            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Sore, great Perſecutions, hath he oft raiſed againſt them from the firſt dayes of the Goſpel, till now. And though he hath often ſeen the Vanity of his attempts that way to root them out, yet he is unwearied therein.

Theſe things are known to all, who have thought it their concern in the leaſt to turn aſide to conſider of them. The boody cruelties of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Party,</hi> againſt the <hi>Bohemians</hi>; in <hi>Holland</hi> alſo; the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris, Ireland,</hi> the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> &amp;c. wherein many thouſands of the Lord's Innocent Ones have been barbarouſly murder'd, for no other reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the World, but becauſe they laboured according to their Light, to maintain, and be found in the Doctrine, and Worſhip of Chriſt, is yet recent in the memory of moſt. What heart ſo rocky as to read the Hiſtories of the deep ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe worthy witneſſes of our Lord the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> without pouring forth floods of tears? What treacheries, clandeſtine Plots, breach of Covenants, Oaths, have the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians</hi> been found guilty of (purſuant to that bloody principle, <hi>Nulla fides</hi>—<hi>No Faith is to be kept with Haereticks</hi>; and all are ſuch in their account, that embrace not their hereſie, abomnable Idolatries) that they might obtain their end, to waſte, deſtroy, root out the Heritage of God.

            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:47212:7"/>2. Schiſme amongſt the Churches of Chriſt. This was early ſet on foot, even in the Apoſtles dayes, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. &amp; 11.18. <hi>When ye come together in the Church, I hear that there be diviſions</hi> (Schiſms) <hi>among you, and I partly believe it:</hi>) and hath been more, or leſs, with cunning, heat, violence, managed ever ſince by Satan, to the diſturbing, breaking, crumbling into nothing ſome Churches of Chriſt. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent charging and recharging of Schiſm upon each other, by thoſe that truely fear the Lord, and agree in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtianity, hath been no ſmall machine of the wicked one to weaken, deſtroy them. A work he's ſtill managing, and we are too too little awakened to ſee his deſign, and to ſtudy in the right Spirit to prevent it. 'T would make ones heart to bleed, to ſee, hear, with what keenneſs, acrimony, bitterneſs ſome Proteſtants are acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt others, who are not of the ſame mind in all things, whilſt the Devil in the Papacy ſtands laughing to think, what an eaſie prey hereby he ſhall make of them all. Ah! alas! where is the Chriſtian ſimplicity, amity? How little reſpect have ſome to the great Commandment of Chriſt, to <hi>Love one another,</hi> who yet would be accounted his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? Were it not for a haſty Spirit, bitter envying that is upon ſome, one would think they had no concern for Religion at all; and yet even this diſcovers that they are too little impregnated with the Spirit of the true Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, which engages to love, meekneſs, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, mutual forbearance amongſt Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Falſe Doctrine, Worſhip. This alſo had an early en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance amongſt the Churches. The denial of the Reſurrection of the dead, ſubſtituting in the room thereof, a metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> betimes infected ſome (at leaſt) of the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. Juſtification by the Law, by Works was introduced into many of them; as the Churches at <hi>Rome, Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> againſt whom the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>Paul,</hi> ſmartly diſputes in his Epiſtles directed to them. Into the pure Worſhip of God, the inventions, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men were at laſt ſo introduced, that God could no longer own it as his Worſhip at all. And in reſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:47212:8"/>
both theſe, none ever were ſo degenerate, corrupt as the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of <hi>Rome.</hi> To enumerate particulars were endleſs; what more contrary to Truth, ſound Doctrine, than their aſſertions, that the Original Hebrew, and Greek, of the Old and New-Teſtament is corrupt; That the Scripture is not perſpicuous, cleer: That to one Man (the Pope) the interpretation of Scripture doth belong, who is Infallible; and Judgment, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, all, is to be ſubjected to him: That he is the alone Judge of Controverſies: who hath the Spirit of God, given to him above others for his ſo doing: That the Pope can diſpenſe with the Law of God: That he is Univerſal Head of the Church: That he is not to be queſtioned for his Doctrine, or Actions. (<hi>Si Papa infinitas animas in infernum traheret, tamen nemo debet ei dicere, quid facis? If the Pope ſhould carry an infinite number of Souls headlong to Hell, none ought to ſay to him, what doeſt thou? For the will of the Pope ſtands for reaſon,</hi> Gloſſa). By his own Authority he can make Laws to bind the Conſciences of the faithful: He hath Power, Authority over Princes; can crown, un-crown; ſet up, depoſe as he pleaſes. That the Scriptures are not a ſufficient Canon, or rule of Faith, and Manners; but Traditions written, and un-written, are alſo neceſſary: That Traditions are ſufficient without the Scriptures; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not ſufficient, without Traditions: That Chriſt is mediator only according to his humane Nature: That 'tis unlawful for Prieſts to marry: That there is a certain place in which (as in a priſon) after this life, ſouls are purged, who were not here perfectly purged; that being ſo purg'd, they might enter into Heaven: That Saints are to be Worſhipped: That Images are to be Worſhipped with the ſame Worſhip that is due to thoſe whoſe Images they are (as the Image of God, Chriſt —): yea, ſo that the Worſhip be terminated in the Image: That the Sacraments confer grace <hi>ex opere operato:</hi> That they juſtify, That there are ſeven Sacraments: That the Church hath power to Inſtitute new Ceremonies for ſpiritual ends: That perſons un-Baptiz'd are damn'd; there's no ſalvation without it: That Baptiſm takes away all ſin: That the Bread and Wine is converted into the Body and Blood of CHRIST: That the Prieſt offers up
<pb facs="tcp:47212:8"/>
Chriſt a propitiatory Sacrifice for the quick, and dead, to God the Father: That there are ſins in their own nature Venial: That Concupiſcence in thoſe that are renued, is no ſin: That men may be ſav'd if they will; 'tis in their own power to believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That men are not juſtified by Faith without Works: That inherent Righteouſneſs juſtifies: That none can be certain, in this Life, either of their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtification, Perſeverance to the end, or Eternal Life: That we are juſtified by Works, that we merit Eternal Life by them. And theſe are ſome of thoſe pure ſtreams that too many have a great mind to return to drink of; and would by force, bloody cruelty, compel others to drink, and be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with them.</p>

Falſe-Prophets, Pſeudo-Apoſtles there were even in the Apoſtles dayes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Such are Falſe-Apoſtles Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.5, 11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. and many have riſen up ſince, whereby the Faith of ſome have been perverted, and they have been drawn off from the wayes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Falſe Miracles, Lying Signs and Wonders. Of this we have an account, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>—. Mar. 13.22. 2 Theſ. 2.9. <hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signes, and
<pb facs="tcp:47212:9"/>
lying wonders,</hi> Rev. 13.13, 14. <hi>And he doth great wonders, ſo that he maketh fire to come down from Heaven on the Earth in the ſight of men: and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of thoſe Miracles.</hi> Antichriſts Kingdom hath been full of ſuch lying ſigns, and wonders, whereby the <hi>Faith</hi> of ſome hath been <hi>Shaken,</hi> and they drawn off from the pure Worſhip of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Open, avowed, oppoſitions to <hi>Goſpel-Inſtitutions</hi> of this device of Satan to ruine the Churches of Chriſt, we might give a diſtinct, and large account; ſome there were of old that oppoſed, denied, ſome particular Ordinances; others refuſed communion with the Churches, as no Churches of Chriſt. In the third Century, the <hi>Manichees</hi> denyed baptiſm with Water, <hi>Auguſt.</hi> l. 2. <hi>de mor. Manich.</hi> and l. 6. <hi>Contra Fauſt.</hi> The <hi>Meletians</hi> in the fourth century refuſed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Churches, ſaith <hi>Theodoret.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtine, ad quod vult,</hi> &amp;c. tells us, that they would not ſo much as Pray with the Saints. The <hi>Audaeans,</hi> or <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> (who held that God had a humane form, or ſhape as a man) denied communion with the Churches in the ſame Century, <hi>Epiphan.</hi> in <hi>Anacephal. Auguſt. ad quod vult,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theodoret,</hi> l. 4. c. 10. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> held in the ſame century, that the Church of God was wholly loſt, and to be reſtored by them; amongſt whom in <hi>Africa</hi> 'twas only preſerved, <hi>Auguſt.</hi> l. 2. <hi>Cont. lit. Petil.</hi> c. 15. l. 2. <hi>Cont. Creſ.</hi> c. 37. (for which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miracles, Viſions, Dreams): What open, avowed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions have been (are) in our dayes made to the Churches, Inſtitutions of Chriſt, is known, and ought to be bewayled by us: Theſe things might have been more at large ſpoken to, but I am ſenſible how far I have tranſcended the due bounds of an Epiſtle to ſo ſmall a Treatiſe, and ſhall only add, That,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I plead not for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church of Chriſt. Many ſuch have been diſ-churched, and may be ſo. God may be ſo far provoked againſt <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That</hi> Church, as to Write <hi>Lo-ammi, Lo-ruhamah</hi> upon it; to diſown his relation to it, or its relation to him. Where is the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Pergamos, Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. but only
<pb facs="tcp:47212:9"/>
argue, that God doth, will, continue the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Ordinances,</hi> in ſome particular Church, or Churches in the World, to the next perſonal coming of Chriſt. Much leſs,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do I plead for the corruptions of Churches, which indeed are too many, and great, perhaps amongſt the beſt, pureſt Churches at this day; and in ſome, at that height (as the ſynagogue of <hi>Rome</hi>) that there is no communion to be held with them, without God-provoking iniquity, that will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, bring his Wrath, Vengeance, upon us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That perſons had need take heed how they ſpeak evil of, ſlight, oppoſe, perſecute the Churches of CHRIST, his Worſhip, Inſtitutions, Ordinances. The Judge ſtands before the door, the Lord of the Vineyards is ready to be revealed, and in flaming fire to take Vengeance on them that know him not, and obey not his Goſpel. Nor will it be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent plea at that day, for any to ſay, we accounted them not thy Churches, Ordinances; therefore we ſo managed our ſelves towards them, a deſpiſing, rejecting theſe, is one way of caſting off the Authority of Chriſt, as we afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it highly concerns all that know the Lord, who are either ſeparated from; or, were never adjoyned to any Church of Chriſt; to teſtify their love, and ſubjection to him; by ſubjecting to his Commandements in this matter, leſt not being found where Chriſt expects them, they be blamed, ſhamed, at his day.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the utmoſt care ſhould be taken, induſtry uſed, to keep thoſe Iniquities out of particular Churches, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to ſpew them out of his mouth, as he did <hi>Laodicea</hi> of old. Particularly</p>
            <p n="1">1. Schiſms amongſt themſelves: Which as they are an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Carnality, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. ſo they diſtaſt, greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord. 2. Formality, Lukewarmneſs. 3. Pride, both inwardly, in Heart, Spirit: outwardly, in Apparel, Garb; God reſiſteth the Proud; ſets himſelf in battel-array againſt them. 4. Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry. A wretched ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that hath too much overſpread, prevailed upon the body
<pb facs="tcp:47212:10"/>
of Profeſſors: Such as are Baptized into it, are Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. 5. Sinful complyance with, and Conformity to this World. 6. Careleſneſs as to ſanctifying the Name of God in every part of Worſhip: The nature of this great work is opened in the following Treatiſe; with many other things, of which we muſt not now ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That particular Churches ought, to be much, often conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their ways, get a ſenſe of their miſcarriages upon them, pollutions amongſt them, to remember from whence they are fallen; repent, do their firſt works. And if ever 'twere the duty of the Churches of Chriſt to attend carefully to theſe things, it's much more now. What languiſhing, dying Churches have we? How is Jehovah by word, providential Diſpenſations cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud to them, to be zealous, <hi>Repent, return</hi>? What little attendment to his Voice amongſt many? How doth he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his unwillingneſs to leave them? How doth he ſeem to hover over them? How many ways hath he been alluring, drawing by cords of Love unto himſelf; and if after all, he ſhould pull down theſe Tabernacles, and erect others for himſelf in ſome remote part of the World; leave poor <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſuffer Papal Darkneſs, Superſtition, Idolatry, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Land; muſt we not ſay, he is Holy, we reap the fruit of our own doings: He is faithful to his Word: Churches (Ordinances) He will have in the world to bear his Name, though we are reduced to Rubbiſh, Ruins. I have been, am trembling within my ſelf, leſt he ſhould at laſt be provoked to leave us (at leaſt for a ſeaſon): Wo, wo, wo, unto us if he depart from us. Repent oh <hi>England</hi>; Awake, awake Churches; awake, awake Profeſſors; lay hold on God, renew your Covenant with him, labour to find out every accurſed thing that may be in the midſt of you; caſt it away with loathing, abhorrency; bemoan your ſelves for the ſins, iniquities, are with you; be conſcientious in filling up the relation you ſtand in each to other, as members of the ſame Body: cry to God to fill you with Preſence, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to communicate the ſuitable grace to you, that you may be able to glorify him in the Fires; Oh Watch and Pray,
<pb facs="tcp:47212:10"/>
that you may be accounted worthy to eſcape the things that are to come to paſs, and ſtand before the ſon of man. Oh! Wait, look for his Coming as thoſe that are indeed ready for it. And if you meet with any ſpiritual good, and advantage, by the ſerious peruſal of the enſuing Treatiſe, let God have the Glory, and pray for him, who accounts it his honour, to be,</p>

That 'tis of the Inſtitution of Chriſt, together with the Ordinances thereunto belonging, Proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEfore I come to that which is the main deſign of this Treatiſe; <hi>viz.</hi> A plain Scripture-Demonſtration of the <hi>Continuance of Goſpel-Churches,</hi> to the next Perſonal, Glorious coming, and Kingdom of Chriſt, 'twill not be altogether unprofitable, nor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to take a view of the Churches of God, that have from the beginning been in the World; ſo far at leaſt as any foot-ſteps of them remain in the ſacred Scriptures, the alone unerring guide in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Then, that God made <hi>Adam</hi> upright, in his own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after his own Image, and gave him a Law to walk by, with promiſes of a higher ſtate of Glory, if he continued in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity (figured forth by the Tree of Life in the midſt of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God) and threatning of death in caſe of defection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, is evident, <hi>Gen. 2.16, 17.</hi> That in this ſtate of Innocency, <hi>Adam</hi> offered Sacrifices to God; and that the skins wherewith he was afterward cloathed, were the skins of the ſacrificed Beaſts (as ſome affirm) ſeems to be an un-ſcriptural fooliſh figment. This is certain, that upon mans diſobedience, a New-ſtate of things was introduced.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> He that could converſe with God, as a friend; now flies from him as an enemy, <hi>Gen. 3.8, 9, 10.</hi> Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Can he any longer treat with God upon the terms of the firſt Covenant; nor draw nigh to him (as formerly) immediately by himſelf in his original, created Righteouſneſs. He had quickly (by his diſobedience) forfeited all his primitive Glory, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, with which in the day of his Creation he was inveſted; and brought miſeries, deaths of all kinds, Temporal, Spiritual, Eternal, both upon himſelf, and all his Poſterity that ſprang from
<pb facs="tcp:47212:12"/>
him by a natural generation: So that in him, <hi>All ſinned, and came ſhort of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. <hi>3.23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> As an immediate diſcovery of <hi>Jehovahs</hi> diſpleaſure againſt him for his rebellion, he drives him out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi>; and guards the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> with <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and a <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> that he come not at, or eat of the fruit of it, <hi>Gen. 3.24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> It was therefore neceſſary that another Foundation be laid for fallen-mans drawing nigh to God (from whom he had thus dreadfully Apoſtatized) which being provided in the eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, and agreed upon in a Solemn-Covenant, betwixt the Father and the Son, is immediately (of the inconceivable Grace of <hi>GOD</hi>) revealed to <hi>Adam,</hi> viz. the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> the Lord Jeſus, the only <hi>Way to the Father, Gen. 3.15. Joh. 14.4, 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> That upon this Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt (mankind mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying exceedingly by the Power of that word of God, <hi>Gen. 1.28.</hi>) there was a Church-ſtate erected by the Authority and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God in <hi>Adams</hi> Family, where ſolemn Worſhip was mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; as Praying, Preaching, offering Sacrifices, <hi>Gen. 4.3, 4.</hi> And out of this Church, were open notorious offenders Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. So was <hi>Cain, Gen. 4.12, 14.</hi> By whoſe ejection the Church was kept pure, till about the Age of <hi>Enoſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> Much about that time, degeneracy in Worſhip had ſo far prevailed, that the <hi>Rigteous Seed,</hi> ſaw a neceſſity of ſeparating from the generality of the Worſhippers of that day, and gather themſelves together as a diſtinct People, for the ſolemn carrying on Divine ſervice amongſt themſelves, <hi>Gen. 4.26.</hi> The words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are variouſly rendred. <hi>He began to invocate the Name of Lord,</hi> ſo the <hi>Vulgar Latine,</hi> and <hi>Syriac. He hoped to invocate the Name of the Lord,</hi> ſo the <hi>Seventy. Then</hi> (in his dayes) <hi>the Sons of men cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from calling upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> ſo the <hi>Chaldee. Then the Name of God began to be called upon,</hi> ſo the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, Arabick</hi> Tranſlations renders it. I know there are ſome who will have the words to poynt at a great degeneracy in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a ſad lapſe into Idolatry. But that a defection in Worſhip cannot be intended, is evident; for there had been long before, a great degeneracy, a total Apoſtaſie there-from in the <hi>Cainites</hi>:
<pb facs="tcp:47212:13"/>
but ſomewhat that men began to do, which hitherto had not been attempted, is intimated thereby; which can be nothing elſe, then that Segregation, and aggregation in order to purity of Worſhip before intimated: For men had before, called on the <hi>Name of the Lord</hi>; but there was never tell now, ſo viſible a ſeparation from the reſt of the World, for the ſolemn management of Religious Worſhip amongſt themſelves. And as they began now to call <hi>upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> or to call themſelves <hi>by the Name of the Lord,</hi> as the margin reads, ſo are they upon the account of this act of theirs, Stiled, <hi>The Sons of God,</hi> Gen. <hi>6.2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> About one thouſand Years after (all which time there was in a great meaſure purity preſerved amongſt them) great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion invades the Church. The nature of it together with its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and ſpring, we have an account at large of, <hi>Gen. 6.</hi> And yet even now the Lord leaves not himſelf without a Witneſs.

               <hi>9.</hi> This call of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> was effectual, he obeyes it, ſeparates from the degenerate, Idolatrous World; conſtitutes a New-Church, ſets up the pure Worſhip of God in his Family: Enjoyes more clear, full openings of Divine Myſteries than any before him. God enters into Covenant with him, inſtitutes circumciſion— See <hi>Gen. 12.3, 7, 8. &amp; 13.15, 16. &amp; 15.1, 5, 6. &amp; 17.1, 2, 9. &amp; 22.17, 18.</hi> So that the Church of God in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family growes up in to greater glory, viſibility, than before. Several cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are not long after amongſt them in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their going into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which he reforms, <hi>Gen. 35.1, 2, 3, 4.</hi> They polluted themſelves with Idolatry in the Land of <hi>Aegypt, Joſ. 24.14. Ezek. 23.2, 3.</hi> (brought their <hi>Whordoms</hi> from thence, <hi>ver. 8.</hi> which they practiſed in the <hi>Wilderneſs, Exod. 32.</hi> (and never totally left till they were carried captive
<pb facs="tcp:47212:14"/>
into <hi>Babylon</hi>): Nevertheleſs, the Lord caſts them not off: but oh the wonder of Love! brings them from under their bonds, leads them to Mount-<hi>Sinai</hi>; makes a Covenant with them, gives them good Statutes and Judgments to walk by. And now that Church becomes as a City on a Hill, viſible, conſpicuous unto the Nations round about: is decked, adorned, with viſible excellency, and glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that her renown goes forth through the Nations, <hi>Ezek. 16.14.</hi> But wo, and alas! after all the grace of the Lord ſhewed to her, his wonders wrought for her, ſhe quickly forgets, departs from him. Is more notorious for ſpiritual Whordoms, Wickedneſs, than all the Nations round about her: Yet God gives her not up, woes, allures her to return to him—. But all to no purpoſe, <hi>Iſrael</hi> (or the ten Tribes) is led Captive by <hi>Salmanaſſur: Judah</hi> (or the two Tribes) is not betterd by it; but though now and then under the conduct of ſome good Kings, a reformation is introduced; yet anon all's ſpoyled, marr'd again. <hi>Jehovah</hi> call's to return, but their ear is deaf, their hearts hardned, none obey his voice: He profeſſes for all this, he knows not how to give them up, his bowels turn within him towards them, repentings are enkindled for them. Yet this affects them not, ſo that at laſt he is forced to ſend them into <hi>Babylon</hi>; yet doth not take off his love, care for them there, nor diſregards them as a People unchurcht; looks upon them as his own in Covenant with him, brings them from thence to their own Land again. Then is a new, moſt abſolute reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, by <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah, &amp;c.</hi> The Temple is rebuilt; the men of the great Synagogue inſtituted. A moſt diligent conſideration of the exemplars of the Holy Scriptures is ſet upon. The word of God is ſedulouſly Preached, <hi>Neh. 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</hi> The wicked are excomunicated, <hi>Ezr. 4.2, 3.</hi> From the mixt People, there's a perfect ſeparation, <hi>Ezr.</hi> chapters <hi>9.10. Neh.</hi> ch. ult. So that the Church ſeems to be again comely, through the comelineſs that God put upon her: But long abides not firm with him, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes his Worſhip, with the inventions, traditions of men; departs from the Doctrine he had delivered to her; particularly, the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the free Juſtification of a ſinner before God; in oppoſition to which, they introduce juſtification by the works of the Law. In a word, they become as filthy, and abominable every way, as a people can well be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nevertheleſs, God bears with them, their
<pb facs="tcp:47212:14"/>
Church-ſtate is not diſſolved, they have their Temple, Ordinances, and even the moſt holy amongſt them attend there, as <hi>Zachary, Elizabeth, Simeon.</hi> The Lord ſends a Prophet to them, <hi>John</hi> (<hi>Elias</hi> in ſpirit) to reform, bring them back from their Apoſtaſie. At laſt he ſends his Son to reclaim them; <hi>Who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would have gathered them as a Chicken under his wings, but they would not.</hi> Him they refuſed, thruſt away, by wicked hands, took, condemned, crucified, ſlew him; and now the meaſure of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers iniquity being filled up, and the time appointed by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to take down that Tabernacle, being fully come, and to ſet up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the room of it by the Meſſiah, <hi>CHRIST,</hi> he puts a full period to it, apotomizes, cuts them off, perfectly unchurches them, and (at laſt) layes waſte, deſtroyes their City, Temple, with an utter Deſtruction. Now was the total ruin of that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatick Judaick Church. And to purpoſe, in capital letters, is <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> and <hi>Loruhamah</hi> written upon them, <hi>viz. Ye are not my People, I have no mercy for you</hi>; and not ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at any time as now. 'Twere eaſie to make many remarks to the advantage of the preſent truth we are riſen up in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of, from the foregoing diſcourſe. The prudent Reader, can do it himſelf. To whom we leave it. The whole Church-politie of the Jews, being vertually diſſolved at the death of Chriſt, a New-Church-ſtate is introduced by him: New Churches formed according to his rule, model, new-inſtitutions appointed by him, which 'tis the duty of thoſe Churches to conform to.</p>
            <p>Two things muſt here briefly be enquired into.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> What a <hi>Goſpel-Church,</hi> or an <hi>Inſtituted-Church</hi> of Chriſt is.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That ſuch a Church is of the Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As touching the firſt, A <hi>Coſpel-Church</hi> is a Society of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> once dead in treſpaſſes, and ſins; but now quickned by the Spirit, ſanctified, juſtified, by the Free-Grace of God in Chriſt; illuminated by the ſame Spirit in the knowledge of his Will, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the World, and voluntarily joyned together for the exerciſe of the Communion of Saints in the due obſervation of all the Inſtitutions, Ordinances of Chriſt. This deſcription of a <hi>Goſpel-Church</hi> is proved in every part of it, from the enſuing Scriptures, Eph. <hi>2.1. And you hath he quickned who were dead in
<pb facs="tcp:47212:15"/>
treſpaſſes, and ſins,</hi> ver. <hi>5. When we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>6.11. Ye are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſanctified, juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>1.2. Unto the Church of God which is at</hi> Corinth, <hi>to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints. 2</hi> Cor. <hi>6.16, 17. What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For ye are the Temple of the living God—Wherefore come out from amongſt them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> Heb. <hi>3.1. Holy Brethren, partakers of the Heavenly calling.</hi> Jam. <hi>1.18. Of his own will begat he us by the word of Truth.</hi> Rev. <hi>1.20. The ſeven (Golden)
Candleſticks which thou ſaweſt are ſeven Churches, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>2.5.</hi> Eph. <hi>2.21, 22, 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As touching the ſecond, that ſuch a Church was inſtituted by Chriſt, is evident,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> From Chriſts appointment, and approbation of ſuch a Church, <hi>Mat. 18.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Chriſt charges his Apoſtles, <hi>Mat. 28.</hi> to teach thoſe, who ſhould be converted by their Miniſtry, to obſerve whatever he commanded them. In purſuance of which charge, we finde, that as ſoon as any were converted to the Faith, by the direction of the Apoſtles, they were gathered into Church-Societies, <hi>Acts 2.41, 42, 47. 8.1. 11.26. 14.23, 27.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Theſe are called the Churches of God, of Chriſt. <hi>Act. 20.28. 1 Cor. 1.2. &amp; 10.32. 11.22. &amp; 15.9. 2 Cor. 1.1. Gal. 1.13. 1 Tim. 3.5. Rom. 16.16.</hi> becauſe of their inſtitution, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> The Apoſtles, in the Name, Authority of Chriſt, direct their Epiſtles to them as ſuch. <hi>1 Cor. 1.1. 2 Cor. 1.1. Gal. 1.2.</hi> Phil. <hi>1.1. Col. 1.2. &amp; 4.16. 1 Theſ. 1.1. 2 Theſ. 1.1. Eph. 1.1.</hi> compared with <hi>Acts 20.17. 1</hi> Pet. <hi>5.2.</hi> or unto particular perſons, giving directions touching their carriage, deportment, and duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. <hi>1 Tim. 3.15. Tit. 1.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Chriſt calls them his Churches, <hi>Rev. 1.20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> Own's himſelf to be their Head, Husband, Lord, King; they his Body, Bride, Houſe, Family — of which afterwards.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> A great part of the Apoſtolick-writings conſiſts in giving Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<pb facs="tcp:47212:15"/>
Exhortations, Counſels to guide, lead them in their duties to each other, in ſuch a relation; and for their preſervation in Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Order. Of which we ſhall have occaſion particularly to make mention in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8.</hi> His ſpecial care of them.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9.</hi> The particular notice he takes of them, in the book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> ſending particular Epiſtles to them; Exhorting, reproving, counſelling, incouraging them; taking no notice of any that did not appertain to them, <hi>Rev.</hi> chapters <hi>2. and 3.</hi> with much more that might be ſaid, doth abundantly demonſtrate that the Church deſcribed, was of the inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That the Ordinances practiſed in and amongſt thoſe Churches; ſuch as Preaching the Word, Prayer, Baptiſm, breaking Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were of the Appointment of Chriſt, will not be denied, ſe <hi>Act. 2.42. and 6.2. 1 Cor. 14.3. 2 Tim. 4.2. Heb. 13.7. Act. 6.4. and 13.2, 3. 1 Tim. 2.1. Mat. 28.19. and 26.26, 27. 1 Cor. 11.23.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Of its Glory, and Excellency. Perſons, and things ſaid to be of God, are therefore ſo ſaid to be. As men of God, <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.6, 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.27. and 9.6. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.14. Hill of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5, 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.3. and 42.6. and 68.15.

                  <p n="2">2. Of its Extract, and Original. There's nothing of man in it, 'tis all of God: given by the Father to Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the World to reveal, and diſcover his Will touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of Believers open, viſible ſubjection to, owning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of God in their Obedience thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of Gods care of it, protection over it, engagement to continue, ſupport, maintain, uphold it to the end. Whence it evidently follows,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there muſt be a continuance of this miniſtration of the Goſpel, the Goſpel-Church-State, with all the Laws, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Ordinances, Orders, thereto appertaining, till it be ſuſpended, abrogated by <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Who hath Power, Authority over his Kingdom? or can preſume to diſannul, ſuſpend any thing he hath therein Inſtituted; but by ſuch an Act he advanceth himſelf above God, and ſo proclaims himſelf to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt that was to come? Denyes the Father, and that ſupreme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47212:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
?? Authority, from whence the original of the Goſpel-miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth flow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The veracity, faithfulneſs, wiſdom, power of God, are all engaged for the ſupport, and upholdment of this Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis of him, from him: He's oblig'd upon that foot of account, to exert, and put forth the perfections of his Nature for the upholdment of it. What Devils, beaſts of Prey, yea, what inward luſts, or corruptions in the Saints themſelves, ſhall be able to evert, bring to nought that Kingdom he's obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſupport, and continue?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there muſt be a law produced from this High and Soveraign Lawgiver, for the ſuſpenſion, perioding of this Miniſtration, or it abides in force, and will do ſo, whether we be ſubject to it, or not. Our wills, fancies, humors, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, any pretended Revelation will not juſtify any perſons Non-conformity thereunto. Let any Statute-law, from <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> be produced for it's ſuſpenſion, diſſolution, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is at an end. Where hath God ſaid, My Kingdom ſhall continue only for a hundred, two, three, or a thouſand years, and then period; after which I'll leave my Children to act as they pleaſe, with reſpect to any Laws, or Inſtitutions rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it? If there be <hi>altum ſilentium,</hi> a deep ſilence with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any ſuch Laws, it becomes, and greatly concerns perſons to take heed, that they withdraw not themſelves from, oppoſe not his Soveraignty herein, leſt they be found fighters againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'tis not inconſiderable, that there are but two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Kingdom of God; which, as hath been ſhew'd (as to viſibility) moſt eminently conſiſts in Goſpel-miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Kingdom of the Devil, and Antichriſt, (who receives his Seat, Power, and great Authority from the Dragon, or Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2.) and to one of theſe we muſt needs be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubject. Two ways Satan takes for the ſupport of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Kingdom;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The one is by eſtabliſhing Laws forreign, yea, contrary to the Laws of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and compelling all to ſubject to them. The other is,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47212:18"/>2. By caſting a ſlight, contempt, upon the Laws of Divine appointment: and whether the one way, or the other, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon poor ſouls, he hath his end; for <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority is thereby trampled upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> If it be Objected, that the legal Miniſtration is call'd, <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi>; and Chriſt tells the <hi>Jews</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that it ſhall be taken from them (and we know that an actual Period is put thereunto) <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. ſo that the Church-ſtate being call'd <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> is no Argument to prove its continuance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The Anſwer is eaſie, 1. It's granted, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic Miniſtration is ſo call'd, and that becauſe it had it's Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from God, who deſcending upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> by the Miniſtry of Angels, gave forth the Law, with the Statutes, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Ordinances. 2. It's alſo granted, that the Whole of that Miniſtration hath expired for above this One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Six Hundred Years. But 3. There were frequent intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Scripture, that it ſhould ſo expire, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.6, 21. (Theſe preſent Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, or Judaic Church-ſtate, with all the Inſtitutions, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereto appertaining will I ſhake, ſo as to remove, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally aboliſh.) <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.2. (The Temple to which the Judaic Solemn-Worſhip was affix'd, ſhall be utterly deſtroyed; ſo the whole of that ſervice thereto appertaining, ceaſe.) Let but one the like inſtance of the purpoſe of God, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the New-Teſtament-Miniſtration before the next glorious perſonal Appearance of Chriſt, be produced, and there's an end of this Controverſy. 4. They were not the Powers of the world, nor the declenſions, apoſtacies of the Subjects of that Miniſtration, that put a Period to it; but the Act of God himſelf, the Soveraign thereof. 5. Whatever the corruptions of the Church-ſtate were (as they were very great) 'tis the commendation of the Lords poor people that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it, as <hi>Zachary, Elizabeth, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe in ſo doing, they teſtify their ſubjection to the Lord, who Inſtituted it. 6. Nor was it actually removed, but by the introduction of a new, more ſpiritual, ſublime Miniſtration, ſet on foot by Jeſus, the Son of God, fore-propheſied of, as the great Prophet of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47212:19"/>
the Church, who was to period that Miniſtration, and ſet up another; to whom we are charged to attend in all things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Goſpel-Churches</hi> (or the Goſpel-Church-State) are ſaid to be a <hi>Houſe built upon a Rock,</hi> Mat. 7.25. and 16.18. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi> 'Tis neceſſary that we En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;</p>
                  <p n="1">I. What we are to underſtand by this Rock.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Papiſts tell us, that by this Rock, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Peter.</hi> The vanity of which pretenſion, is evident: For, 1. 'Tis not (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>This Peter,</hi> but upon <hi>This Rock.</hi> 2. <hi>Peter</hi> no where in any of his Epiſtles aſſerts himſelf to be the Rock upon which the Church is Built, nor do any of the Apoſtles in any of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles ſo affirm of him. He accounts himſelf but as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Co-Elder (with the reſt of the Presbyters, or Elders) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. 3. Chriſt is aſſerted to be the alone Rock, Foundation of his Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. in oppoſition to all others. 4. He himſelf, as well as other Believers, was built upon the Rock, which bare him, and not he it, or the Church. 5. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. that he was not inferior to the very chiefeſt Apoſtles; which had been falſe, if <hi>Peter</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Rock upon which the Church was built. 6. If he were the Rock when he denied Chriſt (as he did dreadfully) and at laſt fell aſleep, What became of the Rock, Foundation of the Church? But this vain pretenſion is hardly worth our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; nor ſhould it be granted, would it at all conduce to the ſupport of the Roman Papal Synagogue, to which good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it's deſign'd. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Rock, we are to underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator of the New-Covenant. He is expreſly ſo call'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. Upon what account, is not to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at preſent to Enquire.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. What we are to underſtand by the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not particular Believers in a ſcattered, diſperſed State.</p>
                  <p>But 2. Saints gather'd together in the order, and fellowſhip of the Goſpel. This is evident, as if written with the beams
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47212:19"/>
of the Sun; for to particular Believers, as ſuch, in their ſcattee red diſperſed State, the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, ths Power of binding and looſing, doth not appertain; But to thi, Church (congregated) it doth, <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. What is ſignified by the gates of Hell; which 'tis ſaid-ſhall not prevail againſt this Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſubtlety, policy of Satan. Over the gates of the City, was wont to be the Council-houſe. Let all the Devils in Hell ſin in Council againſt the Lords Church, they ſhall not be able, by all their cunning, ſubtlety, to prevail againſt it. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attempts of Satan to undermine, deſtroy this Church, have been (are) various. To enumerate particulars, is not our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign: 'Tis enough, that our Lord aſſures us, whatever they are, they ſhall prove ineffectual. Yet perhaps it may not be altogether impertinent to mention ſome few of his ſubtleties, with reſpect to this matter. He hath then attempted to deſtroy it in ſubtlety,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With reſpect to Doctrin; labouring to undermine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the fundamental Doctrines of the Goſpel, thereby ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Faith of ſome. His attempts againſt the Perſon of Chriſt; ſometimes endeavouring to create a miſ-belief, with reſpect to his Eternal Deity (to which <hi>John</hi> oppoſes himſelf in his Goſpel, by impregnable, undeniable Arguments); at other times, to the verity of his Humanity (againſt which the ſame Apoſtle advanceth himſelf in his Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.) his deſigns againſt the Offices of Chriſt were alſo early in the Apoſtle's days, particularly againſt his Prieſtly Office, labouring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a juſtification by the Works of the Law, or, <hi>as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.32. <hi>viz.</hi> partly by Chriſt, and partly by Works, or internal Sanctification. A deſign ſubtilly managed, and carried on by the bloody Jeſuits and others, at this day (as is known); to which the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, and other Worthies ſince, have oppos'd themſelves. But though he hath hereby drawn off (at ſeaſons) not a few, from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; yet there hath all along been a Teſtimony born in the Churches againſt him, which he hath not been able to withſtand, or repel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With reſpect to Worſhip, and that two ways:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47212:20"/>1. By introducing humane Obſervances into the ſervice of God, and Chriſt, ſo polluting, defiling it, that he accounts it not his Worſhip. And hereby for a ſeaſon, he almoſt totally prevailed upon the body of Profeſſors of Chriſtani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that the whole world (as 'twere) <hi>wondred after this Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.3. And the whoriſh Woman, or falſe Church, being her ſelf bewitched with this intoxicating Cup of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſhe held it forth to the Nations (with External pomp and grandeur) to drink of it; and they generally drank of it, and were drunk, and mad with it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2, 3, 4, 5. Yet all along Chriſt had his Remnant, that witnes'd againſt theſe Abominations, (amongſt whom the true Church-State was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and the purity of Ordinances remained) who alſo Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Teſtimony with their Blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By reproaching, reviling, contemning, deſpiſing the pure Inſtitutions of Chriſt, as poor, low, and carnal, pretending to a more ſublime, high, ſpiritual Miniſtration. As ſome even in the Apoſtles days, and ſince. And herein Satan eminently appeared as an Angel of Light, withdrawing perſons from the fellowſhip, wayes of the Goſpel, under the pretence of greater Spirituality, Heavenlineſs, leaving the Word of the Beginning, and preſſing after Perfection. A brave Pretext! wherewith the minds of many have been (are) not a little taken, enſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But neither this way hath he been able to deſtroy the Church, which hath weather'd this point alſo, with, and prevail'd againſt, him: Being from its own experience (as from the Scripture) aſcertain'd, that the more they are in a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Obſervance of the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, the more do they grow up into the Spirit, Life, and Power of divine things. Their ſpiritual progreſs, and growth in Grace, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſingly upon <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Bleſſing; which is promiſed ſolely (and they meet with it) in their conſcientious attendment on him in divine Appointments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The force, power, tyranny, oppreſſive, deſtroying practices of the Wicked One, are alſo intended by theſe Gates. The armoury of the City was over the gates of it. But in this forcible attaque of the Church, he hath alſo fail'd. He did his uttermoſt by bloody cruelty during the firſt Perſecutions. But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47212:20"/>
what was the iſſue? The executioners of his wrath the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Pagan-Emperors, had Torments within them, perpetually gnawing them, whilſt the Holy Ones that kept the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Jeſus were fill'd with Peace and Joy, and triumph'd over them in the Spirit, and Power of Jeſus both living and dying. The vengeance of God eminently wrought on their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Perſecutors, whil'ſt the bleſſing, and good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh, was with theſe; and the more they were Perſecuted, the more they grew: So that it became a Maxim, <hi>Sanguis Martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae</hi>; The Blood of the Martyrs, the ſeed of the Church. And Satan not being able to hold it in the Roman-Pagan-State, enters into the Papal-Antichriſtian-Monarchy, and hath therein hector'd, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, breathing forth nothing but threatnings and ſlaughters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Saints of the Moſt-High, who have the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and Teſtimony of Jeſus. Millions of the Lords poor People have been deſtroyed by this Roman-Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chriſtian-Beaſt in days paſt: &amp; of late not a few; In the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of <hi>Paris, Ireland,</hi> and the Vallies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> &amp;c. Not to mention the Bonfires they made of the bodies of our Brethren, in the bloody <hi>Mary's</hi> days: Which (notwithſtanding their haughty confidence) they'l ſhortly pay dearly for. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord God Almighty will ſpeedily come upon the great Whore, for theſe cruelties; his Wrath will conſume Her utterly. But what's the Iſſue? The number of the Lambs-followers are multiplied; their faith, confidence, and courage heightned. And let the Pope, and that bloody Crew, know, that they are ready to withſtand him in his next attaque, and advance againſt them, being encourag'd thereunto, by that great Cloud of worthy Witneſſes they are encompas'd about with; and that plerophory of aſſurance, that in this laſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he, with his whole Party, will ſtumble, fall, go into Perdition never to appear more.</p>
                  <p>The ſum is, 1. The Church is built upon a Rock; who then is able to evert, overturn it? What winds, blaſts, ſtorms, what ragings of Waves, Seas, can over-whelm, deſtroy it? Satan hath fail'd in all his Attempts hitherto againſt it, and prov'd in-ſucceſsful. 2. Chriſt hath engaged that it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47212:21"/>
un-ſhaken, immovable, notwithſtanding all attaques by fraud, or force. Is he not faithful? Will he not make good his Word? Can he depart from it? Wants he Will, or Power to accompliſh what he hath promiſed? What more derogatory to Chriſt, impious, wicked, can be Aſſerted?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But Churches may Apoſtatize, and ſo diſ-Church themſelves: They may provoke the Lord by his judgments to do ſo. The <hi>firſt,</hi> is notoriouſly Evident in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> manifeſtly true with reſpect to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Both the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>ſecond,</hi> is granted. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The promiſe of Chriſt cannot fail. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The defection of this, or that particular Church, the removing the Candleſtick from it, the taking away its Church-ſtate was never denyed by us. Such a diſpenſation is not in the leaſt contrary to the promiſes of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A total Apoſtaſy of all the Churches of Chriſt in the World, with the ſuſpenſion, ceſſation, of the Ordinances of the Goſpel-thereupon, is what is impleded by us, as diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to this promiſe of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Two things are alſo heedfully to be attended to,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we un-Church not a Church, when that is not to be found upon it; for which the Lord hath declared they are un-Churched; nor before he doth un-Church them. Some Errors in doctrine, formallity, luke-warmneſs, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from firſt-love, doth not un-Church a Church rightly Conſtituted. Theſe things were found in the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. yet at the ſame time true Churches of Chriſt: The latter are own'd, writ to by Chriſt as ſuch, as the former was by the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, when yet theſe evils were found amongſt them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>Rev. ch.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That 'tis the Duty of particular Believers, upon the un-Churching a Church, to joyn themſelves to ſome other Church; or if a number ſufficient of themſelves ſo to do, to form themſelves into a body, or Church of Chriſt; for otherwiſe they diſobey, and offer an open affront to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt in that great Goſpel-appointment of his, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47212:21"/>
ſo indeed lift up themſelves againſt his Kingly Soveraignty over them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Church-ſtate</hi> is repreſented under the Notion of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that Kingdom of Heavens, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47. &amp; 25.1. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven ſhall be likned unto ten Virgins,</hi> &amp;c. And it wants not its weight, that this Kingdom of Heaven, or Goſpel-Church-State (notwithſtanding the declenſion, drowſineſs, ſleepineſs, of the ſubjects of it, or Virgin-profeſſors, viſibly Eſpouſed to Chriſt, in reſpect of their ſubjection to his Inſtitutions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.) is expreſly affirm'd to continue unto the coming of our Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 10. <hi>And at midnight there was a Cry made, Behold the Bridegroom</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>cometh, go ye out to meet Him. Then all thoſe Virgins aroſe, and trimmed their Lamps,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And while they went to buy, the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready, went in with him to the Marriage, and the door was ſhut.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. Why the Goſpel-Church-State is repreſented under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> muſt a little be enquir'd into. 'Tis ſo upon the account,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of its Original from thence. 'Tis not of man, but from Heaven, as was <hi>John's</hi> Doctrin, Baptiſm, Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of its ſupereminent Glory; whatever perſons account of it; 'tis of Heaven, heavenly, beautiful, glorious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of the deſign of God in the Inſtitution, Erection of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to lead Perſons to Heaven, Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of its Stability, Duration. Heavenly things are ſtable, abiding. The Kingdoms of this world are changing, muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the Kingdom of Heaven fixed, permanent.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That none but He who dwells in Heaven, is higher than the Higheſt; who is the alone, Supreme Soveraign of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, hath Power to alter the Frame of it, put a Period to it. The Devil hath no Power, or Authority in it. He's indeed ſtyl'd the <hi>Prince of this World,</hi> Joh. 14.30. <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Eph. 2.2. The whole World is ſaid to be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) He hath a Preſidency, Authority in the Anti-chriſtian Kingdom, is the Head of it, is Worſhipt in it. The Devil gave him (the Beaſt,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47212:22"/>
the Pope) his Power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2, 4. And the Anti-Chriſtians are expreſly ſaid to Worſhip Devils, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. becauſe they Worſhip Idols of Gold, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Worſhip Inſtituted, introduced at firſt by them. But with reſpect to the Kingdom of Heaven, he hath nothing to do, nor can he by any of his Wiles, Strength, cauſe it to paſs away. The ſame may be ſaid, concerning the ſons of men. They may 'tis true advance againſt it; attempt to ſhake, remove it, (as they have done, and do with all their force, and cunning) but 'tis a Kingdom ſo far above them, ſo ſupported, ſtrengthned by the King of Heaven, that they never ſucceed in their Attempts. Vain, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous are their Conſultations, Aggregations, together in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereunto. Can they pull the Stars out of the Firmament? Stop the Sun in its Courſe? Turn it into blackneſs, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Pull it from the place God hath Ordained for it? Are not all Attempts of ſuch a Nature worthy to be ſcorned, derided at, as acts of the greateſt Folly, and deſperate Madneſs? Such are the advances of the Anti-Chriſtians againſt this State, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Whilſt God ſits in the Heavens, he will laugh them to Scorn, and have them in Deriſion. There muſt firſt be a Power, Authority above God's, before this Kingdom can be brought to a Diſſolution by any, ſave he that Erected it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But doth not God ſay, that he will create <hi>new-Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and a new-Earth; and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind, Iſa.</hi> 65.17. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures us 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7, 10, 12, 13. <hi>that the Heavens that now are, are kept in ſtore, reſerv'd unto Fire,</hi> &amp;c. that there is a time <hi>in which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They ſhall be diſſolv'd; that the Saints look for New-Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Dato non Conceſſo,</hi> granting for Diſputation's-ſake, that by Heavens, we are to underſtand a Church-ſtate (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſomewhat elſe is intended in the places under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>viz.</hi> the purifying, delivering the Creation from that vanity, corruption, to which 'twas ſubjected by reaſon of Sin, the Introduction of the Reſtitution of all things by Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21.) yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth not yet appear, nor is it in haſt like to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47212:22"/>
that by the Heavens that are to paſs away, more is to be underſtood, than the removing of the Judaic Church-ſtate; which indeed paſſed away, and was melted down by fervent heat, when the Temple to which 'twas affixt, was conſumed with Fire, not long after <hi>Peter</hi> writ that Epiſtle. The New-Heavens ſpoken of, may perhaps ſignify the Goſpel-Church-State; there's not a tittle ſpoken of their <hi>Paſſing away,</hi> but the contrary, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.22. But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we may give to this Objection (ſuch as it is) the greateſt weight it's capable of, Let it further be granted, that by the Heavens in <hi>Peter,</hi> which ſhall <hi>Paſs away,</hi> is to be underſtood the Goſpel-Church-State; and that <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak of a New-Church-State which ſhall ſucceed that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The firſt Heavens <hi>Paſs not away</hi> till the conſuming Fire is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; nor is it in the Power of man to ſet Fire to them, to cauſe them to ceaſe to be; as the Creation of the New-Heavens is the peculiar Act of God; ſo is the diſſolution of the Old.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. <hi>This Church-State</hi> is repreſented under the Notion of <hi>A Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken, moved,</hi> Heb. 12.27, 28. <hi>Wherefore, we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may ſerve God acceptably with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and godly fear.</hi> A few things muſt be inquired into, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p n="1">I. What we are to underſtand by this Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Goſpel-Church-State we are diſcourſing of. This is Evident, for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis a Kingdom introduced immediately upon the ſhaking of the Heaven, ſo as to remove the things ſhaken, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the putting a period to the Judaic-Church-State, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of all the carnal Ordinances thereunto appertaining.

But then was the ſolemn, viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or creation of their Heaven, or Church-State, which now is ſhaken by the death of Chriſt; ſo that 'tis virtually remov'd, and Saints are no longer to be ſubject to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a Kingdom introduced by Chriſt's ſpeaking from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>v.</hi> 25. or of his eſtabliſhment as coming from the boſom

                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis a Kingdom which they, the <hi>Jews</hi> (believers at leaſt amongſt them) were <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis a Kingdom with reſpect to which they are ſaid to <hi>ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear,</hi> v. 28. Gr. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>—which though in the general it denotes to ſerve in any kind of work or ſervice; yet its ſpecial ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as uſed by the <hi>Seventy</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the New, is, to worſhip God in wayes of his own inſtitution, and appointment.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In what ſenſe it's affirm'd concerning this Kingdom, and the things appertaining to it, that it cannot be ſhaken, moved? That thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47212:23"/>
bears up againſt winds and tydes. The moſt rough winds, impetuous ſtorms, waves, cannot ſhake, ſink it.</p>
                  <p>The meaning is, the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Miniſtration, the <hi>Judaic</hi> Church-State, was liable to ſhakings; 'twas at laſt ſo to be ſhaken, as to be utterly removed, taken out of the way; but this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the oeconomy of the Goſpel, the Goſpel-Church-State is not ſuch. 'Tis true, it ſhall at laſt period, but not by any ſhakings that ſhall diſſolve it, as the former to make way for a new, and better Miniſtration: It ſhall continue immoveable till it run into, and be ſwallowed up in the Glorious Viſible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſiah, or New-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-State.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Church-State</hi> is called, <hi>the Miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, That Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>That by the Miniſtration of the Spirit, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the whole Goſpel-oeconomy, or Miniſtration, the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Worſhip, Inſtitutions thereof, is evident,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From its Antitheſis unto the Miniſtration of the Letter, or legal <hi>Moſaic</hi> obſervances, call'd the Miniſtration of Death, and Condemnation, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 9. which the Apoſtle tells us was done away; now 'twas that whole Miniſtration, as made up of Inſtitutions, Ordinances peculiar to it, that was done away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Twas ſuch a Miniſtration as the Apoſtles were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> which they Preach'd, declared from Jeſus Chriſt, according to his charge to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. and were miniſtring to him, and the Saints in. 'Twas not the Doctrine of the Goſpel, inward purity, practick Godlineſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they declared as the mind of Chriſt; but the Worſhip thereof, inſtitutions of his appointment thereunto appertaining. No ſooner were Perſons converted to the Faith of Chriſt, but they were gathered by the Apoſtles into a Church-ſtate; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42, 46. and 9.31. and 11.22, 26. and 14.23, 27. and 15.41. and 16.5. and 20.28. This is too evident to be denied.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Twas ſuch a Miniſtration, <hi>Wherein as in a Glaſs with open face</hi> (compared to thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vail'd, dark ſights they had in their Paſſover, Sacrifices, &amp;c. under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Miniſtration) <hi>they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47212:24"/>
beheld the Glory of the Lord, and were changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> v. 18. The firſt Primitive believers, 'twill not be denied, attended upon the Lord in Goſpel-Inſtitutions. 'Tis evident they did ſo from the Scriptures but now quoted. In their ſo doing they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the glory of the Lord, had choice diſcoveries, diſplayes of it; grew up into a Conformity unto him in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious waiting on him herein. And whatever any ſay, thouſands of believers at this day, that are found waiting upon the Lord in his own inſtitutions, ſuch as the Church-Fellowſhip, Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> meet with preſence, ſights of Glory, Divine Transformations, renewals in the Spirit of their minds. When any are found in inſtitutions ſhaken in their minds, touching them as the inſtitutions of Chriſt, that by virtue of His Soveraign Authority, Command, they ought to attend to, 'tis no wonder if they ſee not his Glory, know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his transforming power through them. They come not in faith, ſanctify not his name in what they do; therefore meet not with his bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> The Queſtion is upon what accounts this Miniſtration is called, <hi>The Miniſtration of the Spirit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis ſo called with reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To it's Super-eminent, Super-excelling Glory: For Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, Glory, far ſuperiour unto any Miniſtration that went before it. What compare is there, betwixt Spirit, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that which hath life in it, and that which hath none?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the Communication of the Spirit through it, by it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To its being given forth by Chriſt through the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2. The Lord Jeſus being conſtituted by the Father, Mediator of the New-Covenant, Prince, Ruler, Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to the Church; was to reveal the whole of his mind, and Will, to them as ſuch: For his inablement whereunto the Father pours out of the Spirit without meaſure upon him; through this Spirit he gave Commandments to his Apoſtles relating to Goſpel-Worſhip, with a charge to them to Communicate them to others. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ult. Which alſo they did.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47212:24"/>4. To that Glorious effuſion of the Spirit in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt, Act.</hi> 2. at the beginning, or firſt Publick ſetting up of this Miniſtration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To evince that 'tis the higheſt, laſt Miniſtration of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, or viſible Ordinances, that Saints are to expect: that when its taken down, there ſhall be no more (nor indeed will there be need of any;) what Miniſtration can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be higher than the Miniſtration of the Spirit? What can ſuperſede it? Yea, the Apoſtle fairly intimates that it ſhall ſo remain, not to paſs away as the Miniſtration of the ter, or Law that went before it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. which was to be done away. For if that which is done away was Glorious, much more that which <hi>Remaineth</hi> is Glorious. And 'tis not to be paſſed by in ſilence, that the Apoſtle makes part of the excelling Glory (above that of the Law) of the Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to conſiſt in the duration of it. If that which is done away, was glorious; much more that which remaineth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that fixed, abiding, unalterable Miniſtration.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The managery of all the Worſhip, Ordinances, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this Miniſtration, is to be in the Spirit. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom all that's done, is not, will never be acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The means of its ſupport, upholdment, continuance, progreſs, is the ſame Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Weapons of our warfare are not Carnal, but Mighty through God</hi>—. Antichriſt hath other wayes to ſupport, promote his filthy Worſhip, ſenſeleſs traditions, ridiculous fopperies, <hi>viz.</hi> the arm of fleſh, Horrid, Bloody Plots, Conſpiracies, to maſſacre, deſtroy, cut off, ſuch as ſtand in the way of his devices: Priſons, Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, Stakes, Flames to conſume, devour ſuch as refuſe to drink of the Cup of his Fornications; but, <hi>Lex nova non ſe vindicat ultore gladio,</hi> the Law of Chriſt knows no ſuch wayes, methods for its ſupport, increaſe. 'Tis the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Power of God by which it is (ever was) maintained: a neglect of whom; and turning aſide to the Power, Wiſdom of Man, warring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, was the bane of Chriſtianity, and the firſt ſpring off the Antichriſtian apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p>Three things neceſſarily follow from hence.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47212:25"/>1. That a ſlighting, undervaluing, withdrawing from Goſpel-Inſtitutions, is a ſlighting of the moſt glorious Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ever was ſet on foot in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a contempt, undervaluing of the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord; whoſe they are, and from whom they did proceed. Let perſons pretenſions be what they will, it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Goſpel-Inſtitutions are of, through the <hi>Spirit</hi>; to ſlight, theſe is to caſt contempt upon him from whom they are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Spirit</hi> is obliged to ſupport, maintain them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all oppoſitions. He remains with his People for ever for that end, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he ſhall guide you into all Truth.</hi> v. 14. <hi>He ſhall Glorify me, for he ſhall receive of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi> And he hath actually done ſo hitherto, keeping alive a bleſſed witneſs, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to them, for them, in his called, choſen witneſſes more or leſs, in every day. Though ſometimes this their teſtimony hath coſt them dear; <hi>viz.</hi> loſs of Goods, Enjoyments, Friends, Liberty, Life it ſelf; yet they have Gloryed, Triumph'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all through this <hi>Spirit</hi> of Glory, and of God that reſted upon them, and enabled them in this work. The very truth is, as the great controverſie of Chriſt, with the Nations of the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> World, hath been upon the account of their Spiritual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, or falſe worſhip; ſo the great controverſy of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt againſt the Lord's Children, hath been, is, and will be, till he be deſtroy'd upon the account of their abiding by the inſtitutions of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17, <hi>The Dragon</hi> (or Devil) <hi>was wroth with the Woman,</hi> (the Church) <hi>and went to make War with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the Commandments of God.</hi>—Commandments! What Commandments? Such as relate to what is obvious to the eye of the Devils Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz.</hi> Goſpel-Inſtitutions (of which afterwards.)</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Goſpel-Churches</hi> are ſaid to be the <hi>Body of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>But as we have many members in one body, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have not the ſame Office: So we being many are one body in Chriſt, and every one members of another.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt,</hi> (Chriſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47212:25"/>
the head, and Saints the members make but one Chriſt Myſtick.) v. 27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in Particular.</hi> Eph. 4.15, 16. <hi>The Head Chriſt from whom the whole body fitly joyn'd together,—maketh increaſe of the body unto the edifying of it ſelf in Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which places the Church is called a Body, <hi>the Body of Chriſt.</hi> Two things are briefly to be enquired into;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What we are to underſtand by the Church?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Upon what account it's called the <hi>Body of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. As touching the firſt, I ſhall not run over the various accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word Church in the Scripture, (I have done it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.) That in every one of the places inſtanc'd, in a particular inſtituted Church of Chriſt, is intended, is evident. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi> directs his Epiſtles to them as ſuch. Thoſe whom he ſtiles the Church in the beginning of his Epiſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. or beloved of God, <hi>call'd to be Saints, Rom.</hi> 1.7. (<hi>i. e.</hi> the particular <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 16.1, 21.) <hi>Or the Saints which are at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>the Faithful in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 1.1. (<hi>i. e.</hi> that particular Church there, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.) He afterwards calls the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> in the places fore-quoted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such a Church is intended, amongſt which a Schiſm may be, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. but Schiſm is entirely in one Church, among the members of one particular Society.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis ſuch a Church as hath Officers ſet, and placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8, 9, 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22. Theſe are placed of God in particular Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to them as ſuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. and 15.2, 4, 6, 22, 23. and 16.4. and 20.17. and 21.18. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Upon what account this Church is called the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> muſt nextly be conſidered. 'Tis ſo called, becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the forming, faſhioning of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Particular Churches (whatever is pretended) may not be modified, formed, faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned according to the wills, humors, or luſts of men; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Type, or Pattern of them given forth by Jeſus. <hi>He ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, Zach.</hi> 6.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of their Union, with relation to the Lord Jeſus. The Union betwixt Head and Body, is a real, near Union; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated, but by the Deſtruction of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47212:26"/>3. Of Chriſt's Love to, care of, defence over it. The Head is careful of the Body—Nor can it be ſuppoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the higheſt advance againſt the Faithfulneſs, Wiſdom, Love of the Lord Jeſus, that he ſhould not be ſo to his Church.</p>
                  <p>Three things neceſſarily follow from hence;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt is obliged to preſerve his Goſpel-Church-ſtate, in ſome particular Churches who may glorifie him, in their profeſſed ſubjection thereto. They are his Body: now every one will nouriſh, cheriſh, his own Body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That therefore this Church-ſtate, in ſome particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is preſerved by Jeſus Chriſt. If it be not, he's unfaithful, fills not up that relation he ſtands in to his Body, the Church. Beſides, if he preſerve it not, 'tis either for want of Love, or Power ſo to do. The firſt cannot be aſſerted; for no man yet hated his own fleſh, but loves, nouriſheth, cheriſhes it; nor the ſecond; for all power in Heaven and Earth is given to Him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Church-ſtate be not continued; then Chriſt hath now no body, is a head without a body. For they are <hi>Saints,</hi> as walking in ſuch a ſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Order and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Goſpel, that are ſo called, as I have proved.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Goſpel-Churches</hi> are ſtiled <hi>The Temple, Tabernacle, Houſe, Building of the Lord.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. <hi>Know ye not, that ye are the Temple of the Living God.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>Ye are the Temple of the Living God.</hi> Rev. 13.6. <hi>And he opened his mouth in Blaſphemies againſt God, to Blaſpheme his Name, and his Tabernacle.</hi> Prov. 9.1. <hi>Wiſdom hath builded her Houſe. (i. e.</hi> Chriſt hath done ſo, Builded, Planted, his Churches) <hi>She hath hewen out her ſeven Pillars.</hi> Chriſt's Houſe (or Churches) is ſaid to be built upon ſeven Pillars, to point out its ſure, and ſtable Foundation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whoſe Houſe are we.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. <hi>Ye are God's Building.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. <hi>Ye alſo as lively Stones are built up a Spiritual Houſe.</hi> Saints are the Houſe, building of Chriſt ſaith a reverend, and learned Author, upon a treble account;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of their peuſons. In them he dwells really by his <hi>Spirit, Eph.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. and 6.19. <hi>John</hi> 14.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of their being compact together in Church-Order, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſtitution, whereby they are built up, cemented,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47212:26"/>
united, and become an Houſe, like the Tabernacle, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of their Joynt-Worſhip performed in that order; wherein, and whereby he alſo dwells among them, or is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them unto the Conſummation of all things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.</p>

                     <hi>Saints</hi> Congregated together in the Fellowſhip of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are his <hi>Temple, Tabernacle, Houſe, Building,</hi> (in a ſcattered divided ſtate, they cannot ſtrictly be ſo call'd) and ſo deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in Scripture, with reſpect to the Tabernacle; Temple of Old, that were the Lords Building, <hi>viz.</hi> Built by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, expreſs direction in every part of them. Theſe were Types of Goſpel-Churches.</p>
                  <p>Now inſomuch as the Temple of Old was the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable type hereof; Let's a little conſider upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Goſpel-Churches are ſo call'd, with reſpect to the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>They are ſo upon various accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Temple of Old was built of precious, hewen-ſtone, ready prepared for the building, 1 <hi>King</hi> 5.17, 18. and 6.7. Goſpel-Churches are made up of Living-ſtones, formed, prepared, as fit materials for this Royal Building, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> an Eminent Type of Chriſt. Theſe by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.12. (of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That was renowned for its Magnificence, Excellency, and Glory: Theſe however debaſed, reproached, by one, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall be ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That had in it, the Ark, the Mercy-Seat—all Types of Chriſt, and the ſpecial preſence of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Theſe have moſt eminently the preſence of the Lord with them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13, 20. and 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nothing unclean might come into the Temple: nor any impure, unholy perſons, into the Churches of Chriſt. If any ſuch privily creep in, when diſcover'd, they are to be ejected, caſt out.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47212:27"/>6. There was the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>The Daughter of the Voice,</hi> the Anſwer of God; who ſpake unto the people from the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. The ſecret voice, and teachings of God is amongſt theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.16. The Vial-Angels have light into their work in the Temple (or Goſpel-Churches); for out of it they come, when they addreſs themſelves to it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>In the Temple every one ſpake of his Glory, Pſal.</hi> 29.9. in and amongſt theſe is he praiſed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. All the ſolemn Worſhip of God was of old affixt to the Temple: 'Tis now to Goſpel-Churches.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. His ſpecial care, protection, was over his Temple to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, defend it. So 'tis over his Churches, Hence is their continuance, notwithſtanding the furious, various advances of Men and Devils againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. He ſeverely puniſh'd the violaters, deſtroyers of his Temple, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.28. and 51.11. He hath done, will do ſo, with reſpect to ſuch as attempt the ruine, deſtruction of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Five things evidently follow from what we have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing touching this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Goſpel-Churches being God's Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is obliged to ſupport, defend, uphold his own Building, Houſe, Temple.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That if there be no Churches at this day, he hath no Temple, nor ſolemn viſible Worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That none have Power over theſe Churches, to plant, pull down; nor have they, or ſhall they, have permiſſion ſo to ſcatter, deſtroy them; that the Church-ſtate ſhould not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or other, be kept up in the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Goſpel-Churches are Honourable, Glorious. They are God's Temple, Houſe, Building.—</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That thoſe who reproach, revile them; Blaſpheme God, his Temple, Tabernacle, and them; that dwell in Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But though the Tabernacle, Temple, were God's Building; yet both the one, and the other, were taken down, aboliſhed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Neither the one, nor the other, were taken down, but by God's own Authority and Appointment: and that too (at laſt) to make way for a more glorious State.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Worſhippers in that Tabernacle, Temple, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it, till God drove them out of it. They offer'd not violence to it themſeves: attempted not with their own hands, to conſume, deſtroy it. 'Tis true, as to the laſt Temple, <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves ſet fire on't; but theſe were not the Worſhippers in it, but a company of apoſtate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyſt miſcreants, that cared neither for God, Temple, or Worſhip.</p>

                  <p>The Titles, Appellations, given to Jeſus Chriſt, with reſpect to ſuch Churches; each of which is an unſhaken baſis upon which their continuation is founded. We think it neceſſary to premiſe, that 'tis not our intendment to diſcourſe of all the

Theſe Chriſt is ſaid to Build, becauſe he gave forth Directions, Laws, to his Apoſtles for their Erection, Eſtabliſhment. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.3, 4. <hi>Inaſmuch as he who hath builded the Houſe, hath more honour than the Houſe: For every Houſe is builded by ſome Man: But he that built all things, is GOD.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all theſe things, the the Church, Perſons, Ordinances pertaining thereunto.) The deſign of the Apoſtle is to evince Chriſt's preheminence above <hi>Moſes:</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Moſes</hi> was an honourable Perſon; he received teſtimony from God, that he was faithful in his Houſe; but he was but a ſervant in it, a part of it; Chriſt is the Builder of the Houſe, or Church; (For that by Houſe we are to underſtand the Church, or Churches, with all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Worſhip in it, was before proved) Mat. 16.18. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock I will build my Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three things Chriſt did, doth, as the Builder of this Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gives forth the idea, and plat-form of it, in its Laws, Ordinances, and Inſtitutions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Provides materials: by his Spirit in the Miniſtration of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47212:28"/>
the Goſpel, quickning, ſanctifying, making lovely, excellent, glorious, dead, polluted, vile, baſe ſinners.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Cloſely conjoyning, compacting theſe materials, that they may grow up together a ſpiritual Houſe, an habitation of God through the Spirit. To this he uſes not outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, Force, Violence; but ſweetly allures, inclines their hearts by the power of his Spirit, making them willing viſibly to give up themſelves to the Lord, and one another, by the Will of God. And in this work the Lord Jeſus met, meets with the greateſt oppoſition imaginable: All the Power, Wiſdom of Satan, the greateſt, wiſeſt of the World, appearing againſt it: Sin, Corruption, in the hearts of thoſe that are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for materials for it, advancing alſo againſt it: but Chriſt being inveſted with infinite Power, carries the work through the difficulties, and makes the greateſt Mountain become a Plain before him; and having erected, ſet it up, comes and takes up his dwelling, makes his abode in it, as was before proved.</p>
                  <p>Four things neceſſarily follow from hence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is really a Glory in the Churches of Chriſt. 'Tis true, they have been (are, as to outward view) as the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> Poor, Mean, Contemptible; ſo are all the Ordinances, Inſtitutions appertaining to them. The materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of which they are conſtituted for the moſt part, are viſibly baſe and contemptible, the poor of the World—But Chriſt is the builder of them (a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi>) and he builds them for himſelf, an Ivory Palace for the great King: and therefore they muſt needs be amiable, lovely, glorious, comely as the curtaines of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That none can approach, advance themſelves againſt them without pouring out contempt upon, advancing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he is obliged to protect, defend them againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions whatſoever. He hath done, will do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That none hath power to pluck them down; nor can they be diſſolv'd but by his Authority. For any to go about to do ſo, is to aſſume a Power to themſelves co-equal, nay, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to Chriſt who built them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:47212:29"/>II. As Chriſt is call'd the <hi>Builder</hi> of theſe Churches; ſo he is ſaid to be the Foundation of them. They are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as their noble, glorious Foundation, 1 Cor. 3.9, 10, 12. <hi>Ye are Gods Building; according to the Grace of God which is given to me, as a wiſe Maſter-Builder I have laid the Foundation— other Foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.19, 20, 22. 1 Pet. 2.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Three things neceſſarily flow from hence;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Goſpel-Churches</hi> are not built upon the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, (as ſome talk) except we will ſuppoſe Chriſt to be a part of that Covenant: wherein yet there's not the leaſt notice of him to be found.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they are a firm, unſhaken building. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being their Foundation, they muſt be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That none can diſſolve them, put a period to them, but he who is their Subſtratum, Foundation; who as ſuch ſupports, upholds them, and is obliged ſo to do.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. He is alſo ſtyled their <hi>Head, Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 4.15. <hi>May grow up into him in all things who is the Head, even Chriſt; from whom the whole body fitly joyn'd together</hi>—Col. 1.18. <hi>He is the Head of the Body the Church.</hi> &amp; 2.19. <hi>And not holding the Head from which all the Body</hi>—Two things muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Upon what accounts Chriſt is ſaid to be the Head of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What influence this Headſhip of Chriſt hath into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the truth pleaded for. As touching the firſt, 'tis confes'd, that he is not a natural head of the body, the Church. The Expreſſion is Metaphorical. Seven things are pointed forth by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Preference, Dignity, Excellency, above them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His Comlineſs, Beauty. The truth is, all the comlineſs of the Body (the Church) is Chriſt. 'Tis eminently, ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in Him; it flows from him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is the ſeat of all that Life, Spirits, the Church is made partakers of. All's in him in fulneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His Sympathy with them in all their ſorrows, diſtreſſes, ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47212:29"/>5. Their guidance, direction from Him. He is their <hi>dux viae,</hi> glorious conduct, leader in the way they ſhould go.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. His Dominion, Ruledom, Authority over them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Their Protection, Safety in, and under Him.</p>
                  <p>As touching the ſecond particular.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The continuance, abiding of Goſpel-Churches,</hi> is a neceſſary conſequence from hence: For Chriſt being their <hi>Head,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Want's not love, affection to them, to ſupport, uphold them. Nor,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth he want power ſo to do. All power is given to him in Heaven and in Earth. He is for that end conſtituted <hi>Head over all things to the Church.</hi> Eph. 1.21, 22. that he might be able to defend, preſerve it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is an everlaſting Head; therefore as ſuch, muſt have a body to rule, govern, by thoſe Laws, Inſtitutions, he hath given forth, for their Ruledom wherein they are to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their ſubjection to him. Not to do ſo, is to caſt off his Regiment, deny his Soveraignty, Authority. Nay,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As ſuch (being put into Office, deputed, appointed by the Father, as Head, Lord, King over them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6.) he is obliged to protect, defend, preſerve them. For him not to do ſo, were a breach of that truſt, charge repoſed in him, given to him by the Father.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Chriſt is the <hi>Husband, Bridegroom</hi> of theſe Churches, 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>For I have eſpouſed you</hi> (the Church of God, which is at <hi>Corinth,</hi> chap. 1.1.) <hi>to one Husband</hi> (viz. the Lord Jeſus) <hi>that I may preſent you as a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt.</hi> Mat. 25.1, 5, 6. <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (or Goſpel-Church-ſtate) <hi>be likened unto ten Virgins, which—went forth to meet the Bridegroom. While the Bridegroom tarried—Behold the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh.</hi> And theſe Churches are call'd the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> Rev. 19.7.21.9.22.17.</p>
                  <p>Upon what account the Lord Jeſus is ſaid to be the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> of the Church, and She his <hi>Bride,</hi> Wife, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47212:30"/>He is ſo call'd upon the account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of his entire, cordial love, and affection to her. He dearly, above all, loves his Churches. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.2. <hi>The Lord loveth the Gates of Sion</hi> (Saints gathered together in Goſpel-Fellowſhip, ſolemnly worſhipping him in a community) <hi>more than all the Dwellings of Jacob.</hi> He therefore calls them his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Dove,</hi> his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled, Cant.</hi> 5.2. expreſſions demonſtrative of his kindneſs to them. They alſo are full of love, endearment to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. The truth whereof they evidence by keeping his Commandments, <hi>John</hi> 14.21, 23, 24. <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe Commandments he by the Spirit gave forth to them, relating to the inſtitutions, worſhip of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His giving himſelf to them, taking them for his own, above all the People in the World. God is ſaid upon this foot of account, to be the <hi>God of Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 5.1. &amp; 32.27. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 8.30. 13.33. &amp;c.

Nor do, or can any be ſaid ſo to own him, but with reſpect to ſuch a ſubjection, 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>They firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</hi> They are Chriſt's, 1 Cor. 3.23. <hi>All are yours, and ye are Chriſts.</hi> Departure from, forſaking his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, is therefore called, adultery, fornication, whoredom, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.26, 29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.21. &amp; 17.2, 4. &amp; 18.3, 9. &amp; 19.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.2. And the falſe Church is call'd, <hi>the Whore, Rev.</hi> 17.1, 15, 16. &amp; 19.2. becauſe hereby they are unfaithful to Chriſt in this marriage-relation, whereinto he hath taken them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His care, watchfull eye over them. He watcheth over them for good: keeps them day, and night; with much more that might be added touching this matter.</p>
                  <p>Now, can it be imagined, that the Lord Jeſus, who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a people unto himſelf in ſuch a relation, loves them with ſuch a dear, intenſe love; gives himſelf to them, is obliged by

Virtue of that relation, that he hath taken them unto himſelf into, to care for, watch over them, ſhould when in ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of ſpirit they are teſtifying their love to him (though with many infirmities, weakneſſes) in ſubjecting to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo holding faſt his name, and bearing a teſtimony to him in the World; I ſay, can it be imagined, that he ſhould at once reject, caſt them off, unchurch them? <hi>credat Apella</hi>! Is this the manner of Husbands (poor mortals, of weak love, finite bowels) to thoſe, whom they take as Brides to themſelves? Hath not this Lord ſaid, that <hi>'Tis not lawful for a man to put away his Wife, but in caſe of Fornication,</hi> Mat. 5.32. and ſhall it be ſuppoſed that he who is infinite in bowels, choiceſt love, will reject his, when they are not to be charged with ſuch wickedneſs. God once took <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a People unto himſelf; and though actually guilty of ſpiritual adultery, worſhipping in a way that never entred into his heart to preſcribe, ſerving Idols, offering their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> perſecuting alſo the Servants of the Lord, that labour'd to recall them to primitive inſtitutions; yet how long did he bear with them? He woe's them after they had committed whoredom with many lovers, to return again to him; with promiſes of pardon, reception, new embraces, as if they had never ſo offended him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 1, 12, 22. &amp; 4.1. And when he hath thoughts of giving them up, with what ſeeming regret is it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. Nor did he totally do ſo, till he had ſent his Son, whom they by wicked hands took, caſt out, ſlew, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45. And are the bowels of the Lord dried up? Hath he forgotten to be gracious? Is not his Covenant-Relation with his People in a Goſpel-Day, as ſtrong, efficacious, as in the times of the Law? Beſides, hath he any where in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures given us the leaſt <hi>Iota,</hi> or ſyllable, upon which we may conclude, That this his relation, with at leaſt ſome particular Churches, ſhould ceaſe, or expire? <hi>En tabulas</hi>! let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Prophecies thereof be conſulted.</p>

But I ſay, let it be granted, as indeed the Lord doth own himſelf to be the <hi>Husband,</hi> to be <hi>Married</hi> to them, though in the place inſtanc'd in, he doth not do ſo: Let a few things further be conſidered, and the impertinency of what is objected, with reſpect to that we are pleading for, will ſoon appear. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He himſelf by ſignal providences breaking to pieces, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying their Church-ſtate, and that Temple to which their ſolemn Worſhip, as a Church was affix'd, apotomized, cut them off: no ſuch act of God with reſpect to his Goſpel-Churches can be inſtanc'd in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He bare long with them, before he caſt them off; and actually continued with them in that relation for about two thouſand years. Nor,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Did he reject them, till they had for many years rejected Him, deſpiſed his Inſtitutions, Ordinances: committed <hi>adultery with many lovers, Jer.</hi> 3.1. In that matter did worſe <hi>than the Nations round about them, Ezek.</hi> 5.6, 7. If this can be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon any of the Churches, let them plead their own cauſe; I'll be no advocate for them; nor is it neceſſary, with reſpect to our preſent controverſy, ſince there are Churches to whom nothing like it can be imputed. Though this I muſt ſay, I know none of the Churches of Chriſt at this day but are pure, and unchargeable as to any ſuch guilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oject.</hi> 2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church, had Chriſt for her <hi>Husband, Bridegroom.</hi> Is it thus with her now?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47212:31"/>
Is not her Church-ſtate perioded? Is ſhe not the apoſtatick Synagogue? No Bride of Chriſt, but the Whore, the Mother of Harlots, and abominations of the Earth!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. God forbid that I ſhould plead for that filthy Strumpet, Synagogue of Satan, the generation of God's curſe, againſt whom he hath indignation for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſo call'd) that now is, is in nothing like the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that then was, as to its Conſtitution, Matter, Form, Worſhip, Ordinances. That was a particular-Church of Chriſt; this (pretends to be) Catholick, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. That was conſtituted according to the Mind of Chriſt; its matter, viſible Saints; its form, their free, ſpontaneous giving up themſelves to the Lord, and to one another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of God: This conſtituted by the cunning, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, lying Miracles of the man of Sin; by the Luſts, Laws, Compulſions of an arm of Fleſh. Its Worſhip, Ordinances had for their <hi>Subſtratum</hi> the Law, Commandment, Authority of Jeſus Chriſt: the Worſhip of <hi>Rome</hi> is bottom'd upon the Authority, Canons, Laws, Traditions of <hi>Popes,</hi> ſinful men, falſe pretences to the perſonal appearance of Chriſt, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. to them; giving them in charge to practiſe this, and that, as his Worſhip, Appointment, not found in the Scriptures, contrary to them. So that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (ſo call'd) that now is, was never a Church of Chriſt, but a Synagogue of Satan, ſet up in oppoſition to his True Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Had it been never ſo much a True Church of Chriſt; it hath actually diſ-church'd it ſelf, by its horrid Idolatry worſe than the Heathen Worſhiping Idols of Gold, Silver, Wood, Stone, with the ſame Worſhip, that is due to them, whom they ſet theſe up to repreſent; ſo as that their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us) is terminated in theſe; which ſcarce ever entred into the heart of an ingenuous Heathen to affirm; upon the account whereof they are call'd Gentiles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.2. Her perſecution alſo, bloody cruelty againſt Chriſt in his members, ſufficiently beſpeaks her to be deſerted, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord, actuated by another Spirit, than the Spirit of the Goſpel, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, meek: ſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47212:32"/>
far from having any reſemblance of the Churches of Chriſt, that it's the very ſhambles of Satan, by whom as his butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bloody inſtruments, they have deſtroyed, poured forth the blood of millions of the meek, innocent Lambs of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let the argument be conſidered; There was a Goſpel-Church of Chriſt at <hi>Rome</hi>; the members of it fell aſleep in Jeſus, having ſerved the Lord in their generation: by the ſubtilty of Satan, and the man of Sin upon that ſpot ſprings up a ſort of Profeſſors, bearing the name of Chriſt, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Church; that (at laſt, at leaſt) have nothing to be found upon them, like unto what they pretend to be; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there's a period put to the Church-ſtate, to all Churches, Chriſt's relation to them as the Builder, Foundation, Head, Husband notwithſtanding. And why ſo I pray? May not there be true Churches of Chriſt, and he ſtand thus related to them, and as their <hi>Builder, &amp;c.</hi> ſupport, uphold, preſerve his Church-ſtate amongſt them; though that, and many other Churches prevaricate, depart from him? That he hath actually done ſo from the time of his firſt planting Churches to this day, we ſhall (if the Lord will) in the enſuing diſcourſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate. In a word, let it be proved againſt the preſent Churches, That they have unchurch'd themſelves by Idolatry, bloody cruelty againſt the Saints—as this pretended Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, or this objection muſt be acknowledged to be of no weight.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up all we have to ſay upon this argument; Chriſt is the Builder, Foundation, Head, Lord, Husband of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, and ſo call'd with reſpect unto a ſpecial relation to them as ſuch, as hath been proved; either then there muſt be ſuch Churches, or this relation is at an end. And thus far touching the ſecond argument.</p>

                  <p>THat the Scripture is our ſole Directory, both with reſpect to Doctrine, and Worſhip: that 'tis the duty of the Saints in every generation to attend to the Laws, Commandments, Rules of our Lord laid down therein; that none have power to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede any Law, Commandment of Chriſt, hath hitherto been generally own'd as a truth amongſt all the reformed Churches. 'Tis true, ſome amongſt the Papal-Synagogue have blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, That the Pope, that man of Sin, and Son of Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath authority to diſpenſe with the commands of Chriſt;

                     </gap>e as yet doctrinally declar'd the lawfulneſs thereof. What is of that nature practically done by any of them, is not to our preſent purpoſe to enquire. This then might (one would think) be taken for granted; whatever Chriſt hath inſtituted, charged, commanded upon his People in the New-Teſtament, is the duty of the Saints in every day to be found in the practice of. Yet inſomuch as the moſt plain, indiſputable principles, commonly received maxims, are by one, or other, in this day queſtioned and oppoſed; it may not perhaps be altogether uſeleſs, briefly to diſcover the baſis upon which this Principle is built.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Then, 'twas long before the exhibition of the Lord Jeſus propheſied, That God the Father would raiſe up a Prophet to his Church like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> to whom it was their duty to attend in all things, ſhould be declared, taught them by him: under the moſt ſevere penalty was this charg'd upon them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18, 19. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their Brethren, like unto thee; and will put my word in his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him. And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever will not hearken unto my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him.</hi> The <hi>Seventy</hi> render it, <hi>I will take vengance on him:</hi> And the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors ſo explain the words, <hi>He that tranſgreſſeth againſt his words is guilty of death by the hand of God,</hi> as it is written, Deut. 18. <hi>I will require it of him</hi>; Maimon. in Jeſud. Hatorath, <hi>C.</hi> 9. §. 2. And the word <hi>require,</hi> often ſignifies to require by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.5. 42.22. the Apoſtle expounds this place of of Chriſt, and this <hi>requiring,</hi> to be deſtroying from amongſt the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22, 23. That this Prophet is Chriſt, he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Nor is this Propheſie interpreted by any of the antient, or modern Rabbies, except ſome very few, but only of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>: Nor can it be interpreted of any other; every particular being exactly fulfill'd in him. A <hi>Prophet.</hi>] Mat. 21.11. <hi>This is Jeſus the Prophet.</hi> From among your <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>] Chriſt was raiſed up from amongſt his Brethren; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47212:33"/>
'tis particularly mention'd out of what <hi>Tribe</hi> amongſt them he was taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.13, 14. viz. <hi>of Judah</hi>; and the Family he was of in that Tribe, namely, that of <hi>David,</hi> is frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Luk. 1.69. <hi>And will put my words in his Mouth</hi>] According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt ſaid to God the Father, Joh. 17.8. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi> He ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him] This Chriſt did, Joh. 12. 49, 50. <hi>I ſpeak not of my ſelf, but the Father which ſent me; he gave me a commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak —whatſoever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak,</hi> Joh. 15.15. <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father have I made known unto you.</hi> Joh. 17.8. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them.</hi> So that evidently Chriſt is the <hi>Prophet</hi> here ſpoken of. Two or three things are worthy our ſpecial remark.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt is a <hi>Prophet,</hi> raiſed up, ſent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the end of God in his Miſſion of Chriſt as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> was to inſtruct the Sons of Men in the whole of his Will, that he thought meet to manifeſt to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Chriſt actually made ſuch a diſcovery of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will. John 1.17, 18. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace, and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt: No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declar'd him.</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2. <hi>God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes, ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That all Perſons whatſoever are obliged, bound under the ſevereſt penalties, to attend to whatever was revealed by this Prophet. This is alſo enforc'd by a voice from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Glory. Mat. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> So then the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament are our Directory; whatever Chriſt hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd therein, all Saints are to have regard to. For what he declared from the Father, is therein contain'd, and no where elſe. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. There's not the leaſt intimation given by God the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47212:34"/>
Father, or this great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church, of any other way, or means of inſtruction in his Worſhip, or Service, but only the Scriptures. 'Tis true, the <hi>Popelings</hi> talk of Traditions, (as did, do, the <hi>Jews</hi> before them) and much of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; many of their orders is bottom'd upon, receives its Original from pretended Viſions, Revelations, the perſonal Appearance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yea, of Chriſt himſelf (as they vainly pretend); and perhaps Satan might appear to them as an Angel of Light, and avouch himſelf to be the Lord Chriſt. As touching the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> 'tis acknowledg'd, that <hi>Hugo,</hi> who joyn'd with <hi>Bruno,</hi> in laying the Foundations of that Order, had a viſion of Gods Building an Houſe, with ſeven Stars conducting them to a place, call'd, <hi>La grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treuſe</hi>; from whence the whole Order hath taken its name. The Order of the <hi>Carmelites</hi> was from a Viſion that <hi>Simon Stock</hi> had, wherein the bleſſed Virgin appear'd with the Habit in her Hand, which ſhe would have them wear; with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that whoever dyed in that Habit, ſhould not periſh by everlaſting Flames. <hi>Innocent</hi> the third hath a Viſion of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and St. <hi>Dominic,</hi> ſupporting the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church; whence the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> and <hi>Dominican</hi> Orders ſprang. As for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> their Grandſire <hi>Ignatius</hi> was full of Viſions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Peter</hi> appear'd to him, ſometimes the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with a great deal of Glory, and her Child in her lap; whereby he was greatly ſtrengthned, and incouraged. But above all, the ſtrangeſt Viſion he had, was a Viſion of the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity</hi> plainly, under a corporeal Repreſentation, which fill'd him ſo full of Joy, that he could not hold weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before all the People; and was ſo ſtrangly enlightned by it, that he began to write a Book of the glory of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Trinity.</hi> In one of his Exſtaſies he continued eight dayes; in which it's probable, ſaith <hi>Orlandinus,</hi> he ſaw the frame and model of the Society of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> Chriſt appeared to him once, and again; ſometimes he was lift up from the ground, the room where he was, being fill'd with a great Light. In a Viſion he ſaw God the Father commending himſelf and his Brethren, to his Son Jeſus bearing his Croſs; whom he very kindly received, and with a ſmile, ſaid to <hi>Ignatius,</hi> I will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47212:34"/>
be favourable to you at <hi>Rome</hi>; which greatly comforted him, and his Companions. And in the iſſue, it fell out accordingly; his order being confirm'd by <hi>P. Paul</hi> the third, his Bull dated <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. 1540.</p>
                  <p>As were their Orders, ſo their Feſtivals were inſtituted upon the bottom of pretended Viſions, and Revelations: The Feſtival of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> was inſtituted by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the fourth, in honour of Tranſubſtantiation, by the Revelation of a famous Virgin call'd <hi>Juliana</hi>; which had many raptures, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick a Spirit, as to diſcern the thoughts, and intentions of her neighbours hearts; ſhe wreſtled with Devils, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Apoſtles, and wrought many Miracles. <hi>Bullar. Rom. Tom.</hi> 1 p. 147. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite was Canonized for a Saint, upon the Authority of a Viſion, and Revelation.</p>
                  <p>The Feaſt of <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, upon a Revelation to the Biſhop of <hi>Siponto,</hi> and a few Drovers upon the Mountain <hi>Garganus.</hi> To which many more might be added. Theſe are the wayes Satan hath uſed to eſtabliſh his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by, and to introduce his falſe, ſuperſtitious, idolatrous Orders, and Worſhip, deſtructive to the bodyes and ſouls of Men. But in Chriſt's Doctrine, Goſpel, there is a deep ſilence touching any ſuch matter. He himſelf, and his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, introduce nothing upon the account of ſuch Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, but appeal to the Scriptures, and prove their Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine from thence. Not the leaſt intimation is there of any way, or means of inſtruction in his Worſhip, but only the Scriptures. If there be, let the place be produced, and we are ſatisfied. If there be not, as moſt certain there is not, to hearken, attend to Viſions, Revelations, is (to ſay no more) unſafe, dangerous. Nor can it be conſiſtent with the Love of the Father to his Church, had he intended any other way of Inſtruction, not to give the leaſt notice of it to them; nor with his Wiſdom, to make that diſcovery of his mind and will in the Scriptures, to give it forth as our Rule, when upon this ſuppoſition 'tis a moſt imperfect one. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. God ſends us to the Scripture for direction in this matter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not according to this word,</hi> (whatever their pretentions

Deut. 4.2. <hi>Ye ſhall not add to the word which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you.</hi> &amp; Chap. 12.32. <hi>What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to do it: thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> Joſh. 1.7. <hi>That thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all the Law, which</hi> Moſes <hi>my Servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand, or to the left.</hi> Prov. 30.5, 6. <hi>Every word of God is pure—Add thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</hi> Rev. 22.18, 19. <hi>For I teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy unto every man that heareth the words of the Propheſie of this Book: If any man ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book: And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the Book of this Propheſie, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and from the things which are written in this Book.</hi> Evidently, God tyes up his people under Law and Goſpel to a ſtrict, and ſole attendment unto what he hath given forth in the Scriptures; And that becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Theſe are ſufficient, able, and perfect (as he affirms of them) to inſtruct and guide us, Pſal. 19.7. <hi>The Law of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah <hi>is perfect</hi>—2 Pet. 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of Propheſie</hi> (more ſure than what? than the voice that came from the excellent Glory, when Chriſt was transfigured upon the Mount) <hi>whereunto we do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the Day-Star ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> The word of Propheſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Scripture is a ſure word, 'tis a light (every way
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47212:35"/>
ſufficient as ſuch, to direct us in the way we ſhould take) and is carefully to be attended to, till the morning of the day of the Son of Man, or the Revelation of Jeſus. 2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17.—<hi>Thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus. All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, thorowly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſum of what we have been Arguing, Proving, is this, That the Holy Scriptures are our Directory with reſpect to Worſhip; all then (and no more) whatſoever Chriſt hath commanded his people therein, Saints are bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and give up to. And if ſo (as is clearly demonſtrated) then Chriſt having given charges therein, touching Saints walking together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Waiting on him in Goſpel-inſtitutions, Praying, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Baptiſm, breaking Bread, is unqueſtionably the duty of Saints in every generation: <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Tis true, theſe things were once of the inſtitution of Chriſt, but they are now ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They are the Scriptures of the Lord (as we have proved) we are ſolely to attend to, both with reſpect to Doctrine, and Worſhip; let but then one ſyllable, tittle, be produced there-from, that demonſtrates the ceſſation of theſe Inſtitutions of Chriſt, and the matter is at an iſſue. The honour of our Lord Jeſus being ſo deeply concerned herein, no ſober Chriſtian (except under a great power of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) will be willing to part with them upon eaſier terms. 'Tis not pretenſions to Viſions, Revelations, Angelick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, that will remove them from their ſtedfaſtneſs to the inſtitutions of Chriſt; thoſe that depart from them upon ſuch pretenſions, will never anſwer it, in the day of Chriſt. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the ſame reaſon, the inſtitutions, Ordinances under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Miniſtration, might long before the fulneſs of time, for their diſſolution, have been exploded; ſo all the Authority of God, with reſpect to Worſhip, been rejected.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47212:36"/>
To the very time of their paſſing away by the exhibition of Jeſus, who was greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> by whom the Law was given, <hi>John</hi> 1.17. greater than Angels, whoſe Miniſtry was made uſe of in its ſolemn Promulgation, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.53. The Lord charges his People to be found in the practice of them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. And thoſe that were ſo (as corrupt as the then Church-ſtate was) were honoured, ſignally bleſſed by the Lord; as <hi>Zachary, Elizabeth, Simeon.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There's not the leaſt mention of the freedom, exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any of the Lords Children from theſe Inſtitutions, till the perſonal Appearance of Chriſt; but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Well then, it ſeems 'twill be granted, that when Chriſt doth perſonally appear on earth, there is to be a ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and period put to this <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> with the Inſtitutions, and Ordinances thereunto appertaining: what if he hath ſo appeared already?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As touching the firſt, we very readily grant it: upon Chriſt's next, viſible, glorious appearance, there will certainly be a diſſolution of this Fabrick. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the queſtion, whatever the pretenſions of any are, or may be, of Chriſts perſonal appearance to them, its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe, and untrue; not to be believed, heeded, or attended to, for theſe Reaſons;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt foretels us, there ſhall be ſuch pretenders, and charges us not to believe them, or go forth after them, Mat. 24.26. <hi>Therefore if they ſhall ſay unto you, Behold he is in the deſert, go not forth: Behold he is in the ſecret chambers, believe it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scripure mentions but one ſecond coming of the Lord Jeſus, Heb. 9.28. <hi>And unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin, unto Salvation.</hi> Upon this pretext, there may be, muſt be, many comings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Heavens muſt receive him till the times of the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things; when (and not before) God the Father will ſend him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.20, 21. Of theſe times there's nothing appears that bears the leaſt reſemblance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt gives his Church no notice of any ſuch thing: which had he deſigned, and for ſuch an end, as is pretended,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47212:36"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> to put a period to the preſent Miniſtration, and to erect a new one, ſend forth new Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he would certainly have done. A total ſilence herein, were there any ſuch thing intended by him, is perfectly inconſiſtent with the Love he bears to his Children.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. 'Tis expreſly ſaid he muſt <hi>ſit at</hi> Jehovah's <hi>right Hand till his Enemies are made his Foot-ſtool,</hi> Pſal. 110.1 which as yet we are ſure they are not.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Work of Interceſſion now in Heaven, where he is conſtantly to attend it; will not admit him to come from thence, tell he bring the New-<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> down with him: For he makes Interceſſion as God-Man, in that Nature, Body, in which he was Crucified; which though a glorious Body, yet is limited, circumſcribed, elſe 'twere not a Body.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Scripture is expreſs, that when he comes from thence, he comes viſibly as he went away, ſo that every eye ſhall ſee him. Mat. 24.27, 30. <hi>For as the lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be—Then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of Man in Heaven, and then ſhall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn: and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with Power, and great Glory.</hi> Act. 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>And when he had ſpoken theſe things while they beheld, he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>was taken up, and a Cloud received him out of their ſight. And while they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtedfaſtly towards Heaven, as he went up, behold, two men ſtood by them, in White Apparel, which alſo ſaid, Ye men of</hi> Galilee, <hi>Why ſtand ye gazing up into Heaven? This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall SO COME, in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into Heaven.</hi> Rev. 1.7. <hi>Behold, he cometh with Clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. When Chriſt comes, Satan ſhall be bound, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1, 2. the dead Saints raiſed, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. Antichriſt perfectly deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. The Kingdoms of this World become his, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt came perſonally on Earth to <hi>Stephen, Paul, John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing more falſe. As to <hi>Stephen,</hi> 'tis expreſly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47212:37"/>
ſaid concerning him, that he ſaw Jeſus in Heaven <hi>ſtanding on the right hand of God,</hi> Act. 7.55. The ſame line of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is to be drawn over that ſight that <hi>Paul</hi> had of him. 'Twas a ſight of him not on Earth, but in Heaven. May be, when he was caught up into Paradice. <hi>John</hi>'s was evidently viſional. For, 1. He expreſly tells us, he was in the Spirit, in a Prophetick exſtaſie, or rapture (<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10.) taken out of himſelf; when objects are not preſented to the outward ſenſes (which are not in an extaſie, capable of ſeeing, or behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them) but to the inward mind. 2. He alſo tells us, that he whom he ſaw, was (only) <hi>like unto the Son of Man,</hi> ver. 13. was not really, ſubſtantially ſo. 3. If it were a real, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance, then the ſeven golden Candleſticks muſt be ſeven real golden Candleſticks; the white Garment down to Chriſt's feet, the golden Girdle, girt about the paps—the ſeven Stars in his right hand; the ſharp two-edged Sword com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his Mouth muſt alſo be real; which is abſurd, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to imagine; 'twere to make Chriſt a monſter. 4. 'Tis expreſly ſaid, that he ſent, and ſignified the Revelation God gave him, by an Angel, Rev. 1.1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (every particular, the whole, of what's contain'd in this Book) <hi>which God gave unto him—he ſent and ſignified it by his Angel unto his Servant</hi> John. Repeated again, Rev. 22.6. <hi>The Lord God of the Holy Prophets, ſent his Angel to ſhew unto his Servants the things which muſt ſhortly be done. John,</hi> 'tis true, miſtakes him for Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. but is quickly rectified, ver. 9. <hi>I am thy Fellow-Servant, and of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings of this Book.</hi>

                  <head>Demonſtration. IV.</head>
                  <p>THroughout the Book of the Revelation, we have a plain, and full account, of a <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> or Saints Worſhipping God in <hi>Goſpel-Churches,</hi> till the Perſonal appearance of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Two things muſt be premiſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is a diſcovery from God the Father to Jeſus Chriſt, of things (eſpecially relating to his Churches) that were ſhortly to come to paſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> the accompliſhment of ſome of the things there prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of, was immediately to take place. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47212:38"/>2. It containes a prophetick diſcovery of the State of the Church, from that time to the perſonal coming of the Lord Jeſus, Rev. 20.1. <hi>And I ſaw an Angel</hi> [<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſay ſome; an Arch-Angel, ſo others; Chriſt, the Angel of the Covenant, ſo rather] <hi>come down from Heaven, having the Key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit.</hi> (Chriſt alone hath ſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.) <hi>chap.</hi> 21.3. <hi>The Tabernacle of God is with men.</hi> And 22.20. <hi>He which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth theſe things ſaith, Surely I come quickly,</hi> Amen; <hi>even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, if we demonſtrate, that the <hi>Continuance of a Church-ſtate,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-Churches,</hi> is propheſied of throughout this Book, the continuation of Goſpel-Churches, with the Worſhip, Ordinances, Inſtitutions peculiar to them, cannot be denied.</p>
                  <p>A late learned Author (and ſome others before him) aſſerts, that by the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.) the State of the Church of Chriſt downwards, to the end of all things, is repreſented. And the truth is, with that ſtrength of Arguments, that I know not how it can be refelled. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> repreſenting the State of the Church of Chriſt to the tenth of <hi>Nero's</hi> raign, <hi>A.D.</hi> 63. <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the State of the Church from 63. tell <hi>A.D.</hi> 324.

Thyatira,</hi> the State of the Church from 1242. till whole Nations fell off from the <hi>Papacy. Sardis,</hi> from the riſe of the Witneſſes to the laſt Vial. <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> from the time of the Laſt Vial, to the fourth Thunder. <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the State of the Church from the fourth and fifth Thunders, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Satan, to the appearing of Chriſt's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the ſixth Thunder. Now, though I have ſeveral reaſons why I cannot comply with this Learned Author, as touching the computation of time; yet his Arguments, to prove the State of the Church, from that time to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fummation of the World, to be repreſented by the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſeem unanſwerable As, 1. The title of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47212:38"/>
the Revelation, ver. 1. <hi>The Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt— to ſhew unto his Servants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs.</hi> The <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches then were; this Book containes a Revelation of things that were to be. 2.. <hi>John's</hi> preſent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting of the Seven Churches upon his calling this a Book of Propheſies, with this Salutation, <hi>Grace be unto you, and Peace from him which is, and which was, and which is to come,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts as much. 3. The deſcription he gives of Chriſt, <hi>which is, and which was, and which is to come,</hi> ver. 4.8, 11. doth intimate that he is treating of what reaches from the beginning of the Church to the lateſt Ages thereof (even to the coming of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.) 4. The preamble into the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> ver. 10. and that of the <hi>ſeven Seales</hi> is ſo like, that it ſeems they are both of like extent and importance. 5. Elſe no Reaſon can be given, 1. Why, after the Spirit had given notice, that this Book is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of things to come, he ſhould preſently ſtart from the title, and intended ſubject, to write Seven Epiſtles that have nothing conſiderable of Propheſie in them; and that he ſhould do this, with as great pomp, and as high a preamble, as when he begins the Propheſie of the <hi>Seals,</hi> and the <hi>open'd Book.</hi> 2. Why the Epiſtles ſhould be writ to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> rather than to the Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Affrick.</hi> 3. Why he gives the precedency to this Church rather than that. 4. Why juſt Seven, neither more, nor leſs. 5. Why theſe ſeven, rather than any others, which might have the very ſame Vertues and Vices. 6. Why Chriſt is deſcribed holding the <hi>Seven Stars in his right hand,</hi> in the Epiſtles to the Churches of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Sardis.</hi> 7. Why the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> of all others, ſhould be commended for their trying falſe Apoſtles. 8. Why 'tis ſaid to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> more than to any other, <hi>Be thou faithful nnto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> 9. Why ſuch an Ataxy in the ranging of the Churches, that the two irreprehenſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> are not joyned together; <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea</hi> againſt whom there is no complaint of eating things offer'd to Idols; and then <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Why Chriſt expreſſeth a greater diſguſt againſt the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> than that of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which is ſaid to be quite dead. 13. Why in every Epiſtle, that phraſe is uſed, <hi>I know thy works</hi>; which is a thing of ſmall importance in the literal ſenſe; but in the prophetical, it ſeems on purpoſe ſo repeated, to intimate an alluſion in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

Why the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> ſhould account her ſelf ſo hugely rich, <hi>increaſed in goods,</hi> and to have no want in any thing. 19. Why that phraſe, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear</hi>—which our Saviour is found ſo often to add at the end of his Parables, ſhould be uſed in every Epiſtle; they being no Parables, but Epiſtles ſent to each of thoſe Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> reſpectively—</p>
                  <p>The ſum is, the ſeven <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches were Types of the State of the Church (or the Churches of Chriſt) from that time to the end of all things. There muſt then all along be Churches to anſwer to theſe Types. Sometimes ('tis true) more Pure, Spiritual, Splendid, Viſible; ſometimes leſs, as the Types of them repreſent; but alwayes ſuch as Chriſt ownes for his Churches, and as ſuch walks in the midſt of them.</p>
                  <p>But further, The State of the Churches as repreſented in the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> may be conſider'd under a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold period of time.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:47212:39"/>I. The time of the <hi>Roman-Pagan</hi> Empire: That then there were true Churches of Chriſt, will not be denied. Againſt them, Satan the great red Dragon, in that <hi>Pagan</hi>-ſtate, ſet himſelf with all the cruelty imaginable, pouring out the blood of Myriads of the Lords faithful Ones. Theſe Churches wreſtle with God night and day, in Faith, Prayer, Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and at laſt the whole State (as a juſt Judgment of God upon them, for their cruelties exerciſed upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) paſſes away, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. Theſe Churches, are the <hi>Woman cloathed with the Sun, having the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a Crown of Twelve Stars,</hi> Rev. 12.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The time of the propheſying of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which Synchronizes with the time of the <hi>Wild-Beaſt,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> That during this time, which is one thouſand two hundred and ſixty Dayes, or fourty-two Months (which according to the <hi>Grecian</hi> account, thirty dayes to a Month is the ſame.) There were <hi>Goſpel-Churches,</hi> is evident. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> themſelves are ſuch; therefore call'd <hi>Two Candleſticks,</hi> Rev. 11.4. <hi>Theſe are the two Olive-Trees, and the two Candleſticks ſtanding before the Lord of the Earth.</hi> Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks! Who, or what are they? The <hi>Palmoni,</hi> wonderful numberer, the interpreter, one of a thouſand, ſhall anſwer for us (and one would think the interpretation he gives, ſhould paſs without queſtion among thoſe who call themſelves by his name) Rev. 1.20. <hi>The ſeven Candleſticks which thou ſaweſt, are ſeven Churches. Object.</hi> But why here but two Candleſticks? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Antichriſtian apoſtacy had now ſo far prevailed, that Chriſt could own but a few as ſtanding in ſuch a relation unto himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. During this period, there is a <hi>Temple of God, an Altar, and ſuch as Worſhip therein</hi>: which can denote nothing leſs than a <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> and Goſpel-Worſhippers therein; in oppoſition to the <hi>Court without,</hi> and <hi>Holy City which is given to the</hi> Gentiles, (or Antichriſtians) <hi>to tread under foot,</hi> Rev. 11.1, 2. And this Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to be <hi>meaſured with a Rod,</hi> ver. 1. 'Twill not be altogether impertinent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; what's held forth by the <hi>Meaſuring of the Temple, &amp;c.</hi> Five things I humbly conceive the Spirit of the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:47212:40"/>1. The Churches of Chriſt that were in a <hi>Witneſs</hi> for him, being reduced to more Purity, and Scripture-ſimplicity than was with them a little before. Through the cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>man of Sin</hi> (though then in a Myſtery) profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had not a little ſwerved from Scripture-rule. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, generality of theſe are ſwallowed up in the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Apoſtacy; a little remnant are awakened to ſtand up, as <hi>Witneſſes</hi> for Chriſt; and they perceiving diſorders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, reduce all to the Scripture-ſtandard; The only way to heal all the differences amongſt Chriſtians, touching Worſhip at this day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The paucity of true, ſincere Worſhippers, ſo few, that they might eaſily be <hi>Meaſured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The difference God makes betwixt Profeſſors; ſome he curiouſly <hi>Meaſures,</hi> others he deals not ſo with, as not worth minding, being <hi>Virgins, Nullius Pretii,</hi> of no reckoning, value.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the building of the Church is Gods work; his meaſuring-line, not Man's muſt be ſtretcht over it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His care to preſerve this remnant in that purity, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Worſhip, that was according to his Will, and they had attain'd to, during the whole time of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Apoſtacy, and Propheſying of the Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. <hi>Meaſuring</hi> in Scripture (ſomtimes at leaſt) denotes the care, concern of <hi>Jehovah</hi> for the thing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. All the time of Antichriſt's rampancy, there are <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> that have Power given them from the Lord (at leaſt till the time of their ſlaughter) to propheſie againſt Antichriſt; <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſtand by the Lord of the whole Earth againſt him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3, 4. <hi>viz.</hi> to take Chriſt's part againſt Antichriſt; maintain, defend the things of Chriſt againſt the incroachments, devices, carnal inventions of Antichriſt. Now this <hi>man of Sin</hi> made not onely advances againſt the Doctrine of the Goſpel, but againſt the oeconomy, order thereof, with reſpect to Worſhip, Chriſt hath his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches with fixed Officers in them (Inſtitutions, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of his own affixed to them) all gather'd by the Power
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47212:40"/>
of the Spirit, and voluntarily giving up themſelves, to the Lord and one another: Paſtors, Teachers, choſen by them from amongſt themſelves, He the Head of them all: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt hath his oecumenical, Univerſal Church, Officers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Ordinances, Forraign, contrary to Chriſt's: He ſets up himſelf as Head of this Antichriſtian-Church; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into it, by force, violence; rules, governs it, by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Laws of his own. If then Chriſt hath his Witneſſes, and their work be to Witneſs for him againſt Antichriſt's innovations; they muſt be found not only pleading againſt theſe, (which would be only a negative teſtimony) but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing for the Order, Inſtitutions of Chriſt; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be in the practice of theſe. For it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that Chriſt's Witneſſes ſhould own that in Principle, and plead for it, which they are themſelves out of the practice of. Nay the truth is, this laſt is that, wherein their witneſs ſignally lyes.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That the Woman's flight <hi>into the Wilderneſs</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rev. 12.6. and the Witneſſes propheſying in Sackcloth, contemporize, is not onely generally granted; but 'tis from hence evident, becauſe the time of the Witneſſes propheſying in Sackcloth, and the Womans continuing in the Wilderneſs, is the ſame. Rev. 11.3. <hi>They ſhall Propheſie a thouſand two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes clothed in ſackcloth.</hi> Rev. 12.6. <hi>And the Woman fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God that they ſhould feed her there one thouſand two hundred and three-ſcore dayes.</hi> That ſhe was in the Wilderneſs in a <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> waiting upon the Lord, in Inſtitutions, Ordinances of his own appointment, is evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. She is therefore call'd <hi>the Woman</hi>; as the falſe Church is call'd <hi>the whoriſh Woman,</hi> becauſe of her Antichriſtian Church-ſtate, Worſhip, Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>They ſhould feed her there. Queſt.</hi> Who ſhall feed her there? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Perſons appointed by the Lord, and choſen by the Church in this her Wilderneſs-ſtate ſhall do it. <hi>Queſt.</hi> How ſhould they feed her? <hi>Anſw.</hi> There's no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary way of feeding pointed at by the Spirit of the Lord; therefore ſhe's to be fed in God's Ordinary way; in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47212:41"/>
her attendment on Inſtitutions of his own appointment for that end.</p>
                  <p>So that evidently there were Churches, Church-Inſtitutions, Worſhip, all the time of the Witneſſes propheſying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> All this may be granted, and yet the <hi>continuance of Goſpel-Churches</hi> not proved; for the Witneſſes began not to Propheſie till a few years ago.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though this Objection be very weak, frivolous, the baſis upon which it is built, generally exploded by all Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chriſtians, and therefore may ſeem not worthy our notice: yet reſolving not willingly to paſs by any thing, that may ſeem to have the leaſt ſhadow of Argument in it, againſt what we are pleading for; and for the ſake of ſome that are (or may be) in danger to be led aſide, by ſuch pretenſions as theſe, we ſhall particularly examine it. Several things are ſuppoſed, as the baſis upon which this Objection is built, that are evidently falſe; which being demonſtrated to be ſo, the Objection will preſently evaporate into ſmoke, and vanity. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> ſpoken of, are two particular Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they are to come in the laſt of the laſt dayes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the time of their Propheſie is but <hi>One thouſand two hundred, and three-ſcore</hi> natural dayes. Now the Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy of all this, will preſently appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As touching the firſt, 'tis true, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and others, tell us, not only that they are two particular Perſons, (whom ſome of late follow) but alſo who they are, viz. <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> (who they ſay ſhall come, and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Antichriſt in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there be put to death by him, <hi>Bellar. de Rom. Pontif.</hi> l. 3. c. 13.): But that they are not, cannot be two particular Perſons, is evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Two Witneſſes</hi> are call'd, <hi>two Candleſticks</hi>; which Chriſt interprets to be Churches (as was ſaid before.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Two Witneſſes Propheſie,</hi> all the <hi>Wild Beaſt's</hi> (Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's) <hi>Reign,</hi> viz. <hi>Fourty-two Months, or One thouſand two hundred ſixty dayes,</hi> viz. prophetick dayes, <hi>i. e.</hi> Years, as ſhall by and by be demonſtrated. 'Tis not to be imagined,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47212:41"/>
that any two particular Perſons ſhould ever live ſo long.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. During the time of their Propheſie, <hi>They torment them that dwell upon the Earth,</hi> Rev. 11.10. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Antichriſtian Kingdom: which 'tis not probable, two particular Perſons (eſpecially conſidering that thoſe which hold this notion, aſſert alſo, that the 1260. dayes, are natural dayes, or three Years and an half) ſhould do in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When <hi>they are ſlain, and lye dead in the ſtreet of the great City three dayes and an half,</hi> (natural dayes as they'l have it) <hi>they of the People, and Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the multitude over which Antichriſt preſides) <hi>ſee their dead bodies, and rejoyce over them</hi>—Which that they ſhould do, if but two particular perſons, and they lye dead for ſo ſhort a time, is the firſt-born of abſurdities. 'Tis impoſſible, within that limit, the perſons mention'd ſhould all hear of it, much more come to ſee it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That the two Witneſſes are to come in the laſt of the laſt dayes, is alſo an unſcriptural-vanity, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The two Witneſſes Propheſying, and the <hi>Gentiles tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under foot the Holy City,</hi> contemporize, Rev. 11.2, 3. <hi>But the Court which is without the Temple leave out, and meaſure it not: for it's given unto the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the holy City ſhall they tread under foot fourty and two Months. And I will give Power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie</hi> 1260 <hi>Dayes cloathed in Sackcloth.</hi> The fourty two Months, according to the <hi>Grecian</hi> account, are exactly 1260. Dayes: ſo long then as the Gentiles tread down <hi>the Holy City,</hi> ſo long are the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to Propheſie.</hi> A few things muſt further be enquir'd into. 1. Who we are to underſtand by the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 2. What by <hi>the Holy City.</hi> 3. What their <hi>treading under foot the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City,</hi> means. 4. What ſpace of time the <hi>fourty-two Months</hi> take up, in which 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Gentiles ſhall tread down the Holy City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we are to underſtand the Antichriſtians; particularly the bloody Papiſts, headed by the Pope [<hi>That</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

call'd <hi>Gentiles,</hi> becauſe, 1. Of their Introduction of Idolatrous Worſhip practiſed amongſt the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> I mean not only the Worſhip of Statues, Idols of Wood, Stone, Braſs, Silver, Gold; but the Worſhip of <hi>Heroes,</hi> (or Saints) in imitation of the <hi>Gentile-Heroes,</hi> whom they Worſhip'd. 2. Of their being actuated by the ſame Spirit of bloody cruelty, againſt the Worſhippers within the Temple and Altar (or the true Spiritual Worſhipers), with which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> before them were actuated againſt the Primitive Believers; and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally murdering the true Servants of the Lord, as they did.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Court without the Temple, and the Holy City</hi> (which Type out the ſame thing) is the Antichriſtian Church-ſtate, Worſhip, Worſhippers, Orders, Ordinances. The Temple of God, the Altar, and the Worſhippers therein, <hi>v.</hi> 1. are the Goſpel-Church-ſtate, with the Worſhip, and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thereunto belonging (as hath been proved.) The Court then <hi>without the Temple,</hi> and <hi>the Holy City,</hi> to be left out (as a matter of no worth) is the falſe Church-ſtate, with its Worſhip and Worſhippers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their <hi>treading under foot the Holy City,</hi> denotes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The numerouſneſs of the Antichriſtian Worſhippers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their frequency in their Antichriſtian Service, as the Phraſe is taken, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.2. q. d. <hi>Meaſure not the Court</hi>—. The falſe Worſhip, Worſhippers, are ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, vile, they deſerve not to be taken notice of: are ſo numerous, that they cannot well be <hi>meaſured</hi>—They throng the City, as if they would <hi>tread it under foot</hi> at once.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourty-two Months</hi> cannot poſſibly denote fourty-two ordinary Months, or <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> natural Dayes, or three years and an half, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Papacy (repreſented under the notion of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>—) have been already rampant hundreds of Years; perſecuted, murder'd, deſtroyed millions of Saints, for not <hi>treading</hi> together with them, <hi>the Holy City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As was ſaid, The <hi>forty-two Months,</hi> and the <hi>One thouſand

                  <p>By what hath hitherto in this matter been offered, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reader will find a plain probation of the main The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, we are now in the confirmation of, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> come before the laſt of the laſt dayes.

That the time of the <hi>Witneſſes Propheſie</hi>; is but for <hi>One thouſand two hundred and ſixty</hi> natural dayes: the contrary hath been, from what hath been ſaid touching the ſecond particular, abundantly evinc'd; to which add, The <hi>Witneſſes are to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie all the time of Antichriſt</hi> (as hath been proved:) The truth is, they are raiſed up, Spirited by the Lord as <hi>witneſſes</hi> to <hi>propheſie</hi> againſt him, and his incroachments upon the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority of Chriſt. Tis true, the Papiſts, that they may clear the Pope of the charge hath been by the Proteſtants laid againſt him as the Antichriſt, aſſert, That Antichriſt is not yet come; that he is not to come till towards the period of time; to continue, when he comes, <hi>but three years, and an half.</hi> Thus <hi>Bellarmin</hi> l.3. <hi>De Pontif.

                  <p>Two things in this matter are eaſily demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Antichriſt is long ſince come.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That the Papal Kingdom is the Antichriſt ſpoken of: which, if plainly from Scripture demonſtrated, it undeniably follows, that the time of the <hi>witneſſes propheſie</hi> cannot be ſhut up within the limits of <hi>one Thouſand two Hundred and Sixty</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural days.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is long ſince come, is evident; for,</p>

                  <p>The third Period of time mentioned in the Revelation is,</p>

                  <p>A few things muſt be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who is meant by the <hi>Dragon.</hi> 2. Who by the <hi>Woman.</hi> 3. Who are the <hi>Remnant of her Seed.</hi> 4. What this <hi>War is.</hi> 5.

But yet the <hi>Devil</hi> as acting not in the <hi>Roman-Pagan-ſtate,</hi> but in the <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>; wherein he moſt evidently diſplayes his enmity, bloody cruelty, ſubtilty, and Power. Now this ſeems to be very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. For this <hi>Dragon</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> and <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> and <hi>Ten Crowns</hi> upon his <hi>Heads.</hi> The <hi>Seven Heads</hi> are interpreted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.9, 10. not only to be <hi>Seven Mountains,</hi> but alſo <hi>Seven Kings,</hi> or ſeven ſorts of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; whereof <hi>five were fallen,</hi> when <hi>John</hi> writ, <hi>viz.</hi> Kings, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemvirs, Dictators; and <hi>one then was,</hi> viz. <hi>Pagan</hi>-Emperours; and the <hi>Seventh</hi> was <hi>not yet come,</hi> viz. Chriſtian Emperours; amongſt whom ſprings <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is ſaid to be the <hi>Eighth</hi> and yet of the <hi>Seventh, ver.</hi> 11. So then during the time of the <hi>Roman-Pagan</hi>-Emperors, the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> had but <hi>Six Heads</hi>; therefore by the <hi>Dragon</hi> we are not to underſtanding the <hi>Devil</hi> as acting in that ſtate, but in the <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> when he had his <hi>Seven Heads</hi> compleat. The <hi>Ten Horns</hi> are alſo interpreted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12. to be <hi>Ten Kings</hi> which had at that time of <hi>Johns</hi> writing, <hi>received no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>: They reſpect a time when the <hi>Roman</hi>-Empire ſhould be divided into <hi>Ten Kingdoms,</hi> which was not while the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was <hi>Pagan,</hi> but under the <hi>Seventh Head,</hi> about the Year <hi>Four Hundred fifty ſix.</hi> To which add that <hi>John</hi> doth painly enough intimate, that theſe <hi>Ten Horns</hi> did not appertain to the <hi>Sixth Head</hi> that then was, or the <hi>Roman-Pagan</hi>-Empire, but to the <hi>Seventh,</hi> which was to come; for though he tells us, they were <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> yet he adds, that they had <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Kingdom at that time</hi>; i. e. they were Kings not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but only in the purpoſe of God, to be produced as ſuch under the <hi>Seventh Head,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi>-Chriſtian-Empire. Beſides, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> and <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> is expreſly ſaid to carry the <hi>Whore,</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian-Church,</hi> Rev. 17.3. From all which its moſt clear, that the <hi>Dragon</hi> with <hi>Seven Heads,</hi> and <hi>Ten Horns,</hi> is to be underſtood the <hi>Devil,</hi> as acting not in the <hi>Roman-Pagan,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtian</hi> (or rather <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>) State.</p>

Now there are ſeveral things that I humbly conceive lye in the way of theſe interpretations.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. This War is not in, but out of the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi>: For into the Wilderneſs the <hi>Dragon</hi> could not, it ſeems, purſue her. Therefore he caſts a <hi>Flood of VVater out of his mouth, to ſwallow her up,</hi> but with little Succeſs, for the Earth helps her, <hi>opens her mouth and ſwallows up the Flood,</hi> Rev. 12.15, 16. Beſides, he would (if he could) have attaqu't the <hi>Mother</hi> in the <hi>VVilderneſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>Children</hi> brought forth by her there; whereas this is a particular <hi>VVar</hi> againſt <hi>the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her ſeed.</hi> Nor,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:47212:47"/>2. Can I ſee, how their Worſhipping ſeverally, and a part, is conſiſtent with the Characters given of <hi>the remnant of the Womans ſeed,</hi> ver. 17. who are expreſly ſaid to <hi>Keep the Commandments of God, and to have the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Nor,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Would <hi>Satan</hi> have lookt upon them in their divided State, to be ſo conſiderable, as to go about to make ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal a <hi>War</hi> againſt them, as is intimated: could he diſunite, break, diſſipate, ſcatter the Diſciples of Chriſt, he would think he had done his work; at leaſt ſo far, that he might pick them up by degrees, as he ſaw meet; and not put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the coſt and trouble [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a <hi>War</hi> againſt them. Little do ſome think, how much they ſerve <hi>Satan,</hi> by driving on a deſign of ſcattering the <hi>Saints,</hi> and calling them off their <hi>Church-Aſſemblies</hi>: A work he hath been attempting by various artifices, and methods, ever ſince Chriſt had his Churches in the World; but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto without ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>This matter then muſt farther be conſidered. By the <hi>ſeed of the Woman</hi> (in the firſt Scripture-Notion of that expreſſion) we are to underſtand the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Here it hath reſpect to the Saints, begotten by the Word, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus: call'd <hi>the ſeed of the Woman,</hi> becauſe born in the midſt of the Churches of Chriſt, before that their <hi>flight into the Wilderneſs,</hi> mention'd, <hi>v.</hi> 14. As alſo becauſe like <hi>her,</hi> of the ſame nature, ſpirit, temper, walking in the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, owning the ſame Principles, Doctrine, practiſing the ſame Worſhip, found in the obſervation of the ſame Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Ordinances, with her. By the <hi>remnant</hi> then of <hi>her ſeed,</hi> we are to underſtand, ſuch as remain behind her, when ſhe <hi>flies into the Wilderneſs,</hi> go not with her thither. The <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> points out a ſtate of ſecrecy, retirement, and ſo ſafety: The <hi>Woman</hi> (i. e. the body of the Churches) <hi>Flies</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs from the face of the Serpent,</hi> Worſhips in holes, corners; whileſt this <hi>remnant</hi> keep on in their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble owning the Wayes, Ordinances, Inſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as formerly. Who (with ſubmiſſion I ſpeak it) I conceive to be moſt ſtrictly the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in their laſt teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47212:47"/>4. As touching the fourth and fifth particular, what this <hi>War</hi> is, and to what period of time it hath relation; It ſeems (at leaſt to me) evident from what hath been already offer'd, that 'tis the laſt advance of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> acting in the Papal-Antichriſtian-Wilde-Beaſt, aſcending out of the bottomleſs Pit (or coming forth in more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry malice, fury) againſt the <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> or ſuch of the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed,</hi> who ſhall at this time moſt ſtrictly have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Propheſie</hi> with them; and ſo bear up for a ſeaſon, in a teſtimony for <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt him; the iſſue whereof, ſhall be their <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> or the driving them off that publick teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they are bearing, into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> whether the <hi>Woman,</hi> or the body of the <hi>Churches</hi> was before <hi>fled.</hi> And this ſeems more than Probable. Becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though here's mention of the <hi>Dragons</hi> going about to make <hi>War</hi> with <hi>the remnant of the Womans ſeed</hi>; yet there's no intimation of the leaſt execution, as to any corporeal <hi>ſlaughter</hi> he makes upon them: but they ſeem rather (with reſpect to that) in as great ſafety as the <hi>Woman</hi> that before was <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs</hi>: In anſwer to which, the <hi>ſlaughter</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is not, cannot be a corporeal <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> as amongſt others is moſt evident from this ſingle conſideration: <hi>viz.</hi> Such as their <hi>ſlaughter</hi> is, ſuch will their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> be; if their <hi>ſlaughter</hi> be corporeal, their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> muſt be ſo: But their <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is not, cannot be a corporeal <hi>Reſurrection</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it croſſes the Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. <hi>Every one in his own order, Chriſt the firſt-fruits, afterwards thoſe that are Chriſt's at his coming:</hi> clearly aſſerting, that the Saints riſe not till the perſonal coming of Chriſt: But now the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> riſe before; as is granted by all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. After this advance of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> you hear no more of this <hi>remnant</hi> of the <hi>Womans ſeed,</hi> till the great Randezvouz upon <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> Rev. 14.1. Where they are the riſen <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> repreſented under the notion of <hi>One Hundred forty and four Thouſand, with their fathers name upon their foreheads</hi>— going forth under the conduct of the Lamb, to execute the <hi>Judgements</hi> written againſt <hi>Antichriſt, ver.</hi> 7.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. to the end. And no wonder, for all this while, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47212:48"/>
from the time of their <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> to the time of their <hi>riſe,</hi> they lie <hi>Dead,</hi> as to any publick viſible witneſs for Chriſt; which formerly they bear, till the Spirit of Life, from God, re-enters into them; and they ſtand upon their feet—.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>remnant</hi> of the <hi>Womans ſeed,</hi> is much about the ſame time with her ſecond <hi>flight into the Wilderneſs,</hi> ver. 14. That that <hi>flight</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> is a ſecond flight, is evident. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. She is repreſented, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 12. as coming out of it with <hi>Tryumph, Shouting,</hi> having greatned confidence, that ſhe ſhould never return thither again; for ſhe ſings, ver. 10. <hi>Now is come Salvation, and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> whether ſhe flies, is call'd <hi>HER PLACE,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>viz.</hi> with reſpect to what's ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her firſt flying thither. <hi>And the Woman fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God.</hi> Into this place, which is now call'd, <hi>her place,</hi> becauſe before prepar'd for her of God, doth ſhe now fly. Now that ſecond <hi>flight</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> is exactly the ſame with the time of the Witneſſes lying dead; <hi>She is nouriſh't for a time, times, and half a time, from the face of the Serpent:</hi> So the Witneſſes lye dead a time [one Year] times [two Years] and half a time [half a Year] viz. <hi>Three Years and a half</hi> which is congruous to the Scripture-Notion of time, or times, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.23, 25.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That in the time of this <hi>War,</hi> there is a <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> is evident. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There's the <hi>Woman,</hi> i. e. the Saints in Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Worſhipping God in the wayes of Chriſts Inſtitution (for upon this account ſhe's call'd <hi>the Woman, Bride of Chriſt,</hi> as hath been proved) <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs,</hi> juſt (as 'twere) upon its commencement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Remnant of the Womans ſeed which keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God,</hi> ver. 17. If by the <hi>Commandments of God,</hi> we underſtand the Commandments of God the Father, or of Jeſus Chriſt, it comes all to one. For one great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Father to the Sons of Men, is to hear Chriſt,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47212:48"/>
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18, 19. And on the Holy Mount, a voice is heard to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. And Chriſt tells us, that thoſe that have <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>learnt</hi> of the Father, <hi>come to him</hi>; viz. to be <hi>inſtucted</hi> by him, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. And he that <hi>hears</hi> him, <hi>i. e.</hi> obey's, ſubjects to him, his in-doctrinations, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hears the Father.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are alſo ſaid to have the Teſtimony of Jeſus. <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Negatively,</hi> they hold not to the Decrees, Canons, Laws, Inſtitutions of Pope, Councils, Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They abhor to comply with any <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Superſtitions, Worſhip, Orders, Ordinances: would they have done ſo, the <hi>Devil</hi> had never gon about to make <hi>War</hi> againſt them. The Spirit teſtifyes of them, that they <hi>were not defiled with Woman,</hi> Rev. 14.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> with none of the Idolatries, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, Fornications of the great <hi>Whore,</hi> or any of her <hi>Daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> they do viſibly own Jeſus Chriſt, in all his Offices, Laws, Inſtitutions; nor will they be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to leave them, or ceaſe to conform to them whatever it coſt them. The Lord teſtifies of them in their riſen-ſtate, that <hi>they are Virgins,</hi> Rev. 14.4. <hi>i. e.</hi> chaſt to Chriſt, faithful to his Inſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>And thus much touching the Third Period of time, in which it's evident, there are Churches of the inſtitution of Chriſt. That there are ſo,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. At the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> riſe, and all along the pouring out of the <hi>Vials,</hi> is very evident by the ſame Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi>: By the way I would modeſtly give my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching Two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That the <hi>riſen-Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Vial-Angels,</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize. This ſeems evident. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The time of the <hi>Witneſſes Propheſying,</hi> is a time of <hi>Mourning</hi> to them, being in their <hi>Sack-cloth-ſtate,</hi> and for the moſt part the time of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> rampancy: but at the time of their riſe, the ſcene begins to alter; and the Vengance of God falls ſo fearfully upon the <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> that the tenth part of the <hi>City falls</hi>; or one of the <hi>Ten Kingdoms</hi> totally
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47212:49"/>
draws off from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and is brought into ſubjection to Chriſt: The time of the beginning of the pouring out of the <hi>Vials,</hi> is a time of <hi>Mourning</hi> to the <hi>Antichriſtians</hi>: for the <hi>Vials</hi> are <hi>Vials</hi> of the <hi>Pure Wrath of God Almighty</hi> pour'd forth in his Authority, and by his Appointment, upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Witneſſes riſe,</hi> the deſtruction of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> or of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> goe's on, till he be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the Kingdoms become the Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.14, 15, 16, 17, 18. The ſame fate befals the <hi>Antichriſtians</hi> under the pouring forth of the <hi>Vials</hi>: their Kingdom is gradually waſted, conſumed, till it ceaſe to be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16 from firſt to laſt. But this is not a place fully to proſecute this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That there are none of the <hi>Vials</hi> yet poured forth: Theſe few things (amongſt others) which muſt not now be mentioned) lead me captive to the belief of this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> I humbly conceive, are not yet <hi>riſen,</hi> 'tis to be feared not yet <hi>ſlain.</hi> Now the <hi>riſen-witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>Vial-Angels</hi> ſynchronizing, they not being <hi>riſen,</hi> theſe have not pour'd forth one <hi>Vial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have not yet ſeen the preparatory work, to the powring forth of the <hi>Vials</hi> mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſubject of the <hi>Vials</hi> are the perſons, or things of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The <hi>Vials</hi> being <hi>Vials</hi> of pure <hi>Wrath</hi>; on what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſons, or things, they fall, they totally conſume them; ſo, as that they ſhall never ſtand up, or exiſt more. What of the <hi>Perſons,</hi> things of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> have been thus removed, deſtroyed; Are they not all in their ſplendour, height, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at this day?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Vial-Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Stone-ſmiting,</hi> Dan. 2. ſynchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize: the effects of the one, and the other, are the ſame; viz. the total deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and introduction, exaltment, of the Kingdom of the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> But the <hi>Stone</hi> hath yet not begun to <hi>ſmite</hi>; for when it begins ſo to do, it ſhall never ceaſe, till the Image be wholly <hi>deſtroyed</hi>; and it (the <hi>Stone</hi>) become a great Mountain filling the whole Earth,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47212:49"/>
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34, 35. Therefore none of the <hi>Vials</hi> are yet pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out. But of this matter we muſt not now ſpeak at large.</p>
                  <p>That there are particular Churches upon the riſe of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the pouring out of the <hi>Vials,</hi> will receive a ſpeedy diſpatch.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> (which we have proved to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Churches</hi>) ſtand upon their <hi>feet</hi>—. Begin openly, with their wonted, and perhaps, greater courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to aſſert, and give <hi>Witneſs</hi> to the Wayes, and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; which all the time of their <hi>Propheſying,</hi> they were publickly, and in the time of their <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> they were privately found in the practice of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now the <hi>Woman</hi> that had <hi>fled into the Wilderness,</hi> and was <hi>nouriſht</hi> there all the time of the <hi>Witneſſes ſlaughter,</hi> comes out from thence, and ſhews her ſelf as the true Loyal Spouſe of Chriſt, in her viſible ſubjection to him; in all his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſtitutions, and Appointments. To which time, that propheſie ſeems to have reſpect, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now <hi>the Temple, of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is open'd,</hi> Rev. 15.5. A few things muſt be enquired into.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What we are to underſtand by the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why 'tis call'd, <hi>The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In what ſenſe it's ſaid, <hi>to be opened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the <hi>Temple,</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> the Churches, Ordinances, Inſtitutions of <hi>CHRIST:</hi> which hath been before proved, are repreſented under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the Reaſons thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis call'd, <hi>The Temple of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>; becauſe the preſence of God, his Laws, Statutes, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, were with them, amongſt them, in a ſpecial pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner. The Tabernacle of Old was a Type of his ſpecial preſence with his people then, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.8. and 29.45, 46. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.11, 12. Therefore God is ſaid to <hi>dwell</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>; its call'd his <hi>Habitation,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. There he promiſed to meet with, and ſpeak to his People, <hi>Exod.</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47212:50"/>
29.42, 43. This <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is call'd, the <hi>Tabernacle of Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Exod.</hi> 38.21. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.44. becauſe in it was the <hi>Ark,</hi> wherein was the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony.</hi> 'Twas at laſt brought into the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.4.—2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.5. This here is ſaid to be in Heaven (or appertaining to the Goſpel-Miniſtration) perhaps on purpoſe to obviate any miſtake, the <hi>Jews</hi> might have of the reſtitution of their Temple-Worſhip; <hi>q. d.</hi> Though I ſpeak of the Temple of the <hi>Tabernacle of Teſtimony</hi>; don't think, that I intend that which was built, by <hi>Moſes, Solomon,</hi> and that your Old-Worſhip thereto affixed, ſhall be reſtored; no, I am treating of another kind of <hi>Temple,</hi> under another <hi>Miniſtration,</hi> viz. an Heavenly, which he that ſpeaks from Heaven hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. To which appertains the Teſtimony, Laws, Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, he hath given forth; wherein he hath promiſed to meet his People, bleſs them, fill them with his Company, Preſence, Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the <hi>Opening of the Temple of the Tabernacle in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> we are not to underſtand, the introduction of a New-Goſpel-Miniſtration: The vanity, emptineſs, ridicule of ſuch an interpretation is from hence manifeſt; that <hi>John</hi> ſaith not, that there ſhall be a New-Temple built; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Temple ſhall be opened,</hi> i. e. the Old Temple of the Tabernacle that was ſtanding all the times of the <hi>Pagan</hi>-Antichriſtian perſecutions. And this very Scripture is of it ſelf evidence ſufficient, that at leaſt all the times of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> there was an abiding <hi>Temple,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Worſhip, Worſhippers</hi> therein. For at the riſe of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> we find a <hi>Temple,</hi> Rev. 11.1. and now at the going forth of the <hi>Vial-Angels,</hi> this very <hi>Temple</hi> is <hi>open'd</hi>: not the leaſt tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſyllable, of the conſtituting a new one; but the opening the old. The word is not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, to <hi>open</hi> that which was already built, and ſufficiently beautified by the Lord. The words are perhaps an alluſion to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.24. &amp; 29.3. The firſt Scripture tells us, that <hi>Ahaz</hi> had <hi>ſhut up the doors of the Houſe of the Lord</hi>; the latter, that good <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah open'd them</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Twas the ſame Houſe, the ſame doors
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47212:50"/>
(not others) that was <hi>ſhut up</hi> and <hi>opened.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>Goſpel-Churches</hi> that a little before were Worſhipping more retiredly, privately, are now again brought to publick view; returned from their Wilderneſs, retired-ſtate, to an open profeſſion, owning of the Laws, Wayes of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Vial-Angels</hi> come out of this Temple thus opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.6. For they are ſome of the moſt Spiritual, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of the Temple-Worſhippers (or members of theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) as is evident from their Prieſtly-array, they are <hi>clothed in pure and White-linnen, having their breaſts girded with Golden-Girdles:</hi> The attire of the Prieſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.6, 8. Temple-Worſhippers are a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. During the whole time of the pouring out of the <hi>Vials</hi> (at the cloſe of which, as is generally granted, Chriſt comes) we find the continuance of this Temple, ver 8. <hi>And the Temple was filled with Smoak from the Glory of God, and from his Power,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> there was a more than ordinary preſence of God, with theſe Temple-Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers) <hi>and no man was able to enter into the Temple</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to interrupt, diſturb the Worſhippers there, as formerly they had done) <hi>till the ſeven Plagues of the ſeven-Angels were fulfilled,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> till they were all pour'd out) <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by them perfectly <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> the Glorious Kingdom of our <hi>LORD</hi> and <hi>SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> introduced.</p>

Now the whole of that Miniſtration that was then ſet on foot by him, is permanent, and inviolably to be obſerved to the end of the World. To the proof of which, we now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Chriſt himſelf ſeems to intimate as much, when he gives commiſſion to the Apoſtles, to go forth to preach the Goſpel, teaching them who ſhall be converted by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to obſerve his whole charge, Mat. 28.19, 20. <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to obſerve all things whatever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the World.</hi> Two things are plainly aſſerted. 1.

That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would all along communicate his preſence, to ſuch as ſhould, to that great period of time, be found in the obſervance of what he commanded.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who alſo had ſeen the Lord, and converſt with him, when he was caught up into the third Heavens, expreſly aſſerts concerning one part of this <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtration,</hi> or one great <hi>Ordinance</hi> appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, (and ſuch an one as none can regularly be found in the practice of, but ſuch as are in a <hi>Church-ſtate,</hi> Act. 2.42.) <hi>viz.</hi> The Ordinance of Breaking Bread, that it

was to continue to the coming of our Lord, 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew forth the Lords death until he come.</hi> Chriſt commanded his Diſciples a little before he was offer'd up a Sacrifice for them, to be found in this practice, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19, 20.— <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> And afterwards charges them as they love him, to be found in the obſervance of it (as of other his Commandments) John 14.15. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> Tells them it's an argument of their love, and true friendſhip to him ſo to do, John 14.21, 23. and 15.14. <hi>Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> Which ſaith our Apoſtle, we are to do till our Lord comes.</p>

He ownes them for a Church of God, affirmes that they were Sanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, call'd to be Saints, that the grace of God was given them by Chriſt Jeſus; that in every thing they were enriched by him, in all <hi>utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47212:52"/>
and in all <hi>knowledge,</hi> that the teſtimony of Chriſt was confirmed in them; ſo that they came behind in no Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gift; that they were call'd unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7, 9. with much more that might be mentioned, evidently declaring, that Chriſt was in <hi>Spirit, Power,</hi> already come to them; yet the Apoſtle ſpeaks of another coming, till which, the Saints are to be found in the practice of this inſtitution; which coming alſo, theſe <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> waited for, 1 Cor. 1.7. <hi>Waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. He is come already to ſome in perſon; ſay others, there's therefore an end of this Inſtitution, the whole Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the coming of Chriſt in a corner, is not the coming the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of—. 'Tis an unſcriptural, anti-ſcriptural notion (as hath been demonſtrated); but that coming which the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> with all the Saints ever ſince his departure, have been waiting for, <hi>viz.</hi> his Glorious, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible coming in the Clouds of Heaven, when every eye ſhall ſee him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The ſame Apoſtle moſt ſolemnly charges his beloved Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> to keep the Commandment without ſpot, to the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>I give thee charge in the ſight of God, who quickneth all things, and before Chriſt Jeſus, who before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion, that thou keep this Commandment without ſpot—till the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What's meant by <hi>Commandment?

Theſe Believers were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, keep, till the appearing of Chriſt Jeſus. If the words be ſtrictly adhered to, and there be no enallage of the number allowed, it comes to the ſame purpoſe. For 'twill
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47212:52"/>
not I preſume, be denied, that by <hi>Commandment</hi> we are not to underſtand any <hi>Commandment</hi> given forth by <hi>Paul's</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit; but the Commandment of Chriſt through him. Now of all Chriſt's Commandments, there's the ſame reaſon, our reception, owning of, obedience to any one, is grounded upon his Soveraign Authority: If I may reject one, I may reject all; and if I am bound to attend to, obey one, I am bound to attend to, obey all. For 'tis the ſame Law-giver, that hath given them all forth. Beſides, the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.21. charges him <hi>before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Elect Angels, that he obſerve the things delivered to him, without preferring one before another:</hi> which ſeems to be the Commandment, he thus ſolemnly charges him in the words under conſideration, <hi>to keep without ſpot, and unblameable to the coming of Chriſt.</hi> The plain meaning is, the Apoſtle writes this Epſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> on purpoſe to inſtruct him how to <hi>behave himſelf in the Church of God,</hi> Chap. 3.15. He had given him ſundry directions touching the Officers to be choſen in the Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Speaks of the Apoſtaſie from the Doctrine, and Worſhip of the Goſpel that ſhould be in an after-day, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. (of which alſo he had treated in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> Chap. 2.) would have him put the <hi>Brethren in remembrance of theſe things,</hi> Chap. 4.6. charges him to give attendance to the work of the Miniſtry, to which he was call'd; to take <hi>heed to the Doctrine,</hi> relating to Faith, and Church-order, which was deliver'd to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14, 16. which he calls that which was <hi>committed to his truſt,</hi> which he commands him to <hi>keep, Chap.</hi> 6.20. yea, to command and teach to others, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.10. And having charged him to obſerve all theſe things without <hi>partiality, Chap.</hi> 5.21. he in this place moſt ſolemnly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to keep that Commandment of his. The ſum is, 1. Whatever the Apoſtle had charged upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> relating to the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Goſpel; to the Church, and the Inſtitutions thereof; he was not only to obſerve himſelf, but to command others alſo to do ſo. 2. That theſe Orders, Inſtitutions, Ordinances, were to <hi>continue</hi> to the next Glorious Perſonal coming of our Lord Jeſus, and the Saints
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47212:53"/>
in their ſeveral Generations, are till then, to be found in the conſcientious obſervance, and practice of them; whence it neceſſarily follows, that the Miniſtration introduced by Chriſt (which for the moſt part conſiſts in what we have but now inſtanc'd in) muſt continue till that day.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Our Apoſtle give us a farther, and moſt ample de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Truth pleaded for, Heb. 1.1, 2. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> The laſt dayes, are the <hi>laſt dayes</hi> of the <hi>Judaick</hi> Church-ſtate, the whole oeconomy; all the Laws, Statutes, Orders, Inſtitutions thereunto appertaining. <hi>God hath ſpoken—i. e.</hi> God the Father hath done ſo by his Son, in his perſonal Miniſtry, when he tabernacled amongſt men. The deſign of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the words under conſideration it's obvious, is to give the <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtration</hi> a preferrence above all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. And this he doth eſpecially two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The diſcoveries God made of his Will to the Fathers in times paſt, he made by the Prophets: but the diſcovery of his Will in the <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtration,</hi> is by his Son. Now though 'tis true, the Prophets were worthy, excellent, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ones; yet they were but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, meer men; but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi>: The Son of God, the Mediator of the New-Covenant (by whom the Father ſpake, when he dwelt amongſt us) is <hi>fair, fair</hi> above them all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. Tranſcends them all in Beauty, Excellency, Authority, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that Son, that well-beloved Son of the Father in whom he was well pleaſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the diſcoveries that were before, were but partial, gradual. He gave a hint to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi>; ſpake more plainly to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.11, 12. and 17.1, 2. and 26.24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>Moſes</hi> in giving the Law, and erection of the Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick-Church; when there was ſuch a diſcovery of the mind of God, that lookt like ſo perfect a model, that nothing further was to be expected; yet he afterward ſpake by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c. but now by his Son, he hath made a perfect, and full diſcovery of his Mind, and Will;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47212:53"/>
ſo as nothing more, nothing new, nothing beyond it is to be expected. That ſuch a diſcovery ſhould be made by him, was before Propheſied of him, Dan. 9.24. <hi>Seventy Weeks are determined upon the People—to finiſh the tranſgreſſion— to ſeal up the Viſion, and Propheſie, and to anoint the moſt Holy.</hi> That 'tis a Propheſie of Chriſt, is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by both Chriſtians, and Jews. <hi>Nachmanides</hi> tells us <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> (or the <hi>moſt Holy,</hi> as we tranſlate) is the Meſſiah, who is ſanctified from amongſt the Sons of <hi>David.</hi> The work he was to do when he came in the World, is amply decypher'd, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Finiſh tranſgreſſion, to make an end of Sins, to make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iniquities, and to bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs, and to ſeal up the Viſion, and Propheſie.</hi> This laſt is, what we are at preſent concerned to take notice of. Two things muſt be enquired into.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What's meant by <hi>Viſion,</hi> and <hi>Propheſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In what ſenſe the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the <hi>Holy of Holyes,</hi> or the <hi>Holiness of Holineſſes,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah, CHRIST, ſealed up the Viſion, and Propheſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt, by <hi>Viſion and Propheſie,</hi> we are to underſtand, all the wayes of diſcovery of the mind and Will of God, he was pleaſed to make uſe of for the inſtruction of the Judaick-Church therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond, <hi>Chriſt ſealed the Viſion and Propheſie,</hi> by finiſhing, perfecting it, ſo as no more was, or needed to be added thereunto, as to the making the diſcovery of the Fathers will compleat. So the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Chatham</hi> (tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>ſeal</hi>) ſignifies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28, 12. <hi>Thou ſealeſt up the Summe: Vatablus,</hi> and the <hi>Tigurine</hi> render it, <hi>Tues omnibus numeris ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutum exemplar; Thou art in all reſpects a perfect example.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Caſtalion.</hi> The <hi>Syriack</hi> renders it, by a word that ſignifies as to <hi>Seal,</hi> ſo to <hi>compleat,</hi> make <hi>perfect</hi>; and the <hi>Arabick,</hi> by a word, that ſignifies to make an <hi>end</hi> of <hi>ſpeaking.</hi> When a man hath writ the whole of his mind he intends to communicate in his letter, he <hi>ſeals</hi> it up. The meaning is, God had divers wayes, and manners, in dayes paſt, revealed his Will to the Church; at laſt he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47212:54"/>
ſent his Son, as the great and laſt Prophet, who fully, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſcovers his mind to her; ſo that a further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction there needs not, nor is there to be expected. But,</p>
                  <p n="5">V. There's no ground left for any <hi>New-Miniſtration,</hi> or <hi>any Alteration in that ſet on foot by Chriſt.</hi> The reaſons of the alteration of the Old-Teſtament-Miniſtration, with the Inſtitutions, Ordinances thereunto appertaining, may be reduced to a twofold-head.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They all pointed at, had reſpect to the Meſſiah, Chriſt, to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law.</hi> This the Apoſtle aſſerts to be the ground of its abolition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt was to come during its continuance, as Lord over his own Houſe, with more ample Power, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than any that went before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. &amp; 3.5, 6. He had then Power, Authority, to confirm, remove, aboliſh as he pleaſed; and none could ſay unto him in this matter, What doſt thou? But neither of theſe can be ſuppoſed as the ground of altering, diſcontinuing the Miniſtration ſet on foot by Chriſt. He was then already come, tabernacled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: and come he was, as the great Prophet, Lord, King, of the Church; and as ſuch, gives forth Laws for them to ſubject, conform to.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtration, Inſtitutions, muſt continue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a greater than Chriſt come.</hi> The Law was given forth by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it continued thouſands of Years; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the degeneracy, corruption that was amongſt the People, none could put a period to it; the Church was bound to the obſervation of it, to the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10. and that upon this foot of account; becauſe till Chriſt, none roſe up greater than he. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> going about to demonſtrate to the <hi>Jews</hi> the abolition of the Moſaick Miniſtration, layes the Foundation of his diſcourſe in the ſuper-eminent Authority of the Lord Jeſus. 'Tis true, the Law was moſt ſolemnly given forth by the Miniſtration of Angels in the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is above <hi>Angels, Heb.</hi> 1.4. and 2.2. above <hi>Moſes,</hi> chap. 3.3.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47212:54"/>
Is there any greater, ſuperiour to Chriſt? If not (as moſt certain it is there is not; to aſſert it, is the height of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm, 'tis blaſphemy againſt the Son) then the Miniſtration inſtituted by him, muſt of neceſſity continue till he come to put a period to it.

                  <p>THE end for which, the Lord Jeſus eſtabliſht the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Goſpel-Churches, Inſtitutions, Ordinances, is the ſame that ever 'twas, and will continue ſo to be till the time of the conſummation of all things.</hi> Whence its continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſarily follows. Let's a little conſider what were the ends for which God from the beginning, inſtituted a <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> in the World. Amongſt others that perhaps might be mentioned, theſe are the chief.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Sanctification of his name therein, Lev. 10.3. <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſaid, I will be Sanctified in all thoſe that draw nigh to me</hi>—. 'Tis of the ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in that <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> he is there ſpeaking: In
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47212:55"/>
particular, touching that Inſtitution of ſacrificeing to the Lord. The ſanctification of his name therein, is aſſerted to be one great end of the Lord in that inſtitution: a failure wherein coſt <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> dear; they thereby provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Lord, and he brake forth in his fury againſt them, and ſlew them before the People. This alſo is aſſerted to be the end of the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Goſpel-Inſtitutions,</hi> Heb. 12.28, 29. <hi>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken, let us have grace whereby we may ſerve God, acceptably with REVERENCE, and GODLY FEAR, for our God is a conſuming Fire.</hi> By the <hi>Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken,</hi> we have already demonſtrated, is meant the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> therein they were to <hi>ſerve God acceptably, with reverence, and Godly fear,</hi> i. e. they were to ſanctifie his name in their attendment on him in the Inſtitutions appertaining thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which if they neglect to do, they may expect to find the Lord, as <hi>Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> did, <hi>a conſuming fire</hi> to them. Before we come to a full Concluſion of this matter, 'twill not be altogether impertinent or unprofitable to remark what it is to ſanctifie the Name of the Lord in Solemn-Goſpel-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In order whereunto there muſt be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A ſingle reſpect to, a <hi>Holy reverence</hi> of God's Soveraign Authority in its appointment. The Laws, Edicts of men, have no place here. Should we be found in the practice of what God commands, and therein have no regard to his Commandment, Authority; but the Commandments, Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, we ſanctifie not his name therein. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God inſtituting it, is laid as the Foundation of, and motive to all our Worſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6, 7. and 28.58. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. What's bottom'd meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the wills, laws of men, is not the Worſhip of God; 'tis Superſtitious, Idolatrous, Vain, Empty, good for nothing; that which the Soul of the Lord loaths, abhors; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him to Jealouſie, whatever outward ſplendour, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhew of Devotion it may ſeem to have in it. How great a part of the Worſhip of the Papacy is hereby diſcarded, is known: It being ſolely built upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Popes, Councils, Fathers, Traditions, Laws,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47212:55"/>
Edicts of Men; totally forraign, contrary to <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There muſt be alſo Faith in the Promiſes of God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the obſervance of theſe Inſtitutions. That there are ſpecial promiſes of Favour, Grace, Kindneſs to ſuch as Conſcientiouſly attend upon him herein, ſhall afterwards be demonſtrated. Faith is required with reſpect to theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: <hi>He that comes unto God</hi> (draws nigh to him in Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Inſtitutions) <hi>muſt believe that he is, and that he is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There muſt be a Holy, Awfull regard unto his ſpecial Preſence in them. He walks in the <hi>midſt</hi> of his <hi>Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks,</hi> Rev. 1.13. <hi>dwells</hi> in his <hi>Churches,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 'Tis true, he fills Heaven, and Earth, with his preſence, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant to no creature, the vileſt of Men, or Devils; but he hath promiſed a more ſpecial Preſence with his Children, as they are attending him in his own appointments, for their further enlightning, quickning, comfort, ſtrengthning, growth, increaſment in the <hi>Grace of God, Mat.</hi> 18.20. If perſons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on Divine Inſtitutions, and realize not the ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord there; no wonder if they are carnal, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, dead, lifeleſs in them, meet with no feeling of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſights of his Glory—.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There muſt be an attendment to the due order, in which the Lord will have all managed. A failure herein, cauſed the Lord of old to make a breach upon <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> (he ſmote him, ſlew him, when they were about to bring the Ark from <hi>Kirjath-jearim,</hi> 1 Chron. 13.11.) 1 Chron. 15.13. <hi>The Lord our God made a breach upon us for that we ſought him not after the due Order.</hi> All muſt be managed in the Spirit, Power, of <hi>Jehovah</hi>: he's put into office by the Father, and the Son, to enable in the managery of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> Rom. 8.26. Alas! ſorry weak man, is altogether unable for the diſpatch of ſuch ſublime, Heavenly Work. Let men at their utmoſt peril, contemn, deride the aſſiſtance of the Spirit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; they never worſhip God aright, who are ſtrangers to it, nor without it will ever be able to pleaſe him in what they do.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:47212:56"/>5. There muſt be alſo a holy delight in God: the lively ſtirring up, exertings, puttings forth of the grace of God in us. 'Tis not ſo eaſie a matter for perſons to <hi>ſanctifie the Name of God in Worſhip,</hi> as many ſuppoſe it to be. We cannot of our ſelves, in our own creaturely power, ſerve him who is a jealous God.</p>

There muſt be a perſeverance, continuance, unto the end, in obedience to him, in a due obſervation of, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, in <hi>Goſpel-Inſtitutions</hi>: otherwiſe we deny his name, <hi>prophane</hi> it (as much as in us lyes, make Religion, Chriſtianity, a ridicule, contempt in the World) inſtead of <hi>Sanctifying</hi> it. Are any of theſe things vacated, not to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, attended to? Who that pretends in ſobriety to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, hath the forehead to avouch, affirm it?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Another end of <hi>Goſpel-Inſtitutions</hi> is, <hi>Our ſolemn, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, avowed, owning of, ſubjection to the Lord Jeſus.</hi> 'Twas from the beginning, one end of God, in his erecting of Worſhip, that his People might therein, ſolemnly own, avouch, him to be their God, Lord, Soveraign; and they his Loyal Subjects, faithful Servants, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. <hi>This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do theſe Statutes, and Judgments: Thou ſhalt therefore keep, and do them, with all thy heart, and all thy ſoul. Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his Wayes, and to keep his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and his Commandments, and his Judgements, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto his Voice. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day, to be his peculiar People as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldeſt keep all his Commandments.</hi> If we will have God for our God, viſibly own him as ſuch, we muſt conform to his Inſtitutions; our publick acknowledgment of him, as ſuch, lyes therein. The World know nothing of the Saints act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Faith, Love, the ſecret communion they have with <hi>GOD:</hi> nor do they, can they take much notice of them as to their Cloſet, Family-Service: but when found in the practice of the Inſtitutions of the Lord, then are they in the view of men, publickly declaring that God's their God, and they his People, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.18, 21, 22. is to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>Firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47212:56"/>
choſe him for their God, reſign'd up themſelves, all that they were, and had, wholly to the Lord to be at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <hi>And unto us by the Will of God</hi>; i. e. they ſolemnly avouched, publickly owned, declared this God to be theirs, by their entring into the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, walking in the wayes of his appointment, owning, ſubjecting to, the Ordinances of Jeſus declared to them by us. Nor can there be a full owning of the Lord (to ſpeak modeſtly) without a conſcientious walking herein: neither will the Lord look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought we do, whileſt in the wilful neglect of his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be ſuch an owning of him. He will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be our God, not in the way of our own wills, but in the wayes he hath appointed us ſo to do. The ſole queſtion is (and yet one would wonder it ſhould be a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt any that profeſs the fear of the Lord) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the duty of Saints publickly to own, acknowledge him to be their <hi>GOD</hi>? Which if granted, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> with the Inſtitutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, is yet in being; and muſt be ſo, whileſt there are any Saints in this World, whoſe duty 'tis ſo to own him: for one end aimed at by the Lord Jeſus in the eſtabliſhment of theſe Inſtitutions, was, (as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that Saints ſhould ſolemnly own, acknowledge him therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. A third end of this <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> is to ſet forth the Lords honour, publiſh his praiſes, Eph. 3.21. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him be glory in the Churches by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all Ages, World without end,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Two things are here plainly aſſerted by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there ſhall be a continuation of <hi>Churches though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages, World without end</hi>: and of ſuch Churches, both for Matter, and Form, (at leaſt) as were in the Apoſtles dayes; walking with Chriſt in all the wayes of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One would wonder at the confidence of perſons, who have the forehead to aſſert the ceſſation of Churches, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in open oppoſition to what is affirmed here by the Apoſtle of our Lord: who ſpeaks ſo fully, plainly, to their <hi>continuation,</hi> 'till the end of the World, that all the wit of

man cannot poſſibly find out any evaſion. Had he ſaid on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>They ſhould continue, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> into all,</hi> or <hi>throughout all Generations,</hi> or <hi>Ages</hi>: and as if that were not full enough to expreſs his intendment of their <hi>continuance till time ſhould be no more</hi>; he adds, <hi>that they ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, throughout all Ages of the World, of Worlds,</hi> or <hi>Age of Ages.</hi> The Apoſtles ſeems to allude to two Hebrew Phraſes, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>

                     <hi>Ye ſhall not be aſhamed, nor confounded, World without end.</hi> Their continuance till the end of this World, is evidently what's his intendment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That one end of the Inſtitution of theſe Churches, is, that God may be praiſed in them, by them, is alſo aſſerted. Is this end terminated? Is it not the duty of Saints to praiſe the Lord; and to praiſe him in the wayes he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? If he hath inſtituted Churches for this end; 'tis the duty of Saints to praiſe him in them. If for this end he hath Appointed their continuance throughout all Ages, they muſt of neceſſity ſo continue, or God failes of his end, which is abominable Blaſphemous to aſſert. See to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Another end of the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> is Saints mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Edification, Growth, <hi>till they all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of GOD, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.26. <hi>Let all things be done to edifying,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12, 13, 29. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Jude</hi> 20. Have Saints no further need of edification, building up? Are they come to a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt?</hi> Who dare aver it? Can there be a more proper medium, way, or means, fixt upon, for the effecting this noble, and glorious end, than what the Lord propos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47212:57"/>
together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, in the practice of all the Inſtitutions of Chriſt? What ever perſons may think, as none can deſert the way Appointed by the Lord, for the production of this end, without a tremendous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance againſt the Wiſdom of God, his Love to, and Care of his Children; ſo they'l find, any other fixt upon by them, will prove altogether inſucceſsful as to the end aimed at.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The confirmation of the Saints <hi>mutual love</hi> one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is alſo frequently aſſerted to be one great end of this Appointment, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.12. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17.

                  <p>THE <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> with the Inſtitutions, Ordinances thereunto appertaining, is annexed unto, bottom'd upon the <hi>New-Covenant</hi>: Therefore it's perpetual, abiding. The

conſequence is evident; what is annext to, bottom'd upon, that which is permanent, cannot be it ſelf otherwiſe: it muſt abide, continue, as that to which it's affixt, on which it's bottom'd does. The whole Judaick-Church-State, with all its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Inſtitutions, was built upon that Covenant God of Old, took <hi>Iſrael</hi> into, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1. This <hi>Covenant</hi> was mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, changeble; a time was fixt by the Lord for it's abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition: Repreſented at firſt in the breaking of the <hi>Tables of Stone,</hi> in which the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> was writ, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19. Yet ſo long as that abode, the Inſtitutions thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining were in force; therefore the Apoſtle, being to prove the ceſſation of the <hi>Jewiſh-Church-ſtate,</hi> amongſt other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, makes uſe of this as one, that the <hi>Covenant</hi> God took that people into, was perioded, aboliſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13. So then, if the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Ordinances,</hi> are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to the <hi>New-Covenant</hi>; they are, cannot but be, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: except that Covenant alſo be ſuppoſed, and can be proved to be otherwiſe. That the <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate,</hi> and all the <hi>Ordinances</hi> thereof, are annext to, and bottom'd upon the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> is evident from</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Scripture-Propheſie, declaring that ſo it ſhall be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and My Words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth; nor out of the mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed, ſaith the Lord; from hence-forth, and for ever.</hi> 'Tis the Covenant that God takes believers into, the <hi>Goſpel-Covenant</hi> that he ſpeaks of: <hi>This is my Covenant with them</hi>; theſe are call'd: Chriſt's Seed. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 53.10. Concerning them, he ſaith, that the words which he puts into the mouth of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> whatever he gave Chriſt (as the great Prophet of the Church) in charge to communicate to them; all the Laws, Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given forth by Chriſt, were part of Gods words he put into his mouth. <hi>Shall not depart out of their mouths,</hi> i. e. they ſhall be found in the practice of, ſubjecting to them; whilſt there are any Saints in this World, they ſhall be ſo.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47212:58"/>
put a new Spirit within you, and I will take the ſtony-heart out of their fleſh, and will give them an heart of fleſh: that they may walk in my Statutes, and keep mine Ordinances, and do them; and they ſhall be My People, and I will be their GOD.</hi> The former part of the words, <hi>I will give them one heart</hi>— and the latter, <hi>they ſhall be my People, and I will be their GOD</hi>; are the ſum, and ſubſtance of the New-Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.29. Unto this then the Statutes, and Ordinances do evidently appertain: for the Lord takes them to be his People, gives himſelf to them to be their <hi>GOD</hi>; gives them <hi>one heart,</hi> puts <hi>a new Spirit within them—that they may walk in his Statutes, keep his Ordinances, and do them.</hi> If there be any Saints under the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> if a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be put within them, then are there alſo Statutes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances (Goſpel-Inſtitutions) for them to walk in; and in their doing ſo, they diſcover themſelves to be Gods People, as he is their God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. is fully to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean Water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthyneſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you: A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the Stony-heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to Walk in in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgements to do them.</hi> If the donation of the Spirit, Regeneration, Sanctification, be a part, branch, of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi>; the Statutes, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>LORD</hi> are ſo too: and theſe, ſuch a part of it, that there's at leaſt ground of <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> whether any are really made partakers of the former, who are found (except under the power of temptation) in the total neglect, rejection of theſe: <hi>for the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. is given to cauſe them to <hi>Walk in Gods Statutes, and to keep his Judgments.</hi> And it's worthy obſervation, that God hath equally obliged himſelf to cauſe his People to walk in the wayes of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as to <hi>give the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. to them. So that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, there muſt be a <hi>continuation</hi> of Churches, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or there are no Saints, there's an end of the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi>

                  <p>THat there have been perſons under the profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt, congregated together, for the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of Ordinances, from the firſt-times of the Goſpel hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, hath been before proved: That there are ſo ſtill, cannot be denied. Now theſe Churches muſt be either the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Churches of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> There's no medium. A Church that was neither of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet heard of in the world, ſince the firſt-dawning of the <hi>Goſpel-day.</hi> So then, if we demonſtrate, that the preſent <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> are not <hi>Antichriſtian-churches,</hi> we evince them to be the <hi>Churches of Chriſt</hi>; and a <hi>continuation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-Church-State,</hi> at leaſt hitherto, is evidently diſcover'd. That they are not Churches of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is eaſily demonſtrated. They wholly differ from the <hi>Antichriſtian-Church</hi> in reſpect of <hi>matter, form, foundation, doctrine, worſhip, nature, characters, properties.</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which, it's needful that we particularly diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian-church,</hi> is, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver own's the Chriſtian Faith, make's a Profeſſion of it, though never ſo deboyſh, vile, wicked; to every good work, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Notwithſtanding all their pompous ſhews of Religion, Forms of Godlineſs, they are really ſuch as have pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. Is this the <hi>matter</hi> conſtitutive of the preſent Churches? Do they admit perſons of ſo <hi>black</hi> a character into their <hi>Communion?</hi> If any ſuch ſpots are found amongſt them, do they tollerate, indulge them? Are not the rules of Chriſt proſecuted, till they (appearing to be perſons of a reprobate mind) are rejected out of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip? Is it not the avowed principles of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that ſuch as theſe, are not fit <hi>matter</hi> for any Church of Chriſt? Can they be charged with walking contrary to their principles in this <hi>matter</hi>? Who hath the confidence, impudence, thus to charge any one of them? 'Tis true,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47212:61"/>
now, and then, ſome ſcandalous perſons are found amongſt them (and ſo there were in the Primitive Churches, as in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp;c.) that crept in <hi>unawares</hi>; but they are <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>grief,</hi> humbling to them; and they do not, dare not, cannot ſuffer them in their <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Form</hi> (if it may be ſo call'd) of the <hi>Antichriſtian-Church</hi> lie's in a forcible compelling perſons into, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent keeping them in its communion, and fellowſhip. If you'l not be one with them, then Fines, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Bonds attend you; Penal Laws, and Statutes are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted for this end; and by theſe are men brought into, and kept in the <hi>Antichriſtian-church</hi>: And were theſe weapons of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> its warfare taken away, 'twould ſoon become as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Cucumbers, or periſh with its own weight. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> to reduce perſons into their <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by Fire, and Sword; their labours to preſerve the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Church <hi>this way</hi> is known. Is there any thing like it owned by, or to be found, amongſt the preſent Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? Do they not with one mouth affirm, that 'tis a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary departure from the worlds way, and a ſpontaneous giving up themſelves to the Lord, and one another, to walk with him in a ſubjection to his inſtitutions, wherein the <hi>form</hi> of the Churches lies? Herein is a moſt Evident difference betwixt <hi>Them,</hi> and the <hi>Antichriſtian-Church.</hi> They talk of no compulſions, but thoſe of the Spirit, and Love, that make a people Volunteers in the day of the Lord's Power. <hi>Lex no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va non ſe vindicat ultore gladio,</hi> is their Motto, as is known.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian-Church,</hi> is not Jeſus Chriſt; but the Sons of men, one, or other of them; their Laws, Canons, Decretals, upon which it is built. Is this the caſe of the preſent Churches? Do they not all of them, with full conſent, proclaim their abhorrency of ſuch a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation?</hi> Is not CHRIST, in their account, the alone <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of all the True Churches in the world, and they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe accordingly. Their debates touching this matter, with the Papelins, about <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. from whence theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove <hi>Peter,</hi> and conſequentially (as they'd have it) the

                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Anti-chriſtian-Church,</hi> is a Doctrine of <hi>Devils,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>doctrines of Daemons,</hi> ſo the learned <hi>Mede</hi> renders it. Some carry it thus, <hi>doctrines which devils are the Authors of</hi>: There's a great deal of truth in that, all the doctrines of the <hi>Anti-chriſtian-church,</hi> that are peculiarly hers, are the <hi>doctrines of Devils.</hi> But I rather think, with that learned perſon, that by <hi>doctrines of Daemons,</hi> is meant thoſe doctrines that have the <hi>Daemons</hi> for their Object. Now theſe <hi>Daemons</hi> (that were worſhipped by the <hi>Pagans</hi>) were 1. For their <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> ſuppoſed by the Gentiles, an inferior, and middle ſort of divine powers, between the ſoveraign and heavenly Gods, and mortal Men. 2. For their <hi>Office,</hi> to be as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, and agents between theſe ſoveraign Gods, and Men. 3. For their <hi>original,</hi> either Angels, or the Deified-ſouls of Worthy-men after death. 4. For the <hi>way</hi> of Worſhipping them, to find and receive benefits from them; 'twas by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated-Images, and Pillars. 5. Their very <hi>Reliques</hi> were adored, and brought into Temples. They that deſire to ſee more touching this <hi>matter,</hi> may at their leaſure, conſult the famous <hi>Medes</hi> Apoſtaſie of the latter times. The Doctrines of <hi>Daemons</hi> then, are the Doctrines of the Apoſtatick Roman-Antichriſtian-Synagogue, touching the worſhipping of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> in imitation of the Pagan - Daemon - Worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But take the words in the largeſt Senſe, as comprehenſive of all thoſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are not of Chriſt, have the devil for their Author: Some whereof, are mention'd by the Apoſtle afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Forbidding to Marry, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to abſtain from Meats</hi> — the Doctrines of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Works, or inherent Sanctification, of Purgatory (or a ſtate of Purifying after this life)— any Principles, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, contrary to ſound Doctrine; the form of wholeſom words, or the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs; which of the Churches can be juſtly charged with holding, maintaining any ſuch Principles? 'Tis true, perhaps amongſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47212:63"/>
ſome of them, there may be found one, or other, that ſpeak perverſe things (as there was of old in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſome other Churches, in the Apoſtolick times) but are they countenanc't therein? Can their corrupt <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines</hi> be charged as the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the Churches? What more evidently, notoriouſly falſe, can be ſuggeſted, or fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian-Church,</hi> is a Worſhip of <hi>devils, idols of gold, ſilver, wood, ſtone,</hi> the work of men's hands, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. 'Tis an idolatrous, whoriſh, adulterous, ſuperſtitious Worſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.1, 2, 4, 5. whoſe whole <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum,</hi> foundation, is the Commandments of men; (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.) <hi>Traditions,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis formal, ſapleſs, lifeleſs. It's managery in the Spirit, is not at all attended to: His Aſſiſtance is contemned, reviled, blaſphemed; as that which is phantaſtick, whimſical, heretical, ſchiſmatical for any to talk of, or pretend to. Is the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the Churches, ſuch a <hi>Worſhip</hi>? Who hath the forehead to aver it? They witneſs againſt all ſuch <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Worſhipper's,</hi> both in Word, and Writing, as is known: Are ſtudious to walk by Scripture-rule in their <hi>Worſhip,</hi> both with reſpect to the matter, and manner, thereof.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>nature, characters, properties</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſtian-Church,</hi> are amply deſcribed by the Apoſtles of our Lord. They are ſuch as <hi>receive not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved</hi>; upon whom God hath ſent <hi>ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye; that they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. That give <hi>heed to ſeducing Spirits, and doctrines of Daemons, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie; having their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſear'd with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to abſtain from meats,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>covetous, boaſters of themſelves, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents; unthankful, unholy, without natural affection; truce-breakers, falſe Accuſers,</hi> (or make-bates) <hi>incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good: traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more than lovers of God; having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof</hi> — 2 Tim. 3.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Such as Worſhip the Dragon

In a word, the <hi>Antichriſtian-church</hi> is that part of the body of profeſſors that the great <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>-Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy ſpoken of, by theſe Apoſtles, gather's up; who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, character'd, by her <hi>falſe Doctrine, idolatrous, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Worſhip,</hi> (of which before) <hi>immorality in converſation, perſecution, bloody cruelty againſt the Royal Seed, the Saints of the moſt high.</hi> Who ſo ſear'd, hardened in heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as without a bluſh, from a ſoul filled with deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, can bear the ſight of a thought ſpringing up to affix the characters of this <hi>Antichriſtian-church,</hi> unto the preſent Churches?

                  <p>THe <hi>Church-State, Goſpel-Churches, Inſtitutions are bottomed upon the Mediatory Office of Chriſt</hi>; from whence a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation</hi> of them till his next, ſecond, glorious coming doth neceſſarily follow. To Chriſt, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> a threefold-Office (whereinto by Solemn Unction he was inaugurated by the Father) doth appertain, <hi>viz. Prophetick, Prieſtly, Kingly</hi>: Arguments from each of theſe, might at large be inſiſted on, to demonſtrate the truth we are at preſent contending for.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That Chriſt is the great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church, will not be denied, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. and 7.37. As a Prophet, he is fully acquainted with the Will of God, and hath perfectly Revealed it to the Church; both in reſpect of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline. The truth is, his whole work, as a Prophet, is to reveal the Will of God, and therein to Teach, and Inſtruct us. He is alſo call'd, <hi>The Apoſtle of our Profeſſion, Heb.</hi> 3.1. The Prophetick-Office of Chriſt, with reſpect unto his immediate, Authoritative,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47212:64"/>
Miſſion from the Father, is that which is intended by the expreſſion. He is ſaid frequently, to be <hi>ſent by the Father, Iſa.</hi> 19.20. and 48.16. and 61.1. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>He whom the Father ſent,</hi> is the deſcription he gives of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. which is frequently repeated, <hi>John</hi> 3.17, 18, 28, 34. and 5.23, 24, 30, 36, 37, 38. and 6.29, 38, 39, 40, 44, 57. and 7.16, 28, 29. and 8.16, 18, 29, 42. and 9.4. and 10.36. and 11.42. and 12.44, 45, 49. and 13.26. and 14.24. and 15.21. and 16.5. and 17.3, 18, 21, 23, 25. and 20.21. A Prophet he is, and ſuch a Prophet as never was in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nor any other like him, was there to be; and as a Prophet he reveals the Father himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. And his Name, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.6. and 17.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> the myſtery of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Grace of GOD, his Love, Kindneſs to the Sons of Men; his Worſhip, whole will, reſpecting our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Salvation. And for this work, he was ſent from the Father; had his Authority from him, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures through the Spirit (poured out upon him without meaſure) for the diſpatch of it. So that, he that hears Chriſt, hears the Father; and he that refuſeth Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the Father alſo: becauſe he acts in his Name, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in this his Office. That from hence, the <hi>continuation of Goſpel-Churches, Inſtitutions,</hi> muſt neceſſarily follow, is evident. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt, as the great <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Church, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared theſe to be one part of his Fathers Will, that (as ſuch) he was to <hi>Reveal</hi> (as hath been proved). That at any time it ſhould be lawful for us, to oppoſe the Will of the Lord, thus ſolemnly <hi>revealed,</hi> none will ſure have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to affirm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, chap.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 2. makes Chriſt's coming, as the great <hi>Prophet of God,</hi> one argument of the abolition of the whole <hi>Moſaick</hi> Paedagogy, and the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe <hi>Goſpel-Inſtitutions</hi> they were in the practice of. God that ſpake in the Prophets, hath ſpoken in his Son, <hi>q. d.</hi> You expected a Prophet (for ſo they did) who ſhould bring in a New-Miniſtration, reveal the whole will of the Father to you; this is He, he is the Apoſtle ſent from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47212:65"/>
him for this end: <hi>attend him, conſider him,</hi> Heb. 3.1. Now certainly if the Apoſtle lookt upon this as a good argument for the ſame (at leaſt one of the ſame) ends for which 'tis produced by us, 'twill be immodeſty for any to look upon it, as impertinent, incogent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt as the great <hi>Prophet,</hi> when he <hi>Tabernacled</hi> in the World, revealed this State, the Laws, Inſtitutions relating to it: Had we lived in the time <hi>when,</hi> and been one of thoſe to <hi>whom</hi> he had communicated them, ought we to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, obeyed, ſubjected to them? Sure! 'Twill not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but we ought. Are not the ſame Laws, delivered to the Apoſtles, recorded in the Scriptures? This will not be oppoſed. What then? Have the Laws of CHRIST, by their being written, loſt their Authority? This will not (I am ſure it cannot with any pretext of Reaſon) be ſaid. It remains therefore, that Churches, with the Worſhip affixt to them, being once of the diſcovery of CHRIST, muſt ſtill <hi>continue</hi> ſo to be; and our practice ſuitable to that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, <hi>neceſſitate precepti,</hi> neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is there any greater <hi>Prophet</hi> than Chriſt riſen up? Doth he come in his Fathers, or in his own Name; What's his meſſage that he brings? Is he upon a new diſcovery of the Fathers will, pouring contempt upon what hath been <hi>Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> by Chriſt? Every ſpiritual believer knows what reception he ought to have with him, <hi>viz.</hi> neither <hi>he,</hi> nor his <hi>Meſſage</hi> to be <hi>received,</hi> but <hi>rejected,</hi> as an impoſtor, a lye, 2 <hi>John</hi> 10.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hath Chriſt ceaſed to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> Since he was ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inaugurated into that Office by the viſible deſcent of the holy Spirit upon him in the form of a <hi>Dove, Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17? Shall he do ſo till he deliver up the <hi>Mediatory</hi>-Kingdom to the Father? Neither the one, nor the other will be aſſerted. Doth he now any other wayes diſcharge that Office, than by his written Word, and Spirit, opening the underſtanding of believers to perceive his Inſtructions contained therein? Surely no. The <hi>Revelation</hi> then made by him, with reſpect to Inſtitutions, Worſhip, is in every day to be attended to by the Saints. A <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> is then <hi>bottomed upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick-office
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47212:65"/>
of Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>continue</hi> from the time of its erection by him, to the conſummation of all things.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As 'tis <hi>bottomed upon the Prophetick-Office of Chriſt,</hi> ſo 'tis upon his <hi>Sacerdotal,</hi> or <hi>Prieſtly.</hi> The Apoſtle argues from the change of the <hi>Levitical</hi> prieſt-hood, to the change of the whole of that Church-polity, its Laws and Inſtitutions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. <hi>For the Prieſt-hood being changed, there is made of neceſſity, a change alſo of the Law.</hi> If this be a cogent Argument, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſtrongly on the contrary; If there be no change of the prieſt-hood (as the <hi>Melchizedekian</hi> Prieſt-hood, or the prieſt-hood of Chriſt after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> abides for ever, as the ſame Apoſtle tells us) then there is no change of the Law, or inſtitutions appertaining thereunto. That the whole of <hi>Goſpel-inſtitutions</hi> have a dependance upon the <hi>Prieſtly-Office</hi> of Chriſt, is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the legal Miniſtration, or Worſhip, was affixt to, had a dependance upon the <hi>Aaronick</hi> Prieſt-hood, the Apoſtle plainly enough declares in the forecited place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. Now if the Worſhip of that day had ſuch dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> that it liv'd and dyed; ſtood, and fell with it: the <hi>Goſpel-miniſtration,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> muſt have the ſame dependance upon the real Eternal <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of CHRIST; for that was Typick of this throughout.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt by his Death, or the Oblation of himſelf, which was a principal part of his <hi>Prieſtly-Office,</hi> vertually, put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the Law of Commandments contain'd in <hi>Moſaick</hi>-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15.

Temple in the Lord. In whom you are builded together for an Habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> Nothing could be more Evident, if written with the beams of the Sun, than this; that <hi>Goſpel-churches</hi> (call'd the <hi>Houſhold,</hi> the <hi>Building</hi> of GOD) with all the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of CHRIST, through which they have acceſs to God, are <hi>bottom'd</hi> upon the <hi>Prieſtly-Office</hi> of Chriſt.

All the fittings, preparings of Souls, as fit materials for this Spiritual-Temple, Building, and the management of the Ordinances thereof, are <hi>bottom'd</hi> upon the <hi>Prieſtly-Office</hi> of Chriſt.

v.</hi> 1.) <hi>are the Temple of the living God; as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> — Rev. 3.10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of temptation, that ſhall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth.</hi> The words are a promiſe made to the Church in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and ſo to all <hi>Goſpel-churches</hi>; eſpecially to ſuch as are the Antitype to the <hi>Philadelphian</hi>-Church, of preſervation from the temptations, ſnares, diſtreſſes, that are coming upon Profeſſors: others ſhall fall by them, ſink under them; ſhe ſhall be kept, becauſe ſhe kept the words of Chriſt's patience, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Doctrine, Precepts, Inſtitutions of CHRIST, he deliver'd in the day of his patience, when he Tabernacled amongſt men, and endured the contradiction of Sinners. The ſum is, as under the Old Law, ſo under the New; there are ſpecial Promiſes made to Saints Worſhipping God in a Community, as a Church: Whence three things neceſſarily follow:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there muſt be <hi>Goſpel-Churches,</hi> to whom theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes may be made good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That a denial of a <hi>Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Churches, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> is as much as in us lies, to make theſe Promiſes of GOD of none effect. For if their be no Churches, there are none to whom they ſhould be performed. And beſides, ſome of them have in them a ſpecial engagement for their preſervation. As that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5, 6. Is God unfaithful? Can any charge him with breach of Promiſe, without being guilty of horrid Impiety, Blaſphemy againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That a withdrawment from <hi>Church-Fellowſhip, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> is a practick-contempt of the preſence of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his People, as they are found walking according to his will herein.</p>

                  <p>'TIs the <hi>Duty of Saints in every Generation, to confess, make a Profeſſion of Chriſt,</hi> as well as to believe in him, Rom. 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth, the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47212:70"/>
and ſhalt believe in thine Heart</hi>—. This will not be denied! Now our ſolemn, moſt ſignal Profeſſion of our Lord Jeſus, lies in a viſible ſubjection to him in <hi>Church-Inſtitutions.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we ſaid, by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to <hi>put on Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.27. (<hi>i. e.</hi> have taken upon you a moſt ſolemn profeſſion of his name): And our Lord tells us, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.38. That to be <hi>aſhamed of his words,</hi> is to be <hi>aſhamed of him:</hi> that we ſhew our ſelves his <hi>Friends, if we do whatever he commands us, John</hi> 15.14. So that evidently an owning of, viſible ſubjection to, the <hi>Words, Inſtitutions of Chriſt,</hi> is that wherein our Profeſſion of his name doth lie. That it did ſo in the Primitive dayes, will not, cannot be denied: Well then, either there are no Saints in the World, or they are diſcharged from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to confeſs Chriſt, or there are Churches walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Goſpel-Ordinances</hi> at this day; and muſt be ſuch, to the <hi>conſummation of all things.</hi> The truth is, 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for any to hold the nullity of the <hi>Church-ſtate, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>; but they muſt affirm, (as ſome have done) that there are no viſible Saints in the World. For the ſame Law of Chriſt, which directed the Saints, in the firſt-dayes of the Goſpel, to make a <hi>profeſſion of Chriſt</hi> by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> abides ſtill, as a ſtanding rule for them to walk by.</p>

                  <p>MAny are the <hi>evil conſequences that follow upon the denial of Goſpel-Churches</hi>—. We'll inſtance but in a few.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The Miniſtration of the Law wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Servant, was more laſting, than the Miniſtration the Son was on purpoſe ſent from the Father to introduce.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That 'tis lawful to be partial in <hi>Jehovah's</hi> Law. 'Tis true, we are to pray by our ſelves, or perhaps ſome very few with us; to watch, attend the inward work; preſs after a further degree of ſanctification, conformity to Chriſt; we are to love him, believe in him: But as to the law of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, we will have nothing to do with it. And why ſo? Are not theſe laſt, as much the charge, Law of Chriſt to his people, as the former?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. 'Tis a condemning the generation of the Righteous (which we ought to be tender of) and that many wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are (have been) a generation of <hi>Will-worſhippers.</hi> Their Church-ſtate, fellowſhip, breaking bread — is <hi>Will-Worſhip:</hi> Churches are gathered, Ordinances adminiſtred in the will of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>Self-perſecutors, Self-murderers, Self-deſtroyers.</hi> The loſs of their liberty, goods, enjoyments, lives, for their being found in theſe wayes, they may thank themſelves; for, they bring it upon themſelves: for Chriſt requires no ſuch thing at their hands.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. 'Tis a Juſtifying, Gratifying, the Wicked againſt the Righteous. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:47212:71"/>1. A <hi>Juſtifying</hi> them in their charge againſt the Lords People. <hi>You may</hi> (ſay they) <hi>be of what religion you will, pray, preach, a few of you together; but nothing will pleaſe you, except you have a great company together. You talk of conſcience, this is nothing but your ſtubbornneſs, ſelf-will, pride of Spirit.</hi> And the truth is, it muſt be ſomewhat of that nature (for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt it cannot be) if Church-Aſſemblies, with the adminiſtration of Ordinances in them be not of Chriſt's appointment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a <hi>Gratifying</hi> Satan, Antichriſt, in his grand deſign, he hath from the beginning been managing againſt the Lord, and his People, <hi>viz.</hi> to diſſipate, ſcatter, drive them into corners.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis a <hi>Juſtifying</hi> the wicked in all their bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Saints. They perſecute them not as the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Chriſt; for he requires them not ſo to Worſhip him, but as breakers of the Law, Factious, Seditious ones.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. 'Tis as much, as in us lies, a <hi>diſpoyling</hi> Chriſt of all the viſible Soveraignty he hath at this day in the World.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. 'Tis a <hi>Withdrawment</hi> of our ſelves from that <hi>Yoak</hi> of Chriſt he commands, encourages his Diſciples to take upon them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. 'Tis to be aſhamed of Chriſt's words in an <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Generation, Mar.</hi> 8.38. with much more that might be inſtanced in. Theſe things might have been particularly more improved, but we have already paſt the bounds deſigned in the managery of this Controverſie. And if what hath been ſaid, will not convince <hi>Gain-ſayers,</hi> I am out of hopes by any thing that I can offer (though with the brighteſt Scripture-evidence) ſo to do: and ſhall pray to God, to ſhew them the error of their way, and reduce them to his <hi>Foot.</hi> 'Tis time we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thoſe Objections that are made (at leaſt as many of them as we have heard of) againſt the ſubject matter of the preſent diſcourſe: which is the deſign of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving in the precedent diſcourſe, at large evinced, <hi>The continuation of the Goſpel-Church-ſtate, Churches, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>; that which remaines, is the removal of Objections out of the way, which we now addreſs our ſelves to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We grant a <hi>Church-ſtate, Churches, Inſtitutions to be of Chriſt,</hi> but there's now no ſuch thing; for you want ſome of the principal Officers that were in the Churches, viz. <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts,</hi> Eph. 4.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Officers mentioned, were of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, is readily yielded: that ſuch are not, now in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47212:72"/>
any of the Churches of Chriſt, is alſo granted: but that a <hi>ceſſation</hi> of Churches doth not hereupon enſue, is very eaſily demonſtrated. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then there hath been a <hi>ceſſation</hi> of Churches for above a thouſand, and ſome hundred of years; yea, ever ſince the Apoſtles dayes: for, after thoſe particular perſons inveſted by Chriſt into the Offices, and Miniſtry before-mentioned, none ſuch have ſtood up. Now 'tis the firſt-born of abſurdities, that Chriſt ſhould with ſuch ſolemnity, as he did by the pouring forth of the Spirit in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> ſet up a Miniſtration (wherein alſo he ſpent <hi>forty dayes</hi> after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to inſtruct his Diſciples) and ſhould in a few ſcores of Years, ſuffer it to be taken down again. And it cannot be ſuppoſed, to conſiſt with the Wiſdom of Chriſt, ſo to do: it's alſo perfectly inconſiſtent, with the <hi>Goſpel-covenant, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory Offices of Chriſt, and ſignal promiſes made to his Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>—(of which we have already diſtinctly treated).</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Twas never the intendment of Chriſt, that ſuch Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould be continued in the Churches. Which is evident, as if written with the beams of the Sun, from theſe few conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. If he had indeed intended their <hi>continuation,</hi> they ſhould have been continued: for 'twill not 'tis preſumed, be aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Chriſt failes of his intendment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are no intimations given in the Scripture of any Succeſſion of ſuch Officers; nor any rules laid down for the Churches to proceed upon in their Election. Of Paſtors, Teachers, Deacons, we have an account, and directions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for their ſetting apart to Office; but of Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangeliſts, <hi>ne gry quidem,</hi> not the leaſt ſyllable, or Iota, touching their <hi>continuation,</hi> or the way to be uſed in order thereunto. Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the firſt-Churches were planted, we find by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apoſtles, Teachers and Deacons choſen to Office, but no choice made of new Apoſtles; nor any intimation given, that more than theſe were neceſſary, or expedient for the continuance, or preſervation of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When Chriſt writes to the <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47212:73"/>
blames them (moſt of them) for ſeveral things amiſs amongſt them; but charges them not, with any neglect, or ſin, that they had not the Officers mentioned amongſt them; which yet they had not. For Apoſtles, 'tis certain, they had none; of them only <hi>John</hi> was alive at that day, the reſt were fallen aſleep; and he was not with them, but in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos:</hi> Chriſt owns them as his Churches notwithſtanding. 'Tis true, he threatens ſome of them to <hi>un-church</hi> them; but not becauſe they wanted theſe Officers, but for other reaſons mentioned by him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We have an almoſt expreſſe Declaration, that after the Apoſtles fell aſleep, there were to be no more Apoſtles to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. <hi>For I think God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt:</hi> So we render it, but not ſo fully expreſſive of the Greek; which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—<hi>For I think,</hi> (or I conclude, for the word doth not alwayes ſignifie a doubtful opinion, but a certain concluſion, 'tis us'd in the determination of that famous Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28.) <hi>that God hath ſet forth, or exhibited us, the laſt Apoſtles.</hi> So the Arabick, Syriack, V.L. <hi>God hath ſhewed us the laſt Apoſtles. God hath deſigned his laſt Apoſtles,</hi> ſo the Aethiopick. So then evidently, no new Apoſtles were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Chriſt after them. 'Tis true, many have pretended ſo to be; ſome ſuch (as it ſeems) came to the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who upon trial <hi>found them Liaers,</hi> Rev. 2.2. But</p>
               <p n="6">6. The whole weight of the Objection lies upon this ſingle baſis, That the Eſſence of a true Church of Chriſt, conſiſts in having the Officers mentioned amongſt them. For if it doth not, the Churches are as really true Churches of Chriſt, without theſe Officers, as the firſt Apoſtolick-Churches, that had them, were. This is that then we ſhall demonſtrate, that <hi>Apoſtles</hi> — are not of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a true Church of Chriſt. For</p>
               <p n="1">I. There was a true Church of Chriſt of Converted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, before they ever ſaw the face of an Apoſtle, even in the Apoſtles days. Not to mention what's probable, that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> being brought over to the Faith of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. went in to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> Preached Chriſt, gathered Churches
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47212:73"/>
there. In which, ſome think that <hi>Propheſie</hi> had its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 68.31. nor, what ſome affirm, that the Goſpel was Preached, Churches gathered here in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea.</hi> What may we think of the Church at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi>? Was that a true Church? the Apoſtles own'd it as ſuch. And 'tis evident, that 'twas conſtituted without the Officers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Act.</hi> 11.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26. and here the Diſciples were firſt called Chriſtians. 'Tis true, there came <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> to them; but they were, before their coming, a Church of Chriſt. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where by the Miniſtry of <hi>Phillip,</hi> were Converts brought over to Chriſt, and <hi>Baptized,</hi> before ever the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> heard tittle of it; who at this time kept privately at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 8.1, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14. That by the ſame hand, Churches were planted at <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Caeſarea, Act.</hi> 8.40. with 9.30. is more than probable. At <hi>Ptolemais</hi> you have an intimation of a Church of Chriſt; but no account of any <hi>Apoſtles</hi> going thither, till <hi>Paul</hi> in his journey ſalutes the Brethren that were there, and tarries with them one day, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.7. The Church at <hi>Coloſſe</hi> was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Epaphras, Col.</hi> 1.7. as were ſeveral Churches, before ever any <hi>Apoſtle</hi> came to them. So that, if becauſe they have not <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the preſent Churches are no Churches of Chriſt; neither were the Primitive-Churches, at leaſt ſome of them, ſuch: The Objection lies as directly againſt them, as any after-Churches. But</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are neither Foundation, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Form of the Church; ſo far are they from being of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Foundation</hi> they are not; for Chriſt is the alone Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as hath been proved. 'Tis true, Saints are ſaid to be <hi>built upon the Foundations of the Apoſtles, and Prophets,</hi> Eph. 2.20. but the intendment thereof, is no more than that, <hi>they were built</hi> upon the Doctrine was Preacht by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; the ſubſtance whereof was Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not the <hi>Matter,</hi> as Apoſtles: as Saints 'tis true, they were ſo, as well as others; but no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Form</hi> of the Church they are not: for that lies in ſomewhat elſe, as before was Demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:47212:74"/>III. Let's ſuppoſe, that, which may be ſuppoſed. (It hath been, as is known) that by the Providence of God, the meaneſt Saint is caſt upon any ſpot, where the Goſpel never was. He preaches Chriſt to the Natives, they are Converted by the Spirit of the LORD accompanying his Miniſtry: may theſe Converts give up themſelves to the Lord, and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to walk with him in ways of his own Inſtitution, or not? If the firſt, <hi>actum eſt periiſti Antichriſtiane,</hi> there may be true Churches, without <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; for herein lie's the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a true Church: If the Second, it's lawful, then it ſeems, for believers to diſobey the Commands of Chriſt (which will at leaſt ſound harſh in the ears of ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) for <hi>Goſpel-fellowſhip, Churches</hi> — we have proved to be commanded by Chriſt. Nay</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Apoſtles, quâ Apoſtles,</hi> never belong'd to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. Authority in the name of Chriſt they had in, and amongſt them all; never related to any particular Church, as ſuch. They were non-reſidents, <hi>ubiquitaries,</hi> and the Office whereunto they were called by the Lord Jeſus, required, that they ſhould be ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19.</p>
               <p n="5">V. What the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were to the <hi>Goſpel-Churches,</hi> that (at leaſt) <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> may be ſuppoſed to be in the <hi>Judaick Church.</hi> The Law came by <hi>Moſes.</hi> In every difficult Caſe, he was their Mediator to God, and gave reſponſes to them: from him <hi>Aaron</hi> had his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> whereby he gave (in matters propoſed to him) infallible anſwers from the <hi>Holy One.</hi> They had alſo the <hi>Ark,</hi> with the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and <hi>Cherubims.</hi> The <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi>: the Majeſty or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Preſence (viz.</hi> the Oracle in the moſt Holy Place, where God dwelt <hi>between the Cherubims.</hi> Num. 7.89. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 80.2.) the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> (viz. the <hi>Spirit of Propheſie,</hi> not only in the Prieſts, but in the Prophets) were theſe of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Church? was their <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> diſſolved becauſe of their want of them? What more frivolous can be aſſerted? <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſoon fell aſleep, before they came into the good Land. As for the laſt mentioned, they enjoyed them not under the ſecond Temple (as the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge); yet their <hi>Church-ſtate continued</hi> till the death
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47212:74"/>
of Chriſt, as is granted by all. 'Tis impoſſible to fix upon any Argument to prove the neceſſity of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> for the <hi>continuation of a Church-ſtate in Goſpel-dayes,</hi> which will not alſo evince a neceſſity of what we have inſtanced in, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the neceſſity of the exiſtence of <hi>Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> for the <hi>continuation of the Judaick Church-ſtate</hi>; than which nothing is more falſe. Beſides</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Church was never <hi>Built</hi> upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (one or other of them) but upon their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which from the Lord Jeſus they delivered; or rather upon Chriſt the ſum, and ſubſtance thereof. 'Tis true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us (as hath been intimated) that 'twas <hi>Built</hi> upon <hi>Peter,</hi> from, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. upon which they have laboured to build their <hi>Babel,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſubſtitute the <hi>Pope</hi> in his room. The vanity of which attempt, hath been diſcovered by ſeveral, and by none more than the every-way learned, and accompliſhed <hi>J.O.</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> But as was ſaid, 'twas their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not their <hi>Perſons</hi> the Church was <hi>Built</hi> upon. This through the wonderful kindneſs of God, we have continued to us; and therefore no need of their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Miniſtry. Yet,</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Suppoſe we had <hi>Apoſtles</hi> amongſt us, the ſelf-ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles that were ſent forth, and inſtructed by Chriſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrinate the Saints in his will, to charge them to <hi>Obſerve whatever he had commanded them.</hi> They would declare to us the ſame things, or they would not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the ſame, they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record in the Scriptures of truth; and are as much to be heeded by us, as if they had been delivered to us by them <hi>Vivâ voce.</hi> The latter cannot be imagined. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath for ever ſhut the door againſt any ſuch conceit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed</hi>—. So that evidently the want of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> is the moſt weak, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous argument, that ever men of the leaſt reaſon, or converſe with the Scripture, or knowledge of that faith that ought to be with us in theſe matters, ever fixt upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But there was an Apoſtaſie foretold by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Lord, which we find actually came to paſs within a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47212:75"/>
few hundreds of years after Chriſt. Therefore there are no true Churches; for the Apoſtaſie hath covered, ſwallowed up all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That an Apoſtaſie was foretold, as intimated, that it was alſo introduced, is granted. But this proves not, the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Churches, Ordinances. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis expreſly declared, that the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> mentioned, ſhould not be a total Apoſtaſie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not all, but ſome ſhall depart, or make a revolt <hi>from the Faith.</hi> I confeſs had the Scripture aſſerted a univerſal <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> the objection would have ſeem'd, to have had ſome ſtrength in it. I ſay 'twould have ſeem'd, for real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it hath none. For had the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> as is falſly pretended, over-ſpread all for a ſeaſon (as ſometimes it did in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of old, as was demonſtrated in the preface to this diſcourſe); yet it follows not, but in perſons (by the call of God) delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from under that <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> a true Church-ſtate might exiſt. Which is notoriouſly true, with reſpect to thouſands, that for ſome while the Papacy drank in. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have already proved [<hi>Demonſtrat.</hi> 4. c. 4.] that all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> the Lord had his <hi>true Churches</hi> witneſſing for him againſt it. So that we need not ſay more touching this matter. There was an <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> foretold, that ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread the greateſt part of the Churches, prevail in moſt places of the Chriſtian World. It did ſo to purpoſe at <hi>Rome</hi>— &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there are no true Churches, <hi>riſum teneatis amici,</hi> or rather pity; pray for them, who by reaſon of prejudice, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, have their underſtanding ſo far blinded, as to think there's any weight to be laid upon ſuch <hi>Puerile Ludicrous</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But you have no <hi>Wiſe-maſter-builder</hi>; which the Apoſtle ſaith he was, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. therefore you have no true Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection is the ſame with the firſt. To it we will nevertheleſs ſpeak a few words, which will abundantly evince the emptyneſs of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts himſelf to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Chief-Bulder,</hi> not with reſpect to Chriſt; for ſo he was not, but an under-work-man; but with reſpect to others, who afterwards built upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47212:75"/>
that <hi>Foundation</hi> [CHRIST] he had laid. Nor doth he</p>
               <p n="2">2. Aſſert himſelf to be the <hi>Chief-builder,</hi> with relation to all the Churches; but with reſpect to that particular Church at <hi>Corinth.</hi> Were all the reſt of the Churches, that had not this <hi>Maſter-Builder,</hi> falſe Churches? This will not be aſſerted. Yet we hear of no <hi>Wiſe-maſter-builder,</hi> with reſpect to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Churches. The word is only uſed here. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paul,</hi> as wiſe a <hi>Maſter-builder</hi> as he was, was ſure a Work-man under Chriſt; who is the Builder of the Houſe, or Churches (as hath been proved) and he was indiſpenſibly bound to walk by rule; the rule of his Lord and Maſter, Chriſt Jeſus. This he tells us he did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. Now</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints have this <hi>Rule,</hi> and they have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> with them, in them, to open it, and explain it to them. For if they have him not, and for this end (to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth) they are not Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. what hinders then, but that Saints having the ſame <hi>Rule</hi> the Apoſtle walked by, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to inſtruct them in it, they may <hi>conform</hi> to it, and ſo conſtitute Churches of Chriſt? If they have but ſo much <hi>Wiſdom</hi> as to underſtand the rule conſtitutive of Churches; and ſo much Conſcience and honeſty, as to apply themſelves to it (and they are poor Saints that are devoid of the one or the other) they cannot but do ſo. The very truth is, <hi>Paul,</hi> none of the Apoſtles were <hi>Builders,</hi> or <hi>Wiſe-maſter-builders,</hi> but with reſpect to the <hi>Rule</hi> of Chriſt: To have <hi>Built</hi> in their own <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> with a neglect thereof, had been folly and madneſs. So that any that attend to this <hi>Rule</hi> in Church-Work, may be as well ſaid to be <hi>Builders</hi>; and if they lay the <hi>Foundation</hi> of a Church afterward built upon by others, as truely ſaid with reſpect to ſuch a Church to be <hi>Wiſe-maſter-builders,</hi> as <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi> 'Twould hardly be an effectual argument to a man under the ſenſe of inconveniencies (almoſt to ſtarving to death) by winds, and ſtormes, for want of an habitation to dwell in; to tell him, 'tis true, here are <hi>Materials</hi> for a Houſe, and here is a <hi>Rule</hi> to build it by; which if you attend to, you cannot build amiſs, but the Truth is, the <hi>Wiſe-maſter-builder,</hi> who acted by the ſame <hi>Rule</hi> in building all the ſtrong, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Houſes in the Country, is thouſands of miles off, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47212:76"/>
perhaps may not come hither again till you are dead, and rotten in your grave; therefore you had beſt not attempt the work, till he come. Nay ſtay, will the poor man ſay, I have the <hi>Rule</hi> that he walked by, and I'le up, and be doing as well as I can; and I hope the Lord will be with me—. Chriſt commands (as hath been proved) to build an Houſe; gives us rules to walk by in ſuch a work; but hath no where ſaid, he will ſend us ſuch <hi>Wiſe-maſter-builders</hi> in every reſpect as <hi>Paul</hi> was; nor told us the Work muſt ceaſe till they come; but the contrary.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis <hi>Grace,</hi> not extraordinary <hi>Gifts,</hi> that is the qualification of <hi>Church-members,</hi> that conſtitute a Church. When the Apoſtles ſpeak of Church-members, they decypher them as <hi>Sanctified ones,</hi> partakers of the <hi>Grace of God</hi>—. Chriſt requires no other qualification of a Church-member, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>born again of God, John</hi> 3.3, 5. which perſons may be without thoſe extraordinary <hi>Gifts.</hi> Nay, the truth is, the Churches that have moſt excelled in theſe, have not been the moſt comely, or beautiful Churches. For inſtance, the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> who perhaps in theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> excell'd other Churches; but I am ſure, came ſhort of ſome of them in Divine graces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis moſt evident, that the <hi>Primitive-Churches</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, converted, believers added to them, without any immediate participation of theſe gifts, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.40, 41, 42. We have an account of <hi>Three Thouſand Soules added to the Church,</hi> but not a tittle of their partaking of theſe extraordinary <hi>Gifts.</hi> The Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> was a true Church of Chriſt, before the Apoſtles (any of them) came to them, or they had received the Holy Spirit (<hi>i. e.</hi> were made partakers of the extraordinary <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi>) <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 14, 15, 16, 17. The like may be ſaid of other Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle having diſcourſed at large of theſe <hi>Gifts,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. at the cloſe, <hi>v.</hi> 31. tells them, that he ſhews unto them <hi>a more excellent way,</hi> (or <hi>the moſt excellent way,</hi> as the Greek reads it) <hi>viz.</hi> the way of love: of which he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at large, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. And this (not the <hi>Gifts</hi> mentioned) is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47212:76"/>
that which Chriſt makes the badge of his <hi>Diſciples, Joh.</hi> 13.35. Were there more of this, there would not be ſo much talk of the nullity of Churches, as there is amongſt ſome at this day; nor that undue withdrawment from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> are ſo far from being eſſential to a Church; that the Apoſtle tells us, perſons may have them all, and yet not be fit matter for a Church: for they that have them, may nevertheleſs be nothing, devoid of true grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But the Churches have only the <hi>Form</hi> of things, and deny the <hi>Power</hi>; and from ſuch we are commanded to turn away, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I muſt crave leave, to ſay, that the framers of this Objection, are aſcended not only to the height of cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious uncharitableneſs; but invade the Throne of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and will become Judges of the ſecrets of hearts. For, who told them that they deny the <hi>Power</hi>? did any of the <hi>Churches</hi> themſelves? Do any principles <hi>owned</hi> by them, any practices <hi>found</hi> amongſt them declare as much? Let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals hereof [<hi>Guilty</hi>] plead for themſelves, I'le not be their advocate. Though I muſt add, I know no ſuch Churches, and yet they are not a few I am acquainted with.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It had been ſevere enough for the Objectors to have, that <hi>They</hi> have the <hi>Form,</hi> but not the <hi>Power</hi>; therefore are not true Churches. But this perhaps they thought would not have ſerved their purpoſe. Inaſmuch as the Lord himſelf ſaith concerning the Church of <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Thou haſt a Name to live, and art dead</hi>; and of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> v. 15. <hi>Thou art neither cold, nor hot,</hi> v. 17. <hi>Wretched, Poor, Miſerable, Blind, Naked:</hi> yet even theſe are owned by Chriſt for his Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1, 14.</p>

If the gathering together of Saints call'd out of the world, as Volunteers giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to JESUS CHRIST, and one another, to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Goſpel-fellowſhip,</hi> be a gathering in the will of man; 'tis true, they are ſo gather'd. But the beſt on't is, we have good company under the ſame Condemnation, even all the <hi>primitive-churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Oh! but you were not gathered by <hi>Apoſtles</hi>!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Oh! but this hath been already ſpoken to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way: ſeveral of the firſt Churches we have proved, were not gathered by the <hi>Apoſtles; Ergo,</hi> they alſo were <hi>gathered</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> were not true Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. But there's no <hi>Preſence</hi> among the Churches: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no true Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Should it be granted, that there's no <hi>preſence,</hi> yet
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47212:77"/>
from thence it doth not follow that they are not true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For the <hi>glory</hi> was departed from the <hi>Temple,</hi> Ezek. 3.12 <hi>the bleſſed glory of the Lord is gone from his place,</hi> and yet the Temple was ſtanding. In the ſecond Temple, there was not the <hi>Schecinah,</hi> or divine <hi>preſence</hi>; yet the <hi>Judaick Church-ſtate,</hi> not diſſolved till many years after. The <hi>houſe</hi> may ſtand, and be a <hi>true houſe</hi> as much as 'twas before, tho the maſter be gone out of it; perhaps he hath a ſpecial end for the good of the <hi>Houſe, Servants, Children,</hi> for a ſeaſon to leave it. God may have bleſſed deſigns towards his Churches in his tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leaving them, yet true Churches. I'd ask, doth not the Lord ſometimes withdraw his <hi>preſence</hi> from particular Saints? What Child of God, but at one time, or other, finds cauſe to complain of his <hi>departure</hi> from him? He ſeeks him, yet cannot <hi>find</hi> him. Doth this deſtroy his Saint-ſhip? Who'l af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it? Well then, the <hi>with-drawment</hi> of God from Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is no Argument they are <hi>none</hi> of his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be there may be ſome miſtake in this matter, and God is onely ſuppos'd to be a great <hi>way off,</hi> when he is <hi>near. Mary</hi> laments for the abſence of her Lord, when yet he ſtood by her, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.15, 16. It's neceſſary we enquire a little touching the <hi>preſence</hi> of God with a People. He is ſaid to be <hi>preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>being,</hi> ſo he is <hi>preſent</hi> with All; indiſtant to none. He fills Heaven and Earth; all things with his Preſence, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of <hi>providential</hi> diſpenſations, preſerving, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a People, giving them the Victory over their Enemies. In this ſence, through wondrous riches of Grace, the Lord is yet <hi>preſent</hi> with his Churches; the Plots, Confederacies, Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Children of Men againſt them, have hitherto been in-ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of ſenſible manifeſtations of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> in the way of the <hi>new-Covenant</hi> to them; <hi>quickning,</hi> cauſeing their <hi>graces</hi> to flouriſh; <hi>renewing, ſtrengthning, comforting</hi> them. Now though 'tis true, (and touching it, deep ſearchings of heart ſhould be upon us, and mournings after the Lord) that there is not in this ſenſe, ſuch a <hi>preſence</hi> of the Lord as hath
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47212:78"/>
been formerly; yet we muſt ſay, to the praiſe of matchleſs-<hi>grace,</hi> we are not wholly <hi>deſtitute</hi> of it; and are crying, as we can, <hi>Let our Beloved come into his Garden, that the Spices thereof may ſend forth their odoriferous ſmell.</hi> Yet who'l de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe a day of ſmall things? 'Tis a mercy, for a rebellious beggar, to have a crum, a drop, of the bread, waters of Life. And were we more thankful for, did we prize, improve as becomes us, that little God gives us, we might have more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In reſpect of his real, actual <hi>preſence</hi> in <hi>the new-Covenant,</hi> though not ſenſible manifeſtations of it. Thus God is <hi>preſent</hi> with us, (though we complain of his abſence) when he ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens us to wait on, for him, in the ways of his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; enables us to ſeek to him. For without his <hi>preſence,</hi> we were not able to do that. Thus (through <hi>grace</hi>) he is <hi>preſent</hi> with his <hi>Churches,</hi> and every <hi>member</hi> of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is not Prayer, <hi>Prayer,</hi> becauſe we have not his ſenſible <hi>preſence</hi> with us? who'l affirm it? Is it lawful to omit that <hi>Duty,</hi> in our Cloſets, retirements; becauſe we enjoy not God in it? Who dare aver it? This were an Effectual, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious way, to drive Chriſtianity, all Religion, Devotion, out of the World. What though there be not a ſenſible <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of God in <hi>Churches, Inſtitutions</hi> —<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There he hath promiſed to meet his people, and bleſs them; and there it's our duty to wait for the returnal of his <hi>Preſence,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> Thus far in Anſwer to Objections: Which are all I have met with. And in the whole, have been with PRAYER and SUPPLICATION, following the Lord for leadings; have not willingly reflected upon, or uſed exaſperating Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning any; nor deſignedly pleaded the cauſe of any PARTICULAR PARTY, but the general concern of all the Saints, who look upon their ſubjection to Chriſt in <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Inſtitutions</hi> any part of their concern. In ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity (though with much weakneſs) have I been managing this affair; and becauſe I believe, that the truth of the Lord is herein with me, therefore have I ſpoken. If any may be profited, let God have the Glory; If any be otherwiſe minded, I pray God will manifeſt this alſo unto him in due <hi>time.</hi>
