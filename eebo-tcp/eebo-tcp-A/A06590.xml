            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Seing then that in euery counterfaite as well the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish as the bewtie is coloured: I hope I shal not incur the displeasure of the wise, in that in the discourse of Euphues I haue aswel touched the vanities of his loue, as the vertues of his lyfe. The Persians who aboue all their Kings most honored Cyrus, caused him to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen aswel with his hoked nose, as his high forehead. He that loued Homer best concealed not his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Surgion that maketh the Anato<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>my sheweth aswel the muscles in the heele, as the vaines of the hart. If then the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st sight of Euphues, shal seeme to light to be read of the wise, or to foolish to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the learned, they ought not to impute it to the iniquitie of the author, but to the necessitie of the histo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry. Euphues beginneth with loue as allured by wyt, but endeth not with lust as bereft of wisedome. He wooeth women prouoked by youth, but weddeth not himselfe to wantonnesse as pricked by pleasure. I haue set down the follies of his wit without breach of modestie, &amp; the sparks of his wisedome without suspicion of dishone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. And certes I thinke ther be mo speaches which for grauitie wil mislyke the foolish, then vnsemely termes which for vanitie may offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the wise. Which discourse (right Honorable) I hope you wil the rather pardon for the rudenes in that it is the first, &amp; protect it the more willingly if it offend in that it shalbe the laste. It may be that fine wits wil descant vpon him, that hauing no wit goeth about to make the Anatomy of wit: And cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teinly their iesting in my mynd is tollerable. For if the butcher should take vpon him to cut the Anatomy of a man, bicause he hath skil in opening an Oxe, he would proue himself a Calfe: or if the Horselech would adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to minister a Potion to a sick patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in that he hath knowledge to giue a drench to a diseased Horse, he would make himselfe an Asse. The Shomaker must not go aboue his latchet, nor the hedger meddle with anye thing but his bill. It is vnsemely for the Paynter to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a shaft, or the Fletcher to handle the pensill. All which thinges make most against me, in that a foole

Howsoeuer the case standeth I looke for no prayse for my labour, but pardon for my good will: it is the greatest rewarde that I dare aske, and the least that they can offer. I desire no more, I deserue no lesse. Though the stile nothing delight the dayntie eare of the curious sifter, yet wil the matter recreate the minde of the courteous Reader. The varietie of the one wil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the harshnes of the other. Thinges of greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, are sette foorth with least price. When the Wyne is neete there needeth no Iuie-bush. The right Coral nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no colouring. Where the matter it selfe bringeth credit, the man with his glose winneth smal commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It it therfore me thinketh a greater show of a preg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant wit, then perfect wisedome in a thing of sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t excellencie, to vse superfluous eloquence. We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly see that a black ground doth best beseme a white coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. And Venus according to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Mars, was then most amyable, when she sate close by Vulca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. If these thinges be true which experience tryeth, that a naked tale doth most truely set foorth the naked truth, that where the countenaunce is faire, ther neede no colours, that paynting is meter for ragged walls the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fine Marble, that veritie then shineth most b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a world to see how English men desire to heare finer speach then the language will allow, to eate finer bread then is made of Wheat, to weare finer cloth then is wrought of Woll.

               </gap>ie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether I might send this my Pamphlet to the Printer or to the ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. I thought it to bad for the presse, &amp; to good for the packe. But seing my folly in writing to be as great as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I was willing my fortune should be as ill as any mans. We commonly see the booke that at Christmas lyeth bound on the Stacioners stall, at Easter to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Haberdasshers shop, which sith it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of proceding, I am content this winter to haue my doings read for a toye, that in sommer they may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for trash. It is not straunge when as the greatest wonder lasteth but nyne dayes: That a newe worke should not endure but three monethes. Gentlemen vse bookes, as gentlewomen handle theyr slowres, who in the morning sticke them in their heads, and at night strawe them at their heeles. Cheries be fulsome when they be through rype, bicause they be ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, &amp; bookes be stale when they be printed, in that they be common. In my mynde Printers and Taylors are bound chiefely to pray for Gentlemen, the one hath so many fantasies to print, the other such diuers fashions to make, that the pressing yron of the one is neuer out of the syre, nor the printing presse of the other any tyme lyeth still. But a fashion is but a dayes wearing, and a booke but an howres reading, which seeing it is so, I am of a sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers mynde, who careth not so the shooe hold the plucking on, and I, so my labours last the running ouer. He that commeth in print bicause he would be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, is lyke the foole that commeth into the market bicause he would be seene. I am not he that seeketh prayse for his labour, but pardon for his offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, neither doe I set this foorth for any deuotion in print, but for
<pb facs="tcp:5900:5"/>
dutie whith I owe to my Patrone. If one write neuer so well, he cannot please all, and write he neuer so ill hee shall please some. Fine heads will pick a quarrell with me if all be not curious, and flatterers a thanke, if any thing be currant. But this is my mynde, let him that fyndeth fault amende it, and him that liketh it, vse it. Enuie braggeth but draweth no bloud, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious haue more mynde to quippe, then might to cut. I submit my selfe to the iudgement of the wise, and I little esteme the censure of fooles. The one will be satisfyed with reason, the other are to be aunswered with sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. I know gentlemen wil fynde no fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, and beare with those that deserue blame, as for others I care not for their iestes, for I neuer ment to make them my Iudges.</p>

Neyther is that geason, séeing for the most parte it is proper to all those of sharpe capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie to estéeme of themselues, as most proper: if one bée harde in conceiuing, they pronounce him a dowlte, if

               <hi>Euphues</hi> thoughe hée knewe himselfe worthy eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to haue a good countenaunce, yet coulde hée not perceiue hir willinge any way to lende hym a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looke. At the last supper béeing readye to come in, <hi>Philautus</hi> sayde vnto hir: Gentlewoman I was the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5900:15"/>
bolder to bringe my shadowe with mée, (meaning <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phues</hi>) knowing that he should be the better welcome for my sake, vnto whome the gentilwoman replyed: Syr as I neuer when I sawe you thought that you came without your shadow, so now I cannot a lyttle meruaile to sée you so ouershot in bringing a new sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you. <hi>Euphues</hi> though he perceiued hir coy nippe, séemed not to care for it, but taking hir by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand sayd.</p>
            <p>Fayre Lady seing the shade doth often shilde your beautie from the parching Sunne, I hope you will the better estéeme of the shadowe, and by so much the lesse it ought to be offenciue, by how much the lesse it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to offende you, and by so much the more you ought to lyke it, by how much the more you vse to lye in it.</p>
            <p>Well gentleman aunswered <hi>Lucilla</hi> in arguing of the shadowe, we forgoe the substance: pleaseth it you therefore to sit downe to supper. And so they all sate downe, but <hi>Euphues</hi> fed of one dish which euer stoode before him, the beautie of <hi>Lucilla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Héere <hi>Euphues</hi> at the firste sight was so kyndled with desyre, that almost he was lyke to burn to coales. Supper being ended, the order was in <hi>Naples</hi> that the gentlewomen would desire to heare some discourse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning loue or learning: And although <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lautus</hi> was requested, yet he posted it ouer to <hi>Euphues,</hi> whome he knew most fit for that purpose: <hi>Euphues</hi> being thus tyed to the stake by their importunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie, began as followeth.</p>
            <p>He that worst may is alwaye enforced to holde the candell, the weakest must still to the wall, where none will, the Diuell himselfe must beare the crosse: But were it not gentlewomen that your lyste standes for lawe, I would borrow so muche leaue as to resigne myne office to one of you, whose experience in loue hath made you learned, and whose learning hath made you
<pb facs="tcp:5900:16"/>
so louely: for me to entreate of the one being a nouise, or to discourse of the other being a trewant, I may wel make you weary but neuer the wyser, and giue you oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion rather to laugh at my rashnesse, then to lyke my reasons. Yet I care the lesse to excuse my boldnesse to you, who were the cause of my blyndenesse. And since I am at myne owne choyce eyther to talke of loue or of learning, I had rather for this tyme be déemed an vnthrift in reiecting profit, then a <hi>Stoicke</hi> in renouncing pleasure.</p>
            <p>It hath bene a question often disputed, but neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, whether the qualities of the mynde, or the composition of the man, cause women most to lyke, or whether beautie or witte moue men most to loue. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes by how much the more the mynde is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the body, by so much the more the graces of the one are to be preferred before the gifts of the other, which if it be so, that the contemplation of the inwarde qualitie ought to be respected more, then the view of the outward beautie, then doubtlesse women eyther doe or should loue those best whose vertue is best, not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring the deformed man with the reformed mynde. The foule Toade hathe a fayre stoane in his head, the fine goulde is founde in the filthy earth, the swéete ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell lyeth in the hard shell. Uertue is harbored in the heart of him that most men estéeme misshapen, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise if we respect more the outward shape, then the inwarde habit, good God into how many mischiefes doe we fall? into what blyndenesse are we ledde? Doe we not commonly sée that in paynted pottes is hidden the deadlyest poyson? that in the gréenest grasse is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Serpent? in the cléerest water the vglyest Toade? Doth not experience teach vs that in the most curious Sepu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Estridge carryeth fayre fethers, but rancke flesh? How franticke are those louers which are carryed away with the gaye glistering of the fine face? the beautie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is parched with the Sommers blase, &amp; chipped with the winters blast, which is of so short continuance that it fadeth before one perceiue it florishe, of so small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that it poysoneth those that possesse it, of so little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with the wyse, that they accompt it a delicate bayte with a deadly hooke, a sweete <hi>Panther</hi> with a deuouring paunch, a sower poyson in a siluer potte. Here I colde enter into discourse of such fyne dames as being in loue with theyr owne lookes, make suche course accompt of theyr passionate louers: for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly if they be adorned with beautie, they be so straight laced, and made so high in the insteppe, that they disdaine them most that most desyre them. It is a worlde to sée the doating of theyr louers, and theyr dealing with them, the reuealing of whose subtil traines would cause me to shead teares, &amp; you gentlewomen to shut your modest eares. Pardon me gentlewomen if I vnfold euery wyle, &amp; shew euery wrinckle of womens disposition. Two thinges do they cause their seruants to vow vnto them, secrecie, &amp; soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one to conceale their entising sleights, by the other to assure themselues of their onely seruice. Again, but ho there, if I shold haue waded any further &amp; sown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the depth of their deceipt, I should either haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured your displeasure, or incurred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> suspition of frawd, eyther armed you to practise the like subteltie, or accused my self of periury. But I mean not to offend your chast mynds, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the rehersal of their vnchast manners, whose eares I perceiue to glowe, and heartes to be gréeued at that which I haue already vttered, not that amongest you there be any such, but that in your sexe ther should be any such. Let not ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore make to much of their paynted sheathe, lette them not be so curyous
<pb facs="tcp:5900:17"/>
in theyr owne conceite, or so currishe to theyr loyall lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. When the blacke crowes foote shall appeare in theyr eye, or the blacke Oxe treade on their foote, when their beautie shall be lyke the blasted Rose, theyr wealth wasted, their bodies worne, theyr faces wrinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, their fyngers crooked, who will lyke of them in their age, who loued none in their youth? If you will be cherished when you be olde, be curteous while you be young, if you looke for comfort in your hoary haires, be not coye when you haue your golden lockes, if you would be embraced in the wayning of your brauery, be not squeymish in the waxing of your beautie, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre to be kept lyke the Roses when they haue loste theyr coulour, smell swéete as the Rose doth in the bud, if you would be tasted for olde wyne, be in the mouth a pleasant Grape, so shall you be cherished for your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, comforted for your honestie, embraced for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, so shall you be preserued with the swéete Rose, and droncke with the pleasant wyne. Thus farre I am bolde gentlewomen, to counsell those that be coye that they weaue not the webbe of theyr owne woe, nor spin the thréed of their owne thraldome by their owne ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwartnesse. And seing we are euen in the bowells of loue, it shall not be amisse to examine whether man or woman be sonest allured, whether be most constant the male or the female. And in this poynt I meane not to be myne owne caruer, least I should séeme eyther to picke a thanke with men or a quarrel with women. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might stande with your pleasure (Mistres <hi>Lucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>) to giue your censure I would take the contrary, for sure I am though your iudgement be sounde, yet affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will shadow it.</p>

            <p>¶Mistres <hi>Lucilla,</hi> if you speake as you thincke, these gentlewomen present haue lyttle cause to thanke you, if you cause me to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend women, my tale wil be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a méere tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to the matter.</p>
            <p>Touching the yelding to loue, albeit theyr hartes séeme tender, yet they harden them lyke the stone of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> the which the more it is beaten, the harder it is, for being framed as it were of the perfection of men, they be frée from all such cogitations as may any way prouoke them to vncleanenesse, insomuch as they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the light loue of youth which is grounded vpon lust, &amp; dissolued vpon euery light occasion. When they sée the folly of men turne to fury, their delight to doting, theyr affection to frensie, when they sée them as it were pyne in pleasure, and to waxe pale through theyr owne péeuishnesse, their sutes, their seruice, theyr letters, theyr labors, their loues, theyr lyues, seeme to them so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they harden theyr hartes against such concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,
<pb facs="tcp:5900:18"/>
to the ende they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert them from rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to reason, from such lewde disposition, to honest discretion: hereoff it commeth that men accuse women of crueltie, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cause they themselues want ciuilitie, they accompt them full of wyles in not yelding to their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, faythlesse for resisting their fylthinesse. But I had almost forgot my selfe, you shall pardon mée Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse <hi>Lucilla</hi> for this time, if this abruptly, I finish my discourse, it is neyther for want of good wil, or lacke of proofe, but that I feele in my selfe such alteration, that I can scarcely vtter one word, ah <hi>Eupheus, Euphues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The gentlewomen were strooke into such a quanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with this sodayne chaunge, that they all chaunged coulour. But <hi>Euphues</hi> taking <hi>Philautus</hi> by the hande and giuing the gentlewomen thanckes for their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and his repast, badde them all fare-well, and went immediatly to his chamber. But <hi>Lucilla</hi> who now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to frie in the flames of loue, all the company bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing departed to their lodgings, entred into these termes and contrarieties.</p>

Why <hi>Euphues</hi> doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes desyre my loue, but <hi>Philautus</hi> hath deserued it. Why <hi>Euphues</hi> feature is worthy as good as I, But

               <hi>Philautus</hi> his fayth is worthy a better. I but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loue is moste feruent. I but the firste ought to be most faythfull. I but <hi>Euphues</hi> hath greater perfection. I but <hi>Philautus</hi> hath déeper affection.</p>

Will he haue no doubt of thyne honour, when thou thy selfe callest thyne honestie in question? Yes, yes, <hi>Lucilla,</hi> well dothe he know that the glasse once crased will with the leaste clappe be cracked, that the cloath which staineth with Mylke, will soone loose his coulour with vineger, that the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles wynge will wast the fether as well of the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix,</hi> as of the Pheasant, that she that hath bene fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to one, will neuer be faythfull to any.

Ah well I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that loue is not vnlyke the Figge trée, whose fruite is swéete, whose roote is more bitter then the claw of a Bitter, or lyke the apple in <hi>Persia,</hi> whose blossome sauoreth lyke Honny, whose budde is more sower then gall.</p>
            <p>But O impietie. O broade blasphemy agaynst the heauens. Wilt thou be so impudent <hi>Euphues,</hi> to accuse the gods of iniquitie? No fonde foole, no. Neyther is it forbidden vs by the gods to loue, by whose diuine

prouidence we are permitted to lyue, neyther doe wée want remedyes to recure our maladyes, but reason to vse the meanes. But why goe I about to hinder the course of loue, with the discourse of law? hast thou not redde <hi>Eupheus,</hi> that he that loppeth the Uine causeth it to spreade fairer? that hee that stoppeth the streame forceth it to swell higher? that he that casteth water on the fire in the Smithes forge, maketh it to flame fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer? Euen so he that seeketh by counsayle to moderate his ouerlashinge affections, encreaseth his owne mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. Ah my <hi>Lucilla,</hi> wold thou wert either lesse faire or I more fortunate, eyther I wiser or thou milder, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woulde I were out of this madde moode, eyther I would we were both of one minde. But how should she be perswaded of my loyaltie, that yet had neuer one simple proofe of my loue? will shée not rather imagine me to be intangled with hir beautie, then with hir ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. That my fancie being so lewdly chayned at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first, will be as lyghtly changed at the last, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is nothing which is permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is violent? yes, yes, she must néeds coniecture so, although it be nothing so, for by how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more my affection co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> suddaine, by so much the lesse will she thinke it certeyne. The ratling thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolte hath but his clappe, the lyghteninge but his flash, and as they both come in a moment, so doe they both ende in a minute.</p>
            <p>I but <hi>Euphues,</hi> hath shée not hearde also that the drye touche woode is kindled with lyme, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mushrompe groweth in one night? y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fire quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burneth the flaxe? that loue easilye entreth into the sharpe witte without resistaunce, &amp; is harboured there without repentaunce?</p>
            <p>If therefore the Gods haue endewed hir with as much bountie as beautie. If she haue no lesse wit then she hath comelynesse, certes she will neyther

            <p>
               <hi>Philautus</hi> and <hi>Euphues</hi> repaired to the house of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardo,</hi> where they found Mistres <hi>Lucilla</hi> and <hi>Liuia</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with other gentlewomen neither béeing idle, nor well employed, but playing at cardes.

For as the Hoppe the poale béeing neuer so hye grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ende, or as the drye Béeche kindled at the roote, neuer leaueth vntill it come to the toppe, or as one droppe of poyson disperseth it selfe into euerye vaine, so affection hauinge caught holde of my hearte, and the sparkles of loue kindled my liuer, wyll so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinely, thoughe secretlye flame vp into my heade, and spreade it selfe into euerye sinewe.

But as the true golde is tryed by the touch, the pure flinte by the stroke of the yron, so the loyall heart of the faithfull louer, is knowen by the tryall of his Lady: of the which tryall (<hi>Lucilla</hi>) if you shall accompte <hi>Euphues</hi> worthy, assure your selfe, hée wyll bée as readie to offer himselfe a sacrifice for your swéet sake, as your selfe shall bée willinge to employe hym in your seruice. Neyther doth hee desire to bée trusted any way, vntill he shall be tried euery way, neither doth hée craue credite at the first, but a good countenaunce til time his desire shall be made manifest by hys desertes. Thus not blynded by lyght affection, but dazeled with your rare perfection, and boldened by your excéeding courtesie, I haue vnfolded mine entire loue, desiring

Doe you therefore thinke me easely entised to the bent of your bow, bicause I was easely entreated to lysten to your late discourse? Or séeing mée (as finely you glose) to excell all other in beautie, did you déeme that I would exceed all other in beastlynesse? But yet I am not angry <hi>

When the Foxe preacheth the Géese perishe. The Crocodile shrowdeth greatest treason vnder most pitifull teares: in a kissing mouth there lyeth a gallyng minde.

I did at the firste entraunce discerne thy loue but yet dissemble it. Thy wanton glaunces, thy scalding sighes, thy louing signes, caused me to blush for shame, and to looke wanne for feare, least they should be perceiued of any.

But alas it is both common and lamentable, to beholde simplicitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped by subtilytie, and those that haue most might, to be infected with most mallice. The Spider weaueth a fine webbe to hang the Fly, the Wolfe weareth a faire face to deuoure the Lambe, the Merlin striketh at the Partridge, the Eagle often snappeth at the Fly, men are alwayes laying baytes for women, which are the weaker vessells: but as yet I could neuer heare man by such snares to intrappe man: For true it is that men themseleus haue by vse obserued, that it must be a hard winter, when one Wolfe eateth an other. I haue read y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Bull being tyed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Figge trée loseth his strength, that the whole heard of Deare stande at the gaze, if they smell a swéete apple, that the <hi>Dolphin</hi> by the sound of Musicke is brought to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shore. And then no meruaile

it is that if the fierce Bull be tamed with the Figge tree, if that women beeing as weake as shéepe, be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with a Figge, if the wilde Deare be caughte with an apple, that the tame Damzell is wonne with a blossome, if the fleete <hi>Dolphin</hi> be allured with harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that women be entangled with the melodie of mens speach, fayre promises and solemne protestations. But follye it were for mée to marke their mischiefes, sith I am neyther able, neyther they willynge to amende their manners, it becommeth mée rather to shew what our sexe should doe, then to open what yours doth. And seeing I cannot by reason restrayne your importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sute, I will by rigour done on my selfe, cause you to refraine the meanes. I would to God <hi>Ferardo</hi> were in this poynte lyke to <hi>Lysander,</hi> which would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his daughters to weare gorgeous apparell, saying it would rather make them common then comely.

            </p>
            <p>Unto whome <hi>Euphues</hi> aunswered on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>If my tongue were able to vtter the ioyes that my heart hath conceiued, I feare me though I be wel beloued, yet I shoulde hardlye bée beléeued. Ah my <hi>Lucilla</hi> howe much am I bounde to thée, whiche preferrest mine vnworthinesse before thy Fathers wrath, my happinesse before thine owne misfortune, my loue before thine owne lyfe? howe might I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell thée in courtesie, whome no mortall creature can excéede in constancie? I finde it nowe for a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truth, which earst I accompted for a vaine talke, that the Purple dye will neuer staine, that the pure Cyuet will neuer loose his sauour, that the greene Laurell will neuer chaunge his coulour, that beautie can neuer bée blotted with discourtesie: As touching secrecie in this behalfe, assure thy selfe, that I wyll not so much as tell it to my selfe. Commaund <hi>Euphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> to runne, to ride, to vndertake any exploite be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so daungerous, to hazarde himselfe in any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, be it neuer so desperate: As they were thus plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauntly conferring the one with the other, <hi>Liuia</hi> (whom <hi>Euphues</hi> made his stale) entered into the parlor, vnto whom <hi>Lucilla</hi> spake in these termes.</p>
            <p>Dost thou not laugh <hi>Liuia</hi> to sée my ghostly father kéepe me héere so long at shrift? Truely (aunswered <hi>Liuia</hi>) me thinckes that you smile at some pleasaunt shift, either hée is slow in enquiring of your faultes, or you slack in aunswering of his questions, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supper time they al sat downe, <hi>Lucilla</hi> wel pleased,
<pb facs="tcp:5900:30"/>
no man better content then <hi>Euphues,</hi> who after hys repast hauing no apportunitie to conferre wyth his louer, had small lust to continue with the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman any longer, séeinge therefore hée coulde frame no meanes to woorke his delight, hée coyned an excuse to hasten his departure, promisinge the next morninge to trouble them againe as a guest more bolde then welcome, although in deed he thought himselfe to bee the better welcome in saying that hée would come.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Ferardo</hi> went in poste, so hée retourned in haste, hauinge concluded wyth <hi>Philautus,</hi> that the marriage shoulde immediatly bée consummated which wrought such a content in <hi>Philautus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was almost in an extasie through the extremitie of hys passions: such is the fulnesse and force of pleasure, that there is nothinge so daungerous as the fruity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet knowinge that delayes bringe daungers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe hée nothinge doubted of <hi>Lucilla,</hi> whome hée loued, yet feared hée the ficklenesse of olde men, which is alwayes to bée mistrusted. He vrged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ferardo</hi> to breake wyth his daughter who bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge willinge to haue the match made, was content incontiuently to procure the meanes: findinge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his daughter at leasure, and hauing knowledge of hir former loue, spake to hir as followeth.</p>
            <p>Deere daughter, as thou hast longe tyme lyued a mayden, so nowe thou must learne to bée a Mother, and as I haue bene carefull to bringe thée vpp a virgin, so am I nowe desirous to make thée a wyfe. Neyther ought I in this matter to vse any perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maydens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly now a daies are no sooner borne, but they begin to bride it: neither to offer any greate portions for that thou knowest thou shalt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite all my possessions.

heterto to match thée with such an one, as shoulde be of good wealth able to maynteine thée, of great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship able to compare with thee in birth, of honest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to deserue thy loue, and an <hi>Italian</hi> borne to enioye my landes. At the laste I haue founde one aunswerable to my desire, a gentleman of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes, of a noble progeuie, of honest behauiour, of comely personage, borne and brought vp in <hi>Naples, Philautus</hi> (thy friende as I gesse) thy husband <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla,</hi> if thou lyke it, neither canst thou dislike hym, who wanteth nothing that shoulde cause thy liking, neyther hath any thinge that shoulde breede thy loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And surely I reioyce the more, that thou shalt be linked to him in marriage, whome thou hast loued as I heare béeinge a mayden, neither can there any iarres kindle betwéene them, where the mindes be so vnited, neyther any ielowsie arise, where loue hathe so longe bene setled. Therefore <hi>Lucilla</hi> to the ende the desire of either of you may now be accomplished, to the delight of you both, I am here come to finishe the contract by giuinge handes, whiche you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy begun betwéen your selues by ioyning of hearts, that as God doth witnesse the one in your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, so the worlde maye testi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Reuerend Sir, the swéetnesse that I haue found in the vndefiled estate of virginitie, causeth me to loath the sower sauce which is mixed with matrimony, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quiet life which I haue tried being a maiden, maketh me to shun the cares y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are alwaies incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to a mother,

neither am I so wedded to the worlde that I should be moued wyth greate possessions, neyther so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with wantonnesse, that I should bee entised with any mans proportion, neither if I were so dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed woulde I bée so proude to desire one of noble progenie, or so precise to choose one onely in myne owne countrey, for that commonlye these thinges happen alwayes to the contrarie. Doe wée not sée the noble to matche wyth the base, the rich with the poore, the <hi>Italian</hi> oftentimes with the <hi>Portingale</hi>? As loue knoweth no lawes, so it regardeth no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the louer maketh no pawse where hée liketh, so hee maketh no conscience of these idle ceremonies. In that <hi>Philautus</hi> is the man that threateneth suche kindenesse at my handes, and such courtesie at yours, that hée shoulde accompte mée his wyfe before hée woe mée, certeinely hée is lyke for mée to make hys reckoninge twise, bicause hée reconeth without hys hostesse. And in this <hi>Philautus</hi> woulde eyther shew himselfe of greate wisdome to perswade, or mée of great lightnesse to be allured: although the loadstone drawe yron, yet it cannot moue golde, thoughe the Iette gather vp the light strawe, yet can it not take vp the pure stéele.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes if when I looked merilye on <hi>Philautus,</hi> hée dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it in the waye of marriage, or if séeinge mée dispose to ieste, hée tooke mée in good earnest, then sure hée might gather some presumption of my loue, but no promise: But mée thincks it is good reason, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My duetie therefore euer reserued, I héere on my knées forsweare <hi>Philautus</hi> for my husband, althoughe I accept him for my friende, and séeing I shall hardly bée induced euer to match with any, I beséeche you if by your Fatherly loue, I shall bée compelled, that I may match wyth such a one, as both I may loue, and you may like.</p>

And if I doe, it is not for want of strengthe to maynteyne my iust quarrell, but of will which thinketh scorne to gette so vayne a conquest. I know that <hi>Menelaus</hi> for his tenne yeares warre endured ten yeares woe, that after all his strife he wan but a Strumpet, that for all his trauails he reduced (I cannot say reclaymed) but a straggeler: which was as much in my iudgement, as to striue for a broken glasse which is good for nothing.

Well <hi>Lucilla</hi> (aunswered <hi>Euphues</hi>) this case bréedeth my sorrowe the more, in that it is so sodeine, and by so much the more I lament it, by howe muche the lesse I looked for it. In that my welcome is so colde and my chéere so simple, it nothing toucheth me, séeinge your furye is so hotte, and my misfortune so greate that I am neither wyllinge to receiue it, nor you to bestowe it, if tract of time, or want of tryall had caused this <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> my griefe had bene more tollerable, and your fléetinge more excusable, but comming in a moment vndeserued, vnlooked for, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughte off, it encreaseth my sorrowe and thy shame.</p>

               <hi>Euphues</hi> (quoth shée) you make a longe haruest for a little corne, and angle for the fishe that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy caught. <hi>Curio,</hi> yea, <hi>Curio,</hi> is he that hath my loue at his pleasure, and shall also haue my life at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and although you déeme him vnworthy to enioye that which earst you accompted no wight worthy to embrace, yet séeinge I estéeme him more worth then any, he is to be reputed as chiefe. The Wolfe chooseth him for hir make, that hath or doth endure most trauaile for hir sake. <hi>Venus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take the black Smith with his powlt foot. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi> here in <hi>Naples</hi> disdained not to loue a rude Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.

we are best beloued, or if the Princesse of beautye <hi>Venus,</hi> and hir heyres <hi>Helen,</hi> and <hi>Cornelia,</hi> shewe that our affection standeth on our free wyll: then am I rather to bee excused then accused.

            <p>Nay <hi>Lucilla</hi> (sayd he) my haruest shall cease, séeing others haue reaped my corne, as for anglinge for the fishe that is alreadye caught, that were but méere folly. But in my minde if you bée a fishe you are either an Ele which as soone as one hathe holde of hir taile, will slippe out of his hand, or else a Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe which will be nibbling at euery baite but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer biting: But what fishe soeuer you bée you haue made both mée and <hi>Philautus</hi> to swallow a Gudgen. If <hi>Curio</hi> bée the person, I would neither wishe thée a greater plague, nor him a deadlyer poyson. I for my part thincke him worthy of thée, and thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him, for although hée bée in bodye defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in minde foolishe, an innocent borne, a begger by misfortune, yet doth hée deserue a better then thy selfe, whose corrupt manners haue staynde thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly hewe, whose light behauiour hath dimmed the lightes of thy beautie, whose vnconstant mynde hath betrayed the innocencie of so many a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And in that you bringe in the example of a beast to confirme your folly, you shewe therein your beastly disposition, which is readie to followe suche beastlinesse. But <hi>Venus</hi> played false: and what for that? séeinge hir lightnesse serueth for an example, I woulde wishe thou mightest trye hir punishment for a reward, that béeing openly taken in an yron net al the world might iudge whether thou be fish or flesh, and certes in my minde no angle will holde thee,

it must be a net. <hi>Cornelia</hi> loued a Miller, and thou a miser, can hir folly excuse thy fault? <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> my countriewoman borne, but thine by profession, chaunged and rechaunged at hir pleasure I graunte. Shall the lewdenesse of others animate thée in thy lightnesse? why then dost thou not haunt the stewes bicause <hi>Lais</hi> frequented them? why doest thou not loue a Bull séeing <hi>Pasiphae</hi> loued one? why art thou not enamoured of thy father knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>Ah <hi>Euphues</hi> into what a quandarie art thou brought? in what sodeine misfortune art thou wrapped? it is like to fare with thée as with the Eagle, which dyeth neither for age, nor with sickenesse, but wyth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, for although thy stomacke hunger yet thy heart will not suffer thée to eate.

I addicted my selfe wholy to the seruice of women to spende my lyfe in the lappes of Ladyes, my lands in maintenance of brauerie, my witte in the vanities of idle Sonnets.

               <p>IT is most necessarie and most naturall in myne opinion, that the mother of the childe bée also the nurse, both for the entire loue shée beareth to the babe, and the great desire she hath to haue it well nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: for is there any one more meete to bring vp the infant, then she that bore it? or will any be so carefull for it, as shee that bredde it? for as the throbbes and throwes in chyldbirth wrought hir payne, so the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge countenaunce of the infant increaseth hir plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the hyred nurse is not vnlike to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hyred saruaunt which not for good will but for gayne, not for loue of the man but the desire of the money, accomplisheth hys dayes worke. Moreouer Nature in thys poynte enforceth the mother to nurse hir owne childe, which hath gyuen vnto euerye beast mylke to succour hyr owne, and mée thincketh Nature to be a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident foreséer and prouider for the same, which hath giuen vnto a woman two pappes, that if shée shoulde conceiue two, shée might haue wherewith also to nourishe twaine, and that by sucking of the mothers brestes, there might bee a greater loue bothe of the mother towardes the childe, and the childe towardes
<pb facs="tcp:5900:56"/>
the mother, which is very likely to come to passe, for we sée commonly those that eate and drincke and liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be more zealous one to the other, then those that méete seldome, is not the name of a mother most swéet? If it bée, why is halfe that title bestowed on a woman which neuer felte the paines in conceyuing, neyther can conceiue the lyke pleasure in nursinge as the mother doth? Is the earthe called the mother of all thinges onely bicause it bringeth foorth? No, but bicause it nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth those thinges that springe out of it, whatsoeuer is bredde in the sea, is fed in the sea, no plant, no trée, no hearbe commeth out of the ground that is not moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened and as it were nursed of the moysture and milke of the earth, the Lionesse nurseth hir whelpes, the Rauen, cherisheth hir birdes, the Uiper hir broode, and shall a woman cast away hir babe?</p>
               <p>I accompte it cast awaye whiche in the swathe clowtes is cast aside, and little care can that Mother haue, whiche can suffer suche crueltie: and can it bée tearmed wyth any other tytle then crueltie, the infant yet lookinge redde of the mother, the mother yet brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing through the torments of hir trauaile, the childe crying for helpe which is sayd to mooue wilde beasts, euen in the selfe sayde momente it is borne, or the next minute, to deliuer a straunge nurse, whiche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes is neyther holsome in bodye, neyther honest in manners, whiche estéemeth more thy argent although a trifle, then thy tender infant thy greatest treasure?

Therefore lette the mother as often as she shal beholde those two fountaynes of milke, as it were of their owne accorde flowing and swelling with lycour, remember that shée is admonished of nature, yea commaunded of dutie, to cherishe hir owne childe, with hir owne teates, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when the babe shall nowe beginne to tattle and call hir Mamma, with what force canne she heare it of his mouth vnto whome shée hath denyed Mamma? It is not milke only that encreaseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth the body, but the naturall heat &amp; agréement of the mothers body with the childes, it craueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same accustomed moisture that before it receiued in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, by the which the tender parts were bounde &amp; knit together, by the which it encreased and was succoured in the body.</p>
               <p>Certes I am of that minde that the witte and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is altered and chaunged by the milke, as the moysture and sappe of the earth, doth change the nature of that trée or plant that it nourisheth.

Héereoff it came that when the Philosophers could giue no reason by nature, they would saye there is one aboue nature, an other would cal him the first mouer, an other the ayder of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so foorth.</p>
            <p>But why goe I about in a thing so manifest to vse proofes so manifolde. If thou denie the truth who can proue it, if thou denie that blacke is blacke, who can by reason reproue thée, when thou opposest thy self against reason, thou knowest that manifest truthes are not to be proued but beléeued, and that he that denieth the principles of any Arte is not to bée confuted by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, but to bée left to his owne folly. But I haue a better opinion of thée, and therefore I meane not to trifle wyth Philosophy but to trye this by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Scriptures. We reade in the seconde of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that when <hi>Moses</hi> desired of God to knowe what hée should name him to the children of <hi>Israell,</hi> hée aunswered, thou shalte saye, I am that I am.

searcher of the reynes, he that made all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning, the ende and yet euerlastinge, one at whose breath the mountaines shall shake, whose seat is the loftie <hi>Cherubins,</hi> whose footestoole is the earthe inuisible, yet séeinge all things, a gelous God, a louing God, myraculous in all pointes, in no part monstrous. Besides this, thou shalt well vnderstande that hée is such a God as wil punish him whosoeuer he be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeth his name, for holy is the Lord. It is written, bring out the blasphemer without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tents &amp; let al those that hearde him laye their handes vppon hys heade, and let all the people stone him. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lorde shall dye the death. Suche a gelous God, that whosoeuer committeth Idolatrye wyth straunge Gods hée will strike wyth terrible plagues? Tourne not to Idols neyther make Gods wyth handes, I am the Lord your God: Thou shalte make no Image which the Lorde thy God abhorreth. Thou shalt haue no newe GOD, neyther worshyp any straunge Idoll. For all the Gods of the Gentiles are Diuels.</p>
            <p>My sonnes kéepe your selues from Images, the worshippinge of Idols is the cause of all euyll, the beginninge and the ende.

They shall be confounded that worshippe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Images, or glory in Idols. I wyll not giue my glorye to an other, nor my prayses to grauen Images. If all these testimonies of the Scriptures cannot make thée to acknowledge a lyuinge GOD, harken what they saye of such as be altogether incredulous. Euery vnbeleeuer shall dye in his incredulitie. Woe be to those that bee loose in heart, they beléeue there is no God, and therefore they shall not bée protected of him.

The wrathe of the Lorde shall kindle agaynste an vnbléeuinge nation. If yée beléeue not yée shall not endure. Hée that beléeueth not shall bée damned. Hée that beléeueth not is iudged alreadye. The portion of the vnbeléeuers shall be in the lake that burneth wyth fire and brimstome which is the seconde death. If thou feele in thy selfe <hi>Atheos</hi> anye sparke of grace praye vnto the Lorde and hée wyll cause it to flame, if thou haue no feelinge of fayth, yet praye and the Lorde wyll gyue aboundaunce, for as hée is a terrible God, whose voyce is lyke the rushinge of many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so is he a mercifull God whose woordes are as softe as Oyle. Though he breath fire out of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils agaynst sinners, yet is he milde to those that aske forgiuenesse. But if thou bée obstinate that seeinge thou wylt not sée, and knowing thou wylt not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then shall thy heart bée hardened wyth <hi>Pharao,</hi> and grace shall bée taken awaye from thée with <hi>Saule.</hi> Thus sayth the Lorde, who so beléeueth not shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe, heauen and earth shall passe, but the word of the Lord shall endure for euer.</p>

               <hi>Atheos.</hi> Truely <hi>Euphues</hi> you haue sayde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but you goe about contrarye to the customes of schooles, which mée thinckes you shoulde dilygentlye obserue béeinge a professed Philosopher, for when I demaunde by what reason men are induced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a God, you confirme it by course of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as who shoulde saye there were not a relaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwéene GOD and the Scripture, bycause as the olde Fathers define, wythout Scripture there
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5900:76"/>
were no GOD, no Scripture without a GOD. Whosoeuer therefore denyeth a Godhead, denyeth also the scriptures which testifie of him. This is in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>absurdum per absurdius</hi> to proue one absurditie by an other. If thou canst as substantiallye by reason proue thy authoritie of Scriptures to be true, as thou hast proued by Scriptures there is a God, then will I willyngly with thée both beléeue the Scriptures, and worshippe thy God. I haue heard that <hi>Antiochus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded all the copies of the Testament to bée burnt, from whence therefore haue we these newe bookes, I thincke thou wilt not saye by reuelation, therefore goe forwarde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euphues.</hi> I haue read of the milke of a Tygresse that the more salte there is throwne into it the fresher it is, and it may be that thou hast eyther eaten of that milke, or that thou arte the Whelpe of that Monster, for the more reasons that are beate into thy head, the more vnreasonable thou séemest to bée, the greater my authorities are, the lesser is thy beliefe. As touching the authoritie of Scriptures although there be manye arguments which do proue yea and enforce the wicked to confesse that the Scriptures came from God, yet by none other meane then by the secrete testimony of the holy Ghost our heartes are truely perswaded that it is God which speaketh in the lawe, in the Prophets, in the Gospell, the orderly disposition of the wisedome of God, the doctrine sauoring nothing of earthlynesse, the godly agreement of all parts amonge themselues, and specially the basenesse of contemptible wordes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the high misteryes of the heauenly kingedome, are seconde helpes to establish the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the antiquitie of the Scripture, whereas the bookes of other Relygions are later then the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> which yet doth not himselfe inuent a newe
<pb facs="tcp:5900:77"/>
God, but setteth foorth to the <hi>Israelites</hi> the God of their fathers. Whereas <hi>Moses</hi> doth not byde the shame of <hi>Leuy</hi> his father, nor the mourninge of <hi>Aaron</hi> his brother, and of <hi>Marie</hi> his sister, nor doth aduannce his owne children: The same are arguments that in his booke is nothing fayned by man. Also the myracles that happened as well at the publyshing of the lawe as in all the rest of time are infallyble proofes that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures procéeded from the mouth of God. Also where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Moses</hi> speaking in the person of <hi>Iacob,</hi> assigneth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment to the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and where he telleth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the callynge of the Gentiles, whereof the one came to passe foure hundreth yeares after, the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two thousande yeares, these are arguments that it is GOD himselfe that speaketh in the bookes of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Esay</hi> telleth before of the captiuitie of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and their restoryng by <hi>Cyrus</hi> (which was borne an hundreth yeares after the deathe of <hi>Esay</hi>) and wheras <hi>Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where <hi>Daniel</hi> telleth of things to come sixe hundreth yeares after. These are most certeyne proues to establish the authoritie of the bookes of the Prophets, the simplycitie of the speach of the first thrée Euaungelysts, conteyninge heauenlye mysteries, the prayse of <hi>Iohn</hi> thundring from on high with weyghty sentences, the heauenlye maiestie shininge in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paule,</hi> the sodayne callyng of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> from the receipte of custome, the callyng of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> from their fisher boates to the preaching of the Gospell, the conuersion and callyng of <hi>Paule</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an enemy to the Apostleshippe are signes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

Ghost speaking in them. The consent of so many ages, of so sundrye nations, and of so diuers mindes, in embracing the Scriptures, and the rare godlynesse of some, oughte to establish the authoritie thereoff a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs. Also the bloude of so many Martyrs which for the confession thereoff haue suffred deathe with a constant and sober zeale, are vndoubted testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes of the truthe and authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>The myracles that <hi>Moses</hi> recounteth are suffient to perswade vs that God, yea, the God of hoastes, sette downe the Scriptures. For this that hée was carryed in a clowde vpp into the mountayne: that there euen vntill the fortith daye he continued without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye of men. That in the verye publyshinge of the lawe his face did shine as it were besette with Sunne beames, that lyghteninges flashed rounde about, that thunder and noyses were eache where hearde in the ayre, that a Trompette sownded being not sownded with any mouth of man.</p>
            <p>That the entry of the Tabernacle by a clowde set betweene was kepte from the sighte of the people, that his authoritie was so miraculously reuenged with the horrible destruction of <hi>Chorah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron,</hi> and all that wicked faction, that the rocke stroken with a rodde did by and by powre foorthe a ryuer, that at his prayer, it rayned Manna from Heauen.

            <p>Besides this, where the Holy Ghost hath ceased to sette downe, there ought we to cease to enquire, séeing we haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sufficiencie of our saluation conteined in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.

But that such doubtes aryse amonge many in our age, the reason is, theire lyttle faythe, not the insufficient proofe of the cause.</p>

These things <hi>Euphues</hi> testifie vnto my conscience that if there be a God, he is the God of the righteous, &amp; one that wil confound the wicked. Whether therefore shal I goe, or how may I auoide the day of vengeance to come? if I goe to heauen that is his seate, if into the earth that is his footstoole, if into the depth he is there also: Who can shrowde himself from the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, or where can one hide him that the Lord cannot finde him? his wordes are like fire and the people lyke drye woode and shalbe consumed. <hi>Euphues.</hi> Although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reioyce to heare thée acknowledge a God, yet must I néedes lament to sée thée so much distrust him. The Diuell that roaring Lyon seing his pray to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his iawes, alledgeth al Scripture y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the sinner, leauing al out that should comfort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sorrowful. Much like vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deceitfull Phisition which recounteth all things that may endomage his patient, neuer telling any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may recure him. Let not thy conscience be agrieued, but with a patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t heart renounce all thy former iniquities and thou shalt receiue eternall life. Assure thy selfe that as God is a Lord so he is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Christ is a Iudge, so he is a Sauiour, as ther is a lawe, so there is a Gospel. Though God haue leaden handes whiche when they strike paye home, yet hath he leaden féet which are as slow to ouertake a sinner. Heare therfore the great comfort flowing in euery leafe &amp; line of the Scripture if thou be patient. I my selfe am euen hée which doth blotte out thy transgressions
<pb facs="tcp:5900:80"/>
and that for mine owne sake, and I will not be minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thy sinnes. Beholde the Lordes hande is not shortned that it cannot saue, neither his eare heauy, that it cannot heare. If your sinnes were as Crimosin they shall be made whiter then Snow, &amp; though they were as red as Scarlet they shall be made like white Woll. If we confesse our offences hée is faythfull and iuste so that he will forgiue vs our sinnes. God hathe not appointed vs vnto wrath but vnto saluation, by the meanes of our Lorde Iesus Christe, the earthe is filled with the mercye of the Lorde. It is not the will of your Father which is in heauen that any one of the little ones should perishe. God is riche in mercye. I will not the death of a sinner sayth the Lord God, retourne and lyue. The sonne of man came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye but to saue. God hath mercy on all, bycause hée can doe all. God is mercifull, longe sufferinge and of much mercy. If the wicked man shall repent of hys wickednesse which hée hath committed, and kéepe my commaundementes, doinge Iustice and iudgement hée shall lyue the lyfe, and shall not dye. If I shall saye vnto the sinner thou shalt dye the death, yet if hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and doe Iustice he shall not dye. Call to thy minde the great goodnesse of God in creating thée, his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler loue in giuing his sonne for thée. So God loued the worlde that he gaue his onely begotten sonne that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeur beléeued in him myght not perish but haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. God hath not sent his sonne to iudge the world, but that the worlde might be saued by him. Can the Mother (sayth the Prophet) forget the chylde of hir wombe, &amp; though she be so vnnaturall, yet will I not be vnmindefull of thée. There shalbe more ioye in heauen for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> repentaunce of one sinner the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for nintie &amp; nine iust persons. I came not saith Christ to cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteous but sinners to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin, we haue an aduocate

with the father Iesus Christe the righteous, hée is the propitiation for our sinnes, and not for our sinnes onely but for the sinnes of the whole worlde. I write vnto you little children bicause your sinnes be forgiuen for his names sake. Doth not Christ saye that whatsoeuer wée shall aske the Father in his name wée shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne? Doth not God saye this is my beloued sonne in whome I am well pleased, heare him? I haue reade of <hi>Themistocles</hi> which hauing offended <hi>Philip</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> &amp; could no way apease his anger, méeting his young sonne <hi>Alexander</hi> tooke him in his armes, &amp; met <hi>Philip</hi> in the face: <hi>Philip</hi> séeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> smilyng counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the childe, was well pleased with <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles.</hi> Euen so if through thy manifolde sinnes and haynous offences thou prouoke the heauye displeasure of thy God insomuch as thou shalt tremble for horror, take his onelye begotten and welbeloued sonne Iesus in thine armes, and then he neyther can nor will bée angry with thée. If thou haue denyed thy God, yet if thou goe out with <hi>Peter</hi> and wéepe bitterly, God will not deny thée. Though with the prodigall sonne thou wallow in thine owne wilfulnesse, yet if thou retourne agayne sorrowfull thou shalt be receiued. If thou bée a grieuous offender, yet if thou come vnto Christ with the woman in <hi>Luke</hi> and wash his féete with thy teares thou shalt obteyne remission.</p>
            <p>Consider with thy selfe the great loue of Christ and the bitter torments that he endured for thy sake, which was enforced through the horror of death to crye with a loude voyce. <hi>Eloi, Eloi, Lamasabathani,</hi> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mée, and with a groning spirite to say, my soule is heauie euen vnto the deathe, tarry héere and watch, and agayne, father if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible lette this cuppe passe from mée.

I but hir youth made thée often merry, I but thine age should once make thée wise, I but hir gréene yeres wer vnfit for death, I but thy hoary haires shoulde dispise lyfe. Knowest thou not <hi>Ferardo,</hi> that lyfe is the gifte of God, deathe the due of nature, as we receiue the one for a benefitte, so must we abide the other of necessitie.

The Philosophers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest felycitie neuer to be borne, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond soone to die. And what hath death in it so hard that we should take it so heauily? is it strange to sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cutte off, which by nature is made to be cut, or that melten, which is fit to be melted? or that burnt which is apt to be burnt, or man to passe that is borne to perish?

Thou shouldst not wéepe that she hath runne fast, but that thou hast gone so slowe, neyther ought it to grieue thée that she is gone to hir home with a few yeares, but that thou art to goe with manye.

               <p>Moreouer thou saist that in the court all be sluttes that swimme not in silkes, and that the idlest liuers are accompted the brauest louers, I cannot tell whether I should rather laugh at their folly or lament their phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, neither do I know whether the finne bée greater in apparel which moueth to pride, or in affection which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiseth to péeuishnesse, the one causeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other to forgo their sences, ech do deceiue their soule, they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thinck one cannot be cloanly without pride, wil quickly iudge none to be honest without pleasure, which is as hard to confesse as to saye no meane to bée without excesse, thou wishest to be in the country wyth thy distaffe rather then to continue in the court w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy delights.
