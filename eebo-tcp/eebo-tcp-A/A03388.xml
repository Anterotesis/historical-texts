            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Alas (quoth the Queene) it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, not only to vs, but to the whole Kingdome, how my Lord, seduced by the flattering allurements of strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, hath not onely violated the law of our gods, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning my nuptiall bed, made sacred by the holy law of matrimonie; but also the law of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth such disorder and wanton actions. <hi rend="margQuotes">But sith in a Monarchie the wills of Princes may bide no checke, but their reasons (howsoever vnreasonable) are the principles that may not be infringed, it resteth onely for me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, but not to redresse, lest venturing too farre, I set my rest on the hazard, and so desperately throw at all.</hi> What Madame, (answered <hi>Lucilla</hi>) have you no other cause to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet your selfe, then the foolish love of the King? Truely this is a very small occasion, and a cause more then frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, after this manner to vexe your selfe; remove away these dolorous passions, and endevour to live joyfully with those, amongst whom your reputation and credite shall be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: attending til Time shal coole his ardent desires, and enforce him to change his affections, with this proviso; that by vnlawfull acquaintance, your honour likewise be not depraved. Indeede, replyed the Queene, the whole can with facilitie minister counsell to them that are sicke; but if thou didst but feele that distemperature which permitteth me to take no rest in my minde, and the cause of the anguish that doth deprive me of sence, I am assured, that having pittie vpon me, thou wouldest otherwise comfort me, or else help to execute that, which should serve for the intire solace and contentment of my spirit. The King hath led this life a long time, and it is now impossible, but by death or extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of age, he should alter it: in the meane while, I passe my time away in vaine, no waies comforted, which maketh my griefe seeme more intolerable. <hi>Lucilla</hi> perceiving without casting of her water, where she was pained, shaped her this reply.

Since thy being with mee, I had a

dreame, that held me all the time of my sleepe, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance wherof doth trouble me very much, which as neere as I can remember, I will tell thee. Me I thought was going through a thicke wood, where were a number of nettes and snares layde in euery path where should I passe, yet me thought I passed through them so easily, as if they had bin of no strength; til at last I came toward a great water, where neere vnto the shoare lay a great boate, and from the boate lay a long line, made al of gold and pearle; within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe whereof, treading ere I was aware, mee thought some thing gaue a snatch, wherewith the line whipt about my middle, and carried me into the boate; with the soddaine fright whereof I awaked. Now what sayest thou to this dreame? <hi>Lucilla,</hi> no lesse wittily conceipted of her dreame, then noting the carriage of her humour, made her this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

For mine owne parte, my heart imagining by your affection, that the destinies which caused your griefe, had fettered him, and well knowing where loue is vnited, there ones weale is the others good: though I were hardly wonne to the same, yet at length I vndertooke the hazard of your good wil, promising to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne him an answer thereof, wherein, without the graunt of your consent I shall breake promise. Oh <hi>Lucilla,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou of my consent in answering his kinde Letters, for whose sake I haue indured so many nights of vnrest, and carefull dayes?

For he, incensed by the praises of her vertues, fell into such a restlesse <hi>Chaos</hi> of confused pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that he could take no rest till the night was passed in broken slumbers. The next morning, taking Loue onely for his guide, priuatly he went to the Farmers house, where finding her with one of her maides in the midst of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiferie, he stood a prettie while, taking a viewe of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite perfection; till at the last, the good wife espied him, (who, nothing dismaied with his presence, for that beeing forewarned, shee was fore-armed) gaue him after her home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fashion, a Countrie welcome. The King sate downe, and finding some talke, began to discourse with her, about her well ordered house, and other matters, that by a long insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, he might the better fall to his purpose. The poore woman, whose name was <hi>Ballinea,</hi> was as busie as a Bee, to set before <hi>Amazias</hi> such rurall junkets, as the Plough af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foards, making fewe answers; till at last the King, after hee had tasted of her delicates, taking her by the hand, framed his speech in this manner.</p>

Indeed, my Liege, a lesse haruest might haue serued for so bad corne, that how warily soeuer you gleane, it will scarce proue worth the reaping. Tru it is, that preambls are friuolous, that perswade men to such follies: therefore, had you spar'd this speach, your credit had bin the more, &amp; your labor lesse. If on the sodaine my beauty hath inueagled you (for as for my virtue you hazard but a suppose, sith ofttimes report hath a blister on her tong) I must blame your eye that is bleer'd with euery obiect, &amp; accuse such a mind as suffers honor to be suppressed with affection, &amp; (my Lord) soone ripe soone rotten, hot loue is so one cold.

The good wife glad that he tooke the matter so in snuffe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her maid to say nothing to hir master, lest it should disquiet his minde. But the King impatient of this deniall, thought that the Citie which would not yield at the parley, might be conquered by an assault; and that which intreaty could not command, force would constraine: therefore he commanded one of his Peeres, whom he made priuie to his practise, to giue him warning to depart out of his house, but with this <hi>prouiso,</hi> that if his wife were found tractable, then she should remaine there still. The Noble man fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Soueraignes command, proued straight by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it was as possible to force the streame against his course, or the earth to ascend from his center, as to draw her minde from vertue and honestie: and therefore, contrarie to all law and conscience, charged them to leaue their liuings. The poore man, after his wife had made him priuie to the cause of their suddaine calamitie, tooke it very patiently, &amp; chose rather to liue poorely content, then richly discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: so that the prefixed time of his departure being come, he quietly departed from the farme to a cottage, where his wife and he liued as perfect louers in vnfained affection. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazias</hi> seeing his pollicie tooke small effect, impatient stil in his restles passions, accompanied one day with 5 or 6 of his nobles, taking the aduantage of the time, perforce brought <hi>Ballinea</hi> away, &amp; priuily left two of his guard in ambush to kil <hi>Lewesohiln.</hi> The neighbors hearing of this mischiefe, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly sent to <hi>Lewesohiln,</hi> where he was at plow, &amp; forewarnd

him of all that <hi>Amazias</hi> had done, and intended.</p>
            <p>The poore man seeing, that to striue with him, was to shoote against the Heauens, preferring life before wealth, euen as he was apparrelled, went farre from the place of his residence; and as a man in distresse, seeking seruice, went to a Collier, who entertained, and gaue him such wages, as hee deserued: where quietly, although disquieted in minde for the absence of his wife, he passed away a few daies. Diuerse were poore <hi>Lewesohilns</hi> thoughts, for when hee considered <hi rend="margQuotes">the Chastitie of his wife, Suspition hidde her face for shame; but when he saw that womens thoughts are aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and gape after preferment, and that the greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault to honestie,</hi> is Honour; he began to frowne: so that thus betweene Dread and Hope, he liued disquieted. But poore <hi>Ballinea,</hi> whose miserie was redoubled, by hearing of her husbands mishappe, powred out such continuall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of teares, as not onely <hi>Amazias,</hi> but all men tooke pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of her plaints. But the vnbrideled furie of Lust, that while it runnes headlong into a Laborynth of mischiefes, feeleth no remorse, had no consideration of her daily sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, but resolued, if not by intreatie, at least by force, to come to the ende of his lasciuious desire. Which resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beeing knowne to <hi>Ballinea,</hi> from Praiers shee went to Pollicie, and therefore on the suddaine became more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, desiring <hi>Amazias,</hi> that he would giue her some space to forget her old Loue, and entertaine a new choice. Hee, whose fancy was somwhat appeased with this good speech, granted her the tearme of a Moneth, with free libertie to walke in the garden, and else-where at her pleasure. <hi>Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> enioying her wish, so fortunately taking Time by the forehead, earely in a morning stole secretly from the Palace, and fledde into the Countrie; where, in the day time hiding her selfe amongst bushes, and in the night trauelling as fast as shee could; at last shee came to the place where her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was with the Collier: and there changing her apparell into the attire of a man, and her head brauely shorne, shee became an handsome stripling. The next day, comming

to the Cole-pits, she demanded seruice; The master Collier, seeing the youth well faced, had pittie of his want, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him: and for that <hi>Lewesohiln</hi> his man wanted one to driue his cart, he appointed <hi>Ballinea</hi> to attend vpon him. Shee thanking the gods that blest her with so fauourable a seruice, was brought to the sight of <hi>Lewesohiln,</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge. <hi>Lewesohiln</hi> pittying the poore estate of such a yong youth, noting narrowly the lineaments of her face, fell into sighes, &amp; from sighes to teares, for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his sweet <hi>Ballinea:</hi> who pittying her husbands plaints, in that she was a true deuiner of his thoughts, could not (as womens secrets oft hang at the tip of their tongues) but bewray to her husband what shee was: who, when he perfectly knew his wife, so strangely metamorphised; what for ioy of her presence, and sorrow that Fortune had made them both thus vnhappy, he fel into deeper complaints, till appeased by his wife, they went merrily to worke. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazias</hi> missing <hi>Ballinea,</hi> and after diligent search, perceiuing she was stole away, fel into such a melancholy humour, that his subiects thought him halfe in a frenzie. He commanded horse to be made out into euery high way, all passages to be stopt, euery woman to be examined: but in vaine; which so increased his surie, that he injoyned an officer of his Court, (as wel qualified as himselfe) to search out (if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) by his extraordinary industrie, the inauspicate conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his loue. Who taking horse, rode vp and downe the countrie, as one halfe madde; but found not that he sought for. At last, Fortune enuying the happines of <hi>Lewesohiln,</hi> and his wife, brought him where the Colliers were at worke: and a pretty space before he came at the Pit, he met <hi>Ballinea;</hi> who seeing him, although he had disguised himselfe, because he would ride vnknowne, yet perfectly perceiued what hee was; and therefore would willingly haue beene out of his company.</p>
            <p>But hee calling vnto her, and shee hauing her leather coate all dustie, and her sweete face all besmeared with coales, was the bolder to goe; and demaunded of him what

The colliers seeing their boy, (whom for his good behauiour, they all generally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) to be misused by a Seruingman, tooke their whips in their hands, and demanded of <hi>Rawcikew,</hi> what hee meant to offer violence to any of their company? For that (quoth he) the boy hath greatly abused the King. <hi>Ballinea</hi> told them all the whole matter: which knowne, the Colliers wisht him, if he were well, to be packing. <hi>Rawcikew</hi> seeing amongst such an vnruly company, he could not mend himselfe, went his way with a slea in his eare; and as he rode, perceiued where <hi>Lewesohiln</hi> lay asleep; who was not so disguised, but he knew him perfectly: thinking therefore, when hee did awake, to learne something out of him; and so turning his horse into a close hard by, rested himselfe behind a bush. Long he had not sate, before <hi>Ballinea</hi> came merrily whistling with her cart, &amp; told her husband all what had happened; who both smiled that the officer had such rough entertainment, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that so cleanly shee had deceiued him. <hi>Rawcikew,</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerheard them, and perceiued that the youth whom hee tooke for a stripling, was <hi>Ballinea</hi> the poore mans wife; felt such a remorse in his conscience, that the King should offer violence to so vertuous and chaste a mind, that as soone as they were gone, he posted as fast as he could to the Court, &amp; reuealed vnto <hi>Amazias</hi> the whole matter: who greatly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the discourse, desirous againe to see so honest a wife, presently dispatcht a Purseuant to command the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4326:36"/>
to bring his man <hi>Lewesohiln,</hi> &amp; his boy before him. The Purseuant sparing no horse-flesh, came so fast from the court, that he found them al at dinner: who, after they heard his message, were amazed; especially poore <hi>Ballinea,</hi> who feared some new misfortune: yet cheering her selfe, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to comfort her husband, they went with the Purseuant to the Court: where beeing brought before <hi>Amazias, Rawci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kew</hi> complained of the Collier, how he had abused his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in maintaining his boy to giue him euil language. The Collier (as a man amazed) confessed his fault, and therefore desired the Nobles which were standing by, to be his good Lords and Masters. <hi>Amazias,</hi> who all this while had his eie vpon <hi>Ballinea,</hi> asked her what he was? May it please your Grace (quoth she) I am seruant to this man, who is owner of the pit, but vnder this other, who is ouerseer of my work: so then (quoth the King) you serue two masters, the one by day, and the other by night. Nay my Liege (quoth <hi>Ballinea</hi>) but one master, for wee make small account of any seruice that is done in the night. How say you sirra (quoth the king to <hi>Lewesohiln</hi>) is not this boy your man? No my Lord (quoth he) onely my bed-fellow, and that is all the seruice I craue at his hands. At this answer, the King and the Noble men smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and <hi>Ballinea</hi> fearing she was discouered, began to blush: which <hi>Amazias</hi> perceiuing, demanded of her, of what age she was? About 18. my Liege (quoth she). <hi>Amazias</hi> willing to trie then, what the euent would be, told the collier that he and his man, for that their faults were through ignorance<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> might get them home: but for your boy (quoth the King) seeing he is so young, and well faced, I meane to make him my Page. The Collier was glad hee was so dispatcht; but poore <hi>Lewesohiln,</hi> through aboundance of griefe was almost driuen into an extasie; so that changing colour, hee could skarce stand on his legs: which <hi>Ballinea</hi> perceiuing, seeing now Fortune had done her worst, resolued to suffer all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series whatsoeuer: falling down therfore vpon her knees, she vnfolded to the King what she was, &amp; from point to point, discoursed what had happened between her &amp; <hi>Rawcikew,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
