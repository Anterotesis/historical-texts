         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE
TO THE
Learned of this Nation.</head>
            <p>IS it possible then that <hi>Errour</hi> can admit
<hi>Principles?</hi> Or (which is equivalent)
that <hi>Truth</hi> cannot admit <hi>any,</hi> but must
be quite destitute of such firm Supports?
Or is it even possible that Falshood dare so much
as <hi>pretend</hi> to such Evident Grounds, and offer
to <hi>make good</hi> her Pretence, and not sink in
deepest Disgrace for laying Claim to a thing
to which it must needs be Evident she has not
the least Shadow of a Title? Certainly, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
considers attentively that <hi>Principles</hi> are
(properly speaking) <hi>First Truths,</hi> either Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
or with Restriction to such a matter,
and withall that <hi>these</hi> must be most perfectly
<hi>Self-evident,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Principles con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ining
upon the former, must needs partake a very
high degree of Conspicuousness by their near
approach to those great <hi>Luminary Truths,</hi> will,
upon the joyning these two Consider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions, easily
conclude such a Pretence <hi>Unmain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ainable,</hi> if
<pb facs="tcp:62077:3"/>
things be rightly stated and propos'd. Besides,
since all <hi>True Judgments</hi> are built on the
Things being <hi>such</hi> as we <hi>judg'd it to be,</hi> and
what<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>True</hi> is <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> it
must needs follow that (all Circumstances taken
in) it was <hi>Impossible,</hi> and so, a <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
the Thing, at what time we fram'd
that <hi>right Judgment</hi> of it, should have been
<hi>otherwise then it was.</hi> A <hi>Contradiction</hi>
I say; for that which is in the <hi>Thing</hi> or Object
an <hi>Impossibility,</hi> is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in our
<hi>Minds</hi> inform'd by that <hi>Object.</hi> Whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
this Great and Clear Truth, that <hi>Every
Error necessarily involves a Contradiction,
and every Truth a First Principle;</hi> and that,
though not in <hi>Formality of Expression,</hi> yet in
<hi>Reality of Sense</hi> they are both of them
<hi>such.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is it possible that these <hi>Best Evidences</hi>
now spoken of should be held <hi>Obscure</hi> or <hi>False;</hi>
or that <hi>Contradictions</hi> (their Opposits) which
Principle all Falshoods, should gain the repute
of <hi>Clearest Truths?</hi> Surely, there must needs
be a strange <hi>perversion</hi> of Nature somewhere,
when such <hi>Monsters</hi> in Rationality can obtain
the Esteem of being <hi>Legitimate</hi> Production<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>Reason:</hi> And, this must be either in the
mindes of the <hi>Persons to be inform'd,</hi> who are
violently sway'd by <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi> to those
of their own Party, so as not to consider at all
<hi>What Evidence</hi> there is in what they say, but
<pb facs="tcp:62077:3"/>
to <hi>accept</hi> themselves and <hi>cry up</hi> to others any
piece of <hi>Empty Rhetorick,</hi> Plausible <hi>Talk,</hi>
or pretty <hi>Irony</hi> for solid <hi>Conviction:</hi> or else
in the <hi>Discoursers</hi> who are to inform those
Readers; and the Chief Engin with which
they work upon their want of Skill is to <hi>talk</hi>
indeed of <hi>Principles,</hi> because 'tis the highest
Credit that can be to be thought to have such
Invincible Grounds: But they never look into
the <hi>Nature</hi> of Principles and thence <hi>make out</hi>
to their Readers what kind of Sayings those
must be which can deserve that Excellent
Name, lest they should disgrace <hi>themselves</hi>
and shame their Cause; while the whole strength
of their Discourse is built on this, that those
Propositions they rely on are indeed <hi>Right Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi>
and yet, when look't into, are no more
like what they are pretended to be then so many
old Wives Tales.</p>
            <p>It seems then to me both most <hi>Conducive</hi> to
the <hi>Clearing</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> as also the most <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi>
and <hi>Equal</hi> way of proceeding to look first
into the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Principles,</hi> and by laying
it open to determin <hi>thence</hi> what Propositions
<hi>deserve</hi> that name, what <hi>not.</hi> For, if I right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>perform</hi> this, and it appear thence that
<hi>Dr. St.</hi> has indeed <hi>produc't</hi> such Grounds as
have in them the true Nature of Principles and
proceeded upon them, <hi>all</hi> his Discourse <hi>thus
built,</hi> must necessarily be <hi>Convictive,</hi> and
the <hi>Result</hi> of it a <hi>Certain Truth.</hi> But, in
<pb facs="tcp:62077:4"/>
case he has <hi>not</hi> produc't any <hi>such,</hi> his whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is convinc't to be meer <hi>Trifling</hi> and
<hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Principle</hi> then, taken as distinguish't
from other Propositions or Sayings, involves two
Perfections in it's notion: <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> some <hi>other</hi> Truths that partake
their Evidence from It. For, were it never so
Evident in <hi>it self,</hi> yet, if it <hi>deriv'd</hi> none of
that Evidence to <hi>another,</hi> nor had Relation to
any thing besides it self, it might be indeed in
that case a <hi>Great Truth,</hi> but it would no
more be a <hi>Principle,</hi> then that can be said to
be a <hi>Beginning</hi> which has neither <hi>Middle</hi> nor
<hi>End,</hi> nor any thing <hi>following</hi> it. Evidence
is twofold, <hi>Self-Evidence</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> by
way of <hi>Proof.</hi> The former belongs to <hi>First
Principles</hi> as hath been at large prov'd in
<hi>Reason again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Raillery,</hi> Disc. 2. &amp; 3d. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
by <hi>Proof,</hi> belongs to <hi>Subordinate</hi>
Principles, which are <hi>Conclusions</hi> in respect
of those above them, and yet themselves Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential
to prove <hi>other</hi> things. And the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of these must be resolvable finally into
<hi>Self-evident</hi> ones, otherwise it would follow
that all <hi>Proof</hi> must proceed higher and higher
<hi>in Infinitum,</hi> and so <hi>nothing</hi> could ever be
prov'd at all. Now <hi>other</hi> kindes of Evidence
besides these <hi>two</hi> (speaking of <hi>Speculative</hi>
Evidence) are unimaginable; since 'tis most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that what is neither <hi>Self-Evident,</hi> nor
<pb facs="tcp:62077:4"/>
               <hi>made-Evident</hi> is not Evident at all.</p>
            <p>Hence is seen, that 'tis Impossible, the nature
of Principles once rightly understood, Errour
(on whose side soever it be) should maintain it's
<hi>Pretence</hi> to <hi>Principles;</hi> Since 'tis Impossible
that any thing should either be <hi>Self-Evident</hi> or
<hi>Made-Evident</hi> which is not a <hi>Real Truth;</hi> as
also <hi>Impossible</hi> that what's Evident <hi>any</hi> way
(or, which is all one, a <hi>Truth</hi>) should patronize
or abett <hi>Errour.</hi> This way then of managing
Controversies is perfectly Decisive; For which
reason I have frequently prest his Party to it
in my <hi>Letter to my Answerer</hi> and other places,
and have been seconded therein by the Learned
and worthy Author of <hi>Protestancy without
Principles;</hi> but none was ever found so hardy
to attempt it, till this <hi>man of Mettle,</hi> hoping his
<hi>tinkling expression</hi> and <hi>gingling wit</hi> would
baffle even Truth it self, took the <hi>Confidence</hi>
to talk of what he never understood. However
he is to be thank't by us both and acknowledg'd
a Generous Adversary, that, laying aside at
present those frivolous <hi>Inconclusive</hi> ways of
quoting <hi>Authorities</hi> which himself holds <hi>may
deceive</hi> us in all they say, as also those Insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Devices of <hi>Pretty Jests</hi> and other <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical
Dexterities,</hi> he accepts our Challenge
to such a manner of Fight, as must necessarily
be <hi>Fatal</hi> to one side and <hi>Victorious</hi> to the other.
Had he stated also the nature of <hi>Principles</hi>
exactly, and shown <hi>his</hi> to be such, how <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62077:5"/>
a <hi>Goliah</hi> had he appear'd, and how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a man of his hands? whereas now, if it
comes to be discover'd that what he call'd a
<hi>Sword,</hi> or a <hi>Canon,</hi> is indeed but a Bul-rush,
or Pot-gun (a Pygmy's proper weapons,) that is,
if it be prov'd that those things he bragg'd of
and rely'd on as <hi>Principles,</hi> are in Reality
but so many <hi>Paradoxes</hi> or <hi>Impertinences,</hi> I
hope we may s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cease our Fears, and turn them
into a more pleasant humour.</p>
            <p>Though the Prognostick be very obvious
what he <hi>can</hi> do in this case, yet who knows but
for once he may <hi>work</hi> an <hi>Impossibility,</hi> who
(as will appear in the ensuing Treatise) has told
us so many <hi>Contradictions.</hi> In the mean time,
if he thinks fit to attempt any Reply, 'tis Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the former Discourse what he is to do,
unless he will strangely <hi>Prevaricate</hi> from his
<hi>Duty;</hi> viz. either to disallow my settling
here the nature of Principles, and state them
<hi>better,</hi> that is either to <hi>deny</hi> that they are to
have any <hi>Evidence</hi> or <hi>Influence</hi> at all; or else,
if he <hi>allows</hi> it, to make out that his pretended
Principles have <hi>those Qualifications;</hi> which
is best done by resolving them into <hi>First
Principles</hi> and <hi>connecting</hi> them <hi>distinctly</hi>
with their respective <hi>Consequences.</hi> And
let him remember that, till he does this, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defends Himself against my present An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
nor gives a home Reply to <hi>Protestancy
without Principles</hi> (whatever gay things or
<pb facs="tcp:62077:5"/>
things he sayes to particular passages in it) since
himself acknowledges these Principles of his
were intended an <hi>Answer</hi> to that Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out
of the nature of both Treatises they appear to
be the <hi>proper</hi> Return to it.</p>
            <p>I have no occasion, nor is it my intent here
to write against the Church of <hi>England</hi> or any
of her Legitimate Sons: rather I must declare
that, in case they all hold as M. <hi>Thorndike</hi> (a
Man of Eminent Learning &amp; Esteem amongst
them) declares himself to do (<hi>Just weights,
p.</hi> 159.) that <hi>the Scripture interpreted by
the perpetual Practice of God's Church is
the Ground of Faith,</hi> which implies, that

Christs Sense or Faith, and so is their Rule
I must heartily applaud their joyning with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
in the main Point of all, and which
settled is apt to unite us in all the rest. What I
impugn then here is a pestilent Tenet, destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to all <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and the very Essence
of <hi>Church;</hi> making Church-Governors <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
in their main Duty of <hi>Teaching Faith</hi> to
their <hi>Flock,</hi> and <hi>Lame</hi> in that of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
For, if every private man is to rely on
his <hi>own</hi> Interpretation, he ought neither <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
nor <hi>Obey</hi> the Church when the contrary
seems to his Fancy to be grounded in Scripture;
and, if that man do but <hi>alledge</hi> he judges in
clear in Scripture, and consequently that the
Church is corrupt and errs: I see not with what
<pb facs="tcp:62077:6"/>
Iustice, according to these Principles, the Church
can either excommunicate him or bind him
to his Duty.</p>
            <p>I expect <hi>Dr. St.</hi> will object, that I deny di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of his Principles which some of ours have
granted; for his Friend <hi>Dr. T.</hi> and he abound
in such sleight Topicks; To which, though I
could answer, that <hi>unusquisque in sensu suo

<hi>my</hi> task to discover their Oppositness to all Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;

'tis frequent to express we <hi>grant</hi> things which
we only <hi>pass</hi> as nothing to the main Point which
is to be concluded; nor can <hi>Dr. St.</hi> pretend
with any reason that others have yeelded them
<pb facs="tcp:62077:6"/>
to be Principles whereas I deny it: The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

            <head>THE
FIRST EXAMEN
CONCERNING
Dr. Stillingfleet's Design
in this Discourse, as exprest
in his TITLE.</head>
            <p>1. IN the first place, the <hi>Title</hi> superscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to this Discourse, and signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of
it, is to be well weighed; that
so, we may make a right Conceit of what
we are justly to expect from Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in this
occasion: 'Tis this, [<hi>The Faith of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
reduc'd to Principles.</hi>]</p>
            <p>2. Now <hi>Principles,</hi> as we have discours'd
in the <hi>Preface,</hi> must either be <hi>Evident</hi> to
<hi>both</hi> Parties, or at least, <hi>held</hi> and <hi>granted</hi> by
<hi>both;</hi> else no discourse can proceed for want
of Agreement in that on which all <hi>Rational</hi>
Process is grounded. Also, they must be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62077:9"/>
               <hi>Proper</hi> for the End intended, or <hi>Influential</hi>
upon the <hi>Conclusion</hi> which the Arguer aims
to <hi>evince:</hi> otherwise, if the thing in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>deceive</hi> not its Evidence and Truth from
them, though those Propositions be never so
evident in themselves, yet they cannot be to
<hi>It,</hi> or in <hi>this</hi> Circumstance a <hi>Principle,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may be in <hi>others.</hi> Wherefore, to
make good this <hi>Title,</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is to produce
nothing for a <hi>Principle,</hi> but what is either
<hi>granted</hi> at first by <hi>both</hi> Parties, or else is of
so open and undeniable an Evidence, as all
the World <hi>must</hi> see and acknowledge it;
such as are either <hi>first Principles,</hi> or those
which immediatly depend upon them, and
are comprehended under them: or, if he
builds on any Propositions as Principles,
which are not <hi>thus</hi> evident but <hi>need</hi> Proof,
he is at least to render them evident ere he
builds upon them, And, lastly, he is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them close to that which he professes to
<hi>conclude</hi> from them; otherwise, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
show them to be <hi>Principles</hi> in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
any more than one can be a <hi>Father</hi> who
has no <hi>Off-spring,</hi> or than any thing can be a
<hi>Ground</hi> which has no <hi>Superstructures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Next, we are to consider what Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
means by the word [<hi>Faith</hi>] in this place.
And, I hope, he will not think I injure him
in supposing he has so good thoughts of the
<hi>Faith of Protestants,</hi> as to hold 'tis more than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62077:9"/>
a bare <hi>Opinion,</hi> whose Grounds may all be
<hi>false:</hi> For if so, the Assent of Protestants as
Faithful, may <hi>possibly</hi> be an <hi>Error,</hi> and all
the Tenets they profess to be <hi>Truths,</hi> and
hope to be sav'd by believing them, liable to
be prov'd nothing, perhaps in reality but a
company of <hi>Lies.</hi> If then (as in this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
he must) he hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<hi>Impossible to be Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to
<hi>reduce</hi> it into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Grounds and Principles
as are likew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>Impossible to be False;</hi> and,
consequently, if it relies on Authority, he is
to bring <hi>Infallible Authority</hi> for it; all that
is <hi>Fallible</hi> (as Common sense teaches) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<hi>Possibility of Falshood</hi> in whatever is
grounded on it. <hi>Such</hi> Grounds then or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
he is oblig'd to produce for the <hi>Faith
of Protestants,</hi> in case he holds it may not
perhaps be an Error for any thing he or his
Church knows But, in case he judges this
Assent or Belief of Protestants may be <hi>True
Faith</hi> though the Grounds of it may be
<hi>False,</hi> then he ows me an answer to <hi>Faith
Vindicated,</hi> where the contrary is prov'd by
multitudes of Arguments; not one of which
has yet receiv'd one word of sober Reply
from him or Dr. <hi>Tillotson;</hi> though, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Inferences at the end of that
Book, it most highly concerns them both
to speak to the several Reasons it contains.</p>
            <p>4. In the third place we are to reflect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62077:10"/>
what may be meant by the word [<hi>reduc'd</hi>]
in the said Title. And, since all Truths not
self-evident, nor known by immediate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on sense, are at first <hi>deriv'd</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd</hi>
from Principles; this word [<hi>reduc'd</hi>]
having a signification directly contrary to
the other, intimates to us, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
makes account he has begun by putting the
<hi>Faith of Protestants</hi> which is the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and <hi>brought it back</hi> (for so the word
[<hi>reduc'd</hi>] imports) to <hi>Principles;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
'tis Evident to every Scholar, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in a way quite <hi>contrary</hi> to what he
here pretends. First, laying six Principles <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on,</hi> then thirty others, which, since they
go before his Conclusions we are to think
he meant for Principles too, and thence
drawing in the Close, six Inferences or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels;
which is most manifestly to <hi>deduce
from</hi> Principles, not to <hi>reduce to</hi> them.</p>
            <p>5. But, however it be blameable in one
who owns himself a <hi>Scholar,</hi> especially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the rigorous and learned way of
proceeding by <hi>Principles,</hi> not to understand
the nature of the <hi>Way</hi> himself takes; yet let
us kindly suppose that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wariness
only, made use by chance of an
<hi>improper</hi> word; which being but a human
lapse, is more easily pardonable; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
since the Method he here undertakes,
<hi>viz.</hi> to begin with Principles, is (if rightly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62077:10"/>
manag'd and perform'd) the most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a Scholar, and the most satisfactory
that may be, and, so, deserving to make
amends for many greater faults. Let him
then by [<hi>reduc'd to Principles</hi>] mean <hi>deduc'd
from Principles</hi>] yet since both <hi>reducing</hi> and
<hi>deducing,</hi> imply the showing a <hi>Connexion</hi>
between those Principles, and what's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be drawn from them; and this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Immediate,</hi> as to every particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
or <hi>Mediate:</hi> We are to expect
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> should still show us this Connexion:
which is best and most clearly done, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
each of his six Conclusions to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Premisses or Principles: that <hi>so,</hi> by
this distinct proceeding and owning particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>whence</hi> each Deduction <hi>follows,</hi> we may
be better enabled to discover the Goodness
of his Consequences, and thence discern
clearly the Truth of those Conclusions;
which we are to suppose, his Intention in
making those Discourses.</p>
            <p>6. In the last place we are to weigh very
well what is meant by that signal and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularizing
word [<hi>Protestants:</hi>] for 'tis the
Faith of <hi>these</hi> and these <hi>only,</hi> which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
here to <hi>reduce to Principles.</hi> And I
will have the kindness for him, as to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he so much zeals the Purity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Church, as not to defile her with the
mixture of <hi>Anabaptists, Independents, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>

and such like, much less the most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
<hi>Socinians</hi> who deny the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
and the <hi>Godhead</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore, these
being secluded from the notion and name of
<hi>Protestants,</hi> we are encouraged by this Title
to expect such a Discourse as is not proper
for <hi>Socinians,</hi> or any of those other Sects to
alledge for themselves; otherwise it might
and ought with as much right be entitled
<hi>The Faith of Socinians, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> (as the
Faith of <hi>Protestants) reduc'd to Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sum then of what we are by this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to expect from Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is this; <hi>viz.</hi> to
shew us <hi>such</hi> Grounds for our Assent to
Points as divinely reveal'd, as are <hi>Impossible
to be Erroneous;</hi> and such as are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Allegations for <hi>Socinians, Arians, &amp;c.</hi>
but proper to <hi>Protestants</hi> only: Also, that
these Grounds or Principles are such as are
either <hi>self-evident</hi> or <hi>made evident.</hi> And this
he is oblig'd necessarily to do, unless he will
sustain either that <hi>Socinians, Fift-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists,
&amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Protestants;</hi> or, that the
<hi>Faith of Protestants</hi> is but <hi>Opinion;</hi> or, that
there can be any Principles which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evident of <hi>themselves</hi> nor by means of
<hi>others,</hi> that is, <hi>no ways</hi> evident, or <hi>not</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>at all:</hi> Or, lastly, that he can <hi>show</hi> us
any Conclusion <hi>reduc'd to Principles,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
from</hi> them, without shewing us that it
is <hi>connected</hi> with them. This then is what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62077:11"/>
Dr. <hi>St's</hi> words bid us expect from him; let

            <head>Second Examen.</head>
            <head type="sub">Six Principles agreed on by both sides exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
and their Import and Vse weigh'd.</head>
            <p>1. HE begins with laying down six
<hi>Principles agreed on by both sides;</hi>
and they are (as to the main) all of them
very <hi>True</hi> and <hi>granted</hi> by us, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood:
wherefore in case any ambiguous
word do occur, I am to explain it, that so
our perfect concurrence with him in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them may be rightly apprehended,
and the discourse more unoffensively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
in case these Principles should come
hereafter to be made use of. They are
these.</p>
            <p>1. That there is a God from whom Man
and all other Creatures had their Being.</p>
            <p>2. That the notion of God doth imply that he
is a Being absolutely perfect, and therefore,
Iustice, Goodness, Wisdome and Truth must
be in him to the highest degree of perfection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62077:12"/>
These two first are rigorously and literally
true, and worded very exactly.</p>
            <p>3. That man receiving his Being from God,
is thereby bound to obey his will, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is liable to punishment in case of Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>This Proposition is also most true; yet
that it may more throughly be penetrated
and rightly apprehended, it were not amiss
to note, that though the word [<hi>obey</hi>] gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
amongst us signifies doing some <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
action <hi>will'd</hi> by another, yet in this
occasion 'tis to signifie also, nay principally,
the exercising <hi>Interiour Acts</hi> of our soul,
<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> in which
kind of Acts consists our Spiritual Life, as
we are <hi>Christians.</hi> That then this Principle
may be better understood, I discourse it
thus; that, Because God, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
his own Inclination (or rather Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
precisely, out of his over-flowing
Goodness will all Good, and amongst the
rest, the Means to Eternal Happiness to his
Creatures; and the <hi>Believing</hi> in <hi>Him, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
all good from Him, and <hi>Loving</hi> him
are such Virtues or Perfections of the Soul
as are apt and connatural means to raise and
dispose it towards the attainment of Bliss or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62077:12"/>
Fruition of the Deity, hence he wills that
man should <hi>believe</hi> on him, <hi>hope</hi> in him, and
<hi>love</hi> him; whence are apt to follow the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
observances of his Law, and if they
follow not out of <hi>these</hi> motives they are not
properly <hi>virtues</hi> or truly Perfective of the
soul in order to its Last end, nor available
in the least to the attainment of Bliss; nor
Acts of <hi>Obedience</hi> to God's <hi>will,</hi> nor in true
speech the <hi>keeping his Commandments.</hi> God
therefore <hi>willing</hi> us Happiness to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
through the <hi>proper means</hi> to it, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that those who <hi>disobey</hi> this Holy <hi>will</hi> of
his, that is, those who do not cultivate
their minds with the said Virtues of Faith,
Hope and Charity, become <hi>liable</hi> by <hi>such</hi>
their <hi>disobedience</hi> to eternal misery; as want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through this neglect, the Proper <hi>Means</hi>
which is to elevate them to the capacity of
attaining Heaven.</p>
            <p>4. That in order to Man's obeying the Will
of God, it is necessary he know what it is; for
which some manifestation of the Will of God is
necessary, both that Man may know what he
hath to do, and that God may justly punish him,
if he do it not.</p>
            <p>5. Whatever God reveals to Man is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
true, and being intended for the Rule of
Man's obedience may be certainly known to be
his Will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62077:13"/>
I approve very wel of these two Principles.
And to this end I make it my request to the
Proposer of them, that the word [<hi>manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>]
and [<hi>certainly known</hi>] may be understood
in their proper signification for that which is
<hi>True,</hi> or <hi>Absolute Certainty;</hi> and not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
abusively as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> still takes it for such a
Certainty as is indeed <hi>Incertainty,</hi> as is shown
at large in <hi>Reason against Raillery and Faith
vindicated.</hi> Again, that we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be a <hi>Principle agreed to by both sides,</hi>
as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pretends, I shall first put down
our Tenet, which is; that (at least) the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of the Church, who are to teach the
Faithful, convert Unbelievers, (amongst
whom are many acute wits) as also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Faith, and make out the Truth of
it, may, nay must have Infallible Grounds,
and so be <hi>Infallibly</hi> or Knowingly <hi>Certain</hi> of
<hi>what God revealed to Man,</hi> that is, of their
<hi>Faith.</hi> If then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> grants the wisest por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Gods Church to be thus <hi>Infallibly
Certain</hi> of their Faith, we <hi>agree</hi> with him in
this Proposition; but if he denies this kind
of Certainty to them, and consequently
(there being no middle between <hi>Infallible</hi>
and <hi>Fallible</hi>) says they, and so, the whole
Church is only <hi>Fallibly-Certain</hi> of what they
believe; he both speaks <hi>non-sense,</hi> and lays
for a Principle <hi>agreed on by both sides,</hi> that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62077:13"/>
which is absolutely <hi>deny'd</hi> by us, and
indeed the main point in Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us.</p>
            <p>6. God cannot act contrary to those Essential
Attributes of Iustice, Wisdom, Goodness and
Truth in any way which he makes choice of to
make known his Will unto man by.</p>
            <p>This Principle is absolutely granted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Fault in it, but that it expresses not
all the Truth it ought; for <hi>God</hi> not only
cannot act <hi>contrary</hi> to those Essential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
but he is oblig'd by his very Nature
to act perfectly <hi>according</hi> to them, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choice of such a Way or Rule to make
known his Will unto man by, as shall be
(all things consider'd) most proper for
Mankind; that is, most suitable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Capacities of those who are to be
led by it, that so their Acts of Faith (as far
as they spring from the Provision of motives
laid by God) may be pefectly rational;
and also most effectual to the end for which
God intended that Rule and Faith which
depends on it.</p>
            <p>These are the six <hi>Principles</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as <hi>agreed to by both sides;</hi> which (in the
main, and thus understood) are of so
<hi>universal</hi> a Nature, and such <hi>sacred</hi> Truths,
that if he draws any necessary consequences
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62077:14"/>
from them to the establishing the Faith of
Protestants, or overthrowing that of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
(which latter seems chiefly intended)
his Victory is likely to be very compleat; If
he does not, but rather makes no use at
all of them in concluding from them
what he pretends, and his Title imports, it
must needs be understood that they were
only produc'd to make a plausible show,
and to prepare the Readers mind to Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
he must necessarily conquer all before
him, having such sacred Principles engag'd
in his Patronage.</p>
            <p>One thing more I am to add on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
which is, that no discourse at all
can proceed, unless <hi>all</hi> the Principles be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to by both sides;</hi> for, if the Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom we argue deny our Principles,
'tis a folly to hope by means of them, to
force him to admit of the Conclusion depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
solely on those Principles for its Truth
and Evidence. But we are to reflect, that
an Adversary may two manner of ways
grant us our Principles; either <hi>voluntarily</hi>
and of his own accord; or else <hi>forcibly,</hi> that
is, convinc'd by strength of Argument, if
the Principles be subordinate ones, and so
can admit Proof; or for fear of shame from
Human Nature, if they either be <hi>First</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
or that the Controversy by discourse
be reduc'd to that <hi>most Evident</hi> Test. Since
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62077:14"/>
then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> makes account we yeild him
but these six <hi>voluntarily,</hi> we are to expect
from him such manifest proofs for the other
thirty, as may make us by the clearness of
their Evidence, or under the penalty of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Mankind our Enemy for deserting Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Nature, assent to their verity: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
there is no hopes for him to conclude
any thing at all, while we are at liberty to
deny every thing he builds on. But alas!
how far is it from such Talking Disputants,
even to <hi>think</hi> of such performances; though
the necessity of his duty, if he pretends to
Principles, obliges him unavoidably to it.</p>

         <div n="3" type="examination">
            <head>Third Examen.</head>
            <head type="sub">Sifting the first nine Principles that seem to
concern the Nature of Divine Revelation
in Common, and its several ways.</head>
            <p>AFter these six Principles <hi>agreed on,</hi>
follow thirty other Paragraphs, or
whatever else we may guess it fit to call
them; and they are introduc'd by this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>These things being agreed on both sides, we
are now to inquire into the particular ways
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62077:15"/>
which God hath made choice of for revealing his
Will to mankind.</p>
            <p>I expected that since Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had promis'd
us to <hi>reduce the Faith of Protestants to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
he would after he had put down the
Principles voluntarily <hi>agreed to by both sides,</hi>
have pursu'd the Method himself had made
choice of, and have produc'd next, the
Principles made use of by him in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
matter which we are not <hi>voluntarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on;</hi> and either have maintain'd them
to be First Principles, and so, <hi>self-evident;</hi>
or else <hi>subordinate</hi> ones, and deriving their
Evidence from those First, and therefore
have shown us their <hi>derivation</hi> from them,
or <hi>Connection</hi> with them. This had been a
Method becoming a man pretending to
ground himself on Principles, especially in
a discourse where this, and this only was
pretended; for by this means it might, as
reason requires, have been examin'd first,
whether those Principles had subsisted or no
in themselves; which, if they had, then on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Consequences had needed Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and so the Business of Truth had been
quickly decided.</p>
            <p>2. But, instead of this candid and clear
and Methodical proceeding, thirty odd
kind of Sentences, Sections, Paragraphs, or
I know not what, come hudling in one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62077:15"/>
another, of such uncouth fashions, such
desperate and disagreeing natures, so void
of coherence with one another, that none
knows well what to call them, not even
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself, as appears by the Carriage
of the matter. Some of them seem deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Principles agreed on. Others
seem to contain Intire discourses of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Illative particle [<hi>therefore</hi>] or
its Equivalent, which necessarily Ushers
in all Conclusions, is so rarely heard of here,
that one would verily think they were all
Premisses or Principles; but this Conceit is
again thwarted, because divers of them are
meerly Hypothetical Propositions, invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sometimes such a condition as never
was put; others are bare voluntary Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and False into the bargain. Some few
of them pretend modestly to own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
deductions from some other Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs,
but yet onely hint it afar off, as it
were, not speak it out plainly, as if they
fear'd some danger: Others pretend to
draw a Consequence in their Close, not at
all following from the part foregoing. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the whole mass of them hang together
like <hi>a rope of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and</hi> for want of declaring their
Relation to others; and, though now and
then they counterfeit a semblance of some
sleight coherence, yet their whole Frame is
loose and ill-built for want of an orderly and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62077:16"/>
visible dependance of one part on another.
Now, this odd variety in their Complexions
puts an attentive Considerer at some loss
what to name them; no Apellation fitting
the thirty but that which is common to such
Quantities of matter or Multitudes of lines
(whether it be sense or non-sense) such as
are Paragraphs, Sections, and such like: since
their motly nature will neither let us call
them Deductions, nor Conclusions, nor
Principles, nor Propositions, nor Discourses,
nor Inferences, nor <hi>Postulatums,</hi> nor Axioms,
nor Maxims, nor Proofs, nor any thing of
any such nature; and yet all this while the
superscription is, <hi>The Faith of Protestants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It were not amiss for all that, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself calls them, and
to hope thence for some better knowledge
of their nature than we could attain to by
our own Consideration. But he is at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with himself about the point, no one
common name being capable to fit them all,
where the things to be named are of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Parishes or Families. All he does (as
appears by his Transition) to make them all
taken together, amount to an <hi>Inquiry into
the particular ways which God had made choice
of for revealing his Will to mankind.</hi> I do not
by any means like this Insignificant word
[<hi>Inquiry</hi>] 'Tis so very <hi>safe,</hi> that 'tis abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62077:16"/>
               <hi>Inconfutable.</hi> Had he said candidly
and plainly, [Here follow the Principles
<hi>not agreed on voluntarily</hi> which therefore I
will make Evident, that my Adversary's
Reason may be forc'd to acknowledg their
verity, and by that means my discourse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and way be made towards some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion]
he had offer'd me some play, for
then I might possibly have discover'd the
weakness or Inevidence of his Principles,
or the slackness of his Consequences; but
now all my Attempts are defeated by this
one pretty word [<hi>Inquiry</hi>] for though I
should hap to confute every line in all the
thirty Paragraphs, yet still after all this,
none can deny but he has <hi>inquir'd</hi> into the
Point in hand, whether he have produc'd
one word to <hi>evince</hi> it, or no: Thus Dr. <hi>T.</hi>
(in his late Preface) got rid of the hardest
and mainly concerning passage in <hi>Sure-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
by vertue of two insignificant words,
alledging that he had [<hi>sufficiently consider'd</hi>]
it in his Rule of Faith, which words were
perfectly verify'd, though (as appears in
<hi>Reason against Raillery Disc. 8th</hi>) he <hi>readily
granted</hi> all I contended for as to that point.
Once more I desire our Learned Readers to
reflect on the different manner in which I
and my Adversaries bear our selves towards
one another. I candidly avow my Grounds
to be Evident <hi>Principles,</hi> my <hi>Consequences</hi> to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62077:17"/>
be <hi>necessary,</hi> my <hi>Arguments</hi> to be absolutely-<hi>Conclusive</hi>
or <hi>demonstrative;</hi> and by so doing
I offer them all the fair play imaginable;
and, (trusting to the invincible force of
Truth) expose my self freely for them to
lay hold of my discourse where they see it
their best Advantage. They on the other side
make a show indeed of bringing their Faith
to <hi>Principles,</hi> because the very pretence is
honorable; but when it comes to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
are so far from owning the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
they proceed on for such, that (except
in those six agreed on, which, as shall be
shown, are not one jot influential to the
point they are aim'd to evince) they not so
much as name the word [<hi>Principle</hi>] nor
vouch any Argument <hi>Conclusive,</hi> or any
<hi>Consequence</hi> to be <hi>Necessary,</hi> much less can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly
affirm such in particular to be thus
qualifi'd; but hide and obscure all these in
one dow-bak'd slippery word [<hi>Inquiry</hi>] by
which means none can tell where to take
any sure hold of any part of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>4. Notwithstanding that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is thus
shy to name these thirty Paragraphs, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
in regard they are so monstrously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
those Clear and Evident Truths, which
use, and ought to bear that sacred name;
yet 'tis manifest by his carriage he <hi>meant</hi>
them for such, and would have them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62077:17"/>
               <hi>thought</hi> such too; for they immediately
<hi>follow</hi> after the <hi>six Principles voluntarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on,</hi> as if they were the <hi>other</hi> sort of
Principles, <hi>not voluntarily agreed to;</hi> and all
of them <hi>antecede</hi> his six <hi>Conclusions</hi> or Sequels
which he puts immediately to <hi>follow</hi> out of
them. Again, the Running Title super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
to them is, [<hi>The Faith of Protestants
reduc'd to Principles:</hi>] All which manifests
to us beyond Evasion that he makes use of
and relies on them as Principles, though he
be something bashful to call them so <hi>directly.</hi>
Wherefore in compliance with his Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we will for once strain a word to the
highest <hi>Catachresis</hi> that may be, and by a
strange <hi>Antiphrasis,</hi> call <hi>Black, White,</hi> and
all these Paragraphs, <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Yet, though there be nothing of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
and clear and consonant to any max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
even of Natural Logick in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
yet I must allow that there is as much
cunning and slight and Sophistry in it, as
could well be stufft into so narrow a room:
Wherefore, that I may not be like him, I
shall openly profess before hand what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake,
<hi>viz.</hi> to show plainly that he hath
not spoke one efficacious word to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he intended; that is, he has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
any one Principle, one Reason, one
Argument, either settling in the least, the
Faith of Protestants, nor unsetling that of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62077:18"/>
Catholicks. This will be seen by our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of each particular Principle in
order, and the Answer to them. To which I
now address.</p>
            <p>1. An entire Obedience to the Will of God
being agreed to be the condition of mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
no other way of Revelation is in it self
necessary to that end; than such whereby man
may know what the Will of God is.</p>
            <p>Love of God above all things, and of our
Neighbour for his sake being the <hi>Fulfilling
of the Law,</hi> does by consequence include in
it self eminently an <hi>Intire Obedience to the
Will of God,</hi> and is agreed to be the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mans Happiness.</hi> Yet this <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
presupposing <hi>Hope,</hi> and both <hi>Hope</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> presupposing <hi>Faith</hi> as their <hi>Basis;</hi> both
of these do by consequence come within the
compass of <hi>Obeying the Will of God,</hi> and are
in their several manners and according to
their several natures [<hi>Conditions of mans
Happiness.</hi>] as I doubt not but all sober
Protestants will grant.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Faith</hi> being part of our <hi>Obedience</hi>
to the Will of God, and so, <hi>commanded</hi> by
him, and it being against those Attributes
of God <hi>agreed on by both sides,</hi> to command
Man to act contrary to the right Nature
himself had given him and establish'd it Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62077:18"/>
to him, that is, contrary to <hi>true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
Also, Faith being a <hi>Virtue,</hi> and so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>right Nature,</hi> nay more, a <hi>supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Virtue, and so, <hi>perfecting</hi> and elevating
Right Nature or True Reason, not <hi>debasing</hi>
or destroying it; it follows, from these and
many other Reasons alledg'd in <hi>Faith Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi>
that this part of our Obedience call'd
[<hi>Faith</hi>] must be <hi>rationabile obsequium,</hi> a
Reasonable Obedience, and that our Assent
call'd [<hi>Belief</hi>] taking it as impos'd by God,
is conformable to Maxims of Right Reason,
and that it perfects, and not in the least
perverts <hi>Human Nature.</hi> But it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposit to Human Nature as given us by
God, or to Right Reason, to assent and

concerning their Truth, cannot possibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to see any Grounds absolutely Certain,
that the Divine Authority is <hi>indeed</hi> engag'd
for the Truth of the said Points. Also, 'tis
quite opposite to Human Nature to love

the sight of Him: wherefore, when Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
says <hi>no other way of Revelation is in it self ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to this end,</hi> or to the <hi>Entire Obedience
to Gods Will, than such whereby man may know
what the Will of God is;</hi> we are to mean by
the word [<hi>know</hi>] that at least the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
part of Gods Church, or <hi>Ecclesia do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi>
may be <hi>absolutly-certain</hi> that the Points
of Faith, (the assenting to and professing
which, and grounding upon them <hi>Hope</hi>
and this all-over-powering <hi>Love</hi> of Heaven,
the main part of our Obedience) are <hi>True</hi>
or <hi>Impossible</hi> to be False. If then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> takes
the word <hi>know</hi> in this signification, this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
is granted: if in any other, or for a
great <hi>Hope</hi> only that they are True (as I
fear when it comes to the point, he intends
no more) I must for the Reasons here given,
and many more alledg'd in <hi>Faith Vindicated,</hi>
and <hi>Reason against Raillery,</hi> deny that <hi>no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way of Revelation is necessary,</hi> and put
him to prove it, which he neither <hi>has</hi> done,
nor <hi>can</hi> do.</p>
            <p>2. Man being fram'd a rational Creature
capable of reflecting upon himself may antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
to any External Revelation, certainly
know the Being of God and his dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; and those things which are naturally
pleasing unto him; else there could be no such
thing as a Law of Nature, or any Principles of
Natural Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62077:19"/>
I suppose he means by the word [<hi>God</hi>] the
<hi>True</hi> God, and then 'tis not so evident that
every Man in the state of <hi>corrupt</hi> Nature
may arrive to <hi>know</hi> him, however some few
may, and in the State of <hi>Right</hi> Nature, <hi>All.</hi>
And in case he takes the words [<hi>certainly
know</hi>] in their proper signification, then he
may consider how ill his Friend Dr. <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
discourses, who professes not to have,
even with the assistance of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that
<hi>Certain Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Being of God,</hi> which
(as Dr. <hi>Still</hi> says) was attainable by the
meer Light of Natural Reason.</p>
            <p>3. All Supernatural and External Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must suppose the truth of Natural Religion;
for, unless we be antecedently certain that
there is a God, and that we are capable of
knowing him, it is impossible to be certain that
God hath reveal'd his will to us by any superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
means.</p>
            <p>If he means here <hi>Priority</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> 'tis
to be granted; for this Proposition [<hi>God
has reveal'd</hi>] implies and presupposes as its
<hi>basis</hi> [<hi>God is</hi>] But, if he understands it of
priority of <hi>Time,</hi> as I conceive he does, then
I both deny the Proposition, and the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Reason given for it. For, 'tis Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
both by Reason and Experience, that
manifest and Convictive Miracles (which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62077:20"/>
are <hi>supernatural</hi> and <hi>external Revelations</hi>)
done before the Heathens, who yet know
not the <hi>true God,</hi> in Testimony of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianty,
<hi>at once</hi> or at the same time made
it certain that he whom we adore is the
<hi>True God,</hi> and also that <hi>God reveal'd his
will by supernatural means:</hi> and so 'tis not
<hi>Impossible</hi> (as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> here affirms) to be
certain of <hi>such</hi> a Revelation, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any time <hi>before hand</hi> that there is a God,
nor <hi>must All Supernatural and External Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
needs <hi>suppose the Truth of Natural
Religion,</hi> that is, of the Knowledge of the
True God, as he pretends; since such a
Revelation may <hi>cause</hi> that Knowledge, and
so <hi>antecede</hi> it, not be antecedent to it.</p>
            <p>4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nothing ought to be admitted for Divine
Revelation which overthrows the Certainty of
those Principles which must be antecedently
suppos'd to all Divine Revelation. For that
were to overthrow the means whereby we are to
judge concerning the Truth of any Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
            <p>This Discourse seems at the first show to
carry so clear an evidence with it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appears so Irrational as to doubt or
dispute it. And indeed 'tis no less, if the
words in which it is couch'd be not equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
taken, but still be meant in the same
sence. To prevent then the growth of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62077:20"/>
piece of Sophistry which I foresee creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in under the disguise of an ambiguous
word, I am to provide against it with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
both pertinent and necessary to the
present matter.</p>
            <p>These words [<hi>Divine Revelation</hi>] may
either mean the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Revealing,</hi> or
else they may mean the <hi>Thing divinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Point of Faith:</hi> which
differ as <hi>showing</hi> and <hi>thing shown,</hi> or as an
<hi>Action</hi> and it's <hi>Effect.</hi> In the same manner
as the word <hi>Tradition</hi> is sometimes taken
for the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Delivery,</hi> sometimes for the
<hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Point delivered.</hi> When they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the <hi>one,</hi> when for the <hi>other,</hi> partly
the circumstances and the aim of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
determin, partly some annext parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or variation of the word; so that, if they
be taken for the <hi>Thing</hi> reveal'd or deliver'd,
and be express'd singularly, 'tis call'd <hi>A
Divine Revelation,</hi> or <hi>A Tradition;</hi> If plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> or <hi>Traditions.</hi>
Now it seems something doubtful in whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense it be taken <hi>here,</hi> for §. 1. he speaks
of the <hi>Way of Revelation,</hi> which can onely
mean <hi>Revealing,</hi> and in the two following
ones 'tis taken in the same sense as appears
by the words [<hi>God hath reveal'd</hi>] found in
the Third. But this matters not much, so
it be here taken in the same sense through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
which I fear 'tis not; For, the word
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62077:21"/>
[<hi>Revelation</hi>] is here made use of thrice; and,
in the first and last place it seems plainly to
mean the <hi>Points revealed;</hi> in the middle the
<hi>Way</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Revealing;</hi> yet the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Principles incline the doubtfulness
of the Expression to mean the <hi>Points of
Faith</hi> themselves; Though this be, to speak
moderately, by far the more preposterous
and absurd Tenet, as shall hereafter be
shown. But I am to provide for both parts
since I am to skirmish with such an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dextrous
Adversary; and therefore, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this discourse to his Proposition, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
thus, and grant that <hi>Nothing ought
to be admitted for Divine Revelation</hi> (taking
those words to signifie the <hi>Act</hi> of Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<hi>which overthrows the Certainty of those
Principles which must be antecedently supposed
to the Act of Revealing:</hi> Also I grant that
<hi>nothing ought to be admitted for Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
(taking those words to signifie <hi>Points
of Faith revealed) which overthrows the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of those Principles which must be ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently
suppos'd to those Points.</hi> This is candid
and clear dealing, and far from that sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
and equivocating ambiguity which
(contrary to the <hi>Genius</hi> of Truth) he so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and so industriously affects.</p>
            <p>5. There can be no other means imagin'd
whereby we are to judge of the Truth of Divine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62077:21"/>
Revelation, but a Faculty in us of discerning
Truth and Falshood in matters proposed to our
Belief; which if we do not exercise in judging
the Truth of Divine Revelation, we must be
impos'd upon by every thing which pretends to
be so.</p>
            <p>Here are many quaint things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
For, if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> means that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>judge of Truth</hi> without a <hi>Faculty to judge
of Truth,</hi> 'tis a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Principle,
though very litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his purpose. But 'tis
most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oxical to say that <hi>no
other means can be imagin'd to judge of Divine
Revelation,</hi> but such a <hi>Faculty.</hi> For, if <hi>there
can be no other means imagin'd</hi> but this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi>
then This is <hi>all</hi> the means; and so
those <hi>Knowledges</hi> which are to inform and
direct this <hi>Faculty</hi> are <hi>no</hi> means at all:
whence all <hi>motives</hi> to Faith, <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith,
all Teaching, nay Scripture it self are to no
purpose; For none of these are <hi>our Faculty
of discerning Truth and Falshood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, what is meant here by [<hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation?</hi>]
If it be meant of the formal <hi>Act</hi>
of <hi>Revealing,</hi> then 'tis False that <hi>there can be
no other means to judge of its Truth but a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in us of discerning Truth and Falshood in
matters proposed to our Belief:</hi> For these
<hi>Matters</hi> are <hi>Points</hi> of Faith, and 'tis a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to think we must begin with examining
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62077:22"/>
               <hi>their</hi> Truth ere we can know that God has
<hi>truly</hi> or indeed <hi>reveal'd</hi> them; since the
Knowledge that God has reveal'd or spoken
is had ordinarily by natural means antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
even to the Revelation it self, much
more antecedent to those Points; <hi>viz.</hi> by
the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which shows the Divine
Authority engag'd for their Truth. But, if
he means by <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> the things or
<hi>Points divinely reveal'd,</hi> and (as appears by
those words [<hi>matters propos'd to our belief</hi>] he
bends strongly that way) then the sense is
evidently this, that we must <hi>judge</hi> the truth
of the Points of Faith by <hi>exercising a Faculty
of judging</hi> of the Truth of those Points: And
since <hi>to judge</hi> is <hi>to exercise our Faculty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
it amounts plainly to this, that we must
judge of the truth of Points of Faith by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the truth of points of Faith; which is
an Identical Proposition and perfectly true,
but not at all to his purpose. Yet it is too:
for 'tis creditable now and then to speak
<hi>clear Evidences,</hi> however in reality they
prove <hi>Impertinencies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> means nothing but that we
must use our Faculty of discerning Truth
and Falshood, that is indeed our <hi>Reason</hi> even
in Assenting to things <hi>above</hi> Reason, or to
<hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> he says very right: For
'tis most Rational to believe that to be True
which God, who is essential Verity, <hi>has
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62077:22"/>
said;</hi> and exceedingly Rational to believe
God <hi>has said it,</hi> or (which is all one in our
case) that Christ and his Apostles have
taught it, upon an Authority <hi>Inerrable</hi> in
that affair. And thus my Faith may be most
Rational without exercising my Reason in
scanning and debating the <hi>Truth or Falshood
of the matters propos'd to my Belief,</hi> or examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith themselves. Nay
more this Method of his is most preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and absurd; For, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> or
<hi>Points of Faith</hi> being elevated above the
pitch of our ordinary Natural Reason, and
such, (for the most part) in which Gods
Infinity most exerts (as we may say) It's
utmost, but the Knowledge of the <hi>Rule of
Faith</hi> which is to ascertain to us the Divine
Revelation or that God has told us them,
lying level to our Reason as inform'd by
natural Knowledges; hence, to relinquish
the method of examining the Truth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation by those Knowledges
which lie within our own ken, and to begin
with those which are most elevated above
it (as it is to comprehend the extent of Gods
Infinite Power) is both against all Art and
Common sense: Both which tell us we
must begin with what's <hi>more easily</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and thence proceed to what is <hi>less</hi>
Knowable. Nor is there any danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>impos'd upon by everything that pretends
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62077:23"/>
to be Divine Revelation</hi> (as the Dr. scruples,)
as long as we are Certain that <hi>God cannot lie,</hi>
and that <hi>God has said this;</hi> for these put,
the thing is <hi>most certainly True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The pretence of Infallibility in any person
or Society of men must be judged in the same
way that the Truth of a Divine Revelation is;
for that Infallibility being challeng'd by virtue
of a supernatural Assistance, and for that end
to assure men what the will of God is, the same
means must be us'd for the trial of that, as for
any other supernatural way of God's making
known his Will to men.</p>
            <p>Here the words [<hi>A Divine Revelation</hi>]
which he now <hi>first</hi> uses, give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> means <hi>a Point of Faith</hi> and
not <hi>Gods Revealing</hi> it or <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi>
which words he us'd formerly. And this is
farther confirm'd by his saying that <hi>that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
which is challeng'd by vertue of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Assistance must be judg'd in the same
way that the Truth of a Divine Revelation is:</hi>
For, such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> through <hi>supernatural</hi>
Assistance of the Holy Ghost, consists in the
<hi>Sanctity</hi> of the Church, which is a <hi>Point of
Faith,</hi> and so the words [<hi>A Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>]
which he joyns and parallels to it,
must mean a <hi>Point</hi> of Faith also. Whence is
discern'd what marvellous dexterity Dr.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62077:23"/>
               <hi>St.</hi> hath us'd to gain a notable Point against
us, and how smoothly he hath slided from
<hi>Gods revealing</hi> Faith to us, or the <hi>Act</hi> call'd
<hi>Revelation,</hi> to the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith <hi>reveal'd:</hi>
In hope by this confounding one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to perswade his unattentive Reader;
that, because 'tis the only right way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
to begin with the using our natural
Reason so to judge whether <hi>God hath Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
such a point or no; therefore 'tis fit to
begin with the same Method in examining
the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith themselves which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be <hi>reveal'd,</hi> and thence conclude
whether they be indeed divinely reveal'd or
no: which how absurd it is hath lately been
shown.</p>
            <p>But to come closer and apply this to his
present Discourse. <hi>The Pretence of Infallibility
by virtue of supernatural Assistance must</hi> indeed
<hi>be judged in the same way that the truth of a
Divine Revelation is;</hi> for both of them being
<hi>Points of Faith</hi> must be judged by the same
way all other points of Faith are; <hi>viz.</hi> by
the Evidence there is that the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
cannot deceive, and that it stands enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for those Points.</p>
            <p>7. It being in the power of God to make
choice of several ways of revealing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Will to us,
we ought not to dispute from the Attributes of
God the necessity of one particular w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62077:24"/>
of all others, but we ought to enquire what
way God himself hath chosen; and whatever he
hath done, we are sure cannot be repugnant
to Infinite Iustice, Wisdome, Goodness and
Truth.</p>
            <p>I do not remember to have heard that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man living ever went about to dispute
from the Attributes of God <hi>alone, the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of one particular way to the Exclusion of all
others,</hi> nor does it appear how 'tis possible to
do it without considering <hi>also</hi> the Nature of
those several <hi>ways</hi> of Revealing: in doing
which if we come to discover that only <hi>one</hi>
is (as things stand) of it self <hi>sufficient</hi> for
that End, and all <hi>others</hi> pretended to by those
against whom we dispute <hi>depend</hi> on <hi>It</hi> for
their Certainty, then they can safely argue
from the Attributes of God, particularly his
<hi>Wisdome</hi> that none but this could have been
actually chosen by him. So that Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
seems here to counterfeit an <hi>imaginary</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
having never a <hi>Real</hi> one. This will
better appear if we attempt to frame a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
from Gods Attributes <hi>alone.</hi> In en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
which it will appear that all we
can argue from that single Head is this; that,
<hi>Whats disagreeable to Gods infinite Iustice,
Wisdome, Goodness, and Truth cannot be will'd
by him, and what's agreeable can.</hi> Now who
sees not that this signifies nothing either to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62077:24"/>
the Exclusion or Admission of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Way, unless we subsume thus, <hi>But this or
that is most agreeable or disagreeable to the said
Attributes;</hi> whence follows, <hi>therefore it is
to be admitted, or rejected by him.</hi> Whence 'tis
clearly seen that no Argument can be drawn
from those Attributes <hi>alone</hi> without taking
in the consideration of the nature of the <hi>Way</hi>
it self, and its sufficiency or insufficiency, as
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself confesses in common at the
end of the 8th Principle, though he perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
avoids to examin the particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Way, and its Fitness of mankind
to build Faith upon its evidence. Yet let us
see at least though it be so plain a point how
weakly he proves that we are not to argue
from those Attributes, <hi>It being</hi> (says he)
<hi>in the power of God to make choice of several
ways,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we ought not to dispute from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God the necessity of one particular,</hi>
&amp;c. so that the Argument stands thus, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis within the extent of Gods <hi>Power,</hi>
therefore it crosses not but agrees with all
those other Attributes; otherwise, if it did,
we could with good reason <hi>argue</hi> from them
against Gods having made choice of such a
way. Now this reason of his is so palpably
absurd that I admire the meanest Divine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
could stumble upon it. For what man
who holds God <hi>Omnipotent</hi> can doubt but
that his <hi>Power</hi> can reach to reveal his Will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62077:25"/>
to every single man by hourly Apparitions,
the flying of Birds, nocturnal Dreams, or
throwing of Dice upon a Fortune-book:
yet no wise man will doubt but were we to
inquire what is the way <hi>fit</hi> for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
his Will to mankind by, we should
reject these as misbecoming Gods Wisdom,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the same reason all others but
<hi>one,</hi> in case noneX but <hi>that one</hi> were <hi>of it self</hi>
qualified to do that Effect as it <hi>ought,</hi> and so
befitting Gods Wisdome to make choice of
it; and yet, notwithstanding all this, it
might lie within the the compass of the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
of God to chuse several others.</p>
            <p>It follows; <hi>but we ought to enquire what
way God himself hath chosen; and whatever
he hath done we are sure cannot be repugnant to
Infinit Iustice, Wisdom, Goodness and Truth.</hi> All
this is yeilded to, unless he means this to
be the <hi>only</hi> way of arguing from Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
as he would seem; which I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and demand of him why 'tis not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Argumentative to say, This way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
or Rule of Faith, as both Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Reason shows, is evidently incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to give Faith that Certainty which
its Nature and the many Effects to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by it, and Obligations incumbent on
it, require it should have; therefore I am
sure 'tis repugnant to Gods Justice, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Goodness and Truth, and so can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62077:25"/>
have been chosen by him. Or thus; <hi>God
is infinitly Wise, Good, Iust and True; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he hath not chosen a way so Incompetent to
those Ends.</hi> In the same manner as out of
the known Incapacity of a sieve to draw
water, or to ferry one over the Sea to the
<hi>Indies,</hi> we may conclude demonstratively
that 'tis unbeseeming Gods Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Goodness, Justice and Truth to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
that for a Means to attain that End:
Or, if God in some extraordinary case in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
such a Miracle, 'tis necessary all
those who are to use those means be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
assur'd of this wonderful Assistance;
otherwise if they compass not that End, but
perish in the Sea, they may blame their
own presumptuous rashness (which would
needs tempt God) for their miscarriage
and not <hi>God,</hi> who never bound himself by
promise in frequent and ordinary transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to bring about Effects miraculously by
<hi>Imcompetent</hi> Causes. How weakly Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
presumes rather than proves that God <hi>has
chosen</hi> Scriptures Letter to be <hi>the Rule of
Faith</hi> will be seen hereafter.</p>
            <p>8. Whatever way is capable of certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
the Will of God to us may be made
choice of by him for the means of making known
his Will in order to the happiness of Mankind.
So that no Argument can be sufficient <hi>à priori,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62077:26"/>
to prove that God cannot chuse any particular
way to reveal his mind by, but such which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
proves the Insufficiency of that means for
conveying the Will of God to us.</p>
            <p>First, Taking the words [<hi>certain convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>]
to mean <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> as I prov'd
before in this, and in divers Treatises of
mine to be requisit, I am next to distinguish
the word [<hi>capable</hi>] which may either mean
that the Way <hi>in common</hi> may <hi>possibly</hi> bear it,
in case it shall please God to use his <hi>best
Power</hi> to improve it, and make up its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
with all the Assistances it can need. Or
it may mean that such a <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner,</hi> as
it stands now on foot in the world (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the Scriptures Letter as 'tis now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd)
is <hi>of it self capable</hi> of conveying the
will of God to us with absolute Certainty,
without needing any other Thing to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
us in the understanding it. Whatever
is <hi>capable</hi> in the later sense I grant <hi>may be
made choice of by God for the means of making
known his will:</hi> For, <hi>this</hi> being suppos'd to
have in it self actually all that is requisite
for such an effect, is fitting to be made use of
by God, whose Wisdome and Goodness it
becomes (when he acts not miraculously)
to use every thing <hi>as it is</hi> or according
to its <hi>nature</hi> establish'd by the same Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
But I deny that what is <hi>capable</hi> in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62077:26"/>
former sense may alwaies be thus made
choice of by God; For, however such a
<hi>way</hi> in common may be made <hi>capable</hi> to do
that effect, if it should please God to exert
his Power to support its natural defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as is exemplifi'd before in Dreams,
Apparitions, and those other odd methods
there mention'd; yet 'tis unsuitable to Gods
Wisdome, Goodness or other Attributes to
show himself so extraordinarily in things
which reach the Generality of Mankind,
and this for a perpetuity, and so ought to
be allow'd onely his ordinary Concourse;
especially if <hi>other</hi> means be already plac'd
in the world able to perform this with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
orderly and connatural assistance. If
then we can prove the Insufficiency of any
Particular means (taking it alone as 'tis
now found extant) belonging to such a way
in Common, for example of the Scriptures
Letter <hi>as it now is,</hi> to give Mankind <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Certainty</hi> of Gods sense, or <hi>Faith;</hi> then,
however the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Writing</hi> in Common can
possibly be supported by Gods Infinit <hi>Power</hi>
so as to be able to work the Effect of thus
Certifying us of its sense, yet not being such
of its own nature, taking it as it stands now
thus contriv'd, 'tis not a fitting Instrument
for Gods ordinary Providence to make use
of for such a general Effect as is the Certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all sorts of people of their Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62077:27"/>
9 There are several ways conceivable by us
how God may make known his will to us; either
by Immediate voice from Heaven, or inward
Inspiration to every particular person; or inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
some to speak personally to others; or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
them with an Infallible Spirit in Writing
such Books which shall contain the Will of God
for the benefit of distant persons and future
Ages.</p>
            <p>All this is granted and much more; for
there are innumerable other ways conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
how God <hi>may</hi> make known his Will to
us, besides those here recounted, in case we
regard only Gods <hi>Power</hi> to do it, and set
aside his Wisdome and other Attributes;
namely those four ways mention'd by me
above, and multitudes of other such. But,
out of all these, Gods Wisdome, which has
pre-establish'd the nature of all things, will
make choice of That which is fittest to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Effect intended, that is, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
absolutely the first deliver'd Faith to us
who live now. And, left it should be too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood which Way is best for that
End, which would forestall and render void
Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s future discourses, he therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
politickly quite leaves out any peculiar
mention of <hi>our</hi> Rule of Faith, which one
might have thought deserv'd a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62077:27"/>
the rest. <hi>Leaves out</hi> I say, for those
words [<hi>or inspiring some to speak personally to
others</hi>] sute better with <hi>Prophetical</hi> Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
than with the <hi>Tradition of Gods Church.</hi>
Wherefore, premising this Note, that it is
agreed Christ and his Apostles taught and
settled the whole Body of Faith at first, and
therefore that there needs no more <hi>for us to
know Gods Will</hi> now, but to find out what is
the <hi>best</hi> means of conveying <hi>the same</hi> down
to our days, I beg leave to supply Dr.<hi>St's.</hi>
neglects, and to insert into the middle of
this §. these words, [<hi>or else by the way of open
Attestation of a world of Immediate Christian
Fathers to a world of Children by living voice
and constant practice of what they had learn'd
by their daily sensations.</hi>] which had Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
done, any considerate Reader, whom his
much talking of <hi>Gods Power</hi> and what God
<hi>may do,</hi> had not diverted from reflecting
that his Wisdom determins his Power in
ordinary and General Effects to do what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
to the establish'd natures of things
is the fittest means to compass such an end,
would quickly have inclin'd to judge this
the most connatural and fittest way, and
therefore actually to have been made choice
of by God; being assisted or supported by
the <hi>basis</hi> of Human <hi>Nature</hi> according to its
<hi>Sensations</hi> which are naturally fram'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
right Impressions, and according to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62077:28"/>
his <hi>Rational</hi> Faculty, which determins him
to speak <hi>Truth</hi> still in <hi>open</hi> and undisguisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>matters of Fact;</hi> and, if that Body of
men call'd <hi>the Church</hi> had any effectual
means of Goodness in practice amongst
them, <hi>super-assisted</hi> also by <hi>Grace</hi> not to v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from right Faith, and knowingly deliver
a False for a True one.</p>
            <p>And thus ends the first Division of Dr.
<hi>St</hi>'s. Discourse promising <hi>to reduce the Faith
of Protestants to Principles.</hi> In which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
but a few things even hinted that can
make for his purpose: and not so much as
any one of them prov'd, but either slightly
and slily insinuated, or dexterously brought
in, not by <hi>Connexion of Terms,</hi> (far be any
such piece of <hi>Confidence</hi> from so Learned
and profound a Jeerer at <hi>Demonstration</hi>) but
by the virtue of some pretty Equivocation.
I remind the Reader of the chief of them by
putting some of my opposite Propositions,
each of which is made good in its respective
place.</p>
            <p>1. An Entire Obedience to the Will of God
is principally performed by a heartily-assenting
Faith, a Lively Hope, and an Ardent Charity,
and not by outward actions otherwise than as
they spring from these; therefore the way of
Gods revealing his Will to us, or the Rule of
Faith which grounds these, must be absolutely-certain
or Impossible to be False.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62077:28"/>
2. The Nature of the Mysteries or Points
of Faith are more remov'd from our knowledge
than those Maxims which assure us that God
reveal'd them; therefore 'tis not proper to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with examining those Points but the
Grounds for Gods revealing them.</p>
            <p>3. This way of proceeding is perfectly secure;
for, the Divine Authority being granted veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
if there be Infallible Grounds that God has
said them, those Points are Infallibly True: If
not, they are not Points of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith;</hi> and so,
not worth examining whether they be True
or no.</p>
            <p>4. Gods <hi>Power</hi> alone gives us no Light
what is or is not the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but his
Wisdom, Goodness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> joyn'd with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Fitness or Vnfitness of the Thing
pretended to be so.</p>
            <p>5. Gods Wisdome makes choice of that way
to reveal his Will to the Generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
which, according to its nature as now
establish'd, is a capable or fit Instrument to such
an Effect; and not by that way which is only
capable to do it by an extraordinary working of
his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These may serve for Antidotes to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Positions, if he thinks fit to own
them. For, though he is able to deliver
himself as clearly as most men, if he pleases,
yet he affects all over this discourse a strange
perplext Intricacy and Ambiguity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62077:29"/>
puts down his Principles in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as a crafty Lawyer who had a mind to
bring an Estate afterwards into dispute,
pens Writings. Much shifting wit there is
in them, but nothing of candid, clear and
down right. And this Intricacy is made
greater by his unconnected way of discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
no man living being able to discern
in better half of his odd-natur'd Principles
what influence they have, either Immediate
or Mediate, upon any thing following. The
rest of what is contain'd in these nine, are
either Absurdities, already laid open; or
else Impertinent Truths, as will be seen by
their uselesness in the Process of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

            <p>On this occasion it were not amiss to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
before hand, what I mean by <hi>Rule of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62077:30"/>
Faith,</hi> or rather to repeat something of that
much I have writ formerly concerning
that point in my Second Appendix to <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footing,</hi>
and elsewhere; that so (all equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
being taken away) it may more
clearly be seen where the Point sticks on
Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s. side, as also that his understanding
me to have different sentiments from some
Catholick Divines in this matter may be
remov'd; for, if I understand my self or
them, there is no variance at all between
us in the <hi>Thing,</hi> but only in the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being agreed then amongst us all that
what Christ and his Apostles taught is <hi>Gods
Word,</hi> or his <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Means</hi> to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
all that is to be done by us, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, is to know with Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
what <hi>was</hi> the first taught Doctrine,
or Christs sense; and whatever can thus
assure us of that, is deservedly call'd <hi>the
Rule of Faith.</hi> Now, the word <hi>Rule</hi> made
use of to mean a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
is Metaphorical, or translated from
some Material thing, as most words that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Spiritual</hi> Notions are; and 'tis one of
those kind of Metaphors which are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from one thing to another for some
<hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>Resemblance</hi> between them.
For, as a <hi>Material</hi> Rule is such a thing, as,
if one endeavour to go according to it, and
decline not from it, preserves one from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62077:30"/>
crooked; so, this <hi>Intellectual</hi> Rule call'd
the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is of that Nature, that,
if one go according to it, and swerve not
from it, it preserves one from going <hi>wrong</hi>
or from erring, in his knowledge of what
is <hi>True</hi> (or First-deliver'd) Faith; and
<hi>Faith</hi> being intended for persons of all sorts
or Capacities, <hi>the Rule of Faith</hi> must be able
to preserve even those of the <hi>meanest</hi> Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
from Erring in Faith while they relie
upon <hi>It.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agian, this being the <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Primary
Effect</hi> of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is, having essentially in it self a
Power to produce <hi>of its self,</hi> and without
the Assistance of any other its <hi>Primary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
(or rather being it self that Power) as
man to discourse, Fire to burn, &amp;c. it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that, since to preserve all that relie on
it in right Faith is the Proper effect of the
Rule of Faith, what <hi>has not</hi> in it self the
Power to do this, and this <hi>of its self,</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
on any thing else but on God
(who establishes the Natures of all things
to be Certain Powers to produce their
Proper Effect) is not in true speech
a <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> Since then not one
Catholick in the World holds that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
Letter <hi>of it self</hi> and independently on
something else (<hi>viz</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Church's Tradition
attesting the <hi>Truth</hi> of the same Letter, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62077:31"/>
Interpreting it) has <hi>in it self</hi> Power thus to
certifie persons of all capacities of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, without possibility of Err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor any one but holds the Churches
Authority is able alone to do this Effect,
(since 'tis known and confest it actually
perform'd this in the beginning) there is
not one Catholick that I know of who holds
either that the Scripture is <hi>the Rule of Faith</hi>
(taking the words in <hi>this</hi> sense) or that any
thing but the Churches living voice
and Practice, or Tradition is <hi>It;</hi> and,
so taking the words <hi>properly,</hi> as I do, they
<hi>all</hi> agree with <hi>me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, taking those words
[<hi>the Rule of Faith</hi>] for any thing that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
Faith, or that may signify it with abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Certainty to people of all sorts, <hi>not of
it self,</hi> but meerly by vertue of <hi>another,</hi>
whose Power of Asserting the Truth of the
Letter in those Passages (at least) that
concern Christian Faith, and of unerringly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
it <hi>lends</hi> it to be thus certainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative
of Gods Will; taking, I say,
[<hi>Rule of Faith</hi>] in this sense, as some of
ours do, I grant with them that Scripture
is a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> So that still I agree with
them in the <hi>Thing;</hi> only I dissent from them
in the <hi>word,</hi> and judge that this <hi>Container</hi> of
Christs Doctrin, as now describ'd, is but
<hi>improperly</hi> call'd a <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62077:31"/>
in it self the <hi>nature</hi> of such a Rule, that
is, not, having a Power <hi>in it self,</hi> and <hi>of its self</hi>
thus to ascertain Faith by absolutely enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Divine Authority.</p>
            <p>This Distinction now given I learned
from the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> which no where
says that Scripture is a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> as it
does expresly of <hi>Tradition</hi> (<hi>Sess.</hi> 5.) but
only that it <hi>contains</hi> Faith, as also <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
does; but whether it <hi>contains</hi> it in <hi>such
a manner</hi> that all those who are to have
Faith by relying on it, may by so doing, be
absolutely secur'd from erring, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
over and above to make it in true
speech deserve the name of a <hi>Rule,</hi> the
Council says nothing. I am sure it is far
from saying that people of all sorts reading
the Scriptures and attending solely to the
Letter as interpreted and understood by
their private selves, shall be sure never to
erre in right Faith; nay, it engages not for
their security from erring so much as in any
<hi>one</hi> point; which yet ought to be said, if
Scripture <hi>in it self,</hi> and <hi>of it self</hi> have the
power of <hi>regulating</hi> them in their Faith or
be a <hi>Rule.</hi> Rather the Council by its Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
says the direct contrary; for, though
being about to define against Hereticks it
professes to follow in its definitions the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62077:32"/>
written word, yet 'tis observable
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Sure Footing <hi>2d Ed. p.</hi> 145, 146.</note>that it no where builds on any
place of Scripture, but it profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
at the same time to build its
Interpretation of that place on
Tradition; which evidently argues that
though Scripture in the Judgment of the
Council <hi>contain'd</hi> the Point, yet that which
indeed <hi>regulated</hi> the Council in its Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church, as it
also expresly declares where ever it defines.
And I dare say that there is not one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
in the world who thinks the Council
knew not both <hi>what</hi> and <hi>how</hi> to define a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> at that time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
needing to seek its Faith <hi>anew</hi> in Texts
of Scripture; which plainly concludes that
the Council was not <hi>regulated</hi> by <hi>It,</hi> or
look'd upon <hi>it</hi> as her <hi>Rule,</hi> but only consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it as of a sacred Authority and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
against Hereticks professing to rely on
Scripture, and accusing the Church for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Nay the
Council defines that <hi>none should dare to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Scripture contrary to the sense which our
H. Mother the Catholick Church hath held and
does hold;</hi> which clearly takes it out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
hands, and makes the sense of the
Church, <hi>ever</hi> held, the <hi>only</hi> Interpreter of
Scripture, especially in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi>
and extends to <hi>all</hi> Scripture; which una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62077:32"/>
makes it no <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure the Distinction now given
shows my sentiment consistent, if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
agreeing with that Common Opinion
of our Divines, that Scripture is a <hi>Partial
Rule;</hi> or that Scripture and Tradition <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate</hi>
one <hi>compleat Rule.</hi> For they clearly
mean by those words that Faith is <hi>partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi>
in Scripture, <hi>partly</hi> in the Tradition of
the Church. So that what they had an eye to
in so doing was not the <hi>Evidence</hi> requisit to a
<hi>Rule,</hi> but only the degree of <hi>Extent</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to the matter contain'd in it; whence
'tis evident they meant onely that Scripture
<hi>contain'd some part of Faith,</hi> which I perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allow to it, and perhaps more.</p>
            <p>This is my Judgment concerning the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>the Rule of Faith</hi> and <hi>what</hi> is <hi>such</hi> a
<hi>Rule;</hi> and these my <hi>Reasons</hi> for that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
If any one thinks he can go to work
more Logically and exactly in finding out
the true nature and notion of a <hi>Rule,</hi> and
show me I take it improperly, I shall hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thank him, and acknowledge my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
But I never yet discern'd any such
Attempt, nor do I see any reason to fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such performance. And I much doubt
should any Catholick Divine out of a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Intention of Union (which I shall
ever commend and heartily approve) trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Equivocalness of the <hi>word,</hi> say
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62077:33"/>
Scripture is <hi>the Rule</hi> or <hi>a Rule,</hi> I much doubt
(I say) that, when the thing comes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
to the bottom, it will scarce tend to
any solid good; for, however <hi>Words</hi> may
bend, yet the true <hi>Grounds</hi> of Catholick
Faith are <hi>Inflexible;</hi> and we must take heed
lest, while we yield them the <hi>Word,</hi> they
expect not (as they may justly, having such
occasion) that we should grant the <hi>Thing</hi>
properly signify'd by that Word; which if
they do, we must either recede, or else for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Catholick Grounds.</p>
            <p>But now the difference between me and

he still abetts) makes it <hi>possible</hi> that
he has neither True Letter nor
True sense of Scripture: that is makes his
<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and consequently his <hi>Faith</hi>
built solely on It, <hi>possible to be False.</hi> And
all that go that Way fall unavoidably into
that precipice, while they admit no Grounds
but what are <hi>Fallible,</hi> as I have shown at
large in <hi>Faith Vindicated</hi> and <hi>Reason against
Raillery.</hi> Whereas I still bear up to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
that Christian Faith should be <hi>a
Ly,</hi> and consequently I maintain that <hi>the
Rule of Faith</hi> which engages the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on which its <hi>Truth</hi> solely depends,
and without engaging which it might be all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62077:33"/>
               <hi>False,</hi> must be <hi>Impossible</hi> to be False, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
certain. And hence, taking my rise
from the <hi>Nature of Faith,</hi> in which all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
and indeed all that have the name
of <hi>Christians</hi> (except some few speculators)
agree with me, <hi>viz.</hi> that, taking it <hi>as built
on those Motives left by God for his Church to
embrace Faith,</hi> that is, taking it as it <hi>ought</hi>
to be taken, 'tis <hi>above</hi> Opinion and <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be False;</hi> hence, I say, building on
this mutual Agreement, I pursue a solid U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which I declare my self most heartily
to zeal; Hoping that this point once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
clear'd against the Sophisms and
blinding Crafts of some weak Heterodox
Writers, it will quickly appear that 'tis eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans Concern, who is of Capacity, to
look after such Grounds that the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(on which the Truth of all Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends)
is engag'd for the Points he holds, as
are <hi>absolutely Certain</hi> or <hi>Impossible to be False.</hi>
And I make account, that, were this quest
heartily pursu'd, it would quickly appear,
both by others Confessing the <hi>possible False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
of theirs, as also by inforcing Reasons,
nay by Dr. <hi>Tillitsons</hi> yielding to
the sufficiency of this Rule,<note place="margin">Rule of Faith p. 153. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against Raillery p. 190, 191, &amp;c.</note>
even when he was to impugn it,
that nothing but <hi>Tradition</hi> or
the <hi>Testimony of the Church</hi> can
be <hi>such</hi> a Ground. Perhaps also it might be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62077:34"/>
shown that both more learned and more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Protestant Authors have own'd the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
Tradition and a reliance on the

the true sense of Scripture in order to the
attaining true Faith, than those are who
have maintain'd this private-spirited way so
zealously advanc'd by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> of leaving it
to be interpreted by every vulgar head; to
the utter destruction of Church, and Church-Government.
This is and shall be my way
of endeavouring <hi>Vnion,</hi> which beginning
at the bottom, and with our mutual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in so main a point that it bears all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it, <hi>viz. the Absolute Certainty of
Faith,</hi> is hopeful to be solid and well built,
and, so, Effectual; if it please God to inspire
some Eminent and Good Men to pursue
home a Principle which themselves have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heartily embrac'd. If not, I have this
satisfaction that I have done a due right and
honor to Christian Faith, and given it that
advantage by asserting its perfect security
from error, as, Gods Grace assisting, is apt
to make it work more efficaciously both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly
and exteriourly in those who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

to our Examen how Dr. <hi>St.</hi> from
Principles settles us <hi>such</hi> a Rule beginning
from his tenth.</p>
            <p>10. If the Will of God cannot be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declar'd to men by Writing, it must either be
because no Writing can be Intelligible enough
for that end, or that it can never be known to
be written by men Infallibly assisted. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is repugnant to common sense, for words
are equally capable of being understood, spoken
or written; the later overthrows the possibility
of the Scriptures being known to be the word of
God.</p>
            <p>I have already said, and in divers books
manifoldly prov'd, that <hi>no declaration</hi> of
God's will, or (which is all one in our case)
no <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> is sufficient, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dering

               <hi>to be false,</hi> and built on Infallible Grounds.
This premised, we are to inquire, whether
Writing be the <hi>best</hi> Way for <hi>thus</hi> assuring
it in all Ages to the end of the world. To
come then closer to our Answer.</p>
            <p>We are first to reflect again what Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
means by <hi>the Will of God,</hi> at least what he
<hi>ought</hi> to mean by it: For, these words at
the first sight, seem to signifie onely some
External Actions commanded by God to be
performed or avoided; and it is the Dr's
Interest they should be taken onely in <hi>this</hi>
sense; for <hi>such</hi> a <hi>will</hi> is more easie to be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd
by Writing than some other things of
a more abstruse, spiritual and dogmatical
nature, which yet are of absolute Necessity
to be believ'd by the Church, such as are
the points of the Trinity, Incarnation and
Godhead of Christ who dy'd for us: since
then <hi>Gods Will</hi> extends not only to aim at
Mankinds Attainment of his Last End or
True Happiness, but also to provide for the
best means to it, or, to give us knowledg of
those Motives which are apt to create in
man a hearty Love of Heaven above all
things (the best Condition of Mans Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Immediate disposition to it) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that the holding all those Tenets which
contain in themselves such Motives, do all
come within the compass of the <hi>Will of God.</hi>
To omit many others, I will instance in two
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62077:35"/>
Points, of main Concern and Influence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Christian Life; namely the <hi>Godhead</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of Christs
<hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Now, who sees not
how wonderful an Ascendent both these, if
verify'd, must needs have over Christian
hearts? Can any Amulet of Love be so
charming, or apt to elevate to the Love of
God above all things, as to be ascertain'd
that he who was really GOD, Infinite in all
his Attributes, and Infinitely happy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
should, purely out of his overflowing
Goodness toward miserable mankind, take
his nature upon him, become his Brother,
Friend, Physician, Master, nay suffer for
his sake many hardships during his life, and
at length buffeting, scourging, crowning
with thorns, and a most cruel death on the
Cross; and to keep the remembrance of
these many Benefits warm in our hearts to
give us after a wonderful manner his most
precious Body and Bloud in a Sacrament
instituted for that end; by this means not
only reviving the memory of the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
love-motive, but also adding
new Incitements to that best of virtues by
our apprehending lively that he so dearly
embreasts and embosoms himself with us by
his uniting himself to us through his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
presence, that so our souls may by means
of the <hi>Love</hi> springing from this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62077:36"/>
feed on, and be united to him <hi>Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>
On the other side, if these be not Truths,
but that the Church may perhaps erre in
embracing them, who sees not that the
Church it self is <hi>Idolatrous</hi> (at least, <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi>)
in giving True Divine Honor which
is Proper only to the Creator, to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Each of these two Points then is of
that High concern as to Christian Life and
Practice, that it must needs be of its own
nature either a most wicked and damnable
Heresy to <hi>deny</hi> or else to <hi>assert</hi> it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis the highest Impiety to imagin that
God has left no Way to ascertain Mankind
whether these two Points (omitting many
others) be True or False; since 'tis unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
they are, if True, the greatest and most
efficacious helps to Christian Devotion that
can be; If False, the greatest Hindrances
to the same; as corrupting the best Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those Christians into Idolatrous
worship. The Knowing then the truth of
these and such like, being most certainly
<hi>will'd</hi> by God, we are to expect such a Rule
of Faith as is declarative of these, and such
as these, with Absolute Certainty.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider whether <hi>Writing</hi> be
the <hi>best means</hi> for such an end; which if it
be not, it may certainly be concluded from
Gods Wisdome, Goodness, &amp;c. that it hath
not been made choice of, or intended by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62077:36"/>
God for it. But 'tis observable that Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
perpetually waves any Discourse of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and chuses rather to argue from Gods
<hi>Power;</hi> which though I have already shown
how Incompetent and Absurd it is, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
at least what works he makes of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If</hi> (says he) <hi>the will of God cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declared to men by writing, it must either
be, &amp;c.</hi> I must distinguish the words [<hi>cannot
be declared by writing</hi>] as I did formerly;
and affirm that they may either mean, that
the <hi>Way</hi> of Writing, as taken in the whole
latitude of its nature and standing under Gods
<hi>Infinite Power</hi> ordering it with all possible
Advantage to the end intended, cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declare Gods will, as to such Points: or,
they may mean that Gods Revelation of his
Will by <hi>Writing,</hi> so qualifi'd as it is <hi>now</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
found in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
or with absolute Certainty declare
Gods Will as to the Points aforesaid to men
of all capacities in all future Ages. Taking
them in the former sense, I deny the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and say that Gods will as to such Points
can be sufficiently declar'd by Writing. For,
'tis absolutely within the compass of Gods
<hi>Power</hi> to contrive a Book on that manner as
might define exactly, or else explicate at
large in what precise sense every word that
expresses each point of Faith is to be taken,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62077:37"/>
and to provide that it should never be taken in
that book in more than that <hi>one</hi> sense; or, if
in more, to notifie to us in which places 'tis
taken in a different meaning. He could also
have laid it so, that a hundred or two of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals
of these Books might be preserv'd pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in several distant Countries from the
Beginning, which might by their perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
bear Testimony to one another;
and, so assure us the Text was kept hitherto
inviolate even to a tittle, and also remain a
Standard to correct all the multitudes of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Readings</hi> which, as experience shows
us, is apt otherwise to set the Copies at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with one another. He could also have so
order'd it that the <hi>Original</hi> Languages might
have been as well understood by the Generality
of the Church as their <hi>own</hi> is, &amp; so have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Uncertainty of Translations: Again,
lest crafty Hereticks should at any time for
the future, by wittily alluding places, or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon words, or other Sophistries, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the sense; Gods Power could have caus'd
a Book to be written after the manner of a
large Prophecy, foretelling that in such a time
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> place, such and such a Heretick should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise,
perverting such and such a Point, and
forewarn men of his Sophisms and Errours.
This and much more might have been effected
by Gods <hi>Power</hi> to establish Writing such an
absolutely Certain and Intelligible Way:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62077:37"/>
which why his Wisdome should not have
done, in case <hi>Faith</hi> be an Assent which, while
it relies on the Ground God has left for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<hi>cannot be an error,</hi> (as it may be if none
can be absolutely certain both of the <hi>Text</hi> and
<hi>sense</hi> of Scriptures) I would gladly be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Especially since Dr. <hi>St.</hi> tells us here
(Princ. 15.) there is no need of <hi>an Infallible
society of men, either to attest or explain them,</hi>
and all that is <hi>Fallible</hi> (as common sense tells
us) falls short of elevating it above <hi>possibility
of being an Errour:</hi> whence follows that there
being no means on foot in the world, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church failing, or being set aside,
to secure us absolutely of this; it can only be
had by the Extraordinary Operation of Gods
Power securing the <hi>Letter</hi> of such writings,
and rendering those <hi>VVritings</hi> themselves <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
Intelligible</hi> in the manners assign'd, in
case <hi>VVriting</hi> be indeed the RULE OF
FAITH.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVriting</hi> then <hi>can</hi> be <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> or
able <hi>thus</hi> to ascertain Faith to us if Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
<hi>Power</hi> undertakes the framing it such as
I have express'd; but, because experience
tells us 'tis <hi>not so</hi> order'd, let us leave this
<hi>Platonick</hi> way of considering how thing,
<hi>should be</hi> in that supposition, and following
the <hi>Aristotelian,</hi> consider things as they <hi>are;</hi>
and accordingly examin how G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds Wisdome
<hi>has</hi> thought fit to order such Writings <hi>actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62077:38"/>
and thence gather whether (however 'tis
agreed between us, they be most excellent for
other uses and ends) they were ever intended
by the same Wisdome for <hi>a Rule of Faith.</hi> To
evince the contrary of which, (not to repeat
those many Arguments I have brought else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,)
I fartner offer these Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, If the Writings of men divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
were meant for a Rule of Faith, then
either <hi>all</hi> such Writings, as such, are therefore
to belong to that Rule, or <hi>some</hi> onely; If <hi>all,</hi>
then since <hi>some</hi> Writings granted to have been
written by <hi>such</hi> persons are known to be <hi>lost,</hi>
it may be doubted, nay it ought to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the present Written Rule is defective
in the nature of a <hi>Rule,</hi> unless it be well made
out that those divinely-inspir'd Writings
which were <hi>lost</hi> were of another Nature then
these <hi>extant,</hi> and therefore that they had no
part in being a <hi>Rule:</hi> The Proofs for which
point ought to be very pregnant and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;
otherwise it may be question'd whether
<hi>any</hi> Books writ by men divinely inspir'd had
in them the nature of a <hi>Rule,</hi> or were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for <hi>that</hi> end by God. And this is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
inforc'd, because, Dr. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> here (Princ.
28.) makes Scripture the Rule and <hi>Measure</hi>
of what we are to believe; and if the <hi>Measure</hi>
fall short, 'tis to be fear'd the <hi>thing measur'd</hi>
or <hi>Faith</hi> will fall short likewise. But, if he
says onely <hi>some</hi> of those divinely-inspir'd
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62077:38"/>
Writings were sufficient, 'tis very necessary it
should be made out <hi>how many</hi> are needful;
that so it might be throughly understood
what are the <hi>precise Grounds</hi> of Christian
Faith: concerning which yet there is much
difference in opinion amongst those who hold
the Letter-Rule; which signifies that none
of them know distinctly what themselves as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or hold to be that Rule. Or, if he says
that onely those which Gods Providence has
preserv'd are that Rule; then he must either
say that Gods Providence therefore preserv'd
<hi>these</hi> because they <hi>contain'd holy Doctrin</hi> and
were <hi>writ by men divinely-inspir'd,</hi> or were
apt to <hi>benefit future mankind;</hi> and then, by
the same Reason, those which <hi>perish'd</hi> should
have been preserv'd <hi>too;</hi> or else, that God
preserv'd <hi>these</hi> in particular because these
which remain are, besides those qualifications,
<hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Sufficient</hi> to be the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
And then he begs the Question, and supposes
his own <hi>Tenet</hi> true, even while he is proving
it so.</p>
            <p>Nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, supposing the Originals of these Books
now extant to have been once the <hi>Rule of
Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it was requisite the Church in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d have look'd upon them as <hi>such;</hi>
and consequently have made account for the
first 300 years (till when they were not col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
or universally propos'd) it had no <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Certainty</hi> or <hi>Entire Body</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62077:39"/>
But, of this we hear not that any had the least
Jealousie, or that they lookt after Books of
Scripture as Things without which the
Church was not either <hi>absolutely Certain</hi> of its
Faith, or had not <hi>all</hi> its Faith.</p>
            <p>Again, had those Books been then the Rule
of Faith as (considering that some of them
were unacknowledg'd, one scatter'd here, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there accidentally) is sensless to imagin.
Yet, how can we <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow,</hi> or, future Ages <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi>
have Absolute Certainty that some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
word or other is not alter'd, omitted,
or inserted in those places that concern the
main Points of Faith (for example, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of Christ, or the Real Presence) in case
there be no Infallible Authority to <hi>attest</hi> the
Truth of it, which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> denies here Princ.
15. It is not evident he must say that none of
these can be made out with Absolute Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and consequently confess with
<note n="*" place="margin">Rule of Faith. <hi>p.</hi> 118.</note>Dr. <hi>T. that all this may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;</hi>
unless he have recourse
to Gods Extraordinary Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the multitudes of Transcribers and
Translators, because of the Necessity the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
should be thus preserv'd still unchang'd, in
regard otherwise none could say his Faith is
<hi>True:</hi> which again begs the Question, and
<hi>supposes</hi> it the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> instead of
<hi>proving</hi> it so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62077:39"/>
Farther, Let the Letter be suppos'd exactly
like the Original, how will that Letter se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from all possible Error all that rely on it,
as the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> ought, or, to use Dr. <hi>St's</hi>
words (Princ. 15.) <hi>reveal so plainly the whole
will of God, that no sober Enquirer can miss
of what is necessary for salvation?</hi> Now if they
<hi>cannot miss</hi> of what's necessary for salvation,
<hi>they must needs hit</hi> on it, and so are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Infallible,</hi> as to that point, while they rely
thereon. To put it to the Tryal, let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what Disputes there are out of Scriptures
Letter, between <hi>Socinians</hi> and their Opposers
about a <hi>Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Godhead of Christ:</hi> and
what between <hi>Catholicks</hi> and their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
about the <hi>Real Presence.</hi> How many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of [<hi>This is my Body.</hi>] How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Allusions of one place to another in both
those Points to hammer out the Truth, and
these agitated on both sides, by Bodies of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
men, excellent Scholars, Acute Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturists?
Must every <hi>sober Enquirer,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
private ignorant <hi>person who sincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
needs hit on the right, and judge better
of these Points than all those Learned men?
Or, must we needs conclude that all those
learned Enquirers found in each of those vast
different parties are <hi>mad</hi> or <hi>Insincere?</hi> I wish
he would prove this: 'Tis his best Interest,
and would give his Argument some likelihood;
which till then has <hi>none:</hi> for the Fact being
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62077:40"/>
so notorious, how <hi>earnestly</hi> they all <hi>endeavour</hi>
to find out the Truth of these points by the

them, is strangely incompetent for that
end. But 'tis remarkable how neatly Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
skips aside from the Point. He undertakes
not to give us any Assurance that his <hi>sober</hi> or
<hi>sincere Enquirers</hi> shall by vertue of this his
Rule of Faith, find out that <hi>any one</hi> point of
his Faith is an <hi>Absolutely Certain Truth,</hi> but
only that he shall <hi>not miss of what is necessary
for salvation, that he shall not erre,</hi> or at least,
<hi>not be damn'd for it.</hi> So that, for any thing
appears by his discourse, let him but <hi>read</hi> the
Scripture, though he holds nothing but <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
by so doing, yet he is still in the <hi>way to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
by the very <hi>Reading</hi> and Running into
<hi>Errour.</hi> But this deserves a particular reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereafter.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the very nature and <hi>Genius</hi> of the
Scripture, <hi>as it now is,</hi> shows that, however
it be excellently <hi>Vseful</hi> for perfecting the
Lives of the Faithful in many regards, yet it
was never intended for the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> For,
(to omit innumerable other reasons frequently
alledg'd by our Authors,) Its several parts
were evidently writ on several emergent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and have not the least semblance as if
the <hi>whole</hi> had been purposely compil'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62077:40"/>
an <hi>intire</hi> Body of Faith. Nor does it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any method tending to <hi>clear</hi> each seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Point. For, it neither begins with define<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or <hi>explaining</hi> every word made use of in
signifying those Points, which is the best
means to avoid Equivocation, the Ground of
all <hi>mistake:</hi> nor does it pursue home the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing
any one Point, by making us aware
of the sinister senses in which <hi>each word</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
that Point might seem to be taken;
nor does it put objections against each <hi>Tenet,</hi>
and establish us in the right Apprehension of
it by solving them, nor <hi>distinguish</hi> by laying
common Rules to know when the words are
to be taken <hi>properly,</hi> when <hi>Metaphorically,</hi>
much less tell us particularly in <hi>which</hi> places
each word is to be taken <hi>thus</hi> or <hi>thus:</hi> nor
can it justifie with absolute or Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
either its Text or Copy to be substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
like the Original, nor (if we may trust
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> here Princ. 15.) can any Authority
on Earth supply that necessary duty for it:
nor, (it being requisite to compare one place
to another so to find out the sense) does it tell
us which place is to be compar'd to another
as its <hi>proper Explainer,</hi> nor of the two allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
places which is to stand <hi>firm</hi> and be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>as the Letter lies;</hi> which to <hi>bend</hi> its signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in correspondency to that <hi>other;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fore-knowledg of which 'tis pure folly
to think to avail our selves by <hi>comparing Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:62077:41"/>
None of these things, I say, are found
in the Scriptures Letter as it lies; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
and perhaps many other such
like, it had been agreeable to Gods Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Goodness to have given it, in case
it had been intended by him for a <hi>Rule of
Faith,</hi> or such a Direction by relying on
which, people of all capacities might have so
well-grounded an Assent to those Points, as
is impossible to be an Errour while they thus
relie on it; which Assent in Christian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
we call [<hi>Faith</hi>]</p>
            <p>On the other side 'tis evident that of some
Points it gives onely accidental hints here and
there without <hi>insisting</hi> upon them <hi>amply</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining</hi>
them <hi>fully;</hi> and that Book which
was most designedly intended to assert Christs
Divinity, was yet so far from putting it out
of all dispute or preserving it from being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
and call'd in question, that never yet did
Heresie prevail so much against Gods Church
as did the <hi>Arians,</hi> who deny'd that very
Point of Faith. But what needs more to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
this Point than these two Arguments,
one <hi>à priori,</hi> the other <hi>à posteriori.</hi> All words
are either <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Improper</hi> and Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
of which <hi>Proper</hi> ones express that the
Thing <hi>is indeed</hi> or <hi>in reality so:</hi> but <hi>Improper</hi>
ones that 'tis <hi>not indeed</hi> or <hi>in reality so:</hi> whence
it happens that in matters of so exact Truth
as Points of Faith (especially when the Points
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62077:41"/>
are of main Concern) it imports a plain Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
either to take a <hi>Proper</hi> word for an <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
or, an <hi>improper</hi> one for a <hi>Proper:</hi> For
example, those Texts expressing that God
has <hi>hands, feet, repents, grieves,</hi> is <hi>mov'd</hi> by
our Prayers, &amp;c. are, if taken <hi>properly</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heresies and destroy the Spiritual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
nature of the Godhead. Also, to
take those words Christ is <hi>man, suffer'd, dy'd,
rose again, &amp;c. improperly,</hi> are wicked He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
<hi>too,</hi> and take away the main supports of
our salvation: This being so, it follows that the
absolutely-certain Knowledg when the words
of Scripture <hi>are</hi> taken properly, when <hi>not,</hi>
being determinative of what's <hi>true Faith,</hi>
what <hi>Heresie,</hi> it must be had from the <hi>Rule
of Faith</hi> it self, and so from the Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
if that be <hi>indeed</hi> the <hi>Rule.</hi> But this
Knowledge is <hi>not</hi> had from the Scriptures
Letter; for this must either be done by that
Letters signifying in each place expresly or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalently
that the words are properly or
Improperly there taken, which is Impossible
to be shown, nor was ever pretended; or else
by signifying the <hi>contrary</hi> Point in another
place; and this, as far as the bare Letter
carries, or abstracting from all Interpretation,
can onely signifie that the Letter in <hi>one</hi> place
seems to <hi>contradict</hi> it self in <hi>another</hi> place;
and this, as far as the bare Letter carries, or
abstracting from all Interpretation, can onely
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62077:42"/>
signifie that the Letter in <hi>one</hi> place seems to
<hi>contradict</hi> it self in <hi>another</hi> place, which is far
short of giving us an unerring security which
side is <hi>Truth.</hi> Or, if it be said, the Letter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
gives us not this security without some
Interpretation, then this Interpretation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
what the Letter (if it be a Rule) <hi>ought,</hi>
but <hi>could not,</hi> and determines with Absolute
Certainty when the words are taken <hi>properly,</hi>
when not; that is <hi>gives us our Faith;</hi> and
consequently <hi>that</hi> Light or Knowledge, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was, which the Interpreter brought
with him, and had it <hi>not</hi> from the <hi>Letter,</hi> gave
us the <hi>right sense</hi> of Scripture; and, so, <hi>It,</hi> not
the <hi>Scripture</hi> was the <hi>True Rule of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Effect, or <hi>à posteriori</hi> I argue thus:
We experience that Great Bodies of men of
divers sects, with <hi>equal</hi> earnestness (as far as
appears to us) go about to find their Faith in
the Scriptures Letter, and equally profess to
rely upon Gods Assistance to that end; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
either we must be forced to judge that
<hi>none</hi> of those several sects do sincerely desire
to find <hi>True</hi> Faith in the Scriptures, and so
by Dr. <hi>St's</hi> Principles <hi>no</hi> sort of men in the
whole world has right Faith: which quite
takes away all Christianity; or else we must
think <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>truly desire</hi> to find right Faith
in the Scripture, and rely on Gods help to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
them, In which case, since the fault is not
in <hi>them</hi> taken as applying themselves to their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62077:42"/>
Rule, and relying on it, and yet 'tis mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
they <hi>differ</hi> (that is <hi>one</hi> side errs) in most Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Points, as in the Trinity, Divinity
of Christ, Real Presence of Christs Body in
the Sacrament, &amp;c. it follows unavoidably
that the Faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is in those persons in <hi>holding</hi> it
their Rule, for, in case they err'd not in holding
it <hi>to be a Rule,</hi> that is in case it were indeed apt
to <hi>ascertain</hi> them <hi>absolutely</hi> if they <hi>apply'd</hi> it,
and that they <hi>did</hi> actually apply it, it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
they should have ever <hi>err'd.</hi> Scriptures
Letter then is far from securing men of all
sorts, while they rely on it, from Errour;
since whole Bodies of men, and, amongst
those, multitudes of great Scholars and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Scripturists <hi>erre grievously</hi> and that in <hi>most
Fundamental Points,</hi> even while they rely
upon it: Which if it destroy not the nature of
a <hi>Rule,</hi> I know not what does. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
being forelaid, we shall be able to make
shorter work with his Principles, to which
we now address.</p>
            <p>Whereas then in his tenth Principle, he
contend; that <hi>the will of God can be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declar'd to men by writing.</hi> I answer, That
by Extraordinary Contrivances and Actings
of Gods Wisdome and Power <hi>it may;</hi> but
that this will avail him little, since 'tis evident
that <hi>de facto</hi> God <hi>has not</hi> thus exerted his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Power in making Scriptures Letter
fit for that End; whence we conclude that it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62077:43"/>
was never <hi>meant</hi> for a Rule: and, whereas he
says that <hi>words are equally capable of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
spoken or written;</hi> I deny it absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for nature teaches us that the countenance
and Carriage of the Speaker, the Accent of
the voice, the giving a due and living <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
to the words, with the whole Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Circumstances in which the Speaker is
found, and which generally are not unknown
to the person to whom he speaks; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these, principally, his applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>pertinently</hi> to the <hi>present</hi> exigency,
Thoughts and Expectation of the <hi>Hearer:</hi> All
these, I say, and many others give Living
voice an incomparable Advantage over Dead
Characters in point of Intelligibleness and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressiveness:
And, though Dr. <hi>St.</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that whatever advantage in signifying,
<hi>That</hi> has over <hi>This,</hi> may possibly be put in
writing and exprest by means of many large
Explications writ by the person himself that
was to deliver his mind, yet he can never show
that those Multitudes of words in those very
Explications have the same degree of Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativeness
and Intelligibility as if they had
been spoken <hi>vivâ voce</hi> by their Author; since
they will still want all or most of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
now spoken of, which manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the signification of words. To omit,
that all this will little make for his purpose
when he comes to apply it; since Scripture
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62077:43"/>
has no such large Explications writ upon it
to supply that <hi>less clearness</hi> of expressing
which the way of <hi>writing</hi> is necessarily subject
to, if compar'd with that of <hi>speaking:</hi> much
less if <hi>daily practise</hi> go along with <hi>living voice</hi>
to declare mens minds, as is found in <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what he adds, and builds on, that
<hi>Scripture may be known to be the word of God:</hi>
If he means it may be <hi>known</hi> to be <hi>such</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Grounds he proceeds on, he
ought either to have put it amongst <hi>Principles
agreed on by both sides,</hi> or else have <hi>prov'd it;</hi>
which he no where attempts, but afterwards
(Princ. 15.) very solidly and learnedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
and confutes: while he denies <hi>the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of any Infallible society of men to attest or
explain those VVritings;</hi> For, since in the
bare Letter <hi>as it lies,</hi> there are found many
passages which <hi>contradict</hi> one another, and,
abstracting from all <hi>Interpretation</hi> and <hi>Atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station</hi>
of the Letter, no part of it is to be held
truer than other (for if it once lose the repute
of being <hi>Gods word,</hi> as in that case it must,
'tis all equally liable to be false) it follows
that if there be neither any men <hi>Infallible</hi> in
<hi>attesting</hi> nor in <hi>explaining</hi> those Writings, all
the World <hi>may be deceiv'd</hi> in performing both
those duties; and, so, all Mankind may be
deceived both in judging the Scriptures which
we now have to be the <hi>same</hi> book which was
writ at first, since there is no <hi>INFALLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62077:44"/>
Attestation</hi> of it, and also <hi>may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi>
in judging there are not Contradictions
in it, since there is no <hi>Infallible Explanation</hi>
of it to secure it from many such Imputations,
Evident in the bare Letter taking it as <hi>un ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd</hi>
or <hi>uninterpreted.</hi> Any man of reason
would think that to leave Scripture in such a
pickle, were but a slender provision to give it
such a Certainty as will fit it to be <hi>a Rule of
Faith,</hi> if he but reflects that that <hi>Rule</hi> must be
the <hi>Basis</hi> of all our Knowledg that God ever
reveal'd any thing at all; that is, of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds
way to salvation.</p>
            <p>But suppose it <hi>thus</hi> granted that <hi>the will of
God can be fufficienty declared to Men by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
in the manner declared above, let's see
what follows.</p>
            <p>11. It is agreed among all Christians that
although God in the first Ages of the VVorld
did reveal his mind to men immediately by a
voice or secret inspirations, yet afterwards he
did communicate his mind to some immediatly
inspir'd to write his VVill in Books to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for the benefit of future Ages, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that these Books of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which we now receive were so written by
the Apostles and Disciples of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>This is granted: only it is not <hi>agreed among
all</hi> that bear the name of <hi>Christians</hi> of what
nature this <hi>benefit</hi> is which God intended men
in future Ages by the Scriptures, whether of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62077:44"/>
strengthening them in Faith, and stirring
them up to good Life, or teaching them
their Faith at first and <hi>assuring</hi> it to them
nor how this <hi>benefit</hi> comes to be <hi>deriv'd</hi> to
the Generality, whether by Immediate <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and penetrating it <hi>themselves:</hi> or, through
the <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Instruction</hi> of some <hi>others</hi>
deputed by God for that end, who have Faith
in their hearts already by some other Means:
But we are to expect Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of his discourse clear this point solidly and
throughly, for 'tis the main hinge of all this
Controveesie: He goes forward thus.</p>
            <p>12. Such Writings have been received by
the Christian Church of the first Ages, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Infallible, and being deliver'd down as
such to us by an Vniversal consent of all Ages
since, they ought to be owned by us as the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule of Faith; whereby we are to judge
what the Will of God is in order to our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
unless it appear with an Evidence equal to
that whereby we believe those Books to be the
Word of God, that they were never intended for
that end because of their obscurity or Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>This whole Paragraph amounts to one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which is this, <hi>such Writings,</hi> (viz.
<hi>penn'd by men divinely inspir'd for the benefit
of future Ages)</hi> receiv'd at first, <hi>and deliver'd
down ever since as Divine and Infallible, are to
be held the Certain Rule of Faith, unless there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62077:45"/>
be Evidence of their Defectiveness, equal to that
of their being Gods Word.</hi> Which is a bare
<hi>Assertion,</hi> neither prov'd from any Principle
<hi>agreed</hi> or <hi>not agreed</hi> on, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>Groundless,</hi> and <hi>unprov'd;</hi> and <hi>False</hi>
into the bargain, though the main stress of his
whole discourse relies on it. Now that 'tis
<hi>False</hi> I prove, because its Contradictory is
True. For, <hi>there may be writings penn'd by
men Divinely inspir'd and deliver'd down to us
as Divine and Infallible, and yet we need not
be bound to hold them the Rule of Faith, though
we have not equal Evidence of their defect as
we have that they are the VVord of God.</hi> Since
to be <hi>writ by men divinely-inspir'd,</hi> to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
Infallible,</hi> and the <hi>word of God,</hi> signifies
no more but that they are perfectly <hi>Holy</hi> and
<hi>True</hi> in themselves, and <hi>beneficial</hi> to mankind
in <hi>some</hi> way or <hi>other;</hi> and this is the farthest
these words will carry; but that they are of
themselves of sufficient <hi>Clearness</hi> to give
sincerely-endeavouring persons <hi>such Security</hi>
of their Faith while they rely on them as <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist with Error</hi> (which is requisit to the
<hi>Rule of Faith</hi>) these words signifie <hi>not:</hi> They
may be most <hi>Holy,</hi> they may be most <hi>True in
themselves,</hi> they may be exceedingly <hi>Vseful</hi>
or Beneficial to mankind, and yet not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with <hi>this</hi> Property, which yet the
<hi>RVLE OF FAITH must</hi> have. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he says <hi>they are</hi> for these reasons <hi>to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62077:45"/>
for the Rule of Faith (that is we are for
these reasons to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>profess</hi> them such)
unless it <hi>appear with an equal evidence, &amp;c.</hi>
that they are defective; sure he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what <hi>Iudging</hi> and <hi>Professing</hi> is built on,
who can make such a Discourse: Our <hi>Assent</hi>
or <hi>Iudgment</hi> is built on the <hi>Grounds</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
which <hi>conclude</hi> the thing to <hi>be</hi> as we <hi>judg,</hi>
and not on our seeing nothing to the contrary:
for, in case the reasons produc'd <hi>conclude not</hi>
the thing to <hi>be so,</hi> the <hi>not appearing to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
will avail nothing <hi>to conclude it so:</hi> All
it can effect is to make us maintain our liberty
of suspence and Indifferency that so we may
be void of forestalment or prejudice and free
to believe it when competent or conclusive
Reasons shall appear to evince it. What then
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is to do, is to produce Conclusive
Reasons to evince that the Letter of Scripture
has such a <hi>perspicuity</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Perfections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>such</hi> a Rule as must ground that
<hi>most Firm, Vnalterable</hi> and (if rightly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>Inerrable</hi> Assent call'd <hi>CHRISTIAN
FAITH,</hi> and this considering the <hi>Nature</hi>
of Faith, the <hi>Effects</hi> which are to proceed from
Faith, and <hi>Obligations</hi> issuing from it, and
<hi>Incumbent</hi> on the <hi>Faithful,</hi> as such; But in
stead of performing this necessary Duty of
his, to argue as if, though the Reasons he
brings conclude it not, yet it must needs <hi>be so</hi>
because we have no Evidence 'tis <hi>not so, is,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62077:46"/>
so pleasant and new invented a way of arguing,
that he must find the <hi>VVorld</hi> a new <hi>Logick,</hi> and
<hi>Mankind</hi> it self a new <hi>nature</hi> ere he will arrive
by means of <hi>such</hi> Discourse at <hi>any</hi> Conclusion.</p>
            <p>And, whereas he seems to build much on
the word [<hi>Equal,</hi>] alledging that we must,
for the reasons there given, hold the Scriptures
the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> unless it appear they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<hi>with an Evidence</hi> [Equal] <hi>to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we believe those books to be the word of God:</hi>
'Tis absolutely deny'd, not only for the reason
lately given in common, that, <hi>none</hi> can be bound
in reason to <hi>hold</hi> or <hi>own</hi> any <hi>unprov'd</hi> Position;
but particularly because of the <hi>peculiar</hi> nature
of the thing we are discoursing of; For, <hi>the Rule
of Faith</hi> being that which is to tell us God
said such or such things, or engages the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority</hi> for their Verity, if we should
happen to misuse Scriptures Letter, by letting
loose people of all capacities to rely on it as
their Rule of Faith, then, in case it should
peradventure not have been intended by God
for this end, but for some others, we expose
our selves and others to the desperate danger
of running into <hi>Endless Errors</hi> by this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usage
of Scripture, and of adhering to those
Errors <hi>as firmly</hi> as if God himself had spoke
them; that is, we hazard erring <hi>irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
in matters which ate the proper means of
salvation, and blaspheming God daily in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him the Patron of Lies. In <hi>this</hi> case then
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62077:46"/>
there is <hi>particular caution</hi> to be used, and so,
if upon sincere and strict Examination it be
but any thing <hi>dubious</hi> that Scripture was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended by God for <hi>a Rule of Faith,</hi> we
can never be obliged to hold or <hi>own</hi> it for
such, especially not having any <hi>Certain</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to <hi>conclude</hi> it such; much less must
we be oblig'd to hold it to be such unless we
have <hi>EQVAL Evidence</hi> of its Unfitness <hi>to
that whereby we believe those Books to be the
word of God,</hi> unless Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will say that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ought to restrain a man from hazarding
the <hi>greatest mischiefs</hi> in the world but <hi>perfect
Evidence,</hi> that no harm will come of it. So
that still his main business, and without which
he does nothing at all, remains yet to be done;
which is, to bring solid convincing Proofs
that God intended <hi>Scripture,</hi> or his Written
Word for the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> that is, for such
a <hi>Rule</hi> as people of all sorts relying on it
should be Infallibly or absolutely-secur'd from
Error by so doing. In making good which
concerning Point he hath hitherto trifled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.
Nay himself here is afraid to own
the Goodness of his own Proof; otherwise
he would never have thought it fit to annex
those words, <hi>Vnless it appear with an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
equal to that whereby we believe those
books to be the word of God, that they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended for that End because of their obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or imperfection.</hi> For, the Evidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62077:47"/>
it appears those Books are the word of
God must be <hi>conclusive</hi> (else according to his
Grounds, we can never <hi>conclude</hi> one word of
Faith <hi>True</hi>) and so an Evidence <hi>equal</hi> to it
must be <hi>Conclusive</hi> likewise: If then he had
thought his reasons to prove Scripture the
Rule of Faith were Good and Conclusive,
Common sense would have forbid him to add
these cautious words <hi>Vnless it appears with an
equal evidence, &amp;c.</hi> for Common sense tells
us no Conclusive reason can possibly be
brought for the <hi>Negative,</hi> if Conclusive Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be once produc'd, or be producible for
the <hi>Affirmative; It</hi> appears then by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of his on this occasion that he distrusts
that either he <hi>has</hi> produc'd any <hi>Conclusive</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for that main Point of Scriptures being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> or that any <hi>can</hi>
be produc'd.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That we may give perfect satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to this Fundamental Principle of his,
though perhaps there is not Evidence Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Letter was never intended for the Rule
of Faith <hi>equal</hi> to that whereby we believe
those Books to be the Word of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
we believe this upon the Authority of
<hi>Gods Church</hi> which is supported with the
<hi>whole</hi> strength of <hi>Best Nature</hi> and <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi>
yet we have rigorous and Conclusive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that it is not penn'd in the very best
way imaginable to avoid all ambiguity of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62077:47"/>
words and forestall mistakes, as being <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi>
inspir'd by God, whose works are <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
if it had been <hi>intended</hi> by him to be our
<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> it ought to be. And I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
I have already brought <hi>Conclusive</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
both <hi>à priori</hi> and also <hi>à posteriori</hi> in
my answer to his 10th Principle to evince
that it has not in it the nature of such a Rule,
nor consequently was it <hi>intended</hi> by God to
<hi>be</hi> such a Rule. How incomparably excellent
soever it be for <hi>other</hi> Ends for which it was
indeed and solely intended. But omitting all
the rest at present, I remind him of one
(which I cannot too often repeat) and enforce
it upon him thus. He cannot deny but the
Points of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Christs Godhead</hi> are
most <hi>Fundamental</hi> Points of Faith, he cannot
deny but both Protestants and Socinians rely
on the Letter of Scripture for the <hi>sole</hi> Rule of
their Faith, and <hi>sincerely endeavour to know
the meaning of them,</hi> which is all he requires
on the Persons side: He cannot deny but that,
notwithstanding this, one party holds There
is <hi>no</hi> Trinity, and that Christ is <hi>not</hi> God, the
other that there <hi>is</hi> a Trinity, and that Christ
<hi>is</hi> God, and so <hi>one</hi> side erres <hi>most Fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
He cannot deny but, <hi>Error</hi> being a <hi>Defect,</hi>
there must be a <hi>fault</hi> somewhere to beget this
Error, that is, either in the <hi>Persons</hi> judging
of <hi>what</hi> the Rule of Faith tells them, or else in
judging <hi>that</hi> to be a Rule which <hi>is not</hi> the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62077:48"/>
Rule; for in case they erre in neither of these,
'tis impossible they should erre or misconceive
at all in matters of Faith. He cannot deny in
any reason, but the persons on both sides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such acute men and excellently well vers'd
in the Letter of Scripture have both Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>enough,</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> that Capacity to their
power by as great a Diligence as any; nor
can he in Charity deny but they <hi>sincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to know the meaning of it in such
points.</hi> Therefore he cannot deny but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>attending</hi> to the Rule <hi>are faultless</hi> either
in understanding Scripture in these points, if
it be to private Understandings <hi>clearly</hi> intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
or <hi>VVill</hi> to understand it if they <hi>could;</hi>
and indeed 'tis Incredible they should not <hi>will</hi>
or <hi>desire</hi> this, since they use such exact dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in it, and solemnly profess to rely on the
Letter alone, or that did they indeed <hi>sleight</hi>
the Letter or purposely decline relying on it,
their byass should not <hi>manifestly</hi> appear in so
long time, and they be branded for Evident
Insincerity: He cannot deny then but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are faultless as to their Capacity and
Will to <hi>understand</hi> the <hi>Rule;</hi> therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he will renounce his Reason, he cannot
deny but the Fault must be in the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
judging <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>the Rule,</hi> which <hi>is
not;</hi> and consequently that the Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is not alone and <hi>of it self</hi> clear and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi>
enough to preserve private men, both
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62077:48"/>
               <hi>capable</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>relying</hi> solely on It
from possibility of Error, no not from <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Erring</hi> in most <hi>Fundamental</hi> Points of
<hi>Faith,</hi> nor consequently has it in it the <hi>true
nature</hi> of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and so, since God
never intends any thing <hi>should</hi> do what its
Nature reaches <hi>not</hi> to do, that is <hi>should do</hi>
what it <hi>cannot do,</hi> 'tis manifest Scriptures
Letter was never intended by God for that
End, or to be such a Rule.</p>
            <p>13. Although we cannot argue against any
particular way of Revelation from the necessary
Attributes of God, yet such away as writing
being made choce of by him, we may justly say,
that it is repugnant to the nature of the design,
and the Wisdome and Goodness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f God, to give
infallible assurance to persons in writing his
Will, for the benefit of Mankind, if those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
may not be understood by all persons who
sincerely endeavour to know the meaning of
them in all such things as are necessary for their
salvation.</p>
            <p>It is not yet prov'd, nor ever will, that God
hath <hi>made choice</hi> of the Way of <hi>writing</hi> for a
<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> nor <hi>design'd</hi> it for that end, nor
that the <hi>benefit</hi> he meant <hi>Mankind</hi> by such
Writings was to Ground their Faith on what
appear'd to their private Judgments to be the
sense of the Letter; therefore 'tis no wonder
if all persons stould hap to <hi>misunderstand</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:62077:49"/>
it even in <hi>such things as are necessary for their
salvation,</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to know the meaning of them,</hi> since God
has never promis'd that any who takes a <hi>way</hi>
never intended by him for such an <hi>End,</hi> shall
infallibly arrive at that <hi>End</hi> by <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Way;</hi>
nor is the Wisdome and Godness of God at
all concern'd in preserving any from Error if
they take <hi>such</hi> a Way, especially if we reflect
upon these following Considerations.</p>
            <p>First, That God hath no where engaged
his word to secure every single or private
man from Error who shall sincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to find his Faith in the Scripture, in case
he rely on his own <hi>private</hi> Judgment &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to <hi>hear</hi> his <hi>Pastors:</hi> whence if such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons rely on Gods promis'd Assistance
to such an End, they rely on what neither
<hi>is,</hi> nor ever <hi>was,</hi> and so no wonder their
hopes <hi>fail</hi> them, if those Hopes be <hi>groundless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They cannot but know, if but
meanly vers'd in the world; that whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of men, and amongst them divers of
great learning, interpret Scripture several
ways in very concerning points of Faith, and
it must needs favour of a proud self-conceit
in any person to think God regards his <hi>single
self</hi> more than he does <hi>whole Bodies</hi> and Great
Multitudes.</p>
            <p>Again, it cannot without a strange Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
&amp; Uncharitableness be imagin'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62077:49"/>
or judg'd that not one person of those many
who adhere to the opposite Tenet as clear to
them in Scripture according to their best
Judgment, does <hi>sincerely endeavour</hi> to know
the meaning of these Sacred Books; and, if
they <hi>do,</hi> then Common sense tells this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person that the <hi>whole</hi> Foundation on
which his Hope is built, is <hi>unsound;</hi> and that
<hi>more</hi> is requisite than the <hi>Letter of Scripture</hi>
and a <hi>sincere endeavour</hi> to understand it; and
that if <hi>these</hi> suffice to direct <hi>him</hi> right, they
ought for the same reason be sufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<hi>another;</hi> and so he ought to <hi>doubt</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>himself</hi> or those <hi>others</hi> proceeding on the
same Grounds and having the <hi>same</hi> Means, be
in the <hi>right,</hi> that is, he ought to doubt of his
Faith no better grounded.</p>
            <p>Lastly, This private man belongs to some
particular <hi>Church,</hi> and so has <hi>Pastors</hi> and
<hi>Governors</hi> set over him to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi>
him, and those too (as wee'l suppose) <hi>read</hi>
and <hi>rely</hi> on the Scriptures; Also, he must
judg this Church <hi>sincerely endeavours to know
the meaning of Scriptures;</hi> for this being the
requisit condition to find right Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this his Church has <hi>no</hi> right Faith, and so
is <hi>no Church:</hi> now for a <hi>private</hi> man who is
subject to <hi>such</hi> a Church, and <hi>ought</hi> to be
<hi>taught</hi> by the Pastors of that Church, not to
submit to the Judgment of that Church and
his Lawful Pastors, as to the Sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62077:50"/>
or his <hi>Faith,</hi> even though they be <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavours</hi> as well as he, but to adhere to
that for his Faith which appears to <hi>his private
self</hi> to be in the Scriptures, though he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict</hi>
and <hi>defy</hi> all the Church he his a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of in so doing (which he ought to do, if
he proceed on this Principle that <hi>Scriptures
may be understood by all persons who sincerely
endeavour to know the meaning of them in all
things necessary for his salvatiou,</hi> for he ought
not for any mans sake relinquish his Faith or
its Rule.) I say, to behave himself <hi>thus,</hi> as
in that supposition he <hi>ought,</hi> is such an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable,
ma apert Presumption, so Sensless and
Unnatural and Self-condemning a Rebellion,
and such a Fanatick Spiritual Pride, as I much
doubt will give a man but small title to hope
for Especial Assistance from Gods Wisdom
and Goodness,</p>
            <p>At present I onely remarke the Faults of
this Principle which are these. First, That
it supposes God has made <hi>choice of,</hi> or <hi>designd</hi>
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be this <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons. Next, that Gods Wisdome and
Goodness is <hi>Engag'd</hi> that it be thus Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to <hi>every sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere Eadeavourer!</hi> Neither
of which is in the least prov'd or proveable.
Lastly, when he comes to the close; instead
of making it so intelligible as that all sincere
Endeavors might therby be <hi>absolutely secur'd</hi>
from erring as to the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:62077:50"/>
(which is the Duty of the Rule of Faith) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well these slight Grounds were not
able to carry so far, he substitutes in their
room these waty words [<hi>in all such things
as shall be necessary for their salvation</hi>] so that
though they <hi>erre</hi> in all the main points of
Christianity, yet for any thing we know, or
these crafty <hi>common</hi> words inform us, they
have still <hi>all</hi> that is needfull to save them, that
is though they <hi>go wrong</hi> all their lives they
are still all the while <hi>in the way</hi> to Heaven.
But, I suppose Dr. <hi>St.</hi> means that no more is
necessary for any ones salvation than just as
much as he can understand in Scripture.
<hi>Which</hi> I wish he would once begin to set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to prove &amp; make out by some convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
argument: I am heartily weary of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still to his unprov'd and voluntary Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>14. To suppose the Books so written to be
imperfect, i. e. that any things necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
or practised are not contained in them,
is either to charge the first Author of them with
fraud, and not delivering his whole mind, or
the Writers with Insincerity in not setting it
down, and the whole Christian Church of the
first Ages with folly, in believing the Fulness
and Perfection of the Scriptures in order to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>As far as I apprehend, the foregoing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62077:51"/>
was intended to shew that Scripture was
sufficirntly <hi>Intelligible</hi> to be <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi>
and this under examination is to prove it to
be the <hi>measure of Faith</hi> as he calls it, <hi>Princ.</hi>
28. and all he contends here is that it <hi>CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS
all that is necessary TO BE BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEV'D
and practic'd.</hi> And, that we may
not multiply disputes, I grant those Holy
Books <hi>contain</hi> all he pretends, some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
either <hi>Implicitly</hi> or <hi>Explicitly;</hi> either in
<hi>Exprest words,</hi> or by <hi>necessary con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>equence.</hi>
But, that those Books <hi>contain,</hi> or <hi>signifie</hi> (for
they are the same) all that is to be believed
and practiced, so evidently that <hi>all persons who
sincerely endeavor to know their meaning,</hi> and
this for all future Ages, may thence <hi>alone</hi> (as
his discourse aims to evince) that is, without
the Churches interpretation, arrive to know
<hi>what's necessary for their salvation,</hi> with such a
Certainty as is requisite for the <hi>Nature and
Ends</hi> of Faith, and the Obligations annext to
it, I absolutely deny, and if he means <hi>this</hi> by
the word [<hi>Perfection</hi>] which he adds to
[<hi>Fulness</hi>] I deny also that either the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
can be charg'd with <hi>Fraud,</hi> since he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
no such thing; or the Writers with
<hi>Insincerity,</hi> since they were not commanded,
nor did intend thus to express it; nor, as far
as appears, had any order from God to <hi>set
down his whole mind,</hi> but only writ the several
pieces of it occasionally: nor did the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62077:51"/>
Church in the first Ages,</hi> ever attribute to
Scriptures such an Intelligibleness as that <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
persons should ground their Faith upon
their Evidence without needing the <hi>Churches</hi>
Interpretation, if we speak of <hi>all</hi> points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Mankinds salvation, as he seems
and ought to do. And here I desire to enter
this declaration to all the world, that I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
not the <hi>least</hi> Imperfection to the <hi>Holy
Scriptures;</hi> Every thing has <hi>all</hi> the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it <hi>ought</hi> to have, if it <hi>can do</hi> what it was
<hi>intended</hi> to do, and in the <hi>manner</hi> it was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Treatises of deep Philosophy are not
Imperfect, if they be not as plain, as plainest
Narrative Histories; no not if they be <hi>ita
editi ut non sint editi,</hi> in case they were meant
as a matter for the Author to explain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
upon to his Scholars; nor are the <hi>Laws</hi>
Imperfect, though they often need Learned
Judges to <hi>interpret</hi> them. Nor are we to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Isaiah</hi> should be as
plain as the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> The Immediate
End of writing each piece, as far as appears
to us, was occasional, <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Epistles were
evidently <hi>so;</hi> nor can I doubt but they were
perfect in their kind, and apt to signify com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
to those to whom he writ what he
intended; so that, if they had any <hi>farther</hi>
doubt, they might send to ask him, or do it
<hi>viva voce;</hi> and yet we see that even in those
days when the complexion of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62077:52"/>
was <hi>fresher</hi> and <hi>neerer</hi> then <hi>now,</hi> some
<hi>unlearned</hi> persons err'd <hi>damnably</hi> in mistaking
and misconceiving them, that is, while they
went about to frame their Faith out of them;
'Tis questionless also they rely'd upon them
as <hi>Gods Word,</hi> or dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi>
else they had not <hi>so</hi> built upon them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her'd
<hi>to</hi> them. They might sincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
too to know their meaning; yet, if the
Writings were disproportion'd to their pitch
they migh Erre damnably for all that. What
farther End God intended the H. Scriptures
for, appears not by any Expresse either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
or declaration of our Saviour; but out
of the knowledge that they were writ by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>divinely inspir'd</hi> and the Experience the
Church had of their <hi>Vsefulness</hi> towards In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and Good Life, joyn'd with the
Common Knowledg we have that all Goods
that come to the Church, happen through the
ordering of Gods Providence, hence we just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude (as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> well says) that they
were intended and writ also <hi>for the Benefit
of future Ages.</hi> And from their <hi>Vsefulness</hi>
and the <hi>success</hi> of their Use, we may gather
<hi>how</hi> God intended them for the Church. The
<hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>stable</hi> sons of the Church read
them with much fruit to excite their wills to
<hi>Goodness.</hi> The Pastore of the Church make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use of them in exhorting, preaching,
catchising, &amp;c. and in many other uses of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62077:52"/>
this sort they are excellently beneficial, which
are so many that were it now seasonable for
me to lay them open at large as I truly hold
them, none would think I had little Reverence
for Scriptures; but in deciding Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
or finally silencing Hereticks, as the Rule
of Faith ought to do, by the unavoidable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Text to private persons no use
was ever made of them (alone) with any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
as the Fathers also complain; Unless the
the Churches Authority, going along, animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the dead Letter in dogmatical passages, and
shew'd the sense of the places to have been
perpetually held from the beginning, and so
give It the Sense, Majesty Authority and
Force of <hi>Gods VVord,</hi> elevating it thus above
the repute of being some private Conceit or
Production of Skill and Wit interpreting the
Letter. Scripture then is <hi>perfect,</hi> or has <hi>all</hi> due to
the nature God intended it; if, duly made use of
as the Churches best Instrument, it be able to
work those Effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> spoken of, though it be not
so Evident or self-authoriz'd as to be <hi>the Rule
of Faith.</hi> We give it absolute Pre-eminence
<hi>in its kind,</hi> that is, above all other Writings
that ever appear'd in the world; but we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
before it <hi>Tradition</hi> or Gods <hi>Church,</hi> which
is the <hi>Spouse</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Pillar and Ground
of Truth,</hi> and consisting of the <hi>Living Temples
of the H. Ghost,</hi> for whose sole Good, as its
<hi>Final End,</hi> Scripture it self was <hi>intended</hi> and
written.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62077:53"/>
15. These Writings being owned as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them the whole Will of God so plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
that no sober enquirer can miss of what
is necessary for salvation; there can be no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
supposed of any Infallible society of men
either to attest or explain these Writings among
Christians, any more than there was for some
Ages before Christ of such a Body of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Iews, to attest or explain to them the
VVritings of Moses or the Prophets.</p>
            <p>He that <hi>owns</hi> this, must <hi>own</hi> it without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for any thing appears yet; for Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
has afforded us hitherto nothing to prove this
point but a few words craftily laid together,
which, when look'd into, have not a jot of
reason in them. And the like empty inside we
find in this present Principle. For, if the
<hi>whole will of God be plainly reveal'd</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
then in case nothing else be requisit to
understand <hi>Gods</hi> will but the disposition
of <hi>soberly enquiring</hi> (as he puts no other) it
must follow that <hi>no</hi> sober Enquirer can miss of
knowing there the <hi>whole will of God;</hi> and since
every Article of Faith is <hi>part of Gods VVill,</hi> it
would follow hence that <hi>every sober Enquirer</hi>
may understand <hi>all Faith</hi> in Scripture, which
yet the Dr. is not dispos'd to say; as appears
by his avoiding to put down what the tenour
of his discourse requir'd, namely, that <hi>the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62077:53"/>
whole will of God is so plainly reveal'd in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that no sober Enquirer can miss [of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his whole will there;</hi>] and instead of it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting,
that <hi>the whole will of God is so plainly
reveal'd</hi> in Scripture, that, <hi>no sober Inquirer
can miss of [what is necessary for salvation</hi>]
which words may be true though they fall <hi>far
short</hi> of knowing the <hi>whole</hi> will of God by that
means.</p>
            <p>Next, it is very material, and it would be
very requisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to know <hi>how</hi> a man must be
qualify'd to be a <hi>sober Enquirer.</hi> In order to
which, we may reflect that (as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
it ought in reason be judged <hi>Gods will</hi>
that we should know whether Christ be God,
and whether his Body (and consequently Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
be <hi>really</hi> in the Sacrament; lest we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

he <hi>be,</hi> and we judge he <hi>is not;</hi> or else commit
material Idolatry by judging him to <hi>be so,</hi>
when he <hi>is not</hi> so. Now I would have him
clearly show (<hi>clearly,</hi> I say, for all depends
upon it, according to his Grounds) in what
either the <hi>Roman-</hi> Catholicks or the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
fall short in point of being <hi>sober enquirers;</hi>
for 'tis plain they must both fall short of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such if the <hi>whole will of God be clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
in Scripture,</hi> since the former holds
Christ is <hi>really</hi> in the Sacrament; the other,
that he is not God, the contrary to both which
I suppose Dr. <hi>St.</hi> holds to be the true sense of
Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:62077:54"/>
Farther, if there can be <hi>no</hi> necessity of any
<hi>Infallible</hi> society of men either to attest or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
those Writings, 'tis Evident there can be
no need of a <hi>Fallible</hi> society of men for those
Ends. For if Writings which are <hi>attested</hi> or
<hi>explained</hi> by a <hi>Fallible</hi> Society of men be the
<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or the Grounds God has left
us to build our Faith on, and it be evident that
a Fallible Attestation or Explication may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
lead us into nothing but Errour, it would
follow that God himself <hi>may</hi> possibly have
led all Christians <hi>hitherto</hi> and still <hi>leads</hi> them
to the end of the world into <hi>actual</hi> Errour;
since a reliance on <hi>Fallible</hi> means of knowing
the Letter and Sense cannot possibly raise any
Assent beyond possibility of being Erroneous.
There needs therefore by Dr. <hi>St's</hi> discourse
neither <hi>Infallible</hi> nor <hi>Fallible</hi> Societies; and
so according to his Principles, farewell <hi>all</hi>
Church, both <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> as far
as concerns these two main Duties, on which
all else depends.</p>
            <p>Again, though all this were true, and that
<hi>the Scriptures were own'd as containing in them
the whole VVill of God so plainly reveal'd that
no sober Enquirer can miss of what's necessary
to salvation,</hi> and that therefore there needed
no Church to <hi>explain</hi> them. Yet 'tis a strange
Consequence that therefore <hi>there can be no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of any Infallible society</hi> of men to <hi>AT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEST,</hi>
them, or to witness that the <hi>Letter</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62077:54"/>
of Scripture is <hi>right.</hi> This is so far from <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi>

Enquirer</hi> would <hi>less</hi> be in doubt to <hi>miss of
what is necessary to salvation</hi> in case the Letter,
on which all depends be <hi>well</hi> attested, than if
it be <hi>not,</hi> and most certainly an Infallible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men can <hi>better</hi> attest that Letter than a
<hi>Fallible</hi> one, and those Writings can with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the <hi>VVill of God,</hi> if their Letter be attested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
possibility of being wrong, than if <hi>left</hi>
in a possibility of being <hi>such;</hi> for if the <hi>Letter</hi>
be wrong, <hi>all</hi> is wrong in this case. It might
seem wonderful then what it is that thus byas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> against his own Interest; And I
wish I had reason to think it were not a kind
of Innate Antipathy against not onely <hi>our</hi>
Church but <hi>Church</hi> in Common, and a desire
to attribute as little to it as he can possibly
though he hazzard some prejudice to his own
Cause and even <hi>all</hi> Christian Faith into the
bargain. His whole way of discourse here
bends strongly towards the taking away all
<hi>divine</hi> Institution of Pastors (for this would
oblige the people to <hi>hear</hi> them) and levelling
all into a Fanatick Anarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y. I would gladly
interpret him otherwise; and imagine that
perhaps he means that, since 'tis <hi>own'd</hi> the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62077:55"/>
Scriptures thus <hi>contain Gods will,</hi> therefore
there needs not be <hi>supposed</hi> any Infallible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men either to attest or explain them;
but I cannot conceive he should think Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Letter must be <hi>own'd</hi> to be right without
some either <hi>Fallible</hi> or <hi>Infallible</hi> Authority to
attest it to be such; or that, however he may
sceptically dread no Authority can be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet that he will deny but that it were
<hi>good</hi> there were such an Authority to <hi>attest</hi>
Scriptures Letter, nay <hi>needful</hi> too in case he
heartily held that Christian Faith built (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Grounds) solely on that Letter
may not possibly all be a <hi>Ly;</hi> which common
sense tells us, it <hi>may be,</hi> in case we may all
be deceiv'd in the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, That <hi>for some Ages before Christ
there was no Necessity of such a Body of men
among the Iews to attest or explain to them the
VVritings of Moses and the Prophets,</hi> is first
not prov'd, and yet Dr. <hi>St.</hi> builds upon it as
confidently as if it were evidently concluded,
or else Self-evident. Next, what mean those
words [<hi>for some Ages before Christ?</hi>] If the
<hi>whole</hi> time of the Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al Law; then 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
false, since (<hi>Deut. 17. v.</hi> 10, 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.)
God commanded upon pain of death to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as some persons he had appointed for
that end should explain the Writings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Law; and if these men had not
some way or other been secured from Errour,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62077:55"/>
God by commanding the subject Laity under
so heavy a penalty to act as they adjudg'd, had
both <hi>led</hi> them into <hi>actual Errour,</hi> and punisht
them thus grievously in that case for <hi>adhering
to Truth;</hi> which are too horrid blasphemies
to be heard or imagin'd. But, if they mean
onely, for <hi>some time</hi> of that Law, or <hi>some</hi>
Ages immediately <hi>before Christ</hi> when the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
was most corrupt, this implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
that such a Society was <hi>necessary</hi> in the
Ages <hi>foregoing;</hi> and then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is to show
us why it was not <hi>equally</hi> necessary in the <hi>later</hi>
as in the <hi>former,</hi> and not suppose it <hi>gratis.</hi> Nor
was the Synagogue ever more corrupt than in
our Saviour's days, and yet we see how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
he enjoins the Jews of that time to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Scribes and Pharisees because they
<hi>sate in Moses his Chair;</hi> which it were blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
to say Christ could do, if he had not
secur'd their Doctrine from being Erroneous,
that is, preserv'd them Inerrable in that Affair.
Add, that were all granted, yet there is far
<hi>more</hi> necessity of explaining the Scriptures
now, than at <hi>that</hi> time: For the Law was in
a manner all of it, either matters of <hi>Fact</hi> to be
done, or <hi>Moral</hi> Duties and so agreeable to
nature; whence <hi>both</hi> of these were far more
easily expressible in proper language, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Intelligible, than the sublime, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and mysterious Tenets of the Law of
Grace; which are more hard to be exprest in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62077:56"/>
               <hi>per</hi> words; and being more removed from our
knowledg, the natures of the Things are more
hard to be penetrated, and so those words
more difficult to be rightly comprehended
and understood without an Interpreter, than
were those other.</p>
            <p>16. There can be no more intolerable usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Faith of Christians than for any
person or society of men to pretend to an Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as Infallible in what they propose as was in
Christ or his Apostles without giving an equal
degree of Evidence that they are so assisted as
Christ and his Apostles did; viz. by miracles
as great publick and convincing as theirs were;
by which I mean such as are wrought by those
very persons who challenge this Infallibility, and
with a design for the Conviction of those who do
not believe it.</p>
            <p>Thus the Dr. makes <hi>sure</hi> work against the
Infallibility of any Church; which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
his <hi>single self</hi> nay any <hi>private</hi> man or
woman that has but self-conceit and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to proceed openly upon these
Principles of his, is <hi>upon even ground</hi> with the
best nay <hi>all</hi> the Churches in the World at the
main point of understanding and determining
what's Faith, what not: Nay more, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all the Governours of all Churches in the
World, if he or she be but conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62077:56"/>
that they <hi>sincerely endeavour</hi> and <hi>soberly
enquire</hi> for the true meaning of the divine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
for these being their Rule of Faith, and
being assu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> that they cannot miss,
if they <hi>soberly enquire,</hi> of what is necessary for
salvation, and being inform'd by common
Reason that 'tis a point very necessary to the
salvation of a Christian, or one who is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and adore Christ, to know whether he be
God, and so may without fear of Idolatry have
Divine Honour given him or no; these things
being so, in case it should seem to the best
judgement of <hi>such</hi> a man (and let him be, for
example, one brought up in the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
and newly turn'd Socinian) that Christ
is <hi>not</hi> God, he ought not to relinquish his
<hi>Rule of Faith</hi> at any rate, nor what he judges
the Scriptures sense of it (this being his <hi>Faith</hi>)
but maintain it boldly against all his Pastors;
talk, and quote Scripture as briskly as the best
of them all; desy them to their faces, nay, dye
in defence of his interpretation of it, and be a
special Martyr though he take his death upon
it, that all his lawful Pastors and the whole
Church of which he is a member, are most hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
Idolaters for giving the worship <hi>proper to
God,</hi> to a <hi>man.</hi> In this case 'tis plain, the
Church cannot pretend to oblige him to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
her interpretation of Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; Alas! all
such power is quite taken out of <hi>her</hi> hands by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62077:57"/>
these new principles; not to <hi>act exteriourly</hi> as
she does; for that were to oblige him to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
his Faith in his <hi>Actions</hi> and carriage, and this
in so hainous a point as committing flat Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and which his Rule of Faith tells him is
such. Nor to acquiesce so far as to hold his
tongue and not contradict the Church; for 'tis
both <hi>ingratitude</hi> to God who has so <hi>plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd</hi>
it to him in Scripture, not to stand up
for his honour so wickedly violated by the
Church; and withall most <hi>uncharitable</hi> to his
neighbour not to communicate to him the
light he has receiv'd by such <hi>plain Revelation
from God's word,</hi> and to endeavour his reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from so grievous an Idolatry, especially
if this man be a Minister of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
whose Office and Duty 'tis to hold
forth or preach what he judges God's word:
Nay, though it were a Lay-man or a Lay-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
all's a case; why may they not with as
much reason make known so concerning a
truth <hi>plainly reveal'd</hi> to them, as <hi>Aquila</hi> and
<hi>Priscilla</hi> did of old. As for all power of the
Church to restrain them that's quite thrown
out of doors. Humane commands can have no
force when the <hi>best</hi> duties to God and man are
neglected by obeying; and the more the
Church is obstinate and opposes this private
man or woman, by so much <hi>greater</hi> is the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
of his (or her) informing the Church
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62077:57"/>
               <hi>right,</hi> and standing up for the Truth.</p>
            <p>Hereafter more of this: at present let us see
how he destroyes infallibility in the Church,
which is his chief design, and indeed it makes
very much for his purpose; for I so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
with him, that if it be but fallible in <hi>atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi>
or <hi>explaining</hi> Scripture, 'tis little available
to the grounding Christian Faith, so that if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
be but overthrown and these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
setled in its stead, every private man is a
<hi>Church;</hi> which (our corrupt nature loving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty)
will no doubt be very taking, and please
the rabble exceedingly. He is so earnest at his
work that he stumbles for hast. For, first, who
did ever pretend to an infallibility <hi>equal</hi> to
what was in Christ or his Apostles, as his words
import? Christ was <hi>essentially</hi> infallible; the
Apostles by <hi>Immediate Inspiration</hi> from God:
The Church pretends indeed to be infallibly
assisted, but that she pretends to have it either
<hi>essentially</hi> as <hi>God</hi> has it, or by way of <hi>immediate
inspiration,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> had it, is a thing I
never yet learnt. 'Tis enough to justify her
constant claim of infallible assistance, that she
have it <hi>mediately,</hi> or by means of the ordinary
working of natural and supernatural causes, so
shee but <hi>have</hi> it. And to have it <hi>this way</hi> seems
far more agreeable to reason than the other of
<hi>immediate inspiration,</hi> as to have by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
inspiration was far more fitting for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62077:58"/>
the <hi>Apostles;</hi> For neither was it in their dayes
accepted by a <hi>great</hi> portion of the world that
Christ was <hi>God,</hi> or his Doctrine <hi>truth,</hi> that so
they might receive it transmitted from the
foregoing divinely assisted Church, that these
and these doctrines were <hi>His,</hi> but they were
the <hi>First</hi> that were to propagate this doctrine;
and publish and make out the Truth of it: not
could their <hi>own</hi> testimony avail to the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ended;
for what could they testify? That
Christ said <hi>thus,</hi> and did <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> miracles
to testify the <hi>truth</hi> of his doctrine, or that the
H. Ghost inspir'd them? The latter was <hi>latent,</hi>
and the hearers had but their own words for it;
the other was <hi>patent</hi> indeed, and so fully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive
to those who knew and convers'd with
them, and were acquainted with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
but to <hi>remote</hi> nations, whither two or
three of them were to go and Preach, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
little, and depended upon their bare words.
Hence Miracles were at first (and shall till the
end of the world in like cases be) absolutely
necessary, to make such unheard of Tenets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and sink into the hearts of great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
how circumstanc't soever. But, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a World, or vast Body of men were
by those Extraordinary Means settled unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
in a firm beleif that Christ was God,
or at least that his doctrine was true, there
could need no more but to know it was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62077:58"/>
down all along the same, to make deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his Church (against whom we dispute
at present) accept it; and it being visible, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
and practical, and so subject to sense;
hence <hi>Attestation</hi> of the foregoing Age to the
Age succeeding was the most Proper way to
continue it down; and perfectly <hi>Certain,</hi>
being now grown so Ample and Vast; and the
Attesters being <hi>Intelligent</hi> Persons, and having
the sense of Christ's Law written in their heart,
could deliver and explain themselves perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
to all arising difficulties, and clear all
possible misunderstandings, which the dead
Letter could not; and so this <hi>Living rule</hi> is
perfectly <hi>Intelligible</hi> too. I omit here the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi>
assistances, which those who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
what most effectual means of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there is in the Doctrine, Sacraments, and
Discipline of the Church, and consequently
(as appears by divers excellent effects of it) the
Product also of those means, or <hi>Holiness</hi> in
great multitudes of the Faithful, will see and
acknowledge, do incomparably strengthen the
Authority of the Church, in delivering down
right Faith.</p>
            <p>Hence appears our D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s. unreasonableness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated

Common Reason and (as I remember) St.

Miracles succeeded the consent of Countries &amp;
Nations; though Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whom perhaps
he holds as Holy a Father, as great a Saint, and

have told him in his <hi>More Reasons for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

when Christ delivered his Doctrine and

us of the first taught doctrine, as if we had
seen and heard it, and consequently of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
of the Church in case that were a

of his principles must be, that no Argument

though never so strong and convictive, no Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
how well qualifi'd soever it be, nor any

but down right <hi>Miracles,</hi> full <hi>as great</hi>
(observe his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were those of Christ and his Apostles, and wrought

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>destroying Principle
is laid! But if one should ask seriously whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Convincing reason</hi> to prove this infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
I mean such a one as evidently <hi>concluded</hi>
the point, might not do <hi>without a miracle,</hi> I
know no rational man that ever would deny
his assent upon such a condition; nor would
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> perhaps in another occasion; but here,
oh here 'tis another case! His hatred against
the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> Infallibility is so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
that he professes to desy <hi>Demonstration</hi> it
self, that is, renounce Humane Nature rather
than admit it; nothing but <hi>Miracle</hi> with all the
nice cautions imaginable shall serve the turn.
A notable resolution, and only parallel to his
whom nothing would satisfy of the truth of
Christianity, but the miraculous appearance
of his Angel Guardian: but the Miracle not
being granted him, he dy'd an Atheist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:62077:60"/>
In a word, if the Church ever <hi>usurpt</hi>'t the
pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> I hope she first inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it at one time or other: Now, since as
long ago as St. <hi>Paul's</hi> time she we was called

of <hi>Faith,</hi> he ought to shew and make out when
the Church <hi>lost</hi> that Title and preheminence;
otherwise, since she is found <hi>claiming it</hi> now,
and actually holding and possessing it upon the
tenure of Tradition as promis'd her by Christ,
we have very good reason to hold, she never
<hi>usurp'd</hi> it at all, but <hi>inherited</hi> it by a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
line of <hi>Succession</hi> from the beginning of
Christianity to this very day: Nor has it
ever seem'd <hi>Intolerable</hi> to any but to those
whom nothing would content but new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<hi>Innovation,</hi> and altering the long-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
doctrine of Christ, deliverd down per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
from his time.</p>
            <p>17. Nothing can be more absurd then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the necessity of such an infallible Commission
and Assistance to assure us of the truth of these
writings, and to interpret them, and at the same
time to prove that Commission from those writings
from which we are told nothing can be certainly
deduc'd such an assurance not being supposed; or
to pretend that infallibility in a Body of men is not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62077:60"/>
at liable to doubts and disputes as in those books
from whence only they derive their Infalliblity.</p>
            <p>The first part of this Principle is granted as
to the <hi>Absurdity</hi> of the Position, abating the
<hi>Degree</hi> of it; for, I take it to be <hi>equally</hi> or <hi>more</hi>
absurd not to assent to the Infallibilty of a
great body of men (which is all that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
whatever <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi> appear
for it, without an <hi>evident Miracle.</hi> The second
part is likewise granted, in case it suppose (as
it seems to do) the knowledge of their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
deriv'd only from those very books
which they recommend, and in passages which
they are to explicate, ere they can be sure of
such an infallibility. Otherwise, 'tis possible a
book; <hi>obscure</hi> in multitudes of <hi>other</hi> passages
may be <hi>clear</hi> in that <hi>one</hi> which relates them to
the Church or that body which they are to
<hi>hear</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> as to the proper interpreters of
the Scriptures in Dogmatical and controverted
passages which belong to Faith. But the Dr.
should do well to shew us any society of men
or Church, that pretends to build her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
only on the Scriptures interpreted by
that very Infallibility. Otherwise it will not
touch our Church who claimes the <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
assistance of the Holy Ghost upon her Rule
of Faith, <hi>Tradition:</hi> and, as for her being <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
supported from errour in <hi>attesting</hi> former
doctrines 'tis grounded by those who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62077:61"/>
of that point upon Humane nature as to
its infallible <hi>Sensations</hi> and on its <hi>Rationality,</hi>
which renders it incapable to do any thing
without a <hi>motive,</hi> as they must do, should they
transmit <hi>a not-deliver'd,</hi> that is, an <hi>evidently-new</hi>
doctrine for an <hi>old</hi> or <hi>deliver'd</hi> one.</p>
            <p>18. There can be no hazard to any person in
mistaking the meaning of any particular place in
those books, supposing he use the best means for
understanding them comparable to that which
every one runs who beleeves any person or society
of men to be infallible who are not; for in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he runs unavoidably into one great error, and
by that may be led into a thousand; but in the
former God hath promis'd either he shall not erre,
or he shall not be damn'd for it.</p>
            <p>This whole Paragraph is built on a false and
<hi>unprov'd</hi> supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that any Adversary
of his <hi>beleeves any society of men to be Infallible
which is not.</hi> Other faults there are in it, and
that good store; as, granting in effect here what
he lately deny'd, that a man <hi>using the best
means for understanding Scripture may mistake
the meaning of any particular place,</hi> though not
with a hazard incomparable to that of the
other: whereas, if Scripture be the Rule of
Faith as he contended, 'tis impossible that a
man relying and proceeding upon it, and using
that means in the best manner he can possibly,
should come to <hi>erre</hi> in his Faith; for in this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62077:61"/>
case the man having done all that can be done
by him as to the understanding the <hi>Rule,</hi> the
fault must needs be in his judging that to be a
Rule which is <hi>none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this main and fundamental error is coucht
in the last words; [<hi>in the former, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
he shall not erre, or shall not be damn'd for
it,</hi> what mean [<hi>in the former</hi> case, &amp;c.] <hi>This</hi>
certainly and nothing but <hi>this,</hi> if we may trust
his own words; <hi>in mistaking the meaning of any
particular place in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se books supposing he use the
best means for understanding them:</hi> Now 'tis a
strange thing to me, that God should promise
that a man <hi>mistaking</hi> the meaning of these
books should not <hi>erre</hi> in so doing: But omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this slip of Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> Reason or memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
I ask what means this disjunctive promise,
either of <hi>not erring</hi> or <hi>not being damn'd for it?</hi>
Why it means that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> knows not well
himself what to say to the point, or whether
he should stand to it or no, that a man using the
<hi>best means</hi> for understanding Scripture, that is,
according to him, the best means lest by God
for him to arrive at Faith, should not <hi>erre,</hi> and
therefore he warily subjoyn'd [<hi>or he shall not
be damn'd for it</hi>] and then he thinks himself
secure enough from confute; it being a hard
thing to conclude of any particular well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
man when he is damn'd, when not;
whereas it might perhaps be no such hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62077:62"/>
to prove whether what he held was <hi>true</hi> or
not.</p>
            <p>I could ask him whence or how he comes
to this assurance of God's disjunctive promise
here so confidently asserted, on the truth of
which the salvation of so many souls necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depends? Not by <hi>Tradition:</hi> For this would
make him rely on a society of men, or a
Church, which he hates with all his heart; not
by <hi>Scripture,</hi> for this would make the same
thing be the proof to it self: not by <hi>Reason,</hi> for
we are to suppose he has done his best in that
already, and yet (as is shown) has effected
nothing. But I would demand of him seriously;
did God ever promise that if one takes such a
way as (for want of a due intelligibleness in
proportion to his capacity) is <hi>not able</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him from error, he shall <hi>not</hi> erre, or that
if he will needs be wiser than his Pastors and
chuse a Means for such an end which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended for that end, he shall yet be <hi>sure</hi>
to arrive at that end by that means; or that,
if by relying on it and erring, he shall happen
to <hi>fall short</hi> of sufficient means, he shall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
miraculously be sav'd <hi>without</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
means? These are the points he is to
consider well, and speak to, and not thus <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
call every thing a Principle which he
thinks fit to say on his own head, though never
so extravagant. In a word, let him prove Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62077:62"/>
to have in it the nature of a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
or (which will fall into the same) to have been
intended by God for that end, that is, to be <hi>of
it self</hi> such to people of <hi>all capacities</hi> that <hi>sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enquire,</hi> as secures them from erring in
Faith while they rely on it, and this <hi>of it self</hi>
without needing any society of Men, or
Church to attest or explain it, and then I shall
yeild his discourse to run as currently as his
own heart can wish: but in proving this, he
hitherto <hi>hath</hi> and ever must fall short most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably.</p>
            <p>He hath often, as I noted formerly, instead
of saying his Rule of Faith should <hi>preserve</hi>
those who endeavour to follow it from <hi>error</hi>
or from <hi>missing of truth,</hi> substituted those
words, <hi>cannot miss of what is necessary for their
salvation,</hi> and such like: The examination of
which words I have reserved till now; and, that
I may do him all right imaginable, I will press
his Argument (or rather indeed bare saying)
in behalf of Scripture as far as my reason can
carry it. <hi rend="margQuotes">None can deny but that the knowledge
of a very few points are sufficient for well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particular persons, as appears by the Iewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
that were sav'd, and many silly and weak
Christians since; nor can it be deny'd but every
one that reads Scripture or hears it read by one
they dare trust, may understand some few good
things, to which if they live up heartily (and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62077:63"/>
if they do not 'tis their own fault) they shall be
sure to be sav'd: And as for such points as a
Trinity, Christ's Godhead, Real Presence, and
such like, the knowledge of them (even in case
they are truths) is not of necessity to salvation,
since none doubts but tis, absolutely speaking,
possible to be sav'd without knowledge of them
since many have been actually sav'd who never
heard of any such points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having impartially said in short the best I
could in Dr. <hi>Sts.</hi> behalf, and much more than
he has said for himself; let us see now what
ought to be reply'd in behalf of <hi>Truth.</hi> To make
way to it, I premise these Maxims. 1. That
according to the Ordinary course of God's
Providence, men are sav'd by <hi>means.</hi> 2. That
<hi>All</hi> points of Faith, are to <hi>some degree</hi> Means
of salvation. 3. That according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Circumstances and Exigencies of particular
persons, one needs <hi>more</hi> Means than another.
4. That, therefore, it must be said some have
miscarry'd because they had <hi>no more</hi> of those
means of salvation apply'd to them, who might
yet have been sav'd had they <hi>had more.</hi>
This being so, how great a presumption and
madness it is to affirm that every man who
reads the Scripture shall be sure to understand
there so much as is <hi>sufficient</hi> means for <hi>His</hi> sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
or motives to work up his soul to a
disposition for Heaven, considering his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62077:63"/>
without needing the knowledge of
other Points which contain other Motives ten
times more forcible perhaps to move and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
him to true interior goodness? Is it not
manifest, that (considering mens several capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
which 'tis a perfect Phrenzy to think they
must needs be perfectly adjusted to their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
necessities) one may as well say that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one who throws a Die upon a Fortune book
shall most certainly light on his own Lot, as that
every one who reads Scripture shall, let his
exigencies be what they will, find motives suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for his salvation? If Dr. <hi>St.</hi> sayes that
some <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Points have prov'd sufficient
for some <hi>few,</hi> therefore they might have serv'd
<hi>All</hi> if they <hi>would,</hi> and that God's goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Christians obliges him to no more; I
reply, First, That he speaks against nature,
since tis evident <hi>some</hi> temptations require <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
Motives to overcome them than <hi>others,</hi> and
no man can assure us, that those who have <hi>few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
motives</hi> shall not have the <hi>strongest tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
And if it were but rightly comprehended
that tis <hi>Love</hi> of God which unites us to him,
and so saves us, and that 'tis for want of <hi>this</hi>
those miscarry, who do miscarry, it would be
easily understood that many excellent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
motives, as the Godhead of
Christ and such like are lost to weak souls, and
consequently Heaven, by their not understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62077:64"/>
them; and not only so, but by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
connexion of truths with one another,
while they misunderstand the Scripture, and
so, by their holding opposite to such great
truths oppose in their thoughts other points of
Faith, <hi>those</hi> also lose their motive force, whence
their souls become tainted with multitudes of
erroneous Maxims and Practices. Secondly,
this answer takes away the necessity of all <hi>other</hi>
points of faith but of such a <hi>few</hi> of them only,
which have hapt by the very especial assistance
of God's preventing and assisting grace to have
accidentally (as it were) suffic'd to have sav'd
some few.</p>
            <p>If he sayes that, proceeding on this manner,
none <hi>can hold</hi> an error; for they are to hold
nothing but what they see to be evidently
there, and in all other things which they see
not they are to suspend. I would know what
should hinder them from thinking they see
that to <hi>be</hi> evidently there, which is <hi>not</hi> evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there; since 'tis acknowledg'd the vulgar or
Generality are but bad judges and distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers
of a true Evidence from a Counterfeit
one; besides, there are in the <hi>open</hi> Letter as it
lyes, many Heresies; and if they know these
to be such, how can they be sure of <hi>any</hi> thing
they read there to be <hi>True,</hi> since nothing is
<hi>plainer</hi> in the letter than are those <hi>Heresies;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be said that <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> Maxims
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62077:64"/>
taught them these places are to be <hi>literally</hi>
understood, and did not tell them so of the
<hi>other;</hi> and then, they are beholding to those
Maxims and not to Scripture for their faith,
since in that case <hi>It</hi> has taught them no more
than they knew <hi>before.</hi> Again, may not an
acute wit make out to the generality of <hi>D.
Sts.</hi> Faithfull, that to know the meaning of
Scripture right, they must compare one
place with another; and then, by doing so
dexterously, make them beleeve a thousand
Errours to be pure Scripture, and God's
Word, which are not. Much more might
be said on this occasion; but I only make
one reflexion on this Principle, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>His intent in it is to shew which Party
runs <hi>greater hazard.</hi> The Adherers to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
us'd on his fashion, or those who <hi>hear
the Church;</hi> and he would run us down by
vertue of an unprov'd Supposition, that the
Church is not Infallible. To offer him fair
play, let us grant him all the advantages he
pretends to in Scripture, and let him grant
us all we pretend to secure us, in the Church,
and then compare the <hi>two hazards</hi> together;
nay more, let us condescend as much as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
can imagine, even so as to abate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church, and to grant that
she is <hi>Fallible;</hi> and yet the very light of
Nature will stand on the side of <hi>our</hi> Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62077:65"/>
against <hi>his.</hi> For, this teaching them
that Superiours are to be obey'd, and their
Teachers to be heard and believ'd in things
not known to be <hi>against</hi> God's Command,
and experience telling them that Scripture
is oft times liable to dispute in passages
that to both sides seem clear; both Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Prudence, Obedience, and the due care
of their Salvation and <hi>all</hi> Virtues that can be
concern'd in this kind of action, incline them
strongly rather to adhere to what Persons
<hi>wiser then themselves,</hi> or their <hi>Pastors</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be the meaning of Scripture, than to
what seems so to <hi>themselves,</hi> in opposition to
the same Pastors and Multitudes of other
Christians, who are evidently of <hi>greater
knowledge,</hi> and, as far as they can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
of <hi>equall sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. The Assistance which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis't
to those who sincerely desire to know his
will, may give them greater assurance of the
Truth of what is contain'd in the Books of
Scripture, than it is possible for the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
in any other Persons to do, supposing
they have not such assurance of their Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</p>
            <p>God hath promis't <hi>no</hi> Assistance that those
should arrive at their end who take a way
disproportion'd to that end; otherwise God
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62077:65"/>
should oblige himself to work constant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
as oft as well-meaning people out of
weakness should act imprudently. Next, if
men <hi>desire sincerely</hi> to know Gods will and be
<hi>humble</hi> (and if they be not 'tis doubtfull
their desire is not <hi>sincere</hi> as is ought) they
will, as God's command, the Order of the
World, and common Reason obliges them,
be rather willing to trust their Pastors who
are better qualifi'd for such Knowledge, and
whom God hath set over them to instruct
them, what is the sense of Scriptures, than
trust their own private shallow judgments.
And, 'tis observable that Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> discourse
all along concerning this point, is a plain
begging the Question; For, if God have
left a Church and commanded the Faithfull
to hear it, and conform to it's Faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to receive the sense of Scripture
as to Points of Faith from it, then there is
no necessity of Scripture's being intended to
be plain to all Capacities of it self, nor of
thinking men may <hi>sincerely desire</hi> to know
God's will in Scriptures, and use due means
to understand it, without making use of the
Churches Judgment in that affair; upon
which false supposition Dr. <hi>St.</hi> wholly builds
his otherwise perfectly ruinous discourse;
Wherefore, his supposition being deny'd, I
must reply, that those who <hi>sincerely desire, to
know Gods wisl,</hi> have a certain virtue in them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62077:66"/>
called <hi>Humility;</hi> and this teaches them not
to overween in their own opinion, but to
think that their Pastors appointed by God
to teach them are generally wiser then those
who are to be <hi>taught,</hi> and that those who are
<hi>wiser</hi> know <hi>better</hi> than those who are <hi>lesse</hi>
wise. A little of this plain, honest, rational
Humility would quite spoil all Dr. <hi>St's</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and convince all his Principles to be
a plausible piece of Sedition and licentious
presumption, tending of its own nature ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to destroy all <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi>
and, if applied to <hi>that</hi> Subject,
<hi>Temporal</hi> too.</p>
            <p>I should be glad to know what means the
word [<hi>such</hi>] in the last line; if he means
<hi>Infallible,</hi> and that the Church pretending
to Infallibility must have Infallible <hi>Assurance</hi>
that she is Infallible, tis asserted by us; and
his supposition that she is not, is absolutely
deny'd: For the Church is Infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Christ's promise to her shall not
fail; and also Infallibly certain by constant
<hi>Tradition</hi> and the beleef of good Christians
in all Ages that Christ <hi>has</hi> promis'd her this
Security or Immunity from <hi>Errour</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi>
none questioning it but those who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel'd
and revolted from her.</p>
            <p>In a word, this whole Principle is Faulty,
being built on a False and unprov'd <hi>Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and were the <hi>Supposition</hi> granted, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62077:66"/>
that the <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>Fallible,</hi> still it were
<hi>false,</hi> that his Faithfull would have greater
Assurance of their Faith than <hi>ours,</hi> as hath
been partly now shown, and more amply in
my Reply to the foregoing Principle.</p>

               <p>The Sum then of Dr. <hi>St's</hi> Performances in
these <hi>ten Principles</hi> of his, which most Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally
concern his Faith, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reduction of it to Principles, is brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly
this; that he hath not brought so much
as one single Argument proving either that
Scripture's Letter is <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> nor
that <hi>Tradition</hi> or the Infallible <hi>Testimony</hi> of
Gods Church is <hi>not it.</hi> And as for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Maxims</hi> or Sayings of his, on which
he chiefly relies, they have been one by one
disprov'd, and the <hi>opposite Truths</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish't;
As,</p>
               <p>1. That Faith being such an Assent, as
when built (as it ought to be) on the means
left by God for mankinde to rely ou, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be False, and so that Means or
the Rule of Faith being necessarily such as
while men rely upon, it is impossible they
should erre; These things, I say, being so
(as I have largely prov'd in <hi>Faith Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and the Introductory Discourse to this
present Examin) Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has not so much as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62077:67"/>
made an offer or attempt, to show that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is the Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>2. That since 'tis agreed God can contrive
<hi>Writings</hi> sufficiently Intelligible for that End,
or sufficiently clear to ascertain those who
rely upon them of their Faith, and yet, on
the other side, 'tis evident God has not <hi>de
facto</hi> done this, or contriv'd such Methods
and ways as our Reason tels us evidently,
are proper means to keep those Writings
call'd <hi>the Scriptures</hi> from being thus mis-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by severall Parties, even in <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi>
Points, as we experience they are
it follows hence most manifestly that God
never intended the way of <hi>writing</hi> for <hi>the
Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Since <hi>several</hi> Parties of excellent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
in understanding words aright, and
<hi>both</hi> owning <hi>Scripture</hi> for their <hi>Rule,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
themselves with greatest diligence to
know the true sence of it, do notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
differ in those Fundamental Points of a
Trinity and the God-head of Christ; 'tis
manifest that <hi>Scripture</hi> is not able so secure
those who rely on it to their power of the
<hi>Truth</hi> of their Faith, and so is not the Rule
of Faith.</p>
               <p>4. Again, since in passages that concern
Faith the knowing whether the words be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
properly or improperly is that which
determines what is Faith, what not; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62077:67"/>
this knowledge is not had from Scripture, it
follows, that Scripture is not the <hi>Rule of
Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. God has no where promis'd that he
will still assist those who sincerely endeavour
to compass an <hi>end,</hi> in case they take a <hi>way
disproportion'd</hi> to attain that end; and which
way was (consequently) never <hi>intended</hi> by
him for such an end: for this were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himself to do perpetual Miracles, when
ever any one should act irrationally. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
unless it be first solidly prov'd that
<hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or apt of its
own nature to give those who rely on it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable
security of the Truth of their Faith
while they thus rely on it, and consequently
that it was intended by God for such an end,
none can justly lay claim to God's assistance,
or tax his Justice or Veracity if they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Errour; Much lesse, if they neglect
those Duties which Nature makes evident
to them, and common Christianity teaches,
<hi>viz.</hi> to obey and hear their <hi>Governours, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
and <hi>Teachers</hi> ordain'd by <hi>God,</hi> and rely
on their own <hi>private</hi> Wit, or God's Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Assistance to <hi>their</hi> single selves rather
than to those <hi>Publick</hi> Officers of the Church
God had appointed to govern and direct
them, for this intolerable spiritual Pride is
so odious and pernicious that it most justly
entitles them to delusion, Errour, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62077:68"/>
6. Hence, since God has left <hi>some means</hi>
for Faith, and 'tis Blasphemy to say that
those who rely according to their utmost
power on the means left and Intended by
God to lead Men into Truth, can, while
they do so, run into Errour; which yet pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
understandings (as was seen) may, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on the Written Word; it follows <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
unavoidably that some <hi>other</hi> way is left
(which is <hi>not Writing</hi>) to secure the Relyers
on it from Errour in Faith, or to <hi>be</hi> to them
<hi>the Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>Scripture</hi> not being the <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Christ's
Doctrine</hi> being once settled and accepted in
the <hi>Christian</hi> part of the World, by means of
<hi>Miracles,</hi> there needed no more but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
it down to future Ages; and, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
being <hi>Practicall,</hi> and, so, objected to
to our Sences, Testimony was sufficient to do
it, so it were sufficiently qualify'd, that is,
the best and on the best manner supported
that any ordinary means can be; such was
the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (or <hi>Tradition</hi>)
which, besides what is found in humane
Testimony, has also the whole body &amp; joynt
force of <hi>supernaturall motives</hi> to preserve the
Testifiers Attentive and Veracious.</p>
               <p>Thus the Church or the Christian Society
of Men being establish't <hi>Infallible</hi> in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down Faith, needs not prove her <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
by <hi>Miracles;</hi> but 'tis sufficient the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62077:68"/>
Faithfull beleeve that Christ promis't to
protect her from Errour (and consequently
to beleeve the <hi>An est</hi> of her Infallibility, or
<hi>that she is infallible</hi>) upon the <hi>same Rule</hi> they
beleeve all their <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> too,
<hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>Tradition;</hi> and that her Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versiall
Divines who are to defend Faith, by
way of Reason or Argument prove the
<hi>Quid est</hi> of this Infallibility or make out in
<hi>what</hi> it consists or in what second Causes this
ordinary and constant Assistance is founded,
and consequently prove it's force by such
Maxims as ground the Certainty of Humane
Testimony, and (if the Reader comprehends
them) by the strange efficacy of supernatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
motives also conspiring to strengthen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as to that effect of rightly testifying
the Doctrine received and beleeved to be
Christ's.</p>
               <p>8. There is no Necessity then of proving
this <hi>Infallibility</hi> meerly by Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by virtue of this Infallibility; Nor
do the Faithfull or the Church commit a
<hi>Circle</hi> in beleeving that the Church <hi>is</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
upon <hi>Tradition.</hi> For first, taking them as
Faithfull precisely they are meerly <hi>Beleevers</hi>
not <hi>Reasoners,</hi> or such as put one proposition
artificially before or after another. Next,
they <hi>beleeve</hi> only the <hi>supernaturall Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
built on the Assistance of the Holy Ghost,
that, is, on the Churches <hi>Sanctity;</hi> and this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62077:69"/>
is prov'd by the <hi>Human</hi> Testimony of the
Church to have been ever held since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and the force of the <hi>Human</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Church is prov'd by Maxims of
<hi>meer Reason.</hi> Add that the Certainty of
such a va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Testimony is <hi>self-evident practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally;</hi>
in the same manner as 'tis self-evident
that the Testimony of all <hi>England</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us in telling us there was such a man
as King <hi>Iames:</hi> whence no Circle can possibly
be committed, if it be beleeved for it's own
sake, or rather known by its own light
though there would be if discoursing it rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
we should put the same Proposition
to be before and after it self.</p>
               <p>9. Since those who have the least capacity
of penetrating Scripture, and consequently
(according to Dr. St.) have the <hi>fewest</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of good life applyed to them may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
live amongst <hi>greatest</hi> Temptations,
that is, in circumstances of needing the <hi>most;</hi>
'Tis a blind Undertaking, and no securer nor
wiser, than idle Fortune-telling, to bear men
in hand that persons of all capacities who
sincerely Endeavour shall understand Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>in all such things as are necessary for their
Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Since 'tis most evident that <hi>private
Iudgments</hi> may err in understanding Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but not evident that Christ has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
his Church Security from erring in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62077:69"/>
Faith, they run the greater hazard by far
who rely on their <hi>private</hi> sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
then those do who rely on the <hi>Church;</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
since the Church <hi>denyes not</hi> Scripture
but professes to go according to it, and so
in common reason is likely to comprehend
its meaning far <hi>better</hi> than <hi>private</hi> men; but
most especially since our Moderns when
they first began to rely on their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Scripture for their Faith, revolted
from hearing the Church, and rebell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Pastours and lawfull Superiours,
which both Gods Law and the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taught them they were to follow and
submit to.</p>
               <p>Thus our new <hi>Apostle of the private spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
of <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>new Light,</hi> hath endeavour'd
to pull down the Church and subvert the
Foundation laid by Christ; and instead
thereof to set up as many Churches as there
are private and proud Fancies in the world.
Each of which may by this devillish Doctrine
defy the Church for Teaching him his Faith;
or for governing him as as a Church, that is,
governing him as one of the Faithfull; for
she can bind never a subject in conscience
to any thing but what her self and each man
judges to be True and Sound; wherefore,
if any or each private person understands
Scripture <hi>another</hi> way then she does, he is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62077:70"/>
enfranchis'd by his Rule of Faith (which he
ought not relinquish) from her Authority; she
may in that case <hi>wish</hi> him <hi>well</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> him as
every old wife may also do; and he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
may wish well to the Church end pity
her; She may endeavour to admonish and
instruct him better, so to pluck him out of
his Errour; and he in requital, that he may
not be behind-hand with the Church in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy,
may with equal nay better Title ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
the Church of her failing, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to pull her out of <hi>her</hi> Errour, or (as the
new phrase is) <hi>reform</hi> her; for, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to himself that he <hi>reads</hi> the Scripture
and <hi>sincerely indeavours to know the meaning
of it,</hi> he has all the security of his Faith, (and
consequently of the Churches being in an
Errour,) that may be; Nor can he being thus
<hi>gifted,</hi> want Power to <hi>preach</hi> to her and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
For, certainly the World would be
most <hi>perversly</hi> ordered, if they who are <hi>in
Errour,</hi> should have Licence and Power to
propagate their <hi>Errours,</hi> and those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Truth</hi> should have <hi>no</hi> leave to propagate
<hi>Truth.</hi> Thus the Church has lost <hi>all</hi> power,
that is, has lost <hi>her self,</hi> being able neither to
<hi>lead</hi> nor <hi>drive</hi> her equally-gifted Subjects:
so that her exercising Jurisdiction over them
would by this wicked Doctrine be a most
Tyrannical persecution, and every such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man's refractory Disobedience (see the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62077:70"/>
wonderful gifts of the <hi>private spirit!</hi>) would
become a most Glorious Confession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith; and every Rebell acting against
the Church, (so he be but so self-conceited
as to judge he knows more of God's mind
in the Scripture then all the Church besides)
would by this Doctrine (in case the Secular
power should think fit to curb his Insolence)
be a <hi>most blessed Martyr,</hi> such, no doubt, as
<hi>John Fox'es</hi> were.</p>

            <head>The Fifth Examen.</head>
            <head type="sub">Sifting the Eleven remaining Principles,
which seem Chiefly to concern the nature of
Faith.</head>
            <p>WHoever hath perus'd the foregoing
Examin, and reflected well upon
what a sandy Foundation Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has built
his Faith, will doubtless expect that he will
assigne it such a nature as is of no exceeding
great strength; for fear lest his <hi>weak Grounds'</hi>
should not support his <hi>Superstructures</hi> nor his
<hi>Proofs</hi> carry home to his Conclusions.</p>
            <p>Now the Conceit which the Generality of
Christians have of Faith, importing it's <hi>true</hi>
Nature, is that 'tis such an Assent as is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be an Errour</hi> or <hi>False;</hi> Whence
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62077:71"/>
follows, that its Grounds are likewise <hi>such:</hi>
And indeed, since all hold, That Faith is an
Immoveable and Unalterable Assent which is
to bide by us and we by it all our whole
lives till we arrive at our future state, the
Region of Light, where we shall see <hi>facie
ad faciem,</hi> who sees not that it must <hi>be held;</hi>
and so (since there can be no Necessity to
<hi>hold</hi> a thing to <hi>be</hi> what <hi>'tis not</hi>) must <hi>be</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be false? for, otherwise were we
to <hi>hold</hi> it, that is, were it self <hi>possible to be
False,</hi> it ought to be held <hi>Alterable,</hi> when
ever more <hi>Light</hi> should appear discovering
it to be an Errour. To evince this Truth I
have produc't multitudes of Arguments in
<hi>Faith vindicated,</hi> none of which has been
thought fit to be reply'd to, though mine and
Faith's opposers still craftily persist to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate
the contrary Errour; But I will at
present make use only of one, which will, I
conceive, best conclude the Point between
us. For, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> makes Scripture <hi>the Rule
of Faith,</hi> and so speaks of Faith as standing
under what he conceives the <hi>firmest</hi> and <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Ground, and which was left by God for
<hi>Mankind</hi> to embrace Faith. I do the <hi>same</hi>
when I assert the Churches Testimony or
<hi>Tradition</hi> to be the <hi>Rule.</hi> So that neither of
us speak of the <hi>particular</hi> odd ways by which
<hi>some</hi> persons casually come to have Faith, nor
of Faith as had by <hi>such</hi> means, but of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62077:71"/>
               <hi>common road-way</hi> left by God for Mankind
to attain to Faith, and of Faith as standing
under <hi>such</hi> a Means or Rule. Upon this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
if we joyn issue, and proceed, it
seems that nothing but evident Obstinacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
manifest Truth can hinder us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
in our Conclusion. For since, if we
may be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in <hi>beleeving</hi> even while we
follow the direction of that <hi>Rule</hi> which God
himself has appointed to light us to Faith, it
would follow that there is no means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
likely to do that effect, as also that God
himself had deceived us, which is both Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous
and Impossible, it must follow,
That Faith built upon the <hi>Rule</hi> left by <hi>God</hi>
(whether <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi>) must be
Impossible to be an Errour, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
its Ground or Rule must be Impossible to
be False or Erroneous. Wherefore Dr. <hi>St.</hi>
is oblig'd as well as I am to hold heartily
this double Conclusion, and, if he attempts
to discourse of that point, to make it out,
that the Rule he assignes is such as cannot
leave us in Errour and our Infinitely-perfect
God in the blame. How far short he hath
fallen hitherto of making out his pretended
Rule of Faith (<hi>viz.</hi> Scripture as standing
under the Judgement of every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
to be Impossible to suffer men to err
while adhering to that way, is already
shown; How heartily now he asserts Faith
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62077:72"/>
it self, built on the Means or Rule left by
God, to be Impossible to be Erroneous or
False, comes next to be examined.</p>
            <p>20. No mans Faith can therefore be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
meerly because the Proponent is said to be
Infallible: because the nature of Assent doth
not depend upon the objective Infallibility of any
thing without us; but is agreeable to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we have of it in our mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; for Assent
is not built on the nature of things, but their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to us.</p>
            <p>This Principle begins with a Fallacy of
<hi>non causa pro causa:</hi> For what man in his
Witts ever said or held, that Faith must
therefore <hi>be</hi> Infallible, meerly because the
Proponent <hi>is said</hi> to be Infallible; must a
<hi>meer saying,</hi> that is, a saying neither self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
nor prov'd, be held a competent Ground
to build the <hi>Existence</hi> of any thing upon?
But let us suppose that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> by the words
[<hi>is said to be</hi>] meant [<hi>is</hi>] or [<hi>prov'd to
be</hi>] as is indeed our true Tenet, let's see
how he confutes us.</p>
            <p>Our Tenet is, that in case the Proposer of
Faith be Infallible, all that rely on It for that
particular are <hi>by so doing</hi> Infallible likewise.
He argues against us from the nature of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
which he sayes <hi>depends not on the Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
Infallibility of any thing without us, but is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62077:72"/>
agreeable to the evidence we have of it in our
minds.</hi> If he means by the words [<hi>depends
not</hi>] such a dependence as is <hi>Immediate,</hi> I
grant it; For our Assent being an effect
wrought <hi>in</hi> our Soul, and a Result of some
foregoing knowledges, notions or natures of
things <hi>within us,</hi> which <hi>produce</hi> that Assent if
it be a Conclusion; or compound it if a <hi>First
Principle;</hi> 'tis impossible any thing <hi>without us,</hi>
and staying there, without <hi>evidencing it self
to our minds,</hi> or breeding some Interiour
discovery of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf there, should beget any
Assent at all concerning it. But, if he means
by those words that our Assent depends not
<hi>mediately,</hi> or depends not <hi>at all</hi> on the Object
without us, as his large Expression seems to
signify, then 'tis absolutely deny'd; For the
Evidence of the <hi>Thing in us,</hi> is an Effect of the
<hi>nature</hi> of the Thing <hi>without us;</hi> nor could
evidence of the Thing <hi>in us</hi> cause Assent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such dependence on the Object or Thing
<hi>without us,</hi> for, unless by means of the <hi>Object</hi>
and <hi>dependence</hi> on it, this <hi>Evidence</hi> it self
could not be. The last words, [<hi>For Assent
is not built on the nature of things but their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to us</hi>] is but a Tautology or short
rehearsall of the reason lately given, and so
needs no new Answer.</p>
            <p>Yet, however D. <hi>St.</hi> for want of Logick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
himself ill &amp; confusedly, there is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
a kind of knot in in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62077:73"/>
and I shall lend my best Assistance to loose it;
but, first it will be necessary to put down his
three next Principles, since they all seem to
club into one Dilemma against Infallibility
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Proponent.</p>
            <p>21. It is therefore necessary in order to an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Assent, that every particular person
be infallibly assisted in judging of the matters
proposed to him to be beleeved; so that the
Ground on which a necessity of some Externall
Infallible Proponent is asserted, must rather
make every particular person Infallible, if no
Divin Faith can be without an Infallible Assent;
and so renders any other Infallibility use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>22. If no particular person be Infallible in
the Assent he gives to matters proposed by others
to him, then no man can be Infallibly sure that
the Church is Infallible: and so the Churches
Infallibility can signify nothing to our Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Assurance without an equal Infallibility in
our selves in the belief of it.</p>
            <p>23. The Infallibility of every particular
person being not asserted by those who plead for
the Infallibility of a Church, and the one ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the other useless (for, if every person be
Infallible, what need any representative Church
to be so!) and the Infallibility of a Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of no effect if every person be not Infallible
in the belief of it, we are farther to inquire
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62077:73"/>
what certainty men may have in matters of
Faith, supposing no externall Proponent to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p>Ere I begin my Discourse I am to note
Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> shuffling way of contriving his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
here, or of penning his <hi>Principles</hi> as
he call's them. His <hi>21st</hi> contends 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Infallible Assent that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
person be infallibly assisted in judging of
<hi>the matters proposed to him to be beleev'd.</hi> And
the 22d in consonancy to it, mentions the
Infallibility of particular persons in the Assent
they give <hi>to matters proposed by others to them,</hi>
which clearly signify that Faith cannot be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
unless we have Infallibility or Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Knowledge of <hi>the Points of Faith;</hi> for
what can [<hi>matters propos'd to us to be beleev'd</hi>]
signify else? On the other side in the <hi>21st</hi>
Princ. he seems only to aim at proving,
there must be Infallibility in us that
the Proponent is Infallible. Also <hi>Princ.</hi> 22.
he concludes, that to our Infallible Assurance
there is required equal Infallibility in our
selves in the belief of the Churches Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
And lastly, <hi>Princ.</hi> 23. he concludes, the
<hi>Infallibility of the Church of no effect if every
person be not Infallible in the beleef of it.</hi>
Which expressions are of quite different
sense from the former; and require not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in the <hi>in the matters propos'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62077:74"/>
as did the other, but only in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Proponent</hi> to be Infallible. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have no mind to cavill but am hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glad when he gives me occasion to handle
any good point, I will not take him as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words sounded, it being perfect Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
to require evidence of the Points. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
ere we can be certain of the Authority
that Proposes them (for what need can there
be either of any Proposer, or of knowing him
Infallible, if we be Infallible certain antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
of the Points themselves,) but I shall
willingly pass by those expressions as effects
either of a strange Unwariness, or of a crafty
Preparing for future Evasion, and discourse
of the Later <hi>Thesis;</hi> For in truth it hints at a
very excellent difficulty, though he proposes
it but ill and pursues it worse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will therefore clear his discourse from
his contradictory expressions, and put it
home and close as well as I can, and so as I
hope himself will not say I at all wrong it.
He seems them to argue thus.</hi> Objective In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
in another (<hi>viz.</hi> the Proponent) avails
nothing to make my Faith or Assent Infallible,
unles I be also Infallibly certain that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
is Infallible, wherefore (<hi>in case Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
be requisit to Faith</hi>] every one of the
Faithfull must be also Infallible. <hi>But</hi> this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
both these Infallibilities useles and Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt;
for the Infallibility of the Church is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62077:74"/>
of no effect, if every person be not Infallible, and
if every person be Infallible what need any
Church Representative or Councill be so:
Therefore, this Doctrine of an Infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
is frivolous and Inconsistent.</p>
            <p>To make way towards the clearing this
considerable difficulty, I premise these few
Notes.</p>
            <p>1. That a man may be <hi>Infallible,</hi> or out of
the power of being deceiv'd in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
thing two manner of wayes: Either,
from his penetrating the reasons which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the thing to be as he judges, that is,
from his <hi>knowledge</hi> that the Thing is so, which
we may fitly term <hi>Formally Infallible.</hi> Or
else by adhering, not through Knowledge,
but accidentally as it were, to some thing
which is a reall Truth, though he penetrate
not the Grounds <hi>why</hi> it is True; or by adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Judgment of another person in
some thing or Tenet whose Judgment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
well grounded and <hi>Certain</hi> as to that
<hi>Thing,</hi> though he see not 'tis so. And such a
man may fitly be said to be <hi>materially</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Both of them are absolutely secur'd
from Errour or Infallible <hi>Fundamentally</hi> by
the Thing's being such as they judge it to be,
that is, (in our case) by relying on a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
which is Infallible; and they differ only
in the wayes by which they come to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Proponent; the one being led to it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62077:75"/>
by <hi>perfect Sight</hi> that the thing <hi>must</hi> be so, or
that the Proponent <hi>must</hi> be Infallible; the
other perhaps <hi>blindly,</hi> at best not out of
clear discernment embracing that Judgment,
yet, as long as he adheres to the Judgment of
another man who cannot be deceiv'd or in an
Errour as to that thing, himself is actually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
from possibility of erring; and so, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
or Incapable to be in an Errour like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
To this difficulty I had regard in my
<hi>Faith vindicated</hi> when I distinguish't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Faith's being <hi>True in us,</hi> and <hi>True to
us.</hi> For the blindest Assenter that is, though
he <hi>stumble</hi> upon a Truth, yet if he <hi>really hold</hi>
it, his Judgment is truly and really <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the Thing</hi> or Object, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>True</hi> or Impossible to False, and
so himself undeceivable or uncapable to be
in an Errour in holding thus: yet, if we go
abut to relate that <hi>Truth</hi> which is <hi>in</hi> him, to
evident reasons or <hi>Grounds</hi> in his mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
breeding that <hi>Conformity</hi> of his
Judgment to the Thing, there is no such
thing perhaps to be found; whence, 'tis not
<hi>True to him,</hi> or <hi>evident to him 'tis True,</hi> since
he sees not or knows not that 'tis True; yet
still, as I said before, he is Infallible or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be in an Errour while he adheres
to it as <hi>True,</hi> because that Judgment of his
<hi>is in reality</hi> comformable to the thing.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis requisit and necessary that the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62077:75"/>
               <hi>Assent</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>every</hi> particular Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
be at least <hi>materially Infallible,</hi> provided
it be built (as it ought) upon the means laid
by God for Mankind to embrace Faith, that
is, upon the <hi>Right Rule of Faith.</hi> For (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
many other mischiefs and Inonveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies)
otherwise, as was lately prov'd, it
would follow that God, who is <hi>essential
Truth,</hi> did lead Mankind into <hi>Errour,</hi> in case
relying sincerely on what God order'd them
to rely on, their Judgment, <hi>by so doing,</hi> did
become Erroneous.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis requisit and necessary that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Faith in diverse particular Beleevers
be <hi>formally Infallible,</hi> or that those persons be
Infallibly certain by Evident Reason, that
the Authority or Rule of Faith they rely on
cannot <hi>herein</hi> deceive them. Else Great
Witts and acute Reflecters whose piercing
understandings require Convictive Grounds
for their Faith, would remain for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfy'd;
nor could the wisest Christians
sincerely and heartily <hi>Assent</hi> to, nor with
Honesty <hi>profess</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of their Faith, nor
could any <hi>prove</hi> it <hi>True</hi> to establish Rational
doubters <hi>in it,</hi> or convert men of exact
knowledge <hi>to it,</hi> or convince Hereticks cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Truth</hi> of it in question. Nor could
Governours and Leading Persons with any
Conscience or Credit propose and Preach the
<hi>Truth</hi> of Faith to the Generality: Also it's
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62077:76"/>
               <hi>Truth</hi> being otherwise unmaintainable, the
best vigour of Faith and it's efficacy to <hi>work
through Charity,</hi> must needs be exceedingly
enfeebled &amp; deaded. 'Tis necessary then that
the Grounds of Faith be both <hi>Conclusive</hi> of it's
<hi>Truth,</hi> and also <hi>penetrable</hi> by those whose
Proper work it is to make deep Inspection
into them; whence they will become <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
or <hi>knowingly</hi>-Infallible that the Authority
they rely on for Faith's Conveyance <hi>cannot
possibly deceive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Besides these men who are to be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi>
Infallible in the <hi>Grounds</hi> of Faith, and
so able to <hi>discourse</hi> of those <hi>Grounds,</hi> and
make out their <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> by way
of <hi>Skill</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> there ought to be moreover
<hi>another</hi> sort of men in the Church <hi>Formally</hi>-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in discerning the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi>
notion of each <hi>Point</hi> of Faith and this is the
proper work of the <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church.
For <hi>these,</hi> by reason of their <hi>State</hi> of Life,
which is to <hi>meditate</hi> on God's Law day and
night, their perpetual <hi>Converse</hi> with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair

Exhorting; their Concern to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook
their Flock lest any Innovatour
should infect them with <hi>Novelties;</hi> their
Constant Addiction to observe exactly their

that so the sounder Faithfull may look

in case that Heretick cloak his poisonous

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>biguous</hi> expressions, or goes
about to pervert the <hi>words</hi> used formerly by
the Church, by drawing them to a <hi>sinister
sense</hi> never intended by Her; <hi>They,</hi> being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62077:77"/>
perfectly acquainted with the language and
<hi>sense</hi> of the Church, are to invent and assign
<hi>proper</hi> words to express the Churches sence,
and such as are <hi>pertinent</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> for the
present juncture and exigency to defeat the
crafty Attempts of those quibbling Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners
of Faith: or else, they are to <hi>clear</hi>
the true sence of the <hi>former</hi> words us'd by
the Church by <hi>declaring</hi> in what meaning
the Church takes and ever took them; And
sometimes too, beating the Heretick at his
own weapon, Scripture's Letter, by avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>this</hi> to be the sence in which the Church
<hi>ever</hi> took such and such places. Hence, they
are said to <hi>define</hi> Faith, that is, to <hi>expresse</hi> in
<hi>distinct</hi> words it's precise <hi>Limits</hi> and bounds,
that so no leaven of Errour may possibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle
it self; and, to <hi>seal</hi> and recommend
their <hi>Acts</hi> by stamping on them the most
Grave, most Venerable, and most Sacred
Authority in the whole Christian world.
Now, that this Authority of the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
is Infallible in knowing the
Points of Faith, and that on the best manner
is prov'd hence, because, if such a Learned
Body, consisting of the most Eminent and
Knowing Personages in the world, can be
deceiv'd while they rely on the Means left
by God to preserve mankinde from errour
in understanding the Points of Faith, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>no man</hi> in the world can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cur'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62077:77"/>
thereby from Errour, and so the <hi>Means</hi>
would be <hi>no Means</hi> to arrive at <hi>Truth,</hi> but
rather a Means to leade men into <hi>Errour,</hi>
since they <hi>err</hi>'d relying <hi>solely</hi> on <hi>that,</hi> which,
it being supposed to have been intended by
God for a <hi>Contrary</hi> end, is absolutely Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p>5. Though the <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of
Faith consists in believing what is True up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Divine Authority certainly engag'd
for those Truths, which is the Formal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Believing, and therefore 'tis <hi>enough</hi>
for trne Faith that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Generality of the
Church or the Vulgar be <hi>materially Infallible</hi>
in their Faith; yet it addes evidently a great
<hi>perfection</hi> to Faith that they be Formally In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
and that the Faithfull <hi>see</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Certainty that the Divine Authority
<hi>is</hi> actually engag'd when they believe. First,
because Faith is an Intellectual Virtue, and
so to proceed <hi>knowingly</hi> upon it's Grounds,
makes it more Agreeable to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Perfective of it. 2. Because the
<hi>more evident</hi> 'tis, that the Divine Authority
is engag'd, the <hi>more heartily</hi> those who reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
it, are dispos'd to <hi>submit their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
by believing: whence Faith in <hi>such</hi>
Persons is more lively, firm and Immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
also more Efficacious and (if other
Considerations be equal) more apt to <hi>work
through Charity,</hi> than it is in others. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62077:78"/>
such Faithful are incomparably more
able to <hi>satisfy</hi> and <hi>convert</hi> others; being able
(as is supposed) to <hi>make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut</hi> evidently the
Grounds of their Faith; Wherefore, every
thing being then in it's <hi>perfectest</hi> state when
'tis able to produce it's like, or another of
it's own kinde, 'tis a signe that Faith in such
men is Ripe, Manly, and Perfect; since 'tis
able to propagate it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf to others, or (as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> phrases it) <hi>gignere in Evangelio.</hi>
Whence, those who are to <hi>convert</hi> souls and
<hi>propagate</hi> Faith, are oblig'd to labour all
that may be to accomplish themselves in
this particular, lest they fall short of this
Perfection which seems <hi>properly</hi> and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
<hi>due</hi> to their state. For 'tis not so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
to the <hi>Layity</hi> to be unable to
perform this, but 'tis highly so to <hi>them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are <hi>lame</hi> without it.</p>
            <p>6. Notwithstanding this, 'tis God's Will
that <hi>all</hi> the Faithfull should be <hi>formally</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in their Faith, or <hi>know Infallibly</hi> the
Grounds of Faith <hi>cannot be False,</hi> as far as
they are capable. For, this being (as was
lately shown) a <hi>Perfection</hi> in Faith, and
God, who is Essential Goodness, not being
<hi>Envious,</hi> but desirous his Creatures should
have <hi>all</hi> the Good they are <hi>capable</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
especially such goods as tend to the
<hi>bettering</hi> their <hi>souls</hi> and promoting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Heaven,</hi> it follows that he wills them
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62077:78"/>
               <hi>this</hi> Perfection in Faith, as far as it can stand
with the Universal Order of the World, or
the particular natures of Things, that is, as
far as they are capable to receive it.</p>
            <p>7. He hath therefore ordain'd <hi>such</hi> a
Means by which to know his Will as far as
concerns our Belief, or what he would have
us believe, that is, he has constituted <hi>such</hi> a
Rule of Faith, that it's Certainty may be
<hi>most easily</hi> penetrable by <hi>all</hi> degrees and sorts
of the Faithfull. Whence follows most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
that <hi>Tradition</hi> and not <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>that
Rule.</hi> For, of <hi>all</hi> ways of Knowing and
Ascertaining imaginable, nothing is <hi>more
easie</hi> to be comprehended or to satisfy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>all</hi> sorts then is that of <hi>Witnessing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
as we experience in their perfect
belief of K. <hi>Iames</hi> or K. <hi>H. 8ths</hi> existence,
and such like. The Grounds of which Truths,
not needing to be <hi>learnt</hi> at School, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either <hi>inbred</hi> or by an ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the world <hi>instil'd</hi> into them,
nothing is easier then for the <hi>wiser</hi>
sort of them to fall into the account
of it <hi>of themselves,</hi> occasion being given;
as also to <hi>awaken,</hi> as it were, those dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
Knowledges in the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> and
make them reflect and see (not with a <hi>clear</hi>
and <hi>distinct</hi> sight as do the wiser portion of
the Church, but) with a <hi>gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse</hi> and <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
yet <hi>solid</hi> Knowledge, and suitable to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62077:79"/>
               <hi>their</hi> pitch, that a Rule of <hi>such</hi> a nature is
<hi>Certain;</hi> and so, those who professedly <hi>own</hi>
and <hi>proceed</hi> upon it are <hi>in the truth;</hi> they
who <hi>reject</hi> it, in an <hi>Errour;</hi> Whereas yet
they are utterly Incapable by any Maxims
in their rude Understandings either to know
that the Letter of the Scripture, on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of which all depends was preserv'd
from Errour, among so many Translatious
and Transcriptions; or that the Sense is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<hi>such</hi> as they conceive it to be, amidst
such multitudes of Commentators and Sects
wrangling about the <hi>meaning</hi> of that Letter;
nor yet are they <hi>competent</hi> Judges of the
<hi>skill</hi> of all those several Sects and sorts of
men whom they see and hear differ about
the sense of it. <hi>Tradition</hi> then of the Church
being thus prov'd <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> 'tis both
farther shown how Unreasonable, Unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Unsafe Dr. <hi>St's private-spirited</hi> Rule
of Faith is, and also (even hence) demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
against him here that Tradition of the
Church is Infallible; since being by this
moans prov'd to be the Rule appointed by
God to light Mankinde to their Faith, 'tis
impossible that those who rely and proceed
upon it, should be led into Errour, and also
Impossible that Faith it self thus grounded
should be False.</p>
            <p>But I needed not have gone thus far to
confute D. <hi>St's</hi> four Principles now under
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62077:79"/>
hand. The four first Notes had abundantly
given them their Answer; and 'tis time we
now begin to apply them to that purpose.</p>
            <p>Whereas then he grounds them all on
our Tenet, That <hi>No Divine Faith can be
without an Infallible Assent,</hi> he may please
to know that we only mean by those words
there <hi>materially Infallible,</hi> or so as <hi>cannot
possibly be an Errour:</hi> and in this sense we
own the Position, and so must he too unlesse
he will speak open blasphemy; For, Divine
Faith being a believing upon the Divine
Authority, and (as we both suppose) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some Means laid by God himself by
which he proposes to us <hi>what</hi> we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
by telling us he <hi>has said</hi> it, in case an
Assent <hi>thus</hi> Grounded could possibly be an
Errou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it would follow necessarily that God
himself would be the Cause of that Errour.
The <hi>Substance</hi> then of Faith could be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and the <hi>Chief End</hi> of Faith (our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
<hi>on some fashion</hi> attained, were there
no more than this, that is, though never a
man in the whole world <hi>did</hi> know or <hi>could</hi>
come to know that the Rule of Faith were
Infallible; provided <hi>none</hi> in the Church did
<hi>speculate,</hi> and so, looking into the Grounds
of his Faith, and finding them (as far as he
could see) <hi>Inconclusive,</hi> did begin to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the <hi>Truth</hi> of it; nor any <hi>out</hi> of the
Church did <hi>oppose</hi> Faith; For the Faithfull
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62077:80"/>
would in that case be in <hi>actual possession</hi> of
those Excellent Truths call'd <hi>Points</hi> of
<hi>Faith,</hi> firmly assented to by their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
which were apt to produce tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
Good Dispositions of their Wills, call'd
<hi>Virtues;</hi> in the same sort (though not in the
same degree) as they do now; and, by
means of <hi>them,</hi> they might arrive at Heaven.
Thus the Dr. may see that all he builds on is
a pure mistake; and that all the Faithfull
may be <hi>thus</hi> Infallible in their Assent, and
<hi>thus</hi> Infallible in judging the Proposer <hi>does
not,</hi> nay <hi>cannot</hi> deceive us; nay Infallible
<hi>in judging thus of the matters propos'd to us to
beleeve,</hi> and yet <hi>not one</hi> man be <hi>Infallibly</hi>
sure by way of <hi>Evident Knowledge</hi> that the
Church is Infallible; because all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not in the least (in this supposition)
from the reach of any man's Intellective <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi>
but purely from the Goodnesse and
Conclusivenesse of the <hi>Grounds</hi> laid by God,
and his good Providence which led those men
to embrace them, though they neither <hi>pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate</hi>
nor went about to <hi>discourse</hi> them, but
simply to <hi>believe</hi> them; on the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as our ruder unreflecting vulgar are led
now. But, in this case, were all the World
no wiser, the wisest in the Church would
be no wiser then the weakest and rudest vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
now mention'd; wherefore, both for that
reason, and many others 'assign'd in my <hi>3d</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62077:80"/>
and <hi>4th</hi> Note, it was <hi>absolutely requisite</hi> to
the Church, and so becoming God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to order that it should be <hi>otherwise;</hi>
and that the <hi>Conclusiveness</hi> of those Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Grounds on which God has founded our
Faith should be penetrable by those who set
themselves to such <hi>speculations,</hi> or fall into
doubts concerning them, according as the
exigencies of the Church shall be found to
need such helps.</p>
            <p>If this will not serve Dr. <hi>St.</hi> (I am sure
it will serve to defeat all his Arguments) I
shall farther tell him that the Generality or
main Body in the Church is <hi>formally Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
in judging the Church to be <hi>such</hi> in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
down the First-taught Faith, as I
have prov'd in my 6th and 7th note and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
Besides my reasons given there and
in other places, I must desire him and the rest
of my Readers that in conceiving how this
may be, they would take their measures
from the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> such people are
capable of in <hi>Parallell</hi> matters, and not from
their <hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>explain</hi> or <hi>defend</hi> this abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Certainty, or their <hi>Constancy</hi> in <hi>adhering</hi>
to it if combated by plausible reasons; for he
is a very mean Reflecter upon Nature, who
observes not that the Vulgar have Absolute
Natural evidence of <hi>many</hi> Truths, which yet
they can neither give reason for, declare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
nor, perhaps (through levity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62077:81"/>
to such weak souls) do very firmly
adhere to; and no wonder, since so great a
man as <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> speculated himself
out of the Conceit of the Certainty of his
<hi>Senses;</hi> of which yet none doubts but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
till he began to <hi>pervert</hi> it by <hi>wrong
speculations,</hi> had given <hi>him</hi> as <hi>Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
as to any <hi>other,</hi> Also, they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
how Infallibility) or, which is all one,
<hi>Certainty</hi>) may be in a thousand different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
according to the greater or lesser Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of the subject; which they will best
comprehend by reflecting with how differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
a Clearness many things appear to us
now we are at Age, and how dimly when we
were young, which yet we were absolutely
Certain of at that time. Nor yet does one
of those Infallibilities spoken of render the
other <hi>Vseless;</hi> for they may either be about
different Objects, as if the <hi>Church Officers</hi>
were formally Infallible in knowing what
particular Points came down from Christ's
time, and penetrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng the distinct Limits
of each point; and those other <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
persons be only Infallible in judging
the Church to <hi>be so;</hi> as it happens in many
Controvertists, who are well instructed in
the Grounds of their Faith, yet not so well
verst in the nature of particular points, but
believe them only by Implicit Faith; or else
one of their knowledges may be <hi>more Clear</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:62077:81"/>
and <hi>distinct</hi> than the others, and so serve to
<hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> it, in the same manner as
<hi>Art</hi> does <hi>Nature.</hi> Least of all can it follow
that the Infallibility of the <hi>Church Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi>
is needless; for This is not intended
to teach the Faithfull their Faith at first, nor
do I remember ever to have seen a Generall
Council cited in a Catechism; but this is
performed by the Church <hi>Diffusive</hi> by her
<hi>Practise</hi> and <hi>Language,</hi> and by her <hi>Pastors</hi>
in their <hi>Catechisms,</hi> and <hi>Instructions;</hi> But it's
use is to <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> Faith <hi>already
taught</hi> and known, from receiving any <hi>taint</hi>
by the Equivocating Heretick, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it more Authoritatively to the
Faithfull, when <hi>clear'd.</hi> And, whoever reads
my <hi>4th</hi> Note will see so many particularities
in the Members which compound a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
Church above others who are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Parts of <hi>Ecclesia Credens,</hi> that he cannot in
any Reason judge them <hi>Vseless,</hi> though
those <hi>others</hi> be in an <hi>Inferiour</hi> degree Certain
of their Faith too, For all this while the
word [<hi>Infallible</hi>] which seems to have so
loud a sound, and is made such a monstrous
peece of business by the Deniers of it, is in
plain Terms no more but just barely <hi>Certain,</hi>
as I have prov'd <hi>Faith Vind.</hi> p. 37. 38. and

built on a great <hi>Probability,</hi> sometimes a
<hi>very little</hi> one, and sometimes men Assent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
little or no reason at all, their Passion or
Interest byassing their wills, and by it their
Understandings, and this many times even
<hi>against</hi> such reason as would be Evident to
<hi>another.</hi> Again, <hi>matteriall Infallibility,</hi> which
is enough to that Assent we speak of, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
and solely consider'd, depends <hi>solely,</hi> at
least <hi>Principally,</hi> on the <hi>Object,</hi> contrary to
what is there asserted. And, whereas he says
Princ. 29. that the <hi>Infallibility of every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person is not asserted by those who plead
for the Infallibility of a Church,</hi> he sees by this
discourse it both <hi>is</hi> and <hi>must be</hi> Asserted, and
that we maintain that every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must be <hi>materially Infallible</hi> or incapable
of erring while he relies on the Grounds
laid and recommended by God; that is,
while he believes the <hi>Church,</hi> which yet is
far from rendring the <hi>Formal</hi> Infallibility
of the Church <hi>useless;</hi> unless he will say, that
because it suffices for the pitch of <hi>weak</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62077:84"/>
(whose duty <hi>'tis not</hi> to <hi>maintain</hi> and
<hi>make out</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of their Faith) that they
be simply <hi>in the right,</hi> or <hi>void of Errour,</hi> and
that they see after a <hi>gross</hi> manner that the
thing <hi>is so,</hi> though they cannot <hi>defend</hi> it;
therefore there is no need that those whose
duty 'tis to <hi>do so,</hi> should be able to <hi>penetrate</hi>
the Grounds of Faith, and, so, explicate,
prove and maintain it to be <hi>True.</hi> Nor will
it follow, that though the Generality were
after a <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> manner <hi>formally</hi> Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in their belief that the Church is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
and therefore that the Points she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
are all likewise <hi>Infallibly-true,</hi> it will
not follow, I say hence, that a <hi>greater</hi> and
<hi>clearer</hi> and more <hi>penetrative</hi> degree of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Infallibility is <hi>useless</hi> in Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
for, as appears by my <hi>4th</hi> Note, there
are many other things to be done by them of
absolute necessity for the Church, which far
exceed the pitch and posture of those dull
Knowers of the lowest Class, (which is the
next degree above Ignorance) and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authoriz'd
to meddle in such affairs. Unless
he will say, that <hi>Art</hi> is needless because
there is <hi>Nature,</hi> or that there needs no <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
to decide such Cases in which the Law
seems <hi>plain.</hi> And thus much for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this concerning Point. In the rest of his
Principles I shall be briefer.</p>
            <p>But I must not pass over his Transition to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62077:85"/>
them, which is this [<hi>We are further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what Certainty men may have in matters
of Faith, supposing no External Proponent to
be Infallible.</hi>] And he need not go far to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his Enquiry: For, it being most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the Disputes between the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
and <hi>Socinians</hi> that Scripture needs <hi>some</hi>
External Proposer of it's <hi>true meaning</hi> in
such kinde of Points, as also some External
Proposer or Attester that this is the true Text
of it (on which all is built.) Also it being
evident that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> (Princ. 15.) denies any
<hi>Infallible</hi> Proposers of either of these, and
that here again he pursues close the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin;
Lastly, this Proposer being <hi>such,</hi> that,
however we can have Certainty <hi>without It</hi>
that the Divine Authority <hi>is to be believed,</hi>
yet we must <hi>depend on It</hi> for the Knowledge
<hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> 'tis engag'd, that is, we must
depend on <hi>It</hi> for the Certainty of our Faith;
It follows, that in case this Proponent be <hi>not</hi>
Infallible, it can never be made out with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Certainty that the Divine Authority
stands engag'd for the Truth of any one Point
of Faith, and consequently that <hi>the Certainty
men have in matters of Faith</hi> is <hi>not</hi> an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>
one. And if it be <hi>not</hi> an <hi>Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
which Faith has (as he no where chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges,
but very laboriously disproves it)
he need not go far to enquire or learn <hi>what</hi>
Certainty it must have; for Common Sense
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62077:85"/>
tels him and every man who has the least
spark of Natural Logick, that, if Faith must
have <hi>Certainty</hi> (as he grants) and have not
<hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> it must either have <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Certainty</hi> or none at all; there being no
Middle between them; and so, we must
make account, that because it overstrains D.
<hi>St's weak Grounds</hi> to assert Faith to be <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
Certain,</hi> therefore his next Attempt
must be to overstrain <hi>Common Sense,</hi> and to
the inestimable Honour of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
maintain that all Christian Faith is <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly-Certain.</hi>
But he must do it <hi>smoothly</hi> and
<hi>warily;</hi> and, however he nam'd the word
[<hi>Infallible</hi>] <hi>loud</hi> enough and <hi>oft</hi> enough
when he was confuting <hi>it,</hi> yet he must take
heed how he names the word [<hi>Fallible</hi>] <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
when he is asserting <hi>it,</hi> lest it breed
<hi>laughter</hi> or <hi>dislike;</hi> though it be evident out
of the very Terms that he who confutes <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Certainty</hi> must maintain <hi>Fallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
sf he maintains any. But now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
his defence of Faiths Fallible Certainty,
and 'tis fit we should listen: <hi>Monstrous</hi> things
use to <hi>challenge</hi> and even <hi>force</hi> Attention from
the most unconcern'd.</p>
            <p>24. There are different degrees of Certainty
to be attained according to the different degrees
of Evidence, and measure of Divine Assistance;
but every Christian by the use of his reason and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62077:86"/>
Common Helps of Grace may attain to so great
a degree of Certainty from the Convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of the Christian Religion and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Scriptures; that, on the same Ground
on which men doubt of the Truth of them, they
may as well doubt of the Truth of those things
which they judge to be most Evident to Sence &amp;
Reason.</p>
            <p>I wish D. S. had explain'd himself here what
he means by [<hi>different degrees of Evidence</hi>]
whether some Glances or <hi>likely</hi> Appearances
of Truth call'd <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>lesser Probabilities;</hi>
or such Intelle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e <hi>be</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>so,</hi> or <hi>True.</hi> I suspect much he means
the <hi>former,</hi> because <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se</hi> are the most proper
Grounds for <hi>Fallible Certainty</hi> which he is
now going to establish whereas the <hi>Latter</hi>
sort of <hi>Evidences</hi> would hazard to carry too
far and to beget <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> which
would quite spoil his most excellent design
of setling the <hi>Fallible Certainty</hi> of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
those Evidences which show the thing to be
<hi>True,</hi> show it at the same time to be <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be False;</hi> whence 'tis a thousand to one
that such Evidences as these would utterly
destroy his beloved <hi>Fallible Certainty,</hi> and
endanger to introduce again by necessary and
enforcing consequence that Popish Doctrine
of <hi>Infallibility</hi> which he had newly discarded</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:62077:86"/>
When he adds that every Christian <hi>may</hi> by
the means here assigned <hi>attain to so great a
degree of Certainty</hi> &amp;c. I had thought he had
meant <hi>Certainty of the Points of his Faith;</hi>
but my hopes were much defeated,
when, coming to the Point, he flyes off to his
Christians <hi>not doubting</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Arguments of Christian Religion and
of the Authority of the Scriptures;</hi> For this is
far wide of our purpose and his Promise,
which was to <hi>reduce the Faith of Protestants
to Principles;</hi> whereas these words signify
no more but not to doubt of <hi>Christianity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>True</hi> Religion, or Scriptures being
God's word; but reaches not to <hi>what are</hi>
those points of Christianity or <hi>determinate</hi>
sense of Scripture in particular, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
<hi>Protestantism,</hi> and only concerns our
debate. Now 'tis evident that the Roman-Catholicks
profess <hi>not to doubt</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Grounds of Christianity, nor yet of
Scripture, but to hold that Christianity is the
only-Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Religion, and that the Scriptures
are <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>God's word:</hi> and yet we differ
so much from Protestants that he thinks us
Idolaters. What we are then in reason to
expect from Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is, that he would bring
us Grounds for the Certainty of his Faith as
to <hi>determinate</hi> Points; viz. <hi>Christ's God-head,
a Trinity, Reality</hi> or <hi>not-Reality</hi> of Christ's
Body in the Eucharist and such like; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62077:87"/>
those so certain as <hi>that we may as well doubt of
what we judge to be most evident to sense and
Reason,</hi> as doubt of them, as he here pretends;
and not put us off with Common words in
stead of particular Satisfaction concerning
his Faith and the Certainty thereof.</p>
            <p>I would ask him then how it comes to
pass that the <hi>Socinian</hi> whom he will not deny
to have both <hi>use of his reason</hi> and <hi>common
helps of Grace,</hi> and both <hi>the convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Christian Religion</hi> and <hi>Authority
of Scriptures</hi> to make use of, how, I say, he
comes so to fall short of <hi>Evidence</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>Certainty</hi> springing from that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
concerning <hi>Christ's God-Head</hi> (which
is a Fundamental Point of Christian Faith,)
that he <hi>doubts</hi> it, nay utterly <hi>denies</hi> it, whereas
yet the Protestant having the <hi>same</hi> means to
work with, judges he has <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
grounded on that evidence that Christ
<hi>is God;</hi> yet all this while they dissent not at
all in things <hi>most evident to Sense or Reason?</hi>
I much fear our Drs. big words concerning
his <hi>degrees of Evidence</hi> and the <hi>Certainty</hi> of
his Faith built on those degrees will, when
examin'd, amount to a very <hi>obscure evidence</hi>
and a <hi>Problematical</hi> kind of <hi>Assuredness;</hi>
much like those comfortable lights which
both parties have when they lay even wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
at Cock-fighting &amp; such games; giving
good <hi>hopes</hi> to <hi>both</hi> sides, but good <hi>Security</hi> to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62077:87"/>
               <hi>neither.</hi> But, so it ought to be, if the Grounds
of Faith be not <hi>Infallibly</hi> but only <hi>Fallibly-Certain.</hi>
which is all he is bent to prove.</p>
            <p>25. No man who firmly Assents to any thing
as True, can at the same time entertain any
suspicion of the falshood of it; for that were to
make him certain and uncertain of the same
thing: It is therefore absurd to say that these
who are Certain of what they believe, may at
the same time not know but it may be False; which
is an apparent Contradiction, and overthrows
any Faculty in us of judging of Truth and
Falshood.</p>
            <p>This Principle and the next were, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
intended to preserve the Dr's and
his Friends Credit against the <hi>Inference</hi> at
the end of <hi>Faith vindicated</hi> and diverse other
Passages, shewing them either to be far from
good <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>holding</hi> that all Christian
Faith may possibly be an <hi>Errour</hi> and Lying
Imposture, or else very bad Discoursers of
their own <hi>Thoughts</hi> whilst they <hi>equivalently</hi>
exprest themselves in divers places to be
possibly in an Errour in all they believe, nay
more all Christians in the whole world to be
in the same condition. This, if justified, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but reflect on them, being so concerning
a Lapse, and I have at Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s brisk instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
charg'd it home in <hi>Reason against Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery;</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:62077:88"/>
though I still expres't my self to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to the more Civil and more Charitable
side; and rather lay the blame on their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
then on their Wills and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.
Which Book had Dr. <hi>St.</hi> seen

the triflingness of these weak excuses. But

assents to a thing as True</hi> is <hi>Certain</hi> of it, as

Nothing is so proper to reconcile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,

or <hi>such</hi> a certainty as is <hi>none:</hi> Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

certainty, or <hi>Certainties</hi> that are <hi>no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,</hi>
can work wonders, and even do
more then miracle. Ridiculous Folly! not
to see that when any one says [<hi>I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
af such a thing</hi>] all mankind understands
him to mean he has such <hi>Grounds</hi> as infer
that thing <hi>is</hi> as he <hi>says,</hi> and not only that
he has a <hi>Firm Assent to it as True,</hi> without
intending that he has any Grounds to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the Truth of it. This is what I often
reflected upon in Dr. <hi>T.</hi> (<hi>Reason against
Railery,</hi>) that his discourse still aim'd to take
the business of Certainty out of the hands
of the <hi>Object,</hi> and put it constantly upon
the <hi>Subject,</hi> and to make account he was
<hi>sure</hi> the thing <hi>was so,</hi> because he verily
<hi>judg'd</hi> it, or did <hi>not doubt it</hi> to be so; And
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is here carrying on the same wise
plot to which he begun to make way in his
<hi>20th</hi> Princip. where he told us that <hi>Assent
is not built on the nature of things but their
Evidence to us'</hi> Indeed, if he speak of an
Assent which it matters not whether it be
<hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> or, rather which <hi>is</hi> or <hi>may be</hi>
False 'tis meerly built on our own Fancies
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62077:89"/>
and Conceits (which I suppose he must
mean there by the word <hi>Evidence</hi>) But if
the Assent we speak of, and to which
himself applies it, be that of <hi>Faith,</hi> which
must necessarily be <hi>True;</hi> both It and the
Evidence which immediately breeds it
<hi>must</hi> forcibly either be built on the <hi>nature
of things,</hi> or else on <hi>nothing,</hi> and so both the
pretended <hi>Evidence</hi> is a <hi>False Light,</hi> and the
<hi>Assent</hi> it self <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Chimerical.</hi> On the
other side, in case if the <hi>Evidence</hi> and
consequently the <hi>Assent</hi> be built on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, which are Footsteps of Gods
Infinite Wisdom in which he has imprinted
all Created Truths, and establisht them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
penalty of the highest Folly and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
<hi>to be inerrably what they are;</hi> it
follows, that; in case the <hi>Evidence</hi> had from
those things be indeed a <hi>true Evidence</hi> or a
<hi>right Knowledge</hi> of their natures, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

and It's <hi>Certainty</hi> built on those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
so that as their <hi>Metaphysical verity</hi>

in <hi>being what they are;</hi> so <hi>Formal

Unchangeableness or an Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
built on <hi>Knowledge</hi> of those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that is an <hi>Infallibleness.</hi> No wonder
then both our Drs. in their weak discourses
fly off so from depending for their Assents or
Faith on the <hi>Objects</hi> or Natures of things, and
recurr still to the <hi>Subject,</hi> for by this means
<hi>Common Sense</hi> is driven out of the world, and
<hi>Non-sense</hi> and <hi>Contradiction</hi> grow in great
request. And, first, Infallibility or true Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is radically destroyed, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
(according to the discourse now made)
must forcibly be admitted: then <hi>Fallible
Certainty</hi> comes into great Credit, or such a

deny that this plea will either acquit him or
Dr. T. from the imputation of making

objected; for why may not this man who

unless he can shew that that Assent of his
depends on the <hi>Object</hi> or is built on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably-fixt
<hi>natures of Things,</hi> which
Dr. <hi>St.</hi> denies in express terms, <hi>Princ.</hi> 20. or
what can establish him in his <hi>Assent</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi>
if that do not? Is it not evident he <hi>may</hi> change
if he may see <hi>true Reason</hi> may be brought <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
it? What would do him credit in this
case is to offer to make it out that, (Assent
requiring Evidence, and, so, <hi>Firm</hi> Assent
<hi>Clear</hi> Evidence,) he has this <hi>Clear Evidence</hi>
from the <hi>Object</hi> to ground this <hi>Firm Assent,</hi>
for then we may be sure his Assent will be
Unalterable and <hi>solidly-grounded,</hi> or Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be False, as becomes Faith; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultory,
Inconstant and weakly-built, as is
the nature of <hi>Opinion.</hi> But this my two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
must not do: For how can they
pretend to an Unalterable Assent, if <hi>Assent

I grant it <hi>absurd;</hi> nay more, I affirm that in

at <hi>any time</hi> ever afterwards, unless the thing
it self hap to be <hi>in that regard</hi> Alterable.
For true Certainty is built on the thing's <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

thing should be True and False at the same time:
Therefore they who assent firmly to the Doctrin
of the Gospel as true, do thereby declare their

of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:62077:92"/>
The first part I easily grant, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it to be most valid. And, for the same
reason, I expect he will in counterchange
grant me this Proposition, that <hi>whatever
words say, prove or imply a thing possible to be
False, do at the same time say, prove, or imply
that 'tis not necessarily true.</hi> And then Dr. T.
must consider how he will avoid the force of
it, who makes Scripture the <hi>sole Rule of
Faith,</hi> or the <hi>only</hi> means for Mankind to be
<hi>assur'd</hi> of their Faith, and yet (<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
p. 118.) professes that both the <hi>Letter</hi> and
<hi>Sense</hi> of it are <hi>possible to be otherwise</hi> than the
Protestants take them to be; which, in case
they take their sense of Scripture or Faith to
be <hi>True,</hi> must mean, <hi>possible to be otherwise
than True,</hi> that is, <hi>possible to be False.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his own contrary Positions hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no, is not my Concern.</p>
            <p>As for his Inference, I deny that <hi>assenting</hi>
(being an Interiour Act) <hi>is declaring</hi> ones
<hi>belief.</hi> But I suppose he meant it thus. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they who</hi> [declare they] <hi>assent firmly to
the doctrin of the Gospel as True, do thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their belief of the Impossibility of the Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of it;</hi> and thus, this is readily also grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
only in requital I expect he <hi>should</hi> (for
I am sure he <hi>must</hi>) grant me this counter-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that <hi>therefore they who declare their
belief of the possibility of Falsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it's Grounds, or of the Letter and Sense of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62077:92"/>
Gospel, do thereby declare they do not assent
firmly to the doctrin of the Gospel as true.</hi> Which
done, let Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and his Friend look to the
Consequences of it. It lies <hi>still</hi> very heavy
upon their Credit as Writers, and ever <hi>must</hi>
till they retract it. No sincere Protestant
who loves <hi>his Faith</hi> more then <hi>their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
will ever be brought to <hi>endure</hi> it, if he
once set himself seriously to <hi>consider</hi> it.</p>
            <p>27. The Nature of Certainty doth receive
several Names, either according to the nature
of the proof or the degrees of the Assent. Thus
<hi>Moral Certainty</hi> may be so called, either as it
is opposed to Mathematical Evidence, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
a firm Assent upon the highest Evidence
that Moral things can receive; Or, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to higher degrees of Certainty in the same
kind. So <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> implyes only grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Probabilities</hi> of one side than the other; In
the former sense we assert the <hi>Certainty</hi> of
Christian Faith to be <hi>moral,</hi> but not only in the
latter.</p>
            <p>This Principle is pernicious to <hi>Human
Nature</hi> as well as to <hi>Faith,</hi> and destructive
to <hi>all Principles</hi> in the world that are <hi>true</hi>
ones and not like it self.</p>
            <p>First, it designs to give us the <hi>several Names</hi>
which the <hi>nature of Certainty doth receive,</hi>
but it does indeed acquaint us with some
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62077:93"/>
               <hi>species</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of Certainty, unless he will
say that the <hi>moral Certainty</hi> he assignes to
Faith is of the same kind with <hi>Probability,</hi>
which I perceive he is loath to own. Next,
to what purpose is it to discourse of <hi>one</hi> or
<hi>more</hi> sorts of Certainty or to <hi>distinguish</hi> it's
Notion, unless we fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t knew the Common
notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> it self. The word <hi>Moral</hi>
which is one of it's <hi>Differences,</hi> and chiefly
intended to be explained here is hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of it self <hi>alone;</hi> but when to this shall
be added a new difficulty of not knowing
what [<hi>Certainty</hi>] which is the <hi>Genus</hi> means,
we are like to make a wise business of it.
Now, all the Knowledge we have hitherto
gain'd of <hi>Certainty</hi> in a discourse purposely
intended to make us under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tand the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Faith,</hi> is this, that 'tis <hi>a firm Assent to
a thing as true,</hi> and that there may be a <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Certainty,</hi> both manifestly imply'd in
his discourse: where, all that we can gather
of the Nature of Certainty by the <hi>former,</hi> is
that perhaps 'tis a <hi>fixing</hi> or <hi>resting</hi> in some
Tenet <hi>without any ground;</hi> and by the later
that 'tis a Chimaera or Nonsense. Thirdly,
he distinguishes <hi>Certainty according to the
nature of the Proof, or the degree of the Assent;</hi>
but I vehemently deny it as the most absurd
Position imaginable, that there can be <hi>any</hi>
kind of Certainty taken from the <hi>degrees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f
the Assent</hi> in contradistinction to <hi>the nature
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62077:93"/>
of the Proof,</hi> for this would make as if the
<hi>Subject</hi>'s or person's assenting <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi>
did constitute some Certainties without any
<hi>kind</hi> of nature of <hi>Proof,</hi> that is without <hi>any</hi>
regard had to the <hi>Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he acquaints us with <hi>one</hi> kind of
[<hi>Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng that this Moral Certainty,
(as he apprehends it) is indeed the Issue of
no kind of <hi>Evidence</hi> at all but of meer <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity,</hi>
or at best of some conjectural glance
of Likelihood. But he <hi>describes</hi> or gives us
some <hi>distinct</hi> Knowledge of this <hi>Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
telling us that it <hi>implies a firm Assent

Faith.</hi> Where, first I would know whether
this <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty here mention'd, be an
<hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> or a <hi>Fallible</hi> one; and I
presume he will answer 'tis a <hi>Fallible</hi> one,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62077:94"/>
for <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite;
which is a fair beginn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng towards
the <hi>ascertaning</hi> Faith. Next, I would desire
him to speak out candidly and tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty put Faith abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
out of <hi>possibility of being False;</hi> or
whether, notwithstanding this <hi>Certainty,</hi> it
may with Truth be said, that still <hi>absolutely
speaking</hi> all Christian Faith may be an <hi>Errour</hi>
or <hi>Mistake</hi> of the world. I presume he will
not say 'tis absolutely Impossible it should
be all a Mistake because 'tis so protected by
this Moral Certainty; for he makes this a
<hi>less</hi> degree of Certainty than Mathematical
Certainty is, and Dr. <hi>T.</hi> has told us there
can be no degrees in Absolute Impossibilities;
besides, I see not how a <hi>Fallible</hi> Certainty
can establish any Tenet <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi>
for an <hi>Infallible</hi> Certainty, which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
<hi>above</hi> that, can do <hi>no more.</hi> And
yet, for all that, 'tis dangerous to his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
(for 'tis indeed blasphemous) to say
that <hi>all Christian Faith may possibly be a lying
Imposture for any thing any man living knows;</hi>
or that <hi>all the Christians in the world, though
relying and proceeding to their power on the
Means God has appointed to establish them in
True Faith, may notwithstanding be possibly
in an Errour.</hi> I suppose then he will recurr
to his late excuse and tell us, that <hi>no man
who firmly assents to any thing as true can at
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62077:94"/>
the same time entertain any suspicion of it's
Falshood.</hi> But this is nothing to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

but his <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>Discourses;</hi> let him clear

for better Evasions, which I am sure
can never be candid and Scholar-like, but
some learned quirks and Jeers, and address
my self to a farther examination of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Principle. <hi>3ly,</hi> then I would ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Firmness</hi> of this Assent which he
says here Moral Certainty <hi>implies,</hi> be taken
from the <hi>Object,</hi> or from the <hi>Subject?</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he will say <hi>here</hi> from the Object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he says 'tis <hi>upon the highest Evidence
Moral things can receive;</hi> but I perceive
him dispos'd even while he says so to blame
the Things for <hi>receiving no more.</hi> I doubt
he should rather blame <hi>himself</hi> for <hi>receiving</hi>
no more from those Moral Objects, who are
both <hi>as able</hi> and <hi>as ready</hi> to afford him <hi>perfect</hi>
Evidence as perhaps any other things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
did he dispose himself to receive it. For,
are not <hi>Moral</hi> things as firmly establisht in
their respective determinate natures as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
and <hi>Mathematical</hi> things, from which
Establishment <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Science</hi> is taken? Is
not a <hi>will</hi> as Certainly a <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62077:95"/>
necessarily <hi>Liberty</hi> as a <hi>Triangle</hi> is a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle?</hi>
Again, are not <hi>Voluntary, Liberty,
Virtue, Vice</hi> and such like, very Intelligible
words, aud consequently the Natures of
<hi>Moral</hi> things <hi>Knowable</hi> as well as others in
other Sciences. I wonder then why the
<hi>Evidences</hi> of Moral things cannot be as
<hi>high</hi> as that of Mathematical things, since the
natures of both are <hi>equally Firm,</hi> both natures
can be <hi>known,</hi> and so engaged in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
<hi>of</hi> them and <hi>from</hi> them, and <hi>all science</hi>
or <hi>Evidence</hi> springs from engaging the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sum then is, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> hath given Faith
excellent good words, in telling us it's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Certainty <hi>implys a firm Assent upon the
highest Evidence Moral things can receive:</hi>
but, looking to the bottom of his meaning,
he intends it only a <hi>Fallible Certainty</hi> or such
as <hi>may</hi> still permit it to be <hi>False;</hi> and so the
right descant upon his fine words is in true
construction this. He allows Faith such a
<hi>Certainty</hi> as is <hi>Vncertain;</hi> such a <hi>Firmness</hi>
as may both <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>break;</hi> such an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
in it's Grounds as is <hi>Obscure,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
makes it such an <hi>Assent</hi> as is <hi>Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional:</hi>
All which and much more must needs
follow from this rejecting <hi>Infallible Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in the Gronnds of Faith. If he thinks I
wrong him, let us put it to the test; Let him
take the best of those <hi>Evidences</hi> or Proofs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62077:95"/>
which ground his Moral Certainty, and put
it with the help of a little Logick into a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism
or two, and then tell me whether it
does necessarily conclude the Truth of Faith
or no. If it <hi>concludes,</hi> why does he not say
Faith is <hi>absolutely Certain,</hi> but mince it with
<hi>Moral?</hi> If it concludes <hi>not,</hi> how can all the
world avoid but his pretended <hi>Evidence</hi> is
<hi>Obscure;</hi> his pretended <hi>Certainty</hi> built on
that Evidence, <hi>Vncertain;</hi> the <hi>Firmness</hi> of
that Assent, <hi>Infirm;</hi> and the <hi>Assent</hi> it self to
a Conclusion thus unprov'd, and no ways
Evident (in a man capable to comprehend
what ought in due of Right Reason cause
<hi>Assent</hi>) privatively <hi>Irrational,</hi> or Faulty.</p>
            <p>28. A Christian being thus Certain, to the
highest degree of a firm Assent, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are the Word of God, his Faith is thereby
resolved into the Scriptures as into the Rule and
Measure of what he is to believe; as it is into
tht veracity of God as the Ground of his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what is therein contained.</p>
            <p>A Christian who is <hi>no better</hi> Certain then
<hi>thus;</hi> that is by Grounds allowing only such
a Certainty as is not absolutely or truly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive</hi>
of the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith (as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
no more by his <hi>Moral</hi> Certainty) is
<hi>not</hi> Certain <hi>at all:</hi> As appears farther by the
next words, <hi>Certain</hi> [<hi>to the highest degree
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62077:96"/>
of a firm Assent.</hi>] the meaning of which must
be that this <hi>highest degree of a firm Assent</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>Certainty</hi> he intends
his Faith according to his former doctrin,
and <hi>constitutes</hi> or <hi>explicates</hi> it; or else that
at least it helps to <hi>make up</hi> this Certainty, that
is <hi>perfect</hi> it within it's notion, and make it
<hi>more</hi> a Certainty or a <hi>better</hi> Certainty; which
makes the Conclusiveness or Evidence had
from the Object needless to create a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and signifies thus much in plain Terms
[<hi>Think or imagine what you will, so you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it strongly, and hold it stifly, you are as
Certain of it as may be.</hi>] Had he said, <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is or may be thus Certain by such a Proof
had from the Object as was truly Conclusive of
the Thing,</hi> how Genuin, Coherent &amp; Clear
had his Expression been, which now is forc't;
Incongruous and Obscure? how Agreeable
to Reason and the nature of <hi>Certainty</hi> as all
Mankind understands it; which now is most
Irrational and Unsuitable to the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
How Honourable and Creditable had
it been to his Cause, and to himself too as a
Writer? But men that have not <hi>Truth</hi> on
their side, and consequently are quite desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnte
of found <hi>Principles</hi> and true <hi>Grounds,</hi>
must not dare to speak Sense. Himself told us
(<hi>Princ.</hi> 20.) that <hi>the nature of Assent is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Evidence we have of it in our Minds,</hi>
let him remember then that <hi>the highest degree
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62077:96"/>
of a firm Assent</hi> requires in reason <hi>the highest
gree of Clear Evidence</hi> to beget it, which
yet he lately deny'd to be had from <hi>Moral</hi>
things, and attributed it peculiarly to the
<hi>Mathematicks.</hi> So that all is Incoherent,
all is Common and big words, hollow and
so of a loud and high Sound, but without any
determinate Sense.</p>
            <p>Again, how does it follow, that because
a Christian is <hi>thus Certain that the Scriptures
are the Word of God,</hi> that therefore <hi>his Faith
is thereby resolved into the Scriptures as into the
Rule and Measure of what he is to believe?</hi>
There is not the least show of consequence
for this, unless he had first prov'd that God
had intended to speak so clear in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as every private Understanding should
not sail of being secur'd from mistake while
it rely'd upon It; as also that God had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to us no other way but by the written
Word, which he <hi>has</hi> no where prov'd, nor
<hi>can</hi> ever prove. And, if the former of these
(as experience tels us 'tis) be wanting, 'tis
not a <hi>Rule</hi> to those Persons; if the latter,
'tis not necessarily the <hi>Measure</hi> of what they
are to believe.</p>
            <p>29. No Christian can be oblig'd under any
pretence of Infallibility to believe any thing
as a matter of Faith, but what was revealed by
God himself in that Book wherein he believes

his Will to be contained, and consequently is
bound to reject whatsoever is offer'd to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon his Faith which has no foundation in

is no making Negative Articles of

believe nothing necessary to Salvation, but what
is contain'd in Scripture, therefore no such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
things which neither are there nor can
be deduc't thence.</p>
            <p>If Christians were bound to hold that God
had reveal'd his <hi>whole</hi> Will in that Book, and
this <hi>so clearly</hi> that <hi>all</hi> or <hi>most</hi> Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tians could
not miss of understanding it right so as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to be <hi>absolutely Certain of their Faith,</hi> then
indeed the first half of his Principle here runs
very currently and smoothly: but these rubs

               </gap>d, they being also satisfy'd
by the General Conceit of Christianity, and
by the Nature and <hi>Genius</hi> of Christian Faith,
that it cannot possibly be an <hi>Errour</hi> or <hi>Lye,</hi>
and, consequently, mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t have such Grounds
as cannot possibly permit all the world to be
<hi>in</hi> an Errour while they rely on them, that
is, Grounds which are <hi>Infallibly secure,</hi> and,
on the other side, observing both by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
and Reason that Scripture <hi>is not</hi> such
a Ground as that private Understandings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62077:99"/>
to it, are thereby perserv'd from possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of erring (as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> also confesses in
his next Principle) hence they are invited
strongly to conceive that God has left some
Persons on earth easily to be found who may
supply what is wanting of Clearness to
Scriptures Letter in the highest Points of
Faith; and that God will <hi>some</hi> way or <hi>other</hi>
perserve them from <hi>erring,</hi> and that while
thus protected by God's signal Providence
(whether this be performed Naturally, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally,
or both wayes) they <hi>cannot
Erre</hi> in that Affair, or in acquainting us with
right Faith. So that, unless Dr. <hi>St.</hi> make
out solidly that Scripture has in it the true
nature of the <hi>Rule of Faith, of it self</hi> and
without needing any Church, he must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in reason that the very nature of Faith
will necessarily incline all sincere persons,
who have due care of their souls and of
finding out true Faith, to beleeve the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, whereas he says that their <hi>rejection of
such Points which have no Foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or are contrary thereto is no making
New Articles of Faith, but only applying
the General Grounds of Faith to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Instances,</hi> he discourses therein very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonantly
to his own Grounds were they
worth any thing; Yet, I have one thing
to propose to his Consideration, which is,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62077:100"/>
that to justify his Reformers he must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Grounds full as good or rather <hi>better</hi>
for the <hi>Rejection</hi> of those Points as for his
<hi>Faith;</hi> or to speak more distinctly, he must
have <hi>as</hi> perfect (or rather <hi>perfecter</hi>) Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
for these two Propositions [<hi>Nothing
it to be beleeved which has no Foundation in
Scripture</hi>] and [<hi>This</hi> or <hi>that rejected Point
has no Foundation in Scripture</hi>] as he has for
any point of Christian Faith For, since upon
the Evidence they had of these two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they disobey'd and rebell'd against their
then lawful Superiours and Church Pastors,
and broke Church-Union, which was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
forbidden by God's Law, and so the
preserving Union &amp; obeying them, is a point
of Faith, and which themselves confess <hi>is</hi> such
and binds them <hi>as such</hi> in case the reasons for
their imposing New points be not valid,
that is, if these two Propositions on whose
Evidence they rely'd when they alledged
they were wrongfully impos'd, and thence
rejected them, be not <hi>True;</hi> it follows that
they must at least have <hi>equal</hi> Evidence (nay
<hi>more,</hi> for bare <hi>Equality</hi> would only <hi>Balance</hi>
them in a doubtful <hi>suspence</hi> berween either
side) that those Propositions on which they
grounds their Rejection of those Articles,
and disobedience to their Pastours aad Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
are <hi>True,</hi> as they have for their
Faith. And, if the Grounds of this Reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62077:100"/>
ought to be <hi>more</hi> Certain then the
Grounds of their Faith, there is either some
thing wrong in the pretended Grounds of
their Faith, or else their <hi>Negative Articles</hi>
ought to be allow'd the honour of being
<hi>Points of Faith</hi> too, since their <hi>greater</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
gives them fair and equal Title to it,
if not Absolute <hi>Preemin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>30. There can be no better way to prevent
mens mistakes in the sense of Scripture (which
men being Fallible are subject to) than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the consequence of mistaking in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherein their salvation is concern'd: and
there can be no sufficient reason why that may
not serve in matters of Faith, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath made use of as the means to keep them
from Sin in their lives: Vnless any imagine
that Errours in Opinion are far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to mens souls then a vicious life is, and
therefore God is bound to take more care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the one then the other.</p>
            <p>The Dr. being conscious to himself that
he had, notwithstanding all his promises to
reduce Faith to Principles, and to prove it's
Certainty, left it still <hi>Vncertain,</hi> thought it
his best Expedient to close his blinde Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
with a <hi>speeding</hi> one, which (to the
shame of all Principles) should maintain
that it <hi>need not be Certain;</hi> though he couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62077:101"/>
this sense <hi>warily</hi> as it behooves him.</p>
            <p>He seems to ground his Sceptical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
on this, that <hi>Men are Fallible,</hi> and so
<hi>subject to mistake the sence</hi> of the Scriptures.
I wish he would speak out once in his life
and tell us plainly whether all Mankinde be
<hi>Fallible in every thing</hi> or only in <hi>some things,</hi>
and in <hi>some</hi> Circumstances? Again, whether
he means that men are <hi>naturally</hi> Fallible, or
<hi>supernaturally,</hi> that is by means of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Power, if it should set it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf to deceive
them. If the later, 'tis not, nor ought to be
our Question; for no man who has any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
for God or his Attributes, will ever
think that he will do <hi>Miracles</hi> still to leade
Mankind into <hi>Errour,</hi> but rather judge it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
his Goodness to provide, in case the
Good of the world or the Church should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that some extraordinary thing be
done, that Mankind should have notice of it
by some Certain way to prevent his Erring,
as it happens in the case of the Eucharist.
Taking him then to mean that man is <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fallible,</hi> we enquire further; Is all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
(however <hi>one</hi> sence or <hi>another</hi> acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
may be insincere in one or another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular)
yet is <hi>all</hi> Mankind naturally Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in their daily Sensations, or which is
all one, are the Senses of all Mankind so
fram'd as to convey wrong Impressions
into his Knowing Power? If not, they <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:62077:101"/>
erre <hi>naturally:</hi> nor do I think Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will
say our Senses <hi>thus</hi> and in <hi>this</hi> are <hi>Fallible;</hi>
If he does, I know not what to say of him;
which is, that he is a perfect Pyrrhonian and
unworthy of Mankind's Conversation or
Discourse with him; for, to what end should
men discourse with him, if, all his Senses
being Fallible, himself knows not whether
they discourse or no? I ask still further, Are
men <hi>naturally Fallible</hi> in some things not had
immediately from sense, for example, in
knowing that the world was on foot a year
before we were born? or in First Principles,
as <hi>Aequale est aequale sibi, An Equal equal
to it self?</hi> Or in a Conclusion immediately
depending on <hi>such</hi> Principles, as that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
three lines drawn from the Center to the
Circumference are equal,</hi> and such like? I
think he will not say it. We see then Men
are capable of Infallibility or Certainty of
their own nature: wherefore they can
aim at it and desire it, especially in Faith,
which is of so high a Concern to their Souls
and the <hi>basis</hi> of all their Spiritual Building,
therefore, both for <hi>that</hi> Reason and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>others</hi> recounted and inforced by me in
<hi>Faith Vindicated</hi> and elsewhere, they <hi>ought</hi>
to <hi>have</hi> this Certainty (especially since the
<hi>Truth</hi> of Faith is neither Proveable, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
nor professible without it) in case
such a Certainty be not in it self Impossible,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62077:102"/>
and that <hi>'tis not</hi> so, I have said something
both in my <hi>Reason against Raillery,</hi> p. 64. to
67. and p. 112. to p. 116. as also in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Treatise in my Answer to the 27. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>But, setting this aside, we will proceed
and demand still farther; Are men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable

absolutely clear his doubt, and
make himself be throughly understood? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
tels us they can, and that they may
as easily be mistaken in their Sensations as
in such kinde of Expressions. We see then
Men are Infallible in many things, and even
in understanding <hi>words</hi> aright in same cases.
If then they be Fallible in understanding
Scriptures, and this in the main and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Points of Christianity, as was shown
above, 'tis evident this Fallibility is not to
be refunded totally into the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Man</hi>
(since he is capable of <hi>Infallible</hi> Certainty
in <hi>other</hi> things) but into the want of Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Letter of Scripture (as to such
Points) in proportion to private Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
and consequently that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62077:102"/>
intended by God for their <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi>
since, though both sides rely on this, yet one
(even while doing thus) is still in an Errour;
and such an Errour as is a Heresie.</p>
            <p>Since then what we hold is, that men are
Infallible <hi>in affairs</hi> belonging to Faith, and
this while they rely on the Grounds left by
God for them to embrace Faith, I would ask
him in a word, whether he holds <hi>all</hi> men <hi>may
be deceived</hi> in that very affair <hi>even while they
do this to the best of their power?</hi> If he says
they <hi>can,</hi> 'tis unavoidable <hi>all</hi> the Christian
<hi>world</hi> may possibly be now in an <hi>Errour,</hi> and
<hi>all</hi> Christian Faith be a <hi>meer lye:</hi> As also, 'tis
evident, that in that case God would have
left no ordinary means to secure his <hi>Church</hi> or
any man in it from Errour; &amp; lastly, that God
<hi>leads men</hi> into Errour, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is their want of Perspicuity or sufficient
Plainness to their addicted and faithfully-endeavouring
Understandings, even as to
those main Points.</p>
            <p>Thus much to show how craftily Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to
avoid reflexion on the Unfitness of the <hi>Rule</hi>
he assigns, puts it only upon <hi>men's</hi> being
<hi>Fallible,</hi> and how unreasonably he behaves

provides against this Fallibility lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62077:103"/>
               <hi>all Mankind</hi> should erre in their Faith.
He tels us that there can be no better way to
prevent men's mistakes in the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which men being Fallible are subject
to, than the <hi>considering the consequence of
mistaking in a matter wherein their Salvation
is concern'd.</hi> Well, put this <hi>Consideration</hi> in
men, are any of them by vertue thereof yet
<hi>Infallible,</hi> or secur'd from erring in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Scripture? If not, <hi>all mankind</hi> may
yet according to his Grounds be in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in matters belonging to Faith, and so
<hi>all Christian Faith</hi> may still <hi>possibly be False,</hi>
notwithstanding all the Provision put by him
to secure <hi>them</hi> and <hi>It.</hi> But if this render
them absolutely secure from Erring, then
we may hope <hi>God's Church</hi> too may have
the grace given her by God as well as a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
man, to <hi>consider the consequence of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
also,</hi> I am sure it as much concerns
<hi>her,</hi> and so the Church (or, as he cals it <hi>a

and <hi>explaining</hi> Scripture; and,
by this means, we are come about again to

<hi>Infallible</hi> in that thing or in interpreting
Scripture, and by consequence that Christian
Faith is <hi>Infallibly Certain,</hi> or else confess
that, notwithstanding all means us'd, all
<hi>Christian Faith</hi> is still either <hi>not Certain at all,</hi>
or else <hi>Fallibly Certain,</hi> which is a peece of
most profound Nonsense; and, were it sense,

            </p>
            <p>The later half of this Principle, is still
more admirable Nonsense than the former,
and shows how meanly he is verst in solid
Divinity; he conterposes there the Certainty
in <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> to <hi>that which God has
made use of as the means to keep men from Sin

by God to make men <hi>Virtuous</hi> and the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

<hi>means.</hi> But because I see Dr. <hi>St.</hi> though
he have a very good witt, yet by reason of
his sole Application to <hi>verbal Divinity,</hi>
which never reaches the Ground or Bottom
of any thing it talks of, is very Ignorant of
what is meant by Christian Life and it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Vice, or Sin, I will take a little pains to

the Proper way for him to worship God is in
<hi>spirit,</hi> that is by Spiritual Acts or Habits to
perfect his Soul, or that part in us which is
Spiritual, and dispose is for Heaven; But
<hi>Errour</hi> is also <hi>spiritual,</hi> and yet is far from
perfecting our Soul, therefore <hi>Truth</hi> must
go along with it, and so we are to worship
God in <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> Hence, the first of
virtues, in priority of Nature is true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and of the motives or means
to attain him, and the only way for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
to arrive at these is by <hi>beleeving</hi> his
Divine Authority upon some way of <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
which gives his Church and by her and
all others Absolute Certainty 'tis engaged;
by which means we are perfectly secure that
what we proceed upon is God's sense, or
Truth, which is the <hi>Basis</hi> of all our Spiritual
building. Out of these <hi>Knowledges</hi> are apt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62077:104"/>
to spring <hi>Adoration, Reverence, Hope,</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> of him above all things, in Christian
Language call'd <hi>Charity,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of all
<hi>Virtues, (major autem horuni Charitas,</hi> says
St. <hi>Paul</hi>) and out of this <hi>Love of God above
all things,</hi> Love of our Neighbour as our self;
in the heartiness of which, or the having that
Rational disposition in our hearts to do as
we would be done to, consists the keeping
all the Commandments of the Second Table;
which is also <hi>our</hi> good; for, so, more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturb'd
by Passion, or vexation from the
Exteriour World whose order we violate
in transgressing against these, we are more
free to practice those other vertues which
are to elevate us towards Heaven and fit us
according to the measure of out pitch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, for the Attainment of Bliss.
Hence is seen what is meant by <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>vice;</hi>
For, this, being formally a <hi>defect,</hi> is only a
<hi>want</hi> of the opposit good Disposition or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
The chief Vice then is <hi>Hatred</hi> of God,
or a very sleighting and perfectly deliberate
dis-regard &amp; Posthabition of his Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
self, our Final Bliss, to a Creature; next,
<hi>Despair, Irreverence, Infidelity,</hi> totally, as
in <hi>Heathenism,</hi> or in some particular, as
<hi>Tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place comes the <hi>want</hi> of that due <hi>Love</hi> of our
<hi>Neighbour</hi> for God's sake as leaves our Will
dispos'd (as far as that motive carries us) to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62077:105"/>
do him any injury for our own temporal
Convenience; in which consists the violation
of the Commandments of the Second Table.
Insomuch as, though a man commits not one
of those Acts there forbidden, out of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Worldly Honour, Civility, Fear or
any other such like, yet if he wants that
rightly-grounded Interiour Love of his
Neighbour and builds not his Avoidance of
harming him on <hi>that</hi> motive, that is, if he
be dispos'd to commit them <hi>all</hi> for any thing
that motive would hinder him, however in
the sight of man or <hi>Exteriourly</hi> he keeps
those Commandments, yet is he guilty of
them all <hi>Interiourly</hi> or in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>To apply this then to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
'Tis seen hence that Faith is the <hi>Basis</hi>
of all virtuous Life, and consequently the
want of it the <hi>ruin</hi> of all <hi>virtue</hi> and the ready
way to all <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>sin:</hi> For, <hi>external</hi> Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Avoiding are nothing to Christian
virtue, unless they spring from a Christian
motive: and 'tis only Faith which gives us
those Motives; and the stability, well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedness
or <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which renders
those Motives effectual. Wherefore, unless
the Faithful be <hi>materially Infallible</hi> while
they believe God has revealed such and fuch
things, that is, unless God did indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
them, and so their Faith be really <hi>True;</hi>
all <hi>Gods worship</hi> and <hi>Good life</hi> is ill-built, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62077:105"/>
and fals to the Ground: And unless
<hi>some</hi> of them, or those who are <hi>capable</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it to be True, be <hi>formally</hi> Infallible,
it would work less effectually in all those
who should re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lect that they saw not but it
might be False, or be made so reflect by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who were enemies to Faith; nor could
the <hi>Truth</hi> of Christian Faith be defended, or
made out, or be Justifiably recommended
to others as <hi>True,</hi> nor with Wisdom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
be <hi>profest</hi> True, by those who judge
themselves capable to look through it's
Grounds and yet see nothing <hi>Conclusive</hi> of
<hi>Truth</hi> in them. Wherefore this <hi>Fallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of his destroys all Efficacy, all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and even Essence of Faith, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
radically subverts and overthrows
all Christian Virtue, and all true Goodness.
Which, I attest the <hi>Authour</hi> and <hi>Finisher of
our Faith,</hi> is the true reason why I with so
much zeal and Earnestness oppose him and
his Friend, for advancing <hi>Vncertainty,</hi> and
consequently <hi>Scepticism in Faith,</hi> however
they and their angry passionate party are
pleas'd to apprehend me.</p>
            <p>I perceive Dr. <hi>St.</hi> will hope to evade by
saying that Christian virtue may be upheld
by the Certainty we have of <hi>some</hi> Points of
Faith, though <hi>others</hi> be <hi>Vncertain:</hi> which
Points, to make his Uncertainty of Faith go
down the better, he cals here <hi>Opinions.</hi> But,

if he means by <hi>Opinions</hi> the Tenets of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Christs Godhead and Presence in the

Christian Life one way or other) in which
we discern great parties differing who all

If, I say, these and such as these be the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi>
he speaks of, and counterposes them to
<hi>means to keep men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from sin in their lives;</hi> and
that the Rule of Faith he assigns leaves whol
Bodies of Reliers on it in actual Errour in
such Fundamental Points of Faith and of
most high concernment to good life, as has
been shown, even while they proceed upon
it; 'tis evident 'tis <hi>not</hi> the Rule God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Church and mankinde to build
their Faith on, and so none can presume of
security of mistake by relying purely upon
it; but all of Concern not known before by

               <head>Recapitulation.</head>
               <p>To meet with the absurd Positions <hi>exprest</hi>
or else <hi>imply'd</hi> in the Doctrin deliver'd here
by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in these last Eleven Principles of
his, I take leave to remind the Reader of
these few opposit Truths establisht in my
former Discourse.</p>
               <p>1. That Assent call'd <hi>Faith,</hi> taken as built
on the Motives left by God to light Mankind
to the Knowledge of his Will, (that is taken as
it ought to be taken, and as 'tis found in the
Generality) is for that Reason Absolutely
(that is, <hi>more then morally)</hi> Certain, or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be False.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Though the Nature of Assent depend
<hi>immediatly</hi> on the Evidence we have of it in
our minds when 'tis Rational; yet in case it be
<hi>True,</hi> as the Assent of Faith <hi>ought</hi> to be, it
must necessarily be built and depend <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally</hi>
on the nature of the Thing; since
without dependance on <hi>It,</hi> this Evidence it self
cannot possibly be had.</p>
               <p>3. A man may be <hi>materially</hi> Infallible, or
out of possibility of being actually deceiv'd in
judging the divine Authority is engag'd, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to <hi>another's</hi> Iudgment who <hi>is</hi> Infallible,
or in the right in thus judging, though he pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
not the reason <hi>why</hi> that other man <hi>comes
to be</hi> Infallible. Also he who is <hi>thus</hi> Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62077:107"/>
being in possession of those Truths (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
upon the Divine Authority as the Formal
motive of believing them) which Truths as
Principles beget those good <hi>Affections</hi> in him
in which consist our <hi>Christian</hi> Life: <hi>such</hi> a
man, I say, has consequently enough (speaking
abstractedly) for the <hi>Essence</hi> of Saving Faith,
though he be not <hi>Formally</hi> or knowingly Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
by penetrating the <hi>Conclusiveness</hi> of the
<hi>Grounds</hi> of Faith.</p>
               <p>4. To be thus <hi>materially</hi> Infallible, or thus
in the right in judging the Divine Authority
is engag'd, is <hi>requisite</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> for the
<hi>Essence</hi> of Faith; otherwise the believing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Divin Authority when 'tis <hi>not engag'd,</hi>
and so perhaps the believing and holding firmly
to abominable <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Hereticall</hi> Tenets
might be an Act of <hi>Faith;</hi> to assert which, is
both <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>most impious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. 'Tis requisite to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Faith
to be <hi>formally</hi> or Knowingly Infallible that
the Divine Authority is engag'd. For, since
it hazards <hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Errour</hi> to judge that
the Divine Authority is engag'd for any point
when 'tis not, it ought to breed <hi>suspence</hi> and
<hi>caution</hi> in Reflecters till they <hi>see</hi> it engag'd:
&amp; consequently the better they see this the more

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtily they are apt to assent to the point upon
the Divine Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rity: So that the <hi>Absolute
Certainty</hi> of the Grounds which <hi>conclude</hi> the
Divine Authority engag'd, <hi>betters</hi> and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62077:107"/>
                  <hi>strengthens</hi> the Act of Faith.</p>
               <p>6. However it be enough for the Faith of
those whose downright rudeness lets them not
reflect at all, to be only <hi>Materially</hi> Infallible
that God's Authority is engag'd, yet 'tis besides
of <hi>Absolute necessity</hi> to <hi>Reflecters</hi> who raise
doubts, especially for those who are very acute,
to discern some reason which <hi>cannot deceive</hi>
them, or to be formally or knowingly Infallible
that 'tis indeed actually engag'd for those points.
Otherwise it would follow that provision <hi>enough</hi>
had been made by God to satisfy or cause saving
Faith in <hi>Fools,</hi> and none at all to breed Faith
<hi>wise men;</hi> which, without satisfaction in this in
point is in possible to be expected in such through-sighted
Reflecters. The same <hi>Formal</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is necessary for the wisest sort of men in
the Church, both to <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it's Grounds in a Scholar-like way, as
also for their <hi>Profession</hi> of the Truth of
Faith, and other Obligations incumbent on them
as Faithfull, and lastly, for the Effects which
are to be bred in them by Faith's Certainty.</p>
               <p>7. Though then the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> needs not
to be actually <hi>penetrated</hi> by <hi>all</hi> the Faithfull
while they proceed unreflectingly, yet it ought
to be so qualifi'd that it may satisfy <hi>all</hi> who are
apt to <hi>reflect</hi> and so to <hi>doubt</hi> of their Faith;
that is, it's Ruling power ought to be penetrable
or evidenceable to them if they come to doubt:
and also so <hi>connatural</hi> and suitable to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elevated</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:62077:108"/>
and <hi>unreflecting</hi> thoughts of men of
<hi>all</hi> sorts, that it be the most apt that maybe to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish</hi>
the Faithfull in the mean time and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
them from doubting of their Faith. Both
these are found in Tradition, or Testifying Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and not in Scripture's Letter. <hi>That</hi>
therefore, and not <hi>This</hi> is the Rule of
Faith.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Infallible</hi> Certainty of Faith being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,

Scripture's Letter is the <hi>fittest</hi> for that End,
and that therefore it become Gods's Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes

and whereas he would argue thus, Princ. 7.
<hi>God hath chosen it for a Rule, therefore 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

               <p>The first, taking the words literally and
Properly as they ought to be taken in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
is <hi>against himself:</hi> for he confesses
there that such a <hi>way of Revelation is in it self
neccessary to our Intire Obedience to God's will,
as may make us know what the will of God is;</hi>
but common sense tells us that <hi>Fallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
(which only, having rejected <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Certainty he can maintain) is farr from
making us <hi>Know:</hi> This Principle therefore
is either <hi>against himself,</hi> or, if he means to go

               <p>The <hi>12th</hi> comes home to the point;

               <p>The <hi>13th</hi> begins with a False Position,

and endeavours to induce a most
Extravagant Conclusion only from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses

               <p>The <hi>14tb</hi> contains <hi>three</hi> False and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd

his Church to deliver his <hi>whole</hi> will

sincere Reader with <hi>such</hi> a Certainty as is
requisit to <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>15th</hi> begins again with a False
and unprov'd Supposition, and draws
thence a consequence not contain'd in the
Proof, and, in part, against the interest of
his own Tenet; and, Lastly, brings in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of it an Instance which makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself.</p>
               <p>The <hi>16th</hi> putts upon Catholicks a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
they never held, and is wholly False,
Irrational and Absurd: assuming <hi>gratis</hi> this
position, that nothing but <hi>Miracle</hi> ought
to serve, whether there be <hi>other</hi> Means
laid or no; Or, that <hi>no</hi> Proof but <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi>
can possibly be sufficient to satisfy
mens Reasons in a thing <hi>Subject to Reason.</hi>
For, the <hi>Natural</hi> Assistance of the Church
is <hi>such</hi> of it self, and the <hi>Suppernatural,</hi>
supposing the knowledge of <hi>Sanctity</hi> in the
Church, is as plain Reason as that the
greatest motives to Goodness, and Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Goodness caus'd by those motives,
will make those good men who have it
act as <hi>good</hi> men ought and are apt
to do.</p>
               <p>The <hi>17th</hi> proceeds wholly upon a False
Imputation laid on our Church, and on
his confounding most absurdly the notion
of the <hi>Church</hi> with that of the <hi>Schools;</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taking a <hi>few</hi> speculative Divines,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62077:111"/>
and those the <hi>weakest,</hi> to be the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>18th</hi> is again built on an <hi>unprov'd
Supposition</hi> (of which kind of Grounds he
is still very <hi>free</hi>) and on a falsely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
promise from God so to secure
any private-spirited Contemner of the
Church that he shall be in the <hi>way to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
whether he <hi>Err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> or <hi>no;</hi> though (as
common sense and the Order of the world
gives it) he forfeit both his Reason and
his Virtue by not hearing his Lawfull and
Learned Pastors rather than his self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
Ignorant self.</p>
               <p>The <hi>19th</hi> has the <hi>same</hi> Faults with the
<hi>former,</hi> and is wholly False, even though
his own Supposition, mention'd in the
close, were freely granted him, which
'tis not.</p>
               <p>The four Principles following are made
up of these Errours. 1. That we hold
that <hi>no</hi> man can have a True and <hi>saving
Faith</hi> unless he <hi>sees</hi> and <hi>knows</hi> that the
Proponent is <hi>Infallible.</hi> 2. That the nature
of Assent (when rational) depends <hi>not</hi> on
the <hi>Object.</hi> 3. That one cannot have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<hi>Assent</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> without Infallible
Assistance to judge of the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith
themselves. 4. That there is no middle
between <hi>no particular person,</hi> and <hi>every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
person</hi> being formally Infallible;
whereas my Tenet is that some <hi>must</hi> be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62077:112"/>
so, most <hi>may</hi> be so, and all <hi>need not</hi> be
so. 5. That because all must be <hi>materially</hi>
Infallible, or in the true Faith, but know not
<hi>how</hi> they are so; therefore 'tis useless that
<hi>any</hi> should <hi>know</hi> how to make out those
Grounds, to settle, explain, and defend
Faith and it's Certainty. These with his
self-contradiction are the jarring Elements
which compound these four terrible Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
with which he hopes to undermine
and blow up the Churches <hi>Infalibility,</hi> and
the absolute <hi>Certainty</hi> of all <hi>Christian
Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>24th</hi> gives good words in common
of <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> but he means
by the former <hi>Fallible</hi> Certainty, by the
Later only some Probability or Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
so it but <hi>appears</hi> so to the <hi>Subject.</hi>
And is a total prevarication, from <hi>Settling</hi>
the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>not doubting</hi> the
Truth of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> of which there is no
question.</p>
               <p>The <hi>25th</hi> holds forth a most wicked and
gross Absurdity, destructive of <hi>all</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Evidence, Faith, Christianity, and even
Man-hood, <hi>viz. that to Assent firmly to any
thing as True,</hi> is to be <hi>Certain</hi> of it: And
intimates two others, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man who
is <hi>now</hi> Certain of a thing, may at <hi>another</hi>
time know that thing to be False, though
not at the <hi>same time;</hi> as also, that <hi>such</hi> a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62077:112"/>
is competent for <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 26. speaks Evident Truth in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of it, but is nothing available to his
cause, but rather against him. The Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
thence is False, being defectively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;
and when rectify'd, is also a clear
Truth, but highly prejudices himself.</p>
               <p>The 27. is utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of common

               <p>The 28. <hi>Principle</hi> is a weak and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
<hi>Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 29. supposes Scriptures Intelligible
<hi>enough</hi> in all Points of Faith <hi>without</hi> the
Church, and to contain expresly God's <hi>whole</hi>
will, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with such a Ground of it there as that 'tis
deducible thence by private understandings
with a Certainty competent for Faith; none
of which he has at all prov'd, nor ever
will.</p>
               <p>The <hi>30th</hi> and last confesses <hi>all men</hi> liable
to <hi>Errour in Faith,</hi> though relying on the
Means left by God to secure them from it;
which evidently makes that means to be
<hi>none:</hi> and assigns a way for their <hi>best</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
which all Erring Sects in the
world (as far as we can discern) take,
and yet still erre. And, lastly, for an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
he makes account, like a Solid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
that our Christian Life is not at all
Interiour, but only Exteriour; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62077:113"/>
that Faith is <hi>no part</hi> of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's
Life, nor the means to the <hi>other</hi> parts
of it, nor Infidelity and Heresy a Sin or
Vice; and then all's safe, and his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
stand firm: for then 'tis evident that
every private man may reject the <hi>Church</hi>
at pleasure, and be sure to understand as
much in Scripture as is <hi>necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
for, if these be <hi>no</hi> sins, and so do not
damn a man either immediatly or mediatly,
there is nothing that will. But indeed, in
Dr. <hi>St's</hi> kind of Reformation, they are rather
to be accounted Cardinal and Fundamental
Virtues. Such Sensless Principles ought to
produce no better Fruit; for this sutes their
Practice and his Principles: Rebel against
God's Church, break the most Sacred Order
of the World, and do but talk stoutly and
with a bold grace and a pretty way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Scripture and God's Word, and
then all is <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reflecting then back on the nature of
Principles, and considering that to deserve
that name they must necessarily have in them
<hi>two</hi> Qualifications, <hi>viz. Evidence</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and <hi>Influence</hi> upon some other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which are to <hi>derive</hi> their Evidence
from them; and it being manifest, both out
of this short Review, and much more out of
the full Replies to each of them, that not
one of those which D. <hi>St.</hi> here cals <hi>Principles,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:62077:113"/>
but is either <hi>Vnevident</hi> and <hi>False;</hi> or, if
True, <hi>Impertinent</hi> and void of any the least
Influence upon the Point he aym'd to prove
by them: They are clearly convinc't to have
nothing in them like Principles, or entitling
them to the honour of that name; and that
he might with far more reason have call'd
them, Conceits, Paradoxes, Quodlibets,
or Crotchets. And I know no better way

on our knowing that the Premisses (it's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
are <hi>True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Therefore, the verity of these <hi>Premisses</hi>
must be <hi>more known</hi> to him whom we intend
to convince of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Conclusion,</hi>
than is the Truth of the Conclusion it <hi>self;</hi>
otherwise 'tis in vain to endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of <hi>this</hi> by the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Consequence or <hi>Following</hi> of the
Conclusion out of the Premisses, or the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uxion</hi>
between them, must be made <hi>known;</hi>
for if by vertue of this Coherence <hi>it follow
not</hi> thence, it may be perhaps a great <hi>Truth,</hi>
but 'tis not at all a <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. To do this, 'tis requisite that each <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:62077:114"/>
Conclusion should either be put <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly</hi>
after it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>particular</hi> Premisses, or else
be <hi>related</hi> to them; otherwise, how shall any
one be able to judge whether they cohere or
no, if he know not <hi>what</hi> things <hi>are</hi> to
cohere.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Conclusion must be such as
that in the <hi>granting</hi> it the <hi>victory</hi> of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
consists; and so it must come <hi>home</hi> and
<hi>close</hi> to the very point in difference between
the two disputing parties. These short
Notes duely reflected on, we advance to a
nearer view of his pretended <hi>Conclusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are introduc't with these three dry
words [<hi>It follows that</hi>]. And here is our first
defeat: The Consequences are <hi>Six,</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<hi>Thirty;</hi> and yet no light is thought fit
to be given us, <hi>which</hi> Conclusion follows out
of <hi>which</hi> Principles; but we are left to grope
in the dark, and guess at a thing, which
(as shall be seen hereafter) no <hi>Sphynx</hi> or <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dipus</hi>
can ever make any probable nor even
possible conjecture of. I wonder to what
end he with such exact care noted all both
Principles and Consequences in due Order
with numbring Figures: was it only to give
us a sleeveless notice that there were <hi>just
Thirty</hi> Principles and <hi>just Six</hi> Conclusions?
I see no such great Mystery or Remarkable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in that observation as should deserve
such a Caution or Care. He should then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62077:115"/>
have <hi>omitted these,</hi> or else, to shew them
<hi>usefull,</hi> have afforded us a few <hi>Figures</hi> more,
relating each Conclusion to to it's respective
Premisses or Principles. But the reason of
this Carriage is manifest: For, had he done
this, we might have examin'd <hi>what</hi> cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
each Conclusion had with it's Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and whether it <hi>follow'd</hi> from them by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
consequence or <hi>no:</hi> Also, whether
the Premisses were more Evident then it self
was: and all those other Properties of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
lately noted; without which 'tis the
height of Non-sense to call any saying a
<hi>Conclusion.</hi> Had these considerations come
to the Test, his <hi>Consequences</hi> had come off as
ill or worse than his <hi>Principles.</hi> Let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
tell us whether I wrong them or no.</p>
            <p>It follows that</p>
            <p>1. There is no necessity at all or use of an
Infallible Society of men, to assure men of the
Truth of those things which they may be Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of without, and cannot have any greater as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
supposing such Infallibility to be in
them.</p>
            <p>This Proposition is so far from being a
Conclusion from any Principles, much less
from his, that 'tis <hi>self-known</hi> to all men of
common sense, and amounts indeed to a first
Principle. For, an <hi>Infallible Society of men,</hi> so
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62077:115"/>
circumstanc't as he describes, is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<hi>needless,</hi> and to no purpose; and so
this Conclusion amounts in plain Terms to
<hi>this</hi> Identical Proposition, only paraphras'd
a little, <hi>What's needless is needless,</hi> Or, <hi>'tis to
no purpose to put that which is of no purpose
when put, or of no purpose to be put:</hi> Which
are known by the Light of Nature, and so
cannot admit Proof. Is not this a rare man,
who first lays such obscure <hi>Principles</hi> as need
<hi>Proof,</hi> and so ought to be call'd <hi>Conclusions;</hi>
and then pretends to infer such Conclusions
as <hi>cannot</hi> possibly <hi>need proving,</hi> being <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident,</hi>
and so ought rather to be call'd <hi>First
Principles?</hi> What I desire at present is that
he would please to acquaint us out of <hi>which</hi>
of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Principles it follows, that <hi>what
needs not, needs not.</hi> If out of none, this is
<hi>no Conclusion,</hi> though it be a most Evident
<hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Infallibility of that Society of men
who call themselves the Catholick Church must
be examin'd by the same Faculties in man,
the same Rules of triall, the same motives,
by which the Infallibility of any divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
is.</p>
            <p>This is of the same nature with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.
For, the former part, which says
that <hi>this Infallibility must be examin'd by
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62077:116"/>
the same Faculties in man,</hi> is as plain as 'tis
that <hi>nothing can be examin'd without a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
or <hi>Power to examin;</hi> or, that <hi>nothing
can examin but what can examin,</hi> which is
Evident beyond all possibility of Proof:
Or, was ever any man in this world so silly
as to imagin that, whereas we must use our
<hi>Reasoning Faculty</hi> in judging the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of any Divine Revelation, yet perhaps
we are to make use not of the <hi>same</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
but of our <hi>Loco-motive, expulsive</hi> or
<hi>Retentive</hi> Faculty, in examining the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Church?</p>
            <p>As for the rest of it; if he means, by <hi>Rules
of Trial</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> the maxims and
Reasons we have for holding the <hi>Truth</hi> of
any thing (as he can mean no other) then
'tis manifest that, taking Divine Revelation
for a <hi>point of Faith reveal'd,</hi> 'tis Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is to be examin'd by the <hi>same</hi> means
<hi>other</hi> Points of Faith are, and so 'tis to be
concluded Infallibly True, as other points
of Faith also are, because the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is shown to be engag'd for the
Truth of it. Again, taking those words
to signify the Act or way of Revealing,
which goes <hi>before</hi> Faith, and so is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of meer natural Reason, 'tis evident its
Infallibility is to be examin'd by the <hi>same</hi>
Maxims as the Infallibility of <hi>other</hi> Human
Authorities also are, or rather, thus taken,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62077:116"/>
the Infallibility of the Church testifying
deliver'd Faith, and the Infallibility of the
Divine Revelation are one and the same
thing. So that, Distinguishing his words
to clear his sense, his Conclusion plainly
amounts to this, that [<hi>Points of Faith are
to be examin'd in the same manner as Points
of Faith are to be examin'd;</hi>] or else [That
<hi>Things of such a nature Subject to Human
Reason, are to be examin'd in the same
manner as things of that nature Subject to
Human Reason are to be examin'd.</hi>] Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which will fit both of them, that
[<hi>Things of any nature are to be examin'd
as things of that nature are to be examin'd.</hi>]
which is so evident to all men of common
sense that it cannot need Proof, and can
scarce admit any; I am sure is never prov'd
by <hi>him:</hi> That is, 'tis <hi>no Conclusion</hi> drawn
from any of his Principles, but putting in
stead of [<hi>the same Rules of tryal and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>]
these words [<hi>the same way</hi>] which
includes them both equivalently, 'tis only
a Repetition of his <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>6th</hi> Principle,
and continues the same affected ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
in the word <hi>Revelation</hi> as he us'd
formerly; nay and is the same nonsense
too, in case he takes <hi>Revelation</hi> in either
place for a <hi>point of Faith</hi> reveal'd, and the
Infallibility of the Church for that only
which is built on Natural Assistance, that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62077:117"/>
is, for it's <hi>Human Testimony:</hi> for so 'tis
most manifest the same motives neither
<hi>are</hi> nor <hi>can be</hi> common to both. For <hi>Points
of Faith</hi> are receiv'd upon <hi>Authority</hi> as
their proper Motive, and are Relative to
<hi>That;</hi> and the Human Authority of the
Church depends on Maxims of meer <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason,</hi> and <hi>not at all</hi> on Authority:
which evidence they depend upon <hi>different
motives,</hi> and so must be examin'd by <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
which are <hi>not the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This pretended Conclusion then is no
<hi>new</hi> Proposition from his Premisses, as a
Conclusion ought to be, but the <hi>self same</hi>
with them; and is either <hi>self-evident,</hi> or
else a meer peece of <hi>Folly</hi> and Nonsense,
that is (the Terms of it being clear'd)
both False and <hi>unprov'd,</hi> and so again <hi>no</hi>
Conclusion, which must be <hi>made evident or
Prov'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The less convincing the Miracles, the
more doubtfull the marks, the more obscure
the sense of either what is call'd the Catholick
Church, or declar'd by it; the less reason hath
any Christian to beleeve upon the account of
any who call themselves by the name of the
Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>No man in his wits could any more doubt
of this then of what's most Evident by the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62077:117"/>
Light of Nature; for, <hi>Convincingness of
Miracles, Evidence of the Marks,</hi> and <hi>Sense
of the Church,</hi> being evidently <hi>Means</hi> or
<hi>Reasons</hi> to believe, this Conclusion, putting
<hi>less</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> these <hi>Reasons,</hi> amounts in plain
Terms to this Indentical Proposition [<hi>Where
there is less reason to believe, there is less reason
to believe</hi>] which is Dr. <hi>St.</hi> can show possible
to <hi>follow</hi> out of any of his Principles as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
as he here pretends, he will do more
then Miracle. For he hath not there prov'd
in the least that our <hi>Miracles are less conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
our Marks doubtful, our sense obscure;</hi>
nor so much as <hi>mention'd</hi> those points, much
lesse gone about to <hi>confute</hi> our pretence of
their Convincingnesse and Evidence: and,
without doing this, to pretend this is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
and that it <hi>follows</hi> from his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
whereas it is incomparably more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
then the best of those he makes use of,
is to abuse the common regard due to his
Readers, and to declare he makes account
they never knew what belong'd to ordinary
Natural Logick, or the Common Light of
Reason.</p>
            <p>4. The more absurd any Opinions are and
repugnant to the first Principles of Sense and
Reason which any Church obtrudes upon the
Faith of men, the greater reason men shill have
to reject the pretence of Infallibility in that
Church as a grand Imposture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:62077:118"/>
This is just such another as the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For it being self-evident that Absurdities
and Contradictions are <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>held;</hi> and
self-evident likewise that that which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
such things to our belief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;</hi>
this pretended Conclusion amounts
to this plain Truth that [<hi>What has more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be rejected, has greater</hi> (or <hi>more) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be rejected:</hi>] which is an Identical
Proposition, so plain that it cannot <hi>need</hi> or
<hi>admit</hi> Proof; and, if it <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>could,</hi> there is
not the least semblance of any thing offer'd
in his Principles to prove it by, nor any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or clause in them concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which has the tenth part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that shines in this Proposition which he
pretends <hi>follows</hi> from them, as a <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. To disown what is so taught by such a
Church, is not to question the veracity of God,
but so firmly to adhere to that, in what he hath
revealed in Scriptures, that men dare not out of
love to their souls reject what is so taught.</p>
            <p>The first part of this, is of the same nature
with the former: For the words [<hi>such a
Church</hi>] and [<hi>so taught</hi>] meaning <hi>absurdly</hi>
and <hi>repugnantly to First Principles,</hi> the Truth
of it is full as self-evident to all Christians
who hold God the Authour of Truth, as 'tis
that [<hi>The Authour of Truth is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of Lies.</hi>] The rest of it, which would
seem to put the opposite to the foregoing
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62077:118"/>
part, and tels us that <hi>to disown what is so
taught by such a Church is firmly to adhere to
what's revealed in Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
False; for <hi>to disown what is so taught by
such a Church,</hi> amounts to no more but to
hold to the First Principles of Sense and
Reason in points conrrary to those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
obtruded by that Church; which a
man may do and yet be an Athiest, for any
thing Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has brought to make him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to Scripture: for I much doubt that a
profest <hi>Fallible Certainty,</hi> for such wonderful
&amp; extraordinary Points as he will be bound
to believe if he becomes a Christian, will
scarce be able to give him <hi>full</hi> satisfaction of
their <hi>Truth,</hi> if he guide himself by the First
Principles of Reason, as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> pretends
he should. Nor is it in Dr. <hi>St's love of
his Soul,</hi> as he like a Saint pretends
here, but Humour and Interest, to adhere
so firmly to his private Interpretation of
Scripture for his <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> which he
cannot but see has not in it the nature of <hi>such</hi>
a <hi>Rule,</hi> nor consequently was ever intended
by God for <hi>such</hi> an <hi>end:</hi> since, renouncing
<hi>Infallibility in men,</hi> he must confess that all
possible means being used to finde out Truth
by Interpretations of Scripture no better
grounded, it still leaves all the Reliers on
it in a possibility of being mistaken (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
also confesses Princ. 30.) that is, Inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62077:119"/>
that their Faith is True, or only Fallibly
Certain of their Faith.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to his sixth and last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
it were not amiss to examine <hi>these</hi>
according to the <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> put down <hi>formerly</hi>
containing some Qualifications necessarily
belonging to all <hi>Conclusions;</hi> and to show by
their want of <hi>all</hi> those how utterly unlike
these five last are to what they pretended
to be. And first, <hi>not one</hi> of them <hi>follows</hi> out
of his Principles as from their <hi>Premisses,</hi> as I
show'd in each of them. 2. Their Verity is
<hi>known</hi> and evident to all Mankind <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi>
on those Principles of his. 3. Their
Verity is <hi>more</hi> known than is that of those
Principles. For, speaking of the main import
and weight of them (abstracting from some
particular words and phrasing his notions)
they are all in a manner <hi>self-evident</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable;
whereas his thirty Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are liable to multitudes of exceptions,
as hath been shown in the proper Answers to
each. <hi>4ly</hi> and <hi>5ly</hi> The Consequence, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
or Following of these pretended
Conclusions out of their Premisses is not so
much as attempted to be shown, nor any <hi>one</hi>
of them <hi>related</hi> to any Principle or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
but all the <hi>Figures</hi> which distinguish
both the one and the others stand for <hi>Cypher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
and are useless. Lastly, were all these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
granted him, yet still he is never the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62077:119"/>
nearer having prov'd or compas't what he
intended. For, suppose we granted that
there can be no necessity of an Infallible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men to do that which can be done
as well without them? What if the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Infallibility of the Church must be
examin'd by the fame Faculty and the same
ways Points of Faith are, or it's Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
the same way it's Natural or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Authority is examin'd? What if we
have less Reason to believe it, if it's Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
be less convincing, it's Marks more
doubtfull, and it's sence more Obscure; and
greater reason to reject it, the more absurd
it's opinions are, and repugnant to the first
Principles of Sense and Reason? What if
to disown such Doctrines be not to question
God's Veracity? What, I say, if all these
were granted by us (as they would have
been very readily at the first, though he had
never skirmish't and flourish't and kept this
pother with laying so formally <hi>six Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
agreed on by both sides,</hi> and then thirty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his own?) yet, he is not one jot the
nearer <hi>the reducing the Faith of Protestants
to Principles</hi> which was <hi>promis't</hi> us at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and so we ought to expect the
<hi>performance</hi> of it when he had deduc't his
Conclusions, which use to infer the Intent
propos'd to himself by the disputant, and
to come home to the very point the Arguer
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62077:120"/>
would be at. Indeed, if he could show us
solidly that Infallibility in a Church were
useless; that, examin'd by such ways and
means as it <hi>ought,</hi> it would be overthrown
and could not stand the trial; that it's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were Unconvincing, it's Marks
Doubtfull, it's Sense <hi>declar'd</hi> by it Obscure,
or that it's Opinions were indeed Absurd
and Repugnant to the First Principles of
Sense and Reason: very great matters had
indeed in that case been done against our
Church and Faith, yet still nothing at all to
the establishment of his own. A Catholick
might in that case have indeed <hi>lost</hi> his <hi>own</hi>
Faith, and be to seek for <hi>another,</hi> but never
find any meerly by means of these destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Positions alone; unless Dr. <hi>St.</hi> can
settle him some <hi>other</hi> Ground built on <hi>better</hi>
Principles and such as are competent to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Faith on, which <hi>Fallible Certainty</hi> (were
it sense) will never reach. So that were all
his Conclusions hitherto freely granted, he
is still as far from having attain'd what he
propos'd to himself and promis't others, as
at the beginning, Nor can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it be imagined
why he makes us this mock-shew of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
but only, that as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
he put down most undeniable and most
sacred <hi>Principles agreed on both sides,</hi> so to
make his Readers apprehend before-hand he
must needs conquer who had such sure Cards
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62077:120"/>
to play (though by his shynesse to make use
of them and apply them home it appear'd
he had no Title to them.) so now he puts
five <hi>undeniable</hi> Propositions for Conclusions
to make weak nnattentive Readers imagine
he had actually conquer'd, for nothing
sounds a more <hi>compleat</hi> Victory, that to in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ferr
<hi>evident</hi> Conclusions; But the ill luck
is, not one of them is a Conclusion, not has
<hi>that kind</hi> of Evidence in it which is peculiar
to <hi>such</hi> Propositions, <hi>viz.</hi> Evidence-had by
means of <hi>Proof,</hi> but they are all evident of
<hi>themselves</hi> or self-evident, and so a good plot
is unluckily spoil'd,</p>
            <p>I have yet one thing more to say to them,
that they have all of them evidently the
Nature of <hi>Premisses</hi> in them, and would do
extraordinary service to his Cause taken in
<hi>that</hi> capacity (as far, I mean, as he ayms
to overthrow the Catholick Church) if
the badness of it would let him pursue
them and stand by them and apply them.
To show which I will put them down in
a clear method, that it may be seen where
the point sticks. The First Conclusion then
has in it the Nature of a Major Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and put in a Discourse, stands thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">That Infallibility without which men
may be Certain of Faith, and cannot have
greater Assurance of Faith were it put, is
not necessary to be put.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:62077:121"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">But suoh is the Infallibility of the Church
of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Therefore the Infallibility of the Church
of Rome is not to be put.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second stands thus, (if it can at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the purpose.)</p>
            <p>That Infallibility which is to be examin'd
by the same Faculties, Rules of Trial and
Motives by which the Infallibility of any
Divine Revelation is, cannot bear the test,
but must be overthrown.</p>
            <p>But the Infallibility of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church is to be thus examin'd.</p>
            <p>Therefore it cannot stand the test, but
must be overthrown.</p>
            <p>The Third stands thus.</p>
            <p>That Church whose Miracles are less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing,
marks more doubtfull, sense more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
has less reason to be beleev'd.</p>
            <p>But such is the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>Therefore she has less reason to be beleev'd.</p>
            <p>The Fourth thus.</p>
            <p>The Infallibility of that Church whose O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
are absurd and repugnant to the First
Principles of sense and reason has great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be rejected as a Grand Imposture.</p>
            <p>But the Infallibility of the Church of Rome
is the Infallibility of such a Church whose O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62077:121"/>
are absurd and repugnant to the First
Principles of Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>Therefore it's Infallibility ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
as a Grand Imposture.</p>
            <p>The Fifth thus.</p>
            <p>They who disown Doctrins thus absurd
and repugnant to the First Principles of Sense
and Reason do own and not question therein the
veracity of God.</p>
            <p>But we (<hi>in disowning the Roman Church</hi>)
disown such doctrins; Therefore, We in
so doing own, or do not question the Veracity
of God.</p>
            <p>By which discourses 'tis evidently seen
that the natural posture and place for these
five Propositions, in an attempt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Roman Churches Infallibility,
and to excuse the Protestants for not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, as is here intended, (for they are
nothing at all to the <hi>reducing the Faith of
Protestants to Principles,</hi> which they were
pretendedly brought for) is to make them
the <hi>Major</hi> Propositions, where the Chief
Principles to all Conclusions <hi>use</hi> and <hi>ought</hi>
to be placed. 'Tis evident also that <hi>these</hi>
Premisses or Principles stand firm in their
own undeniable Verity; and the <hi>only</hi> Thing
for him to do is to make good all the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
Propositions; which done, all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62077:122"/>
must necessarily follow, and so his
work is <hi>done;</hi> as indeed it always ought to
be when the <hi>Conclusion</hi> is <hi>inferr'd.</hi> Whereas,
making these Major Propositions the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his discourse. So that
'tis most palpably Evident, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> most

made those his <hi>Principles</hi> which were <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi>
and <hi>ungranted</hi> and had hundreds of

that is, made those his <hi>Principles</hi> which
ought to have been his <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lusions;</hi> and put
those for his Conclusions which were in a
manner <hi>self-evident</hi> and must be granted by
all Mankind, and which naturally ought to
be the <hi>Majors</hi> in any discourse on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
that is, he mistook <hi>Principles</hi> for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions</hi>
and <hi>Conclusions</hi> for <hi>Principles;</hi> which
perhaps was the reason he made use of
those words [<hi>reduc't to Principles</hi>] in stead
of <hi>deduc't from Principles;</hi> intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that his <hi>Conclusions</hi> were all of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Principles.</hi> Did ever Logick and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense go thus to wrack?</p>
            <p>His <hi>6th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Conclusion remains yet to be
spoke to, and 'tis this.</p>
            <p>6. Though nothing were to be believed as
the Will of God, but what is by the Catholick
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62077:122"/>
Church declareed to be so, yet this doth not at
all concern the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Catholick Church, nor any sound
part, or member of it.</p>
            <p>This is far from being <hi>self-evident</hi> as were
the <hi>former,</hi> but of it self as <hi>obscure</hi> as may
be, and in that regard is <hi>capable</hi> of being a
<hi>Conclusion,</hi> had there been any <hi>Premisses</hi> to
<hi>inferr</hi> it. It comes <hi>home</hi> also to the <hi>point</hi> as
far as his Intent was to impugn Catholicks;
for were that which it contains <hi>concluded,</hi> it
would import no less than the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the Roman Cause. But, where are
the <hi>Premisses</hi> or Principles which are to infer
it? Must every bold and unprov'd saying, and
which begs the whole Question, be cal'd a
<hi>Conclusion</hi> whether it have any <hi>Principles</hi> or
no to prove it by? If then it have none, why
does he put it for a Conclusion, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
he has concluded it? If any, why does
he not <hi>show</hi> us them, and <hi>relate</hi> to them? Is
there any thing more important then to be
acquainted with those perillous all-over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
Principles on which a Conclusion so
desperately destructive to <hi>Rome</hi> is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Or, may we not justly suspect that not
giving us notice with <hi>which</hi> of his Insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
thirty Principles this Romantical sixth
Conclusion had any Commerce, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
to himself it follow'd from <hi>none</hi> of
them; and yet notwithstanding having a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62077:123"/>
mighty mind to be thought to have <hi>concluded</hi>
it, he therefore very politickly call'd his
own saying a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> I know he has
pretended elsewhere Idolatrous worship
(forsooth) has <hi>corrupted</hi> her and made her
unsound, and twenty other Flaws he findes
in her; But then he ought to have made this
Proposition be related to those Discourses,
and not pretend they <hi>follow</hi> out of his thirty
Principles where not a word to that purpose
is found.</p>
            <p>Moreover, these Churches <hi>now</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with <hi>Rome</hi> were <hi>once true</hi> Churches;
<hi>how</hi> came they then, or <hi>when,</hi> to be <hi>now</hi> so
<hi>rotten</hi> and <hi>unsound:</hi> Let the time be assign'd
when by <hi>altering</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> they
became <hi>corrupt:</hi> Let the persons, place, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of beginning, proceeding and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
be particulariz'd, that so a matter
of Fact of this manifest and concerning na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be made credible: Above all, how
it happen'd that matters of this notorious
and important nature should remain <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,</hi>
and still believ'd that no such change
was, and this upon the score of a testifying
Authority, <hi>so great,</hi> that it must be confest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by our enemies, that it was never heard
since the Foundation of the world, that so
many vast Nations should swallow so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
an <hi>Errour</hi> so tamely in a most <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest</hi>
and most <hi>concerning</hi> matter of Fact, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62077:123"/>
which, if it be indeed an Errour, none can
be absolutely secure of the Existence of any
former Kings or Actions done before our
times, much less of the Authority or Text of
any Book in the world. But, I suppose, if
these things be prest, the best answer will
be some Text of Scripture, as that <hi>the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
sowed Tares while men slept;</hi> which, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by Dr. <hi>St's</hi> private spirit, shall san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
to us this prodigious piece of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
that the Roman-Catholick Church
alter'd her Faith and Christian practise, and
yet <hi>none observ'd</hi> it or took notice of it; that
is, that those many <hi>Millions</hi> of her Subjects
begun (as they must at one time or other if
she indeed alter'd her Faith) to believe and
practice otherwise then they did, yet <hi>none</hi> of
them knew they <hi>did so:</hi> All <hi>slept,</hi> and were
wrap't up (God wot) in the dark night of
Ignorance, till owl-ey'd <hi>Luther</hi> even at that
mid-night of Infidelity most blessedly espy'd
the Light of the Gospel dawning, and show'd
it to Dr. <hi>St's</hi> Predecessors.</p>
            <p>Now, whoever reflects how considerable
a Part of Christianity those Churches in
Communion with <hi>Rome</hi> make, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
abominable <hi>Corruptions</hi> or <hi>Sicknesses</hi>
there are in her, if those of Dr. <hi>St's</hi> Private-spirited
Church may be trusted, will with
good reason conclude that the Church has as
many diseases in her as an old horse, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:62077:124"/>
               <hi>very few</hi> limbs of her <hi>free;</hi> so that it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
she for whose <hi>sake whole</hi> nature was
made is the greatest Monster for wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that her condition is more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then any other thing in nature: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that God's Providence has a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
care of his <hi>Church</hi> then of the most <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
toy</hi> in the world; which ill sutes with
the great wonders and extraordinary things
he has done for her; as being made man, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for her, and such like.</p>
            <p>It were good too to know <hi>how long</hi> a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of the Church may remain <hi>unsound</hi> ere it
be time to <hi>cut it off;</hi> also, whether it <hi>can</hi> be cut
off, or <hi>who</hi> are likely to cut it off: without
which the Churches case must needs be most
desperate, to be almost from top to to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as
full of diseases as she can well hold, and no
means extant to give her help. But alas,
'tis so evident that there are <hi>none</hi> in the
world but <hi>her self</hi> and some <hi>few</hi> Sects that
have manifestly <hi>gone out</hi> from her, and it
sounds so unnaturally, to say the <hi>Tree</hi> can
be cut off from it's <hi>branches,</hi> that whatever
such Talkers may say in common, yet come
once to put it in execution the Absurdity of
the Practice of it bewrays the Falshood of
Tenet.</p>
            <p>But to come closer to this voluntary say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his; Either the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
for the <hi>Certainty</hi> of her Faith, on, the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62077:124"/>
               <hi>right Rule of Faith</hi> appointed by God, or she
does <hi>not:</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> she has no <hi>Faith</hi> at all, but
only <hi>Opinion</hi> (however she may hap to be
in the right in many Points she holds) for
her Assent will want the Certainty requisite
to <hi>Faith,</hi> as not being built on the stable
Grounds God had laid to give it that Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
and, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have no
<hi>Faith</hi> 'tis impossible she should be a <hi>Church,</hi>
or any <hi>part</hi> of a Church, sound or unsound,
as wanting what's most Essential, <hi>True Faith;</hi>
and so Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has provided rarely well for
the Mission of his own Church; for, if ours
were <hi>no</hi> Church, she had no Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and if she <hi>had none</hi> her self, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
she could <hi>give none:</hi> whence will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that the Reformed Churches deriv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which was Constitutive of a Church
from any foregoing one, but were wholly
erected anew; and then I would know <hi>what</hi>
Authority, under that of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> who
constituted the Church <hi>at first,</hi> had power to
constitute it <hi>anew.</hi> But if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> says, that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> rely'd on the Means left
by God to ascert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Faith, then 'tis manifest
that <hi>doing so</hi> she <hi>could not erre</hi> in Faith, and
so is as <hi>sound</hi> as may be, whatever our <hi>Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Disputant says. Since then there is no
middle between [<hi>relying on the Means left
by God to ascertain Faith</hi>] and [<hi>not relying
on it</hi>] and so that Body in Communion with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62077:125"/>
the Roman Church must necessarily do one
of them; and if she <hi>does</hi> rely on it she must
needs have <hi>all true Faith,</hi> and so be very
<hi>healthfull</hi> or <hi>sound;</hi> if she does <hi>not,</hi> she m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

needs have <hi>no</hi> True <hi>Faith</hi> at all, and so not
only lose her <hi>Health</hi> but her <hi>Essence</hi> too,
which by consequence un-churches the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
also, it were good Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would
consider the point over again, and not <hi>talk</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As for his <hi>saying</hi> (for <hi>saying</hi> things craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and prettily is his only Talent) that the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which I presume he
means, as we do, those Churches in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Roman, <hi>is not the Catholick
Church,</hi> this will be best decided by settling
the <hi>Certain</hi> Rule of Faith, and then, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of it, to consider whether <hi>any</hi> body
<hi>out of</hi> her Communion have not <hi>deserted</hi> that
Rule; which if they <hi>have,</hi> they will be prov'd
thence to have <hi>no Faith,</hi> nor consequently
to have in them the <hi>Essence</hi> of a <hi>Church;</hi> and
so if this defect appear in them <hi>all,</hi> they can
be in true speech <hi>no parts</hi> of the Church; in
which case it must necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

those in Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> are the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Church. Let us begin with <hi>Grounds</hi>

there is in reality neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

            <p>These excellent performances having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldend
this <hi>man of Confidence</hi> to conceit he
has done <hi>wonders,</hi> he sounds the Triumph of
his own Victory in these words.</p>
            <p>This may suffice to shew the validity of the
Principles on which the Faith of Protestants
stands, and the weakness of those of the Church
of Rome.</p>
            <p>These words give us occasion to reflect
back on his <hi>Promise</hi> and his <hi>Performances:</hi>
His <hi>Promise</hi> was to <hi>reduce the Faith of
Protestants to Principles;</hi> What he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
is this. He has not yet laid one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which is to him a <hi>Principle;</hi> (that
is, which he <hi>makes use of</hi> to conclude what
he designs) but what is both <hi>Obscure</hi> and
<hi>False;</hi> He has settled <hi>no Faith</hi> at all but
brought <hi>all</hi> into <hi>Opinion,</hi> by discarding <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi>
and maintaining only <hi>Fallible Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And had he indeed settled any <hi>Faith,</hi>
yet he has not produc't <hi>own word</hi> to settle
the Faith of <hi>Protestants</hi> in particular, but
all will equally fit a <hi>Socinian</hi> or a <hi>Quaker;</hi>
and his way of managing his Rule will
much better sute with a <hi>Quaker</hi> or any <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi>
than with a <hi>Protestant.</hi> Also, in stead
of <hi>reducing to Principles,</hi> he at first begins
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62077:126"/>
to <hi>deduce from Principles,</hi> and in the process
of his discourse he puts <hi>Conclusions</hi> for
<hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> for Conclusions;
and so <hi>reduces</hi> and <hi>deduces,</hi> that is draws
<hi>backwards and forwards, blows</hi> and <hi>sups</hi> both
at once.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Total sum of his Heroick
Atchievments amounts to this. He has
layd thirty <hi>Principles,</hi> which wanting either
<hi>evidence</hi> or else necessary Influence upon
what he pretends to prove, are <hi>no Principles:</hi>
He hath so <hi>reduc't</hi> to those Principles that
he makes six Conclusions <hi>follow,</hi> that is,
he <hi>deduces</hi> from them; and, so, he has so
<hi>reduc't</hi> to principles, that he has <hi>not reduc't</hi>
to them. He has put that for a <hi>Rule,</hi>
which wanting power to direct aright those
who are ro rely on it, is evidently <hi>no Rule;</hi>
He has attributed such a <hi>Certainty</hi> to his
<hi>Faith,</hi> as is a <hi>Fallible</hi> one, that is <hi>no Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
but a <hi>Chimaera:</hi> and consequently he has
so Principl'd <hi>Faith</hi> as makes it <hi>no Faith,</hi> but
<hi>Opinion</hi> only. He has made six Propositions so
<hi>follow</hi> out the thirty, which for want of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
coherence with them do <hi>not follow;</hi>
Lastly, he has made those to be <hi>Conclusions</hi>
which for want of <hi>Premisses,</hi> and by reason
of their <hi>greater Evidence</hi> than is fonnd in
his <hi>Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iples,</hi> and for many <hi>other</hi> regards,
are <hi>not Conclusions</hi> but rather <hi>Principles.</hi> All
which is shown in their proper places. So
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62077:126"/>
that, his perplexing Intricacy in contriving
and posturing his words oddly, being once
unravell'd, their affected ambiguity clear'd,
and his Insignificances and Incoherences
layd open, the Common Light of nature
will inform any Attentive and Intelligent
Reader that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has <hi>not reduc't the Faith
of Protestants to Principles,</hi> but that his
whole discourse attempting it <hi>is reduc't to
Contradictions.</hi> Yet in confidence of his vast
performances he ventures upon this grand
Conclusion that shall strike all dead.</p>
            <p>From all which it follows that it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but wilfull Ignorance, weakness of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
strength of prejudice, or some sinful passion,
which makes any one forsake the Communion
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to embrace that
of the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>But with how much greater reason may
I conclude, that (in case the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
owns <hi>his</hi> way of discoursing <hi>her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make any man remain in the Communion
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not unite
himself to the Communion of the Church of
Rome. Especially, since they all hold that
<hi>Faith cannot possibly be False,</hi> &amp; so must hold
that the <hi>means to Faith cannot possibly lead
the reliers on it into errour,</hi> and yet (if but
meanly verst in the world) they must needs
experience that those who <hi>do</hi> rely on their
<hi>own sense of Scripture</hi> differ in most Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

METHOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
To Arrive at
SATISFACTION
IN
RELIGION.</head>
            <p>1. SInce all <hi>Superstructures</hi> mn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t needs
be weak whose <hi>foundation</hi> is not
surely laid; He who desires to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
in Religion, ought to begin
with searching out, and establishing the
<hi>Ground</hi> on which Religion is <hi>built;</hi> that is,
the <hi>First Principle</hi> into which the several
Points of <hi>Faith</hi> are <hi>resolv'd,</hi> and on which
their <hi>Certainty,</hi> as to us, depends.</p>
            <p>2. To do this, 'tis to be consider'd, that <hi>a
Church</hi> is a <hi>Congregation of Faithful,</hi> and
<hi>Faithful</hi> are those who have <hi>true Faith;</hi>
Wherefore, till it be known which is the
<hi>true Faith,</hi> it cannot be known which is the
<hi>true Church.</hi> Again, <hi>A Council</hi> is a <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:62077:129"/>
A <hi>Father,</hi> an <hi>Eminent Member of
the Church, and a Witness of her Doctrin;</hi>
Wherefore, till it be known which is the
<hi>true Church,</hi> it cannot be known which is a
<hi>Council,</hi> or who a <hi>Father.</hi> Lastly, Since we
cannot know which is <hi>Scripture,</hi> but by the
Testimony of those who recommend it; And
of <hi>Hereticks</hi> we can have no security that
they have not corrupted it in favour of their
false Tenets; neither can we be secure which
is <hi>Scripture,</hi> till <hi>we</hi> be satisfy'd who are the
<hi>truly Faithful,</hi> on whose Testimony we may
safely rely in this affair.</p>
            <p>3. Wherefore, he who sincerely aims at
<hi>Satisfaction in Religion</hi> ought first of all to
find out and establish some <hi>assured Means</hi> or
<hi>Rule</hi> by which he may be secured which is
<hi>true Faith;</hi> For till this be done, He cannot
be secure either of <hi>Scripture, Church, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
or <hi>Father,</hi> but having once done this, is
in a ready way to Judge certainly of all;
Whereas if he begin with any of the other, or
indeed argue from them at all, till the <hi>Rule
of Faith</hi> be first settled, he takes a wrong
Method, and breaks the Laws of discourse, by
beginning with what is <hi>less cortain,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to him as yet <hi>uncertain;</hi> and in effect,
puts the <hi>Conclusion</hi> before the <hi>Premisses;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he argue, <hi>Ad Hominem,</hi> or against the
personal Tenets of his Adversary, which is a
good way to <hi>Confute,</hi> but not to <hi>Satisfie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:62077:129"/>
4. And, because the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> must be
known before <hi>Faith</hi> can be known, and <hi>Faith</hi>
before <hi>Scripture, Church, Councils</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
it appears, that to the finding out this
<hi>Rule</hi> no assistance of <hi>Books</hi> will be requisite,
for every one who needs <hi>Faith,</hi> is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reade and understand <hi>Books:</hi> There is
left then only <hi>Reason</hi> to use in this Inquiry;
And, since People of <hi>all Capacities</hi> are to be
saved, much <hi>sharpness</hi> and <hi>depth</hi> of <hi>wit</hi> will
not be requisite, but <hi>plain N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tural Reason</hi>
rightly directed will suffice.</p>
            <p>5. This being so, the <hi>Method</hi> of seeking
<hi>satisfaction in Religion,</hi> is become strangely
both more <hi>short</hi> and <hi>easie.</hi> For, here will need
no tedious turning over <hi>Libraries,</hi> nor learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Languages,</hi> nor endless <hi>comparing</hi> volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<hi>Quotations,</hi> nor so much as the
skill to read <hi>English,</hi> all being reduc'd to
the considering <hi>one single Point</hi> (but such
an one as bears all along with it) and
this too comprehensible, (as will appear)
to a <hi>mean</hi> understanding. Again, the large
debating <hi>particular</hi> Points in a controversiall
way is by this means avoided. For, when
the <hi>Right Rule of Faith</hi> is <hi>certainly</hi> known,
then as certainly as there is <hi>any faith</hi> in the
world, all that is received on <hi>that Rule</hi> is
<hi>certain,</hi> and of <hi>faith.</hi> Not but that 'tis of
excellent use too, to cherish and strengthen
the <hi>faith,</hi> especially of <hi>Young Believers,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:62077:130"/>
by shewing <hi>each particular Point</hi> agreeable
to <hi>right Reason</hi> and <hi>Christian Principles,</hi> and
recorded expresly in, or deduced by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from the <hi>Divinely-inspired Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Lastly, <hi>This Method</hi> is particularly
suitable to the Nature of <hi>sincere Inquirers;</hi>
who, if they want the <hi>liberty</hi> of their own
Native <hi>Indifferency,</hi> and be aw'd by any <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
whatever before that <hi>Authority</hi> be
made out, cannot but remain unsatisfy'd,
and inwardly feel they proceed not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Nature</hi> and the conduct of <hi>unbyast
Reason;</hi> Whereas, when the Authority is
once made <hi>evident,</hi> Reason will <hi>clearly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them that it becomes their Nature to
assent to it.</p>
            <p>7. But how will it appear that 'tis so <hi>easily</hi>
determinable by <hi>common Reason,</hi> which is
the <hi>right Rule of Faith?</hi> Very evidently. But
first we must observe, the Assent called <hi>Faith,</hi>
depends upon two Propositions, [<hi>What God
hath said is true</hi>] and [<hi>God hath said this</hi>]
out of which two necessarily follows the
<hi>Conclusion,</hi> that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> in particular is
true. Of these two we are concerned only
in the later: For to examin <hi>Why God is to be
believed</hi> when he has said any thing, which
they call the <hi>formal Motive of faith,</hi> is not a
Task for those who own <hi>Christianity.</hi> But
all we have to do is to finde out <hi>What God
hath said,</hi> or (which in our case is all one)
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62077:130"/>
               <hi>What Christ has taught;</hi> and that, whatever
it be which acqnaints us with this, we call
<hi>THE RVLE OF FAITH;</hi> as that, which
<hi>Regulates</hi> our belief concerning <hi>Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
or the <hi>Principles of Religion.</hi> Now I
affirm i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be <hi>obvious Reason</hi> be discover'd
which this <hi>Rule</hi> is; and that by looking into
the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, or considering <hi>what kinde</hi>
of thing it ought to be; which is no more
than attentively to reflect what is meant by
those two <hi>ordinary</hi> words, RULE &amp; FAITH.</p>
            <p>8. And both of them acquaint us that the
<hi>Rule of Faith</hi> must be the means to <hi>assure us
infallibly</hi> what Christ taught. For, in case a
<hi>Rule,</hi> though we <hi>apply</hi> it to our power, and
<hi>swerve</hi> not from it, leave us still <hi>deceivable</hi>
in those points in which it should regulate
us; we need <hi>another Rule</hi> to secure us that
we be not <hi>actually</hi> deceiv'd, and so this
<hi>other</hi> and not the <hi>former</hi> is our <hi>Rule.</hi> Next,
<hi>Faith</hi> (speaking of <hi>Christian</hi> Faith) differs
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom <hi>Opinion</hi> in this, that <hi>Opinion</hi> may be
<hi>false;</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> cannot: Wherefore <hi>the Rule
of faith,</hi> both as 'tis a <hi>Rule,</hi> and as it grounds
<hi>Faith,</hi> doubly involves <hi>Infallibility</hi> in its
Notion.</p>
            <p>9. Let us apply this to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
(for setting aside the <hi>Light of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Spirit</hi> grounding <hi>Phanaticism,</hi> there are
no more which claim to be <hi>Rules of faith</hi>)
&amp; see to <hi>which</hi> of them this Notion <hi>fits;</hi> that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62077:131"/>
is, whic hath trnly <hi>the Nature of the Rule of
faith.</hi> And this is perform'd by examining
<hi>which</hi> of them <hi>is of its own Nature, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
and held to, able to assure us infallibly,
that Christ taugbt thus and thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. And for the <hi>Letter of Scripture,</hi> not to
insist that, if it be <hi>deny'd,</hi> as <hi>many,</hi> if not all
the parts of the <hi>New Testament</hi> have been
by some or other; or mention that those
who receive the <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ks,</hi> do often and always
may doubt of almost <hi>any</hi> particular Text
alledged, whether some fault through <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Negligence,</hi> or <hi>Weakness</hi> be not crept
into it; in which Cases the <hi>Letter</hi> cannot
evidence it <hi>self,</hi> but needs <hi>another</hi> Rule to
establish it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I say, not to insist upon these
things, which yet are undeniable, We see
by experience <hi>Multitudes</hi> of Sects differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from one another, and <hi>some</hi> in <hi>most fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Points,</hi> as the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Godhead</hi>
of <hi>Christ;</hi> yet all agreeing in the <hi>outward
Letter.</hi> And it is not onely Uncharitable,
but even Impossible to imagin that <hi>none</hi>
among so <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st Multitudes</hi> do intend to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Letter to their power,</hi> while they
all pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess to <hi>reverence</hi> it as much as any,
<hi>read</hi> it frequently, <hi>study</hi> it diligently, <hi>quote</hi>
it constantly, and zealously defend the <hi>sense</hi>
which they conceive of it, fo far that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are even ready to die for it: Wherfore
it cannot be suspected but they <hi>follow it to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62077:131"/>
their power;</hi> and yet 'tis so far from <hi>infallibly</hi>
teaching them the Doctrine of Christ, that,
all this notwithstanding, they contradict one
another, and that in <hi>most fundamental points.</hi>
The bare <hi>Letter</hi> then <hi>is not the Rule of Faith,</hi>
as not being of its own Nature <hi>able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us infallibly, though we follow it to our
power, what Christ has taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I would not be
mistaken to have <hi>less</hi> Veneration than I
ought for the <hi>Divine Books,</hi> whose <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
and <hi>Vsefulness</hi> as it is beyond man to
express, so peradventure among men there
are not many who conceit this deeper than
my self; and I am sure not one amongst
those who take the confidence to charge us
with such irreverent thoughts: But we
are now about another <hi>Question.</hi> They are
the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and their <hi>true Sense</hi> is
<hi>Faith;</hi> We are enquiring out <hi>the Rule of
Faith;</hi> whose office tis not to <hi>satisfy</hi> us
that <hi>we ought to believe what God has said,</hi>
which none doubts of, but <hi>What it is
which God has said.</hi> And I affirm, <hi>That the
Letter alone is not a sufficient means to assure
us infallibly of this;</hi> and the experience of
so many erring Thousands, is a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but convincing proof of it.</p>
            <p>11. On the other side, there needs but
common sense to discern, <hi>That</hi> TRADI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
<hi>is able, if follow'd to ones power, to
bring infallibly down to after Ages, what
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:62077:132"/>
Christ and his Apostles taught at first.</hi> For;
since it means no more but delivery of
Faith by daily Teaching and Practise of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Forefathers to their respective
Children; and it is not possible that men
should be <hi>ignorant</hi> of that to which they
were <hi>educated,</hi> of that which they <hi>daily saw;</hi>
and <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>did;</hi> let this Rule be <hi>follow'd
to ones power,</hi> that is, let Children resolve
still to believe and practise themselves
what they are taught by, and practis'd
with their Fathers; and this from Age to
Age; and it is impossible but all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Children which <hi>follow</hi> this Rule, must
needs from the Apostles time to the end of
the World, be <hi>of the same Faith</hi> which was
taught at first: For, while they do thus,
there is <hi>no change;</hi> and if there be <hi>no change,</hi>
'tis <hi>the same. Tradition</hi> then, thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
has in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it the Nature of <hi>the Rule, of
Faith,</hi> as being <hi>able, if held to, to bring down
infallibly what Christ and his Apostles taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. We have found <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi>
there remains to find which body of men in
the World <hi>have ever,</hi> and <hi>still do follow this
Rule.</hi> For, <hi>those,</hi> and <hi>onely those,</hi> can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
assured of what Christ taught, that
is, can <hi>onely</hi> have <hi>true Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Whereas <hi>all
the rest,</hi> since they have but <hi>Fallible grounds,</hi>
or a Rule for their Faith which <hi>may deceive
them,</hi> cannot have <hi>right Faith,</hi> but <hi>Opinion</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:62077:132"/>
onely; which <hi>may be false,</hi> whereas Faith
<hi>cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. And first, 'tis a strong presumption
that those many particular Churches in
communion with the <hi>Roman,</hi> which for
that reason are called <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi>
do hold their Doctrine by this infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure;
since they alone own <hi>Tradition</hi> to
be an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> whereas the Desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of that Church write whole Books to
disgrace and vilify it: And, since no man
in his wits will go about to weaken a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure</hi>
by which he holds his <hi>Estate,</hi> 'tis a
manifest sign that <hi>the Deserters of that
Church</hi> hold <hi>not</hi> their Faith by the Tenure
of <hi>Tradition,</hi> but rather acknowledge by
their carriage that <hi>Tradition</hi> stands <hi>against</hi>
them; and that 'tis their <hi>Interest</hi> to renounce
it, lest it should overthrow their Cause:
Wherefore, since <hi>Tradition</hi> [§. 11.] <hi>is the
only means to derive Christs Doctrin infallibly
down to after Ages,</hi> they, by renouncing it,
renounce the only means of conveying the
Docttine of Faith certainly to us, and are
<hi>convinc'd</hi> to have <hi>no Faith,</hi> but only <hi>Opinion.</hi>
And not only so, but even to <hi>oppose</hi> and go
point-blank <hi>against</hi> it, since they oppose
the <hi>only-sure Method</hi> by which it can with
certainty come down to us.</p>
            <p>14 Besides, since <hi>Tradition</hi> (which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
understand as formerly explicated to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:62077:133"/>
be the <hi>Teaching the Faith of immediate Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
by words and practise</hi>) hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>only infallible Rule of Faith,</hi> those
who in the days of K. <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> and since
have deserted it, ought to have had <hi>infallible
certainty</hi> that <hi>we</hi> receded from it formerly:
for, if we did <hi>not,</hi> but still <hi>cleav'd</hi> to it, it
could not chuse but preserve the <hi>true Faith</hi>
to us; and if they <hi>be not sure</hi> we did <hi>not,</hi> they
know not but we have the <hi>true faith;</hi> and
manifestly condemn themselves in deserting
a <hi>Faith,</hi> which for ought they know was the
<hi>true</hi> one: But, <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> that <hi>we</hi>
had <hi>deserted</hi> this <hi>Rule,</hi> they can have none,
since they neither hold the <hi>Fathers</hi> Infallible,
nor <hi>their own Interpretation of Scripture;</hi> and
therefore unavoidably shipwaack them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon that desperat Rock. Which is
aggravated by this Consideration, that they
built not their <hi>Reformation</hi> upon a zealous
care of <hi>righting Tradition,</hi> which we had
formerly violated, nor so much as <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Evidence</hi> (as shall be shown presently)
that we had <hi>deserted It;</hi> but all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was that we had deserted <hi>Scripture:</hi>
and, because they assign no other <hi>certain
means</hi> to know the sense of the Holy Books
but the <hi>Words,</hi> and those are shown to be <hi>no
certain means</hi> [§. 10.] 'tis plain the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
regarded <hi>not</hi> at all <hi>the right Rule of
Faith,</hi> but built their <hi>Reformation</hi> upon a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62077:133"/>
               <hi>weak</hi> Foundation, and incompetent to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
<hi>such</hi> a building. Whence, neither had
the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> nor have their <hi>Followers,
Faith</hi> at all, but only <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. On the contrary, since 'tis <hi>known</hi> and
<hi>agreed to</hi> by all the World, at what time <hi>all
Deserters</hi> of our Church, of what name soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
broke from <hi>us;</hi> as also who were the
<hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Abettors,</hi> and who the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners</hi>
of such <hi>New Doctrins;</hi> besides, in
<hi>what places</hi> they first begun, and were thence
propagated to <hi>others:</hi> but <hi>no</hi> such thing is
known of <hi>us</hi> even by our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> whom
it concerns to be most diligent Searchers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it; seeing they are in a hundred mindes
about the Time <hi>when,</hi> and the Persons <hi>who</hi>
introduc'd these <hi>pretended New Doctrins</hi> of
ours, which they say vary from Scripture;
as may be seen by their own words in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Books, and amongst others, one call'd,
<hi>The Progeny of Protestants,</hi> and this for <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
point in which they pretend we have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated:</hi>
'tis plain that when <hi>we</hi> charge <hi>them</hi>
with <hi>deserttng</hi> the <hi>known Doctrin</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Church, and the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> we speak
<hi>open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>acknowledg'd evidence;</hi> when <hi>they</hi>
accuse <hi>us</hi> of the same, their charge is <hi>obscure</hi>
and <hi>unknown</hi> even to the <hi>very Accusers;</hi> nay,
plainly prov'd <hi>false</hi> by the <hi>necessity</hi> of the
things being <hi>notorious,</hi> if it happen'd, and
the <hi>constant disagreement</hi> of those who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

it, <hi>when</hi> or <hi>how</hi> it happen'd.</p>
            <p>16. I say <hi>Notorious;</hi> for, since <hi>Points of
Faith</hi> which ground all <hi>Christian practise,</hi> are
the most <hi>concerning</hi> Truths in the World, it
cannot be but the <hi>denyal</hi> of <hi>such</hi> Truths must
needs raise great commotions before the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Truths could be nniversally spread;
and the change of Christian <hi>Practise</hi> and
Manners which depend on those Truths,
must be wonderfully manifest and known to
every body; wherefore; had <hi>we</hi> been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>change,</hi> and introduc'd <hi>New</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and propagated them over the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>world</hi> as is pretended, it must needs be
manifestly and universally known that we
<hi>did so;</hi> neither is it possible the change should
be so Insensible and <hi>invisible,</hi> that our very
Adversaries cannot find it out; especially
this alone making their <hi>Victory</hi> over us so
certain and <hi>perfect.</hi> For, seeing we own
TRADITION as an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> We are
irrecoverably overthrown, if they make out
that <hi>we</hi> ever deserted It: and, surely, nothing
should be more easie than to make out That,
than which, if True, nothing can possibly be
more Notorious.</p>
            <p>17. Moreover, since it cannot be, that <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi>
of men should profess to <hi>hold</hi> points
both infinitely concerning and strangely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to believe, and yet own <hi>no ground</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they <hi>hold them:</hi> if <hi>we</hi> ever, as 'tis
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62077:134"/>
said <hi>we have,</hi> deserted Tradition, we must,
till the time we took it up again, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon some <hi>other</hi> Ground or <hi>Rule of
Faith:</hi> And, because none ever charged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>18. Besides, 'tis impossible that that Body
of Men whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h claim for their Rule of Faith,

               </gap>les
days, should not have held to that Rule of
Faith <hi>from the beginning:</hi> For, otherwise
they must have <hi>taken it up</hi> at some tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other, and by doing so, profess to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that <hi>Nothing</hi> is to be held of Faith, but what
<hi>descended</hi> by an uninterrnpted delivery from
the beginning; and yet at the same time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that <hi>all</hi> they then held was <hi>not so
descended,</hi> but received by <hi>another Rule,</hi>
this of <hi>Tradition</hi> or uninterrupted Delivery
being then <hi>newly taken up;</hi> which is so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
a Contradiction, that, as Humane
Nature could not fall into it: so, if it could,
the very pretence would have overthrown
it self, and needed no other confutation.</p>
            <p>19. Add to this, that none of tbose many
Sects who from time to time have deserted
our Church's Faith and Discipline, and so
become her Adversaries, ever yet pretended
to assign the time <hi>when</hi> we took up this Rule
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62077:135"/>
of <hi>Tradition;</hi> and yet a change in that on
which we profess to build <hi>all the rest,</hi> must
needs be of all changes the most <hi>visible,</hi> and
most apt to justifie the carriage of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters.
Wherefore, 'tis <hi>demonstrably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
on all sides, that, as this present Body
of men, call'd the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church,</hi>
does <hi>now hold</hi> to Tradition, so their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
uninterruptedly from the Apostles
days <hi>did the same;</hi> that is, did hold to it <hi>ever.</hi>
And, since 'tis shown before [§. 11.] that
this Rule, <hi>if held to,</hi> will certainly convey
down <hi>the true Faith</hi> unchang'd <hi>to all</hi> after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
'tis likewise demonstrable, that <hi>they</hi> have
<hi>the true Faith,</hi> and are <hi>the truly Faithful,</hi> or
<hi>true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. And hence by the way, is clearly seen
what is meant by <hi>VNIVERSAL TRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITION,</hi>
and where 'tis to be look'd for
and found; which puzzles many men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
very judicious and sincere; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a readiness, nay, a duty to follow <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Tradition,</hi> but they are at a loss, <hi>how</hi>
we may certainly know <hi>which</hi> is <hi>Ie.</hi> For,
since 'tis evident that to compleat the notion
of the <hi>Vniversality of Mankind,</hi> (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
it were absurd to think we must
take in <hi>brutes</hi> too, which are of an <hi>opposite</hi>
nature to Mankind, but 'tis <hi>sufficient</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>all in whom</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi>
is found; so, to make np the notion of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62077:135"/>
Tradition,</hi> it were equally absurd to
think we ought to take in those in <hi>whom</hi> the
nature of <hi>Tradition</hi> is not found, but its <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit,</hi>
that is, <hi>Deserters of Tradition</hi> or their
<hi>Followers;</hi> but 'tis <hi>sufficient</hi> to include <hi>those</hi>
in <hi>whom</hi> Tradition <hi>is found</hi> as in its Subject,
that is, <hi>Adherers to Traedition,</hi> or <hi>Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Christians.</hi> All, therefore, that have at
any time <hi>deserted</hi> the <hi>Teoching</hi> and <hi>Practise</hi>
of the <hi>immediately</hi> fore-going Church, how
numerous and of what name soever they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
no show of Title to be <hi>parts of Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Tradition,;</hi> and only they who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>do,</hi> and whose Ancestors <hi>did</hi> ever <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi>
to it, how <hi>few</hi> soever they seem, are the
<hi>only</hi> persons who can with any sense pretend
to be those, of whom, as Parts, <hi>Vniversal
Tradition</hi> consists. Whence also that Rule
of <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> directing us to hold
that which is believ'd <hi>in all places, all times,
and by all,</hi> which is so mis-apprehended by
our Modern Dissenters, is clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
<hi>viz.</hi> by taking it with Restriction to
all those who hold to Tradition. For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
should we not <hi>restrain</hi> it to those only
who have <hi>adher'd</hi> to the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but
<hi>enlarge</hi> it to the utmost extent of the words,
so as to comprehend also those who have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted</hi>
that <hi>Rule,</hi> nothing could possibly be
held <hi>of Faith</hi> whlch any <hi>Heretick</hi> had ever
<hi>deny'd:</hi> and so, in stead of being a Rule to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62077:136"/>
               <hi>dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nguish</hi> or <hi>know</hi> what we are to believe,
it would by thus <hi>confounding</hi> right Faith
with all the Heresies in the world render it
utterly Impossible ever to know what's
Faith, what not, or discern Christ's true
Doctrin from Diabolical Errours. But to
return whence we digrest.</p>
            <p>21. It follows from the former discourse,
that <hi>those</hi> men who <hi>stick</hi> to Tradition, can,
by <hi>applying</hi> that their <hi>Rule,</hi> certainly
know <hi>who</hi> have <hi>true Faith,</hi> and <hi>which</hi> body
of men is the <hi>true Church;</hi> likewise, that a
<hi>Representative</hi> of that Body is a <hi>true Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
and that an <hi>Eminent Member</hi> of it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering</hi>
down to the <hi>next</hi> Age the Doctrine
<hi>believ'd</hi> in <hi>his,</hi> whether by expresly avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it the Chnrches sense, or confuting
Hereticks, is a <hi>true Father.</hi> Lastly, they
can have <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> both of the
<hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture, as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<hi>Faith:</hi> For, if any <hi>fault</hi> which shocks
their Faith, whether of <hi>Translator</hi> or <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriber,</hi>
creep into any passage, or, if the
<hi>Text</hi> be indeed <hi>right,</hi> but yet <hi>ambiguous,</hi> they
can rectifie the <hi>Letter</hi> according to the Law
of God written in their hearts, and assign
it a <hi>sense</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Faith</hi> which they
find <hi>there;</hi> between which and that of the
Holy Writers, they are <hi>sure</hi> there can be
<hi>no disagreement,</hi> as being <hi>both</hi> inspir'd by the
<hi>same</hi> unerring Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:62077:136"/>
22. Contrariwise, those that follow <hi>not</hi>
this Rule, and so are <hi>out</hi> of this Church, of
what denomination soever, First; can have
<hi>no true Faith</hi> themselves: 'Tis possible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and usual that <hi>some,</hi> and not seldom,
<hi>many</hi> of the <hi>Points</hi> to which they assent,
are True, and the same the truly Faithful
assent to, yet <hi>their</hi> Assent to them is not
<hi>Faith;</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> (speaking of <hi>Christian
Faith</hi>) is an <hi>Assent, which cannot possibly be
false;</hi> and not only the <hi>Points</hi> assented to,
but the <hi>Assent</hi> it self must have that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from <hi>Falshood,</hi> (as is prov'd at large
in <hi>Faith vindicated</hi>) else 'tis not <hi>Faith,</hi> but
degenerates into a <hi>lower</hi> Act, and is call'd
<hi>Opinion:</hi> Now the strength of an <hi>Assent</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
made, depends upon the strength
of its Grounds; &amp; all Grounds of that Assent
call'd <hi>Faith,</hi> (I mean such Grounds as tell
us <hi>what Christ taught</hi>) besides <hi>Tradition,</hi> are
proved (§. 10.) weak and none: <hi>Without</hi>
It, therefore, there can be <hi>no true faith.</hi> Next,
for want of that only Infallble Ground
they cannot have Certainty <hi>which is true
Faith, who truly Faithful, which</hi> the true
<hi>Church, which</hi> a true <hi>Council, who</hi> a true <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
nor lastly, <hi>which</hi> is either the <hi>Letter</hi>
or <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> in Dogmatical passages
that concern Faith. And, since they have
<hi>no Certainty</hi> of these things, they have <hi>no
right,</hi> nor ought in a Discourse about <hi>Faith</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:62077:137"/>
be admitted to quote <hi>any of them;</hi> but are
Themselves, and the whole Cause conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this single Inquiry. <hi>Who have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,</hi>
that is, <hi>an impossible to be false,</hi> or
<hi>Infallible Rule to arrive at Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>23. The solid <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> therefore of
those who inquire after <hi>true Faith,</hi> is <hi>onely</hi>
to be gain'd by examining <hi>who has,</hi> or <hi>who
has not</hi> such a <hi>Rule.</hi> This <hi>METHOD</hi> is
short and easie, and yet alone goes to the
Bottom. All <hi>others,</hi> till this be had, are
<hi>superficial, tedious,</hi> and, for want of Grounds,
<hi>Insignificant.</hi>

               <head>The Former Discourse Reduc't
to Principles.</head>
               <p>TO shew the precedent Discourse built
on most Firm and most Evident Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and such as I have describ'd in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
I request the Reader to look back with
attentive Consideration upon it's several
parts, and he will discern that</p>
               <p>§. 1. The First Paragraph is only a Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
upon this Proposition [<hi>The Ground is
to be laid before the superstructures</hi>] or (which
comes to the same) that [<hi>He who builds must
build upon something;</hi>] or, to put it in more
Immediate Terms [<hi>What's First is to be begun
with</hi>] that is [<hi>What's First is to be First</hi>]
which is resolv'd finally into this Proposition
supremely Identical [<hi>A thing is to be what
it is.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§. 2. The Second relies on that famous Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im
of Logicians, that [<hi>The Definition is
more known then the Thing defin'd</hi>] which is
self-evident speculatively: For the words
once understood, it comes to this that [<hi>what
clears another thing must be clearer it self;</hi>]
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62077:138"/>
that [<hi>What explains, must explain</hi>] The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of it implies, that in plain things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on Authority [<hi>Honest men are to be
trusted before Knaves</hi>] which is self-evident
practically.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The third is but an Inference from
the two fore-going ones, and manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on the same self-evident Principles.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The Fourth is a farther Deduction;
and (since to satisfy rationally is to make
men <hi>know</hi> one way or other) plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to this [<hi>What's to be known by all must
be possible to be known by all</hi>] which is as self-evident
as 'tis that [<hi>That cannot</hi> (or is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to) <hi>be done, which is Impossible to be

               </p>
               <p>§. 5. The Fifth is only a short Descant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fore-going parts of this Discourse, and
so is reduc't into the same Grounds with
them.</p>
               <p>§. 6. <hi>The Sixth is as evident as 'tis that</hi>
[Men are not to Assent upon Authority (<hi>or
believe</hi>) if there be no Reason for it] <hi>or that</hi>
[Rational Agents are to act rationally.]</p>
               <p>§. 7. The Seventh states the Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Right <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and shows
the way to look after it by vertue of this
plain Truth, [<hi>The Meaning of the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
any natune is the nature signify'd by
that word:</hi>] or, which is the very same
[<hi>What's meant by any word is meant by that
word.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:62077:138"/>
§. 8. The former part of the <hi>8th</hi> is resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into this clearest Truth [<hi>What leaves us
in need of a Rule is not a Rule</hi>] or [<hi>A Rule
is able to regulate</hi>] which is perfectly equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to this [<hi>A Rule is a Rule.</hi>] The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part averrs, that <hi>Faith</hi> (taking it for
an Assent upon the Motives laid by God
which cannot leade into Errour) <hi>is not</hi> (it's
opposit) <hi>Opinion;</hi> which is equivalent to
this [<hi>Faith is Faith.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§. 9. The Ninth only directs our Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the two preceding Paragraphs to
the same purpose.</p>
               <p>§. 10. The former part of the Tenth is full
as Evident as 'tis that [<hi>Those who are not
Scholars</hi> (as the Generality of the Faithfull
are not) <hi>cannot be satisfy;d rationally in those
things which require Scholarship</hi>] which, since
<hi>to be satisfy'd rationally</hi> signifies <hi>to know,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
thus much that [<hi>Those who cannot
know, cannot know.</hi>] And the second part is
as clear as 'tis, that [<hi>That is not the Way
which multitudes take &amp; yet go wrong</hi>] which,
since <hi>a Way</hi> is that which is to carry one <hi>right,</hi>
is as palpably self-evident as 'tis that [<hi>A
Way is a Way.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§. 11. The Eleventh which contains the
main and in a manner the <hi>only</hi> point, has two
parts: One, that Mankind cannot be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what they <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>do.</hi> For,
since both Reason and Experience tels us,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62077:139"/>
that <hi>Senses</hi> in Men are <hi>Conveyers of Outward
Impressions to the Knowing Power,</hi> should Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
upon those parts not be <hi>conveyed</hi>
thither, they would, in that case, <hi>not</hi> be <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
or <hi>Animals,</hi> and so <hi>no Men:</hi> And, did
they not <hi>perceive</hi> when such Impressions are
convey'd as they ought, they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of a <hi>Power receiving Knowledge by
Senses,</hi> and so again, <hi>no Men.</hi> So that this
first part is as evident as 'tis that [<hi>Mankind
is Mankind.</hi>] And the <hi>Second</hi> part of this
§ directly engages this Identical Proposition
[<hi>The same is the same with it's self.</hi>] that is,
both of them are <hi>self-evident,</hi> or immediatly
implying what <hi>is so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 12. The Twelfth has nothing new but
what is built on this Manifest Truth [<hi>None
can be assur'd without Means to assure</hi>] which,
since [<hi>Means</hi>] speaks that by virtue of which
as a <hi>necessary requisit</hi> an End s to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas't,
that is, without which it <hi>cannot be</hi>
compas't, amounts to this self-evident
Truth; [<hi>That cannot be done which cannot be
done.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§. 13. The Thirteenth has for it's <hi>Basis</hi> this
undeniable Verity; 'Tis <hi>presumable</hi> that they
who <hi>constantly maintain a Tenet</hi> do <hi>hold</hi> the
same Tenet and judge it <hi>available to their
Cause,</hi> or <hi>for their purpose,</hi> and that They
who <hi>write against</hi> it and <hi>vilifie</hi> it do <hi>not hold</hi>
it in their hearts, nor judge it to be <hi>avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:62077:139"/>
to their <hi>Cause.</hi> Both which are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same with this Proposition which Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
makes self-evident. [<hi>Men not Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
or in some high Passion will not act directly
against their own Interest or to their own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;</hi>]
or to this which is self-evident spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively
[<hi>Rational Agents left to their
nature will act as they are,</hi> that is, <hi>rationally.</hi>
The rest of this § is shown to be <hi>self-evident</hi>
in our Discussion of the <hi>11th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. The Fourteenth supposing the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>11th, 13th,</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> is reduc't
to this clear Truth [<hi>They act irrationally
and unjustifiably who relinquish a Rule Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly-Certain
upon Vncertain Grounds</hi>] or
that [<hi>'Tis better to proceed upon Certainty
than Vncertainty</hi>] which Nature teaches all
Mankind.</p>
               <p>§. 15. The Fifteenth contains these two
Truths for it's supporters, both of them self-evident
practically. [<hi>That charge is Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
which is grounded on a Thing unknown to
the Accusers, and that Rational which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on matter of Fact notorious to the whole
Christian world.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§. 16. The Sixteenth subsists by vertue of
this Evident Truth [<hi>An Vniversal Change
in matters both manifest to sense and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
must needs be Notorious.</hi>] which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
that Principle [<hi>Man is Sensitive or
an Animal.</hi>] Whence, this being a direct
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62077:140"/>
part of the <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> 'tis conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

<hi>hold</hi> and <hi>own</hi> themselves and <hi>propose</hi> to <hi>others</hi>
Points most difficult to believe, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that they came from Christ, and yet

came from Christ] or thus, [<hi>Men either
have or</hi> else <hi>yeeld no Reason where there is most

Nature &amp; if it act nor, frustrates it of it's end)

               <p>§. 18. The Eighteenth is as plain as it is that
<hi>Mankind</hi> (amongst which were in all Ages
persons of great <hi>Wit</hi> &amp; <hi>Goodness</hi>) <hi>in matters of
highest moment and which require the best and

it naught and Insufficient;</hi> or upon second
Thoughts going about to settle a better, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably
and directly contradict their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
which is to say [<hi>Where there is most
need of reason men do not use it at all</hi>] And,
since Effects are not done without <hi>Causes,</hi>
(which in our case are <hi>Motives</hi>) and the

Motives or Causes, if that move them <hi>not</hi>

               <p>Having thus attempted to <hi>reduce</hi> the

the Ground of my Faith to <hi>First Principles.</hi>
it is required of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> that in maintaining
<hi>his,</hi> he would not decline the <hi>same</hi> Test:
This if he thinks it safe to undertake, it will
<hi>quickly</hi> and <hi>evidently</hi> appear on whose side
<hi>Truth</hi> stands. And this is mainfestly his
Task who pretends to <hi>Principles.</hi> For he
must either vouch those he produces to be

else he must confess them to be <hi>none at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have little hopes he will think it fit to
expose his Discourses to this Noon-day-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
nor indeed will the <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
endure such a Triall as the going about
to connect it with <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Self-evident</hi>
Truths: for what Communication can that
<hi>Darkness</hi> have with this <hi>Clearest Light?</hi> and
I conceive it was Clearness of <hi>Style,</hi> that is,
a <hi>Grammatical</hi> or <hi>Rhetorical</hi> Clearness, and
not a <hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Rational</hi> one, (which consists
in resolving his Discourse into First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,)
that Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> boastingly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him in his <hi>Sermon-Preface;</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
(as is evident by his whole way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
never dream't of any other. 'Tis
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:62077:141"/>
more to Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s purpose (which is to keep
things from being understood) to avoid by
all means this discovering Method and all
arguing from the nature of the Thing
(whence he foresees no small danger of too
great Evidence is likely to spring) and to
leade his Reader into a Wilderness of
Words (whole Libraries of Authors) where,
by his way of managing Citations, which is
by Criticising, upon ambiguous words and
phrases, they may dance in the Maze till
they be weary. I hear he is about this stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem;
and that he ayms, out of some high
Expressions of the Fathers concerning the
Excellency and Self-sufficiency of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to prove the <hi>Vselesness</hi> of the Church
to ascertain Faith. But, alas! how he will
be defeated? Not one Testimony of any
Authority will be found which comes home
to his purpose, or proves that private men
need not the Churches Interpretation ere
they can securely build their <hi>Faith</hi> on it?</p>
               <p>To save him therefore the labour of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
and Printing multitudes of these to
no purpose; and his Readers from the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
toil of troubling themselves with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences,
I produce him <hi>one</hi> out of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius
Lirinensis</hi> worth thousands; for it
speaks with as high Reverence of Scripture,
and of it's <hi>Fulness, Perfection,</hi> and <hi>Self-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi>
as <hi>any,</hi> perhaps more; and so he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62077:142"/>
not with any reason except against it; and
being intended purposely to speak to <hi>this</hi>
Point must needs be the most apposit deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Question that can be; not to add
the Acceptation and Esteem that Excellent
Treatise of his ever had from the Church,
which argues it's perfect Conformity to the
Churches Sense in setling and stating the
Right Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>I transcribe then from this Ancient and
Learned Father his whole Second Chapter
(in his Treatise Entitled <hi>Against the profane
Innovations of Heresy</hi>) which is this.</p>
               <p>Hic for sit an requirat aliquis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some may ask, since the Canon of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
is perfect, and enough nay more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
suffices to it self for all things, what need
is there that the Authority of the Churches Sense
should be joyn'd to it? Because all men do not
take the Holy Scripture, by reason of its depth,
in one and the same meaning, but divers men
interpret it's sayings diversly, so that as many
Opinions in a manner as there are men seem pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be drawn thence. For <hi>Novatian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
it one way, <hi>Photinus</hi> another, <hi>Sabelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
another, and <hi>Donatus</hi> another; <hi>Arius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomius,
Macedonius,</hi> take it in one sense; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaris,
Priscillianus</hi> in another sense: <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian,
Pelagius, Coelestius</hi> understand it thus;
and lastly, <hi>Nestorius</hi> otherwise. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very necessary by reason of so great
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:62077:142"/>
windings of so various Error that the <hi>Line</hi> of
the Prophetical and Apostolical Interpretation
may be directed according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
and Catholick Sense.</p>
               <p>From which place we may Note,</p>
               <p>1. That though he allows the Canon of
Scripture <hi>perfect and sufficient for all things,</hi>
yet by showing it Interpretable divers ways,
and this by Great and Learned men, and so
that they fall into multitudes of Errors by
those Inerpretations, and thence requiring
the Authority of the Churches Sense as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to understand it right so as to build
Faith on it, he plainly shows, that Scripture
<hi>alone</hi> is not <hi>sufficient</hi> for <hi>this</hi> End, since it
<hi>needs another</hi> to atchieve it. And hence it is
not said simply [<hi>it suffices for all things</hi>] but
[<hi>Sufficit sibi ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omnia, It is sufficient to it self
for all things</hi>] which can only mean that it has
all the Perfection due to it's own nature (as I
shew'd above, <hi>p.</hi> 87, 88, 89.) or is sufficient for
the ends God intended it for, reckon'd up
by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> amongst which no such
thing is found as, <hi>sufficiency of Clearness to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sober Enquirer, so as to build his Faith on
his private Interpretation of it, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Churches Sense;</hi> only which will
come to Dr. <hi>St's</hi> purpose. Since then I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Scripture all Sufficiency and Perfection
but this of being sufficiently clear to private
Understandings so as to build their Faith on
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62077:143"/>
their own Interpretations of it, I allow it all
this Learned Father or the Ancient Church
ever did.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis observable that he puts not the
fault in the <hi>Persons,</hi> but gives for the reason
of their misunderstanding it, <hi>the depth or deep
sense of the Scriptures:</hi> which argues that
though some few out of wickedness wilfully
mistake, yet the General reason of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
is <hi>the disproportion of the Seripture to
private Vnderstandings in Dogmatical</hi> Points
of Christianity, as I constantly maintain.</p>
               <p>3. He cals the Interpretation of it [<hi>a Line;</hi>]
which is <hi>Flexible and Dirigible;</hi> and the <hi>sense
of the Catholick Church the</hi> Rule; which lies
<hi>firm,</hi> as apt to <hi>direct another;</hi> and so with me
he makes the <hi>sense of the Catholick Church</hi>
the <hi>only Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. This Sense of: he Church is intimated
to be Antecedent to <hi>all</hi> Interpretation of
Scripture, and therefore the Church must
have had this <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Faith by
<hi>Tradition;</hi> there being no other way beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Gods Ordinary Providence but these
two.</p>
               <p>5. These things being so, 'tis most Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that when in the former Chapter he
mentions the <hi>Authority of the Divine Law</hi>
(meaning the <hi>Scripture</hi>) and the <hi>Tradition
of the Catholick Church,</hi> he meant them
<hi>jointly,</hi> as appears expresly by the very next
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:62077:143"/>
words beginning this present Chapter; nor
did he speak <hi>there</hi> of the means of <hi>bringing</hi>
men <hi>to</hi> Faith, as the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> ought to
do, but of <hi>keeping</hi> them <hi>in</hi> Faith or preserving
them from sliding into Heresie; and since he
attributes in this Chapter, <hi>Convictiveness</hi> of
what's Faith only to the <hi>Churches Sense;</hi> 'tis
manifest all that remains to be attributed to
Scripture is <hi>Agreeableness</hi> of it's Letter (if a
good Pastor expound it) to the present Faith
of the Church; to see which, exceedingly
<hi>comforts</hi> Faith in the hearts of the already-Faithful,
who must need's have a high Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for the Holy Scriptures Authority.</p>
               <p>The whole strain then of my Discourses
here against Dr. <hi>St.</hi> concerning the <hi>Rule of
Faith</hi> is perfectly consonant to this Learned
Father of the Church and to all Antiquity.
Only our frequent and close Contests with
our acute Modern Dissenters have obliged
us to a more Scholar-like way of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Notions exactly which the Ancients
did not, and (Faith being <hi>contain'd</hi> in <hi>two</hi>
things, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Breast of the
Church</hi>) of determining which of them is
the Proper <hi>Ascertainer of Faith</hi> to all the
<hi>Faithful</hi> and those which are to be <hi>converted;</hi>
and so in true and exact Speech <hi>the Rule of
Faith;</hi> and both this Father and Evident
Reason give it to be the Church.</p>
               <p>What then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is to do in this Point; if
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:62077:144"/>
he makes any such Attempt, is to alledge
Convincing Testimonies that the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
held <hi>Scripture so plain to every Sober
Enquirer as to give him such Certainty that he
may safely build his Faith on his own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
thereof, without needing the Churches;</hi>
when he produces such Testimonies as come
home to this or an Equivalent sense he will
work <hi>wonders;</hi> and, unless he does this, he
does just <hi>nothing.</hi> But I foresee two unlucky
<hi>difficulties;</hi> one, that he will not find <hi>one</hi>
Testimony of <hi>any</hi> Authority which <hi>excludes</hi>
the Church from this Office, as himself <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi>
does; next, that could he produce
thousands, he would spoil them all at the
next word, and render them Inconclusive,
that is, Insignificant, with telling us very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
they are all <hi>Fallible</hi> as to that effect; and
consequently were perhaps in an Error in
all they say.</p>
