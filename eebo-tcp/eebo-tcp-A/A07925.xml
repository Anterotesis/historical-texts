            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time that great and fatall enemy of Rome, <hi>Hannibal</hi> (after that he had wonne those memorable and famous battels of Ticenum, Trebesa, Thracimen, and Cannes) had ouer-run and subdued the most part of all Italy, putting Rome her selfe into a maruellous feare to haue beene surprised if he had then followed his fortune: Of all her great Captains and Commanders (she then had) <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> was estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the most wise and politicke, <hi>Marcellus</hi> the most valiant, because by experience in sundry conflicts, he made the Romans know, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not inuincible: yet of them all none so much repined to see the Maiesty, and greatnesse of her state limited, as it were, within her owne wals, as young <hi>Publius, Corn. Scipio,</hi> the sonne of that <hi>Publ. Scipio,</hi> who first fought with <hi>Hannibal</hi> at his coming into Italy, and afterwards kild, valiantly fighting against his enemies, in Spain, with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cne. Scipio.</hi> They both thus dead, &amp; the army there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of a Commander, the Senat long time consulted to find out some worthy Captaine to supply that roome, but could find no man that durst vndertake so dangerous a charge, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the losse of two so great and famous Captaines before. Til at length, the whole assembly beeing called, to chuse a Vice-consull, all the other Princes and Peeres of the Realme being silent at so worthy a motion, <hi>Scipio</hi> beeing but 24. yeares of age, accepted the charge, and immediatly thereupon departed for Spaine, which to his immortall glorie, he quickly subdued againe to the Romaine abedience; from whence returning to Rome, he was presently chosen Consul, with the greate ioy and applause of the people: and had Cicill assigned to him for his Prouince, with power (if he pleased) to make war in Aphrick.
<pb facs="tcp:13323:4"/>
So beeing stirred vp therto by the often intreaties, and great promises of <hi>Massinissa</hi> king of Numidia, a valorous and coragious young Prince, and a great friend of the Romanes, he leauied new forces, and hauing prepared ships and munition in Sicill fit for such a iourney, went thither: and after many famous baettels, at the last he ouercame <hi>Hasdrubal,</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax</hi> king of the Mascaecilians; who to enioy the beautie of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> the daughter of the sayd <hi>Hasdrubal,</hi> had but lately left the Romane friendship, to take part with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians; to follow whome <hi>Scipio</hi> sent <hi>Massinissa,</hi> with <hi>Caius Laelius</hi> and his light horse-men, whom they pursued to his owne country, and there in a new conflict tooke him priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thereafter <hi>Massinissa</hi> went to Cyrtha the chiefe citty of his Realme, which he took, and there at the first view became enamoured with the matchlesse and incomparable beauty of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> whom not only he promised to free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Romane bondage, but also tooke her to his wife: which <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> vnderstanding, sharply rebukes him for his fault, telling him that no Romane confederate was able to giue libertie to a prisoner taken by the Romane armes, who heauily regrating his offence, to so courteous and continent a Captaine, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, hee could not obserue his promise to <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> sends her a cup of poyson, with a letter, shewing her, hee could not else obserue his faith giuen to her but by that potion, which she immediatly drinks, to preuent all further misery, and giues me the Argument of this Poeme.</p>
