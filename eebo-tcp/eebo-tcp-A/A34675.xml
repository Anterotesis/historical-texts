                  <note>Cawdrey first attacked Cotton in 1645, in a work entitled, "Vindiciae clavium." Cotton answered in "The way of the Congregationall churches cleared," 1648.  Cawdrey then published "The inconsistencie of the independent way," 1651.  Cotton's "Defence" is a reply to the charges against him in the last named work.</note>
                  <note>The controversy between Cawdrey and Owen is as follows: Owen's work "Of schism" appeared in 1657, and was answered by Cawdrey in "Independencie, a great schism." Owen rejoined in "A review of the true nature of schism," whereupon Cawdrey published "Independency further proved to be a schism," 1658. This was the "late treatise" to which the preface "Of schisme" of the present work is a reply.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and will <hi>be so</hi> I am perswaded, whilest Christ hath a Church upon the Earth; The Treatise it selfe was written sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry yeeres agoe, immediately upon the publishing of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdryes Accusation</hi> against him; I shall not need to give an account whence it hath been, that it saw the light no sooner; it may suffice, that in mine own behalfe and of others, I doe acknowledge that in the doing of sundry things seeming of more <hi>importance,</hi> this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98349:3"/>
ought not to have been <hi>omitted;</hi> The judgment of the <hi>Authour</hi> approving of this vindication of himselfe as necessary, considering <hi>the place</hi> he held in the Church of God, should have been a rule unto us, for the performance of that duty, which is owing to his worth and piety, in doing and suffering for the Truth of God. It is now about 7 <hi>months</hi> agoe, since it came into my hands; and since I ingaged my selfe into the <hi>publication</hi> of it, my not immediate proceeding therein, being <hi>sharply</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked by a fresh charge upon my selfe from that hand, under which this <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Person</hi> so farre suffered, as to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to the ensuing defensative, I have here discharged that ingagement. The Author of the charge against him, in his Epistle <hi>to that</hi> against me, tel's his Reader, that <hi>it is thought that it was intended by another (and now promised by my selfe) to be published to cast a Slurre upon him;</hi> so are our <hi>intentions</hi> judged, so our <hi>wayes,</hi> by <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>reports;</hi> Why a <hi>Vindication</hi> of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

cast a <hi>slurre</hi> upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <hi>Cotton</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdry?</hi> but that if one be <hi>vindicated</hi> the other must be <hi>slur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</hi> He shall find now by experience, what assistance he found from him who loved him, to beare his charge, and to repell it, without any such <hi>reflection</hi> on his <hi>Accuser,</hi> as might savour of an intention to <hi>slurre</hi> him; <hi>mala mens, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus animus;</hi> the measure that men feare from others, they have commonly <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> out unto them before hand; He wishes those <hi>that intend to rake in the ashes of the dead, to consider whether they shall deserve any thankes for their labour.</hi> How the covering of <hi>the dead</hi> with their own <hi>comely garments,</hi> comes to be a <hi>raking into their ashes,</hi> I know not; His name is alive, though he be dead; It was that, not his person, that was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98349:4"/>
to be wounded, by the charge against him; to powre forth that <hi>balme</hi> for it's <hi>healing,</hi> now he is dead, which himselfe <hi>provided</hi> whilest he was alive, without adding or diminishing one syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, is no <hi>rakeing into his ashes;</hi> and I hope the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Authour, will not allow him to be offended, that this friendly office is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to a dead <hi>Brother;</hi> to publish this his defence of his own innocency, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in obedience to a prime dictate of the law of Nature, against the wrong which was not done him in secret.</p>
            <p>But the intendment of this prefatory <hi>discourse,</hi> being my own <hi>concernment,</hi> in reference to a <hi>late tract of</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries,</hi> bearing in it's Title and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, a vindication from <hi>my unjust clamours and false aspersions;</hi> I shall not detaine the Reader with any farther dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of that, which he will find fully debated in the insuing Treatise it selfe; but immediately addresse my selfe to that, which is my present peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe; By what wayes and meanes the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98349:4"/>
difference betwixt us is come to that issue wherein now it stands stated, in the expressions before mentioned, I shall not need to repeat. Who first let out <hi>those waters of strife,</hi> who hath filled their streames with <hi>bitternesse, clamour</hi> &amp; <hi>false aspersions,</hi> is left to the judgment of all, that feare the Lord, who shall have occasion at any time to reflect upon those discourses; How ever it is come to passe, I must acknowledge that the state of the Controversy betweene us is now <hi>degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> into such an uselesse strife of words, as that I dare publickly owne engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts into <hi>studies</hi> of so much more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto the interest of truth, Piety, and literature, as that I cannot with <hi>peace</hi> in my own retirements, be much farther conversant therein. Only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I am not in the least convinced, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdry</hi> hath given <hi>satisfaction</hi> to my former Expostulations, about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done me in his other Treatise, and hath evidently added to the <hi>number</hi> and weight of them in this, I could not but lay hold of this opportunity given, by my
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98349:5"/>
discharging a former promise, once more to remind him of some miscarriages, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly unbecomeing his profession and calling; which I shall doe in a briefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of his Epistle and Treatise. Upon the consideration whereof, without char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him or his way with <hi>schisme,</hi> in great letters on the <hi>Title-page</hi> of this book, I doubt not but it will appear, that the guilt of the crime he <hi>falsly, unjustly,</hi> &amp; <hi>uncharitably</hi> chargeth upon others, may be laid more equitably at his own door; and that the <hi>shortnesse</hi> of the <hi>covering</hi> to hide themselves, used by him and others from the inquisition made after them for <hi>schisme,</hi> upon their own principles, will not be supplyed by such outcryes as those he is pleased to use after them, who are least of all men concerned in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under contest, there being no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid <hi>medium,</hi> whereby they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded. And in this discourse, I shall, as I suppose, put an end to my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this <hi>controversy;</hi> I know no man whose patience will inable him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide alwayes in the consideration of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98349:5"/>
things to so little purpose; were it not that men beare themselves on high by resting on the <hi>partiall</hi> adherence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to their <hi>dictates,</hi> it were impossible they should reape any contentment in their retirements from such a manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Controversies as this; <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> is a great schisme, it hath made all the <hi>divisions</hi> amongst us, <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, Anabaptists,</hi> and all sectaries are Independents; they deny our <hi>Ministers</hi> and Churches, they <hi>seperate</hi> from us, all errors come from among them, this I have <hi>been told,</hi> and that I have heard, is the summe of this Treatise; <hi>who</hi> they are of whom he speakes, how they came into such a <hi>possession</hi> of all Church state in <hi>England,</hi> that all that are not with <hi>them</hi> are <hi>Schismatickes;</hi> how <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> they came to be so instated; what claime they can make to their present stations, without <hi>schisme,</hi> on their own principles; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granting the <hi>Church of England</hi> as constituted when they and we begun that, which we call Reformation, to

have been a True instituted Church they have any <hi>Power</hi> of rule in it, but what hath been got by <hi>violence;</hi> what, that is purely theirs, hath any pretence of establishment, from the scripture, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and the lawes of this land? I say with these and the like things, which are incumbent on him to cleare up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Charges with us will be of any value, our <hi>Authour</hi> troubleth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But to proceed to the particulars by him insisted on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He tels the <hi>Reader</hi> in his <hi>Epistle,</hi> that his unwillingnesse to this <hi>rejoinder</hi> was heightned by the Necessity he found, of <hi>discovering some personall weaknesses and forgetfulnesses in me, upon my deny all of some things which were known to be true, if he should proceed therin;</hi> for what he intimates of the <hi>unpleasantnesse</hi> that it is to him, to discover things of that <hi>importance</hi> in me, when he professeth his designe to be to <hi>impaire</hi> my <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> so far that the cause I own may receive no countenance thereby; I leave it to him, who will one day reveale <hi>the secrets</hi> of all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98349:6"/>
hearts, which at present are open and naked unto him; but how I pray are the <hi>things</hi> by me denyed <hi>known</hi> to be true? seeing it was <hi>unpleasant</hi> and <hi>distastfull</hi> to him to insist upon them, men might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that his <hi>Evidence</hi> of them, was not only <hi>open,</hi> cleare, <hi>undenyable,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest as to it's <hi>truth,</hi> but <hi>cogent</hi> as to their publication; The whole insisted on is, <hi>if there be any truth in reports; hic nigrae succus loliginis, haec est aerugo mera;</hi> Is this a <hi>bottome</hi> for a <hi>Minister</hi> of the Gospel to proceed upon, to such charges as those insinuated; is not <hi>the course of Nature</hi> set on fire at this day, <hi>by reports?</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more contrary to the <hi>royall law of charity,</hi> than to take up reports as the ground of charges and accusations?

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98349:8"/>
in confining my <hi>defensative</hi> unto this Preface to the treatise of another, I shall referre it unto certaine Heads, that will be comprehensive of the <hi>whole,</hi> and give the Reader a cleare and distinct view thereof.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with that which is least handled in the two bookes of this <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author,</hi> though the summe of what was pleaded by me in my <hi>Treatise of Schisme.</hi> For the <hi>discovery</hi> of the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Schisme, and the vindication of them who were falsly charged with the <hi>crime</hi> thereof, I layd downe two <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> as the foundation of all that I As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in the whole cause insisted on; which may briefly be reduced to these two <hi>Syllogismes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If in all and every place of the new Testament where there is mention made of <hi>Schisme,</hi> name, or thing, in an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall</hi> sence; there is nothing intended by it, but a <hi>divisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> in a particular Church; then that is the proper Scripture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Schisme in the Ecclesiasticall sence; but in all and every place &amp;c: <hi>ergo,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98349:9"/>
The <hi>Proposition</hi> being cleare and evident in it's own light, the <hi>Assumption</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in my Treatise, by an induction of the severall <hi>instances</hi> that might any way seeme to belong unto it.</p>
            <p>My second principle was raised upon a <hi>concession of the generall nature of Schisme</hi> restrained with one necessary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation and amounts unto this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Schisme in an Ecclesiasticall sense,</hi> be the breach of <hi>an Union</hi> of Christ's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, then they who are not guilty of <hi>the breach of any union</hi> of Christ's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, are not guilty of Schisme; but so is Schisme, <hi>Ergò,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> also of this <hi>Syllogisme</hi> with it's inference being <hi>unquestionable,</hi> for the confirmation of the <hi>Assumption</hi> I considered the nature of all <hi>Church U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> as instituted by Christ, and pleaded the innocency of those whose defence in several degrees I had undertaken, by their freedome from the breach of any Church Union. Not finding the Reverend <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> in his first <hi>answer</hi> to speake <hi>clearely</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98349:9"/>
and distinctly to either of those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but to proceed in a course of <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diversion,</hi> from the thing in question, with reflections, charges &amp;c: All rather I hope out of an <hi>unacquaintednesse with the true nature of argumentation,</hi> than any perversenesse of spirit, in cavilling at what he found he could not answer; I earnestly desired him in my <hi>review</hi> that we might have a faire and <hi>friendly mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> personally to debate these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he had undertaken to oppose, and so to prevent trouble to our selves and others, in writing and reading things remote from the <hi>merit</hi> of the cause un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der agitation; what returnes I have had hereto, the Reader is now acquainted withall, from his <hi>rejoinder,</hi> the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars where of shall be farther enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to afterward.</p>
            <p>The other parts of his two bookes consist in his charges upon me, about my Judgment in sundry particulars, not relating, in the least that I can as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, unto the <hi>Controversy</hi> in hand; As to his excursions, about <hi>Brownists,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:98349:10"/>
               <hi>Anabaptists Seekers;</hi> rending the peace of their Churches, seperating from them, the errours of <hi>the Seperatists,</hi> and the like, I cannot apprehend my selfe concerned to take notice of them; to the <hi>other things</hi> an Answer shall be returned, and a defence made, so farre as I can judge it necessary. It may be our Author seekes a Releife from the <hi>Charge of Schisme</hi> that lyes upon him and his party (as they are called) from others, by mannaging the same charge against them, who he thinkes will not returne it upon them: but for my part, I shall assure him that were he not in my judgment more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquitted upon my principles than upon his owne, I should be necessitated to stand upon even termes with him herein; but to have advantages from want of charity, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> had against the <hi>Catholickes,</hi> is no Argument of a Good cause.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first Chapter</hi> there occurs not any thing of <hi>reall</hi> difference as to the cause under agitation, that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>a review,</hi> being spent wholy in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98349:10"/>
things <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore I shall briefly <hi>animadvert</hi> on what seemes of most concernment therein, in the <hi>manner</hi> of his procedure. His former discourse, and this also consisting much of <hi>my words</hi> perverted by adding in the close something that might wrest them to his owne purpose, he tels me in the beginning of his third Chapter, that this is <hi>to turne my testimony against my selfe, which is,</hi> as he saith, <hi>and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way of the clearest victory,</hi> which it seemes he aimeth at; but nothing can be more remote from being defended with that pretence than this his way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. 'Tis not of <hi>urging a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> from me, against me, that I complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the perverting of my words, by either <hi>heading,</hi> or <hi>closeing</hi> of them with his owne, quite to other purposes than those of their owne intendment: a <hi>way</hi> whereby any man may make other <hi>mens words</hi> to speake what he pleaseth; as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Biddle</hi> hy his leading <hi>questions,</hi> and <hi>knitting</hi> of Scriptures to his expressions in them, makes an appearance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98349:11"/>
the <hi>word of God</hi> to speake out all his <hi>Socinian blasphemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this course he still continues; and his very entrance gives us a <hi>pledge</hi> of what we are to expect in the processe of his management of the present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; whereas I had said, that <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the various interests of parties at difference, there is no great successe to be promised by the management of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, though with never so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and conviction of truth;</hi> to the repetition of my words he subjoines the instance of <hi>Sectaries, not restrained by the clearest demonstration of truth;</hi> not weighing how facile a taske it is, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in their room; which in his account is, it seemes, to <hi>turne his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against himselfe,</hi> &amp; as he somewhere <hi>phraseth it, to turne the point of his sword into his owne bowels;</hi> but, <hi>nobis non licet esse tam disertis;</hi> neither do we here, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>learne</hi> or <hi>teach</hi> any such way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>His following leaves are spent for the most part in <hi>slighting</hi> the Notion of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98349:11"/>
               <hi>Schisme</hi> by me insisted on, and in repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my arguments for it <hi>(p.</hi> 8, 9, 12.) in such a <hi>way</hi> and manner, as argues that he either never understood them, or is willing to pervert them. The true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and importance of them I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid downe, and shall not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine repeat: Though I shall adde that his frequent repetition of his disproving <hi>that principle,</hi> which it appeares, that he never yet contended with all, in its <hi>Full strength,</hi> brings but little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his cause, with persons whose interest doth not compell them to take up things on trust. How well he cleares himselfe from the <hi>charge of reviling</hi> and useing <hi>opprobrious</hi> reproachful termes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he professe himselfe to have been <hi>astonished</hi> at the <hi>charge,</hi> may be seen in his justification of himselfe therein. <hi>pag.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. with his reinforceing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular expression instanced in; and yet he tels me, for inferring that he discovered <hi>sanguinary thoughts</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto them whose removall from their <hi>native soyle</hi> into the wildernesse, he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98349:12"/>
affirmes, England's happinesse would have consisted in, that <hi>he hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to forbeare once more to say the Lord rebuke thee:</hi> for my part, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved such a <hi>satisfactory tast</hi> of his spirit and way, that as I shall not from <hi>hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi> desire him to keep in any thing, that he can <hi>hardly forbeare</hi> to let out, but rather to use his utmost liberty; so I must assure him that I am very little <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi> or not at all, in what he shall be <hi>pleased</hi> to <hi>say,</hi> or to forbeare for the time to come; himselfe hath freed me of that concernment.</p>
            <p>The first particular of value insisted on, is his <hi>charge upon me</hi> for the deniall of all the <hi>Churches of England to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Christ, except the Churches ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, in a Congregationall way:</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving frequently and without hesitation charged this opinion upon me in his first answer, knowing it to be very false, I expostulated with him about it in my <hi>Reveiw.</hi> Insteed of accepting the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> tendered in my expresse deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of any such thought or perswasion, or tendering any satisfaction as to the wrong
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98349:12"/>
done me, he seekes to justify himselfe in his charge, and so persisteth therein. The Reasons he gives of his so doing are not unworthy a little to be <hi>remarked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is this; <hi>He supposed me to be an Independent,</hi> and therefore made that charge; the consequent of which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is much to weake, to justify this Reverend Authour in his Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; doth he suppose that he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, lay what he please to the charge of an <hi>Independent?</hi> but he saith secondly, that he tooke the word <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, generally, as comprehending Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, &amp; Anabaptists, and other Sectaries:</hi> But herein also he doth but delude his owne conscience, seeing he <hi>personally</hi> speakes to me and to my designe in that booke of Schisme, which he undertook to confute; which also removes his third intimation, that he formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>any kind of Independency,</hi> &amp;c: the rest that follow are of the same nature, and however compounded will not make a salve to heale the wound made in his reputation by his own weapon; for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98349:13"/>
learned Author, <hi>called vox populi,</hi> which he is pleased here to urge? I first que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whither he be <hi>willing</hi> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to maintaine this <hi>Charge;</hi> and if he shall appeare; I must needs tell him, (what he here questions whether it be so, or no) that he is a <hi>very lyar.</hi> For any <hi>principles</hi> in my Treatise, whence a denyall of their <hi>Ministers and Churches</hi> may be regularly deduced, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them if he can; and if not, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there had been a more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and ingenious way of coming off an ingagement into that charge, then that by him chosen to be insisted on; <hi>animos &amp; ir am ex crimine sumunt.</hi> And againe we have <hi>vox populi</hi> cited on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, <hi>pag.</hi> 34; about my refusall to answer whither I were a Minister or not; which as the thing it selfe of such a refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of mine on any occasion in the world, (because it must be spoken) is <hi>purum putum mendacium,</hi> so it is no truer, that, that was <hi>vox populi</hi> at Oxford which is pretended; that which is <hi>vox populi,</hi> must be publicke: <hi>publicum</hi> was once

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98349:14"/>
that they would not voluntarily engage themselves into an opposition against me, and waveing my judgment which I had constantly published and preached, have gathered up <hi>reports</hi> from <hi>private</hi> and <hi>table</hi> discourses, most of them false and untrue, all of them uncertaine, the occasions and coherences of those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses from whence they have been raised and taken, being utterly <hi>lost,</hi> or at present by him wholly omitted.

continuance in the family of <hi>Aaron</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the miscarriage of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall Person vested therewithall; In the close of the Chapter he reassumes his charge of my <hi>renouncing my owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> which with great confidence, and without the least <hi>scruple,</hi> he had asserted in his <hi>Answer;</hi> of that assersion he now pretends to give the Reasons, whereof the first is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The world lookes on him as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the highest note;</hi> therefore he hath renounced his ordination; and therefore <hi>I dare to say so.</hi> So much for that reason. I understand neither the <hi>Logick</hi> nor <hi>morality</hi> of this first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He knowes from good hands that some of the Brethren have renounced their Ordination;</hi> therefore he durst say posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>that I have renounced mine.</hi> Prov. 12. 18.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He hath heard that I disswaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from <hi>their ordination,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he durst say I renownced my owne; and yet I suppose he may possibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98349:16"/>
some from <hi>Episcopall Ordination:</hi> but I know it not, no more than he knowes what he affirmes of me which is false.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He concludes <hi>from the principles in my book of Schisme;</hi> because I said that to insist upon a <hi>succession of ordination from Anti-Christ and the Beast of Rome would if I mistake not keep up in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular what God would have pulled down,</hi> therefore I renounced my ordination; when he knowes that I avowed the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ordination on another account.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If all this will not doe,, he tels me of something that was said at a <hi>publique meeting (at dinner</hi> it seemes) with the <hi>Canons of</hi> Chhist-Church, <hi>viz:</hi> that <hi>I vallued not my ordination by the Bishop of Oxford any more than a crum upon my trencher;</hi> which words whether ever they were spoken or no, or to what purpose, or in reference to what Ordination, (I meane of the two orders) or in what sense, or with what limitation, or as part of what discourse, or in comparison of what else, or whither solely in reffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98349:17"/>
to the Roman succession, in which sense I will have nothing to doe with it, I know not at all; nor will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne my selfe to enquire; being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ashamed to find men professing the Religion of Jesus Christ, so farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of all common Rules of civility and principles of humane society, as to insist upon such <hi>vaine groundlesse reports</hi> as the Foundations of accusations against their Brethren! nor doe I believe that any one of the <hi>Reverend Persons</hi> quoted will owne this information; although I shall not concerne my selfe to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into their memories concerning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such passage or discourse.</p>
            <p>Much reliefe for the <hi>future</hi> against these and the like mistakes may be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from an easy observation of the different senses wherein the terme of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> is often used; it is one thing when it is taken largely for the whole appointment of a man to the ministry; in which sense I desire our Authour to consider what is written by <hi>Beza</hi> among Reformed, and <hi>Gerhard</hi> among the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98349:17"/>
               <hi>Divines;</hi> to omit innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; another thing when taken for the imposition of hand, whither by <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters;</hi> concerning which <hi>single Act,</hi> both as to its <hi>order,</hi> &amp; <hi>efficacy,</hi> I have sufficiently delivered my judgment, if he be pleased to take notice of it. I feare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that when men speak of an <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ministry;</hi> which in its true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense I shall with them contend for, they often relate only to that solemnity, restraining the authoritative making of ministers singly thereunto; contrary to the intention and meaning of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, in Scripture, antiquity, and the best reformed Divines, both <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and yet it is not imaginable how some men prevaile by the noise and sound of that <hi>Word,</hi> upon the prejudiced minds of <hi>partiall</hi> unstu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died men. A litle time may farther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, if it be not sufficiently done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; that another account is given of this matter, by <hi>Clemens, Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen, Justin Martyr,</hi> and generally all the first writers of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98349:18"/>
besides the Counsels of old &amp; late, with innumerable <hi>Protestant Authors</hi> of the best note to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>This I say is the ground of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake; whereas sundry things concurre to the <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> as it belongs to the Church of God, the <hi>ground and pillar of truth,</hi> the <hi>spouse of Christ,</hi> Psal. 45. and <hi>mother of the family, or she that tarryeth at home,</hi> Psal. 68. <hi>unto whom all ministers are stewards,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in that <hi>house</hi> of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. and sundry <hi>qualifications</hi> are indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably previously required in the persons to be called; overlooking the <hi>necessity</hi> of the qualifications required, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. 13. 2. 14. 22. the Act of them who are not the <hi>whole Church,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11, 12. but only a <hi>part</hi> of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. 1 Pet. 5. 3. as to ministry, consisting in the approbation and solemne confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of what is supposed to go before, hath in some mens language, gotten the name of <hi>ordination,</hi> and an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98349:18"/>
of that name to such an extent, as to <hi>enwrap</hi> in it, all that is <hi>indispensably</hi> necessary to the constitution or making of <hi>ministers;</hi> so that where that is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> in what order soever, or by whom soever administred, who have first obtained it themselves, there is a lawfull and sufficient calling to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. Indeed, I know no errour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the institutions of Christ, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with more pernitious consequences to the Church of God, then this; should it be practised, according to the force of the <hi>principle</hi> its selfe. Suppose six, eight, or ten men, who have themselves been formerly ordained; but now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, not by any <hi>ecclesiasticall censure,</hi> but by an act of the civill <hi>magistrate,</hi> are put out of their places, for <hi>notorious ignorance</hi> and <hi>scandall;</hi> should concurre and ordaine an hundred ignorant and wicked persons like themselves, to be ministers: must they not on this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be all accounted <hi>ministers</hi> of Christ, and to be invested with all <hi>ministeriall power;</hi> and so be enabled to propagate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98349:19"/>
their kind to the end of the world; and indeed why should not this be granted, seeing the whole bulke of the <hi>papall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> is contended for as valid; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is notoriously knowne, that sundry <hi>Bishops</hi> among them (who perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their own ordination as the <hi>reward of a whore)</hi> being persons of <hi>vitious lives,</hi> and utterly ignorant of the Gospell, did sustaine their pompe and sloth, by sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>holy orders</hi> as they called them, to the <hi>scum</hi> and refuse of men; but of these things, more in their proper place.</p>
            <p>Take then Reader, the substance of this chapter; in this briefe recapitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He denies our Churches to be true Churches, and our Ministers true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath renounced his owne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When some young men came to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise about their ordination he diswaded them from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He saith he would maintaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98349:19"/>
               <hi>all the Ministers of England, there was in Scripture no such thing as Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That when he was chosen a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament man he would not answer whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was a Minister or not;</hi> all which are <hi>notoriously</hi> untrue, and some of them, <hi>namely</hi> the <hi>two last,</hi> so remote from any thing to give a pretence or colour unto them, that I question whether <hi>Satan</hi> have impudence enough to owne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe their Author; and yet from <hi>heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes, reports, rumours, from table talk, Vox populi,</hi> and such other grounds of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning this Reverend Author hath made them his <hi>owne,</hi> and by such a <hi>charge,</hi> hath I presume, in the judgment of all unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced men, <hi>discharged</hi> me from further attending to what he shall be prompted from the like principles to divulge, for the same end and purposes, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto he hath managed, for the future. For my judgment about their ministry, and Ordination, about the nature and efficacy of Ordination, the state and power of particular Churches, my owne
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98349:20"/>
station in the ministry, which I shall at all times through the grace and assistance of our Lord Jesus Christ, freely justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy against men and <hi>devills,</hi> it is so well knowne, that I shall not need here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to declare it: for the true nature and notion of <hi>Schisme,</hi> alone by me enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after, in this chapter, as I said, I find nothing offerd thereunto: only whereas I restrained the Ecclesiasticall use of the word <hi>Schisme</hi> to the sense wherein it is used, in the <hi>places</hi> of Scripture, that mention it with relation to Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, which that it ought not to be so, nothing but <hi>asseverations</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are produced to evince; this is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, to extend to all that I would allow as to the nature of Schisme it selfe, which is most false; though I said if I would <hi>proceed</hi> no farther, I might not be compelled so to do, seeing in things of this nature we may crave allowance to <hi>think</hi> and speak with the Holy Ghost: However, I expressely comprised in my proposition all the places wherein the <hi>nature</hi> of Schisme is delivered under
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98349:20"/>
what termes or words soever. When then I shall be convinced, that such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses as those of this Treatise, made up of diversions into things wholy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne to the inquiry by me insisted on, in the investigation of the true notion and nature of Schisme, with long <hi>talkes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Anabaptists, Brownists, Sectaries, Independents, Presbyterians, Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> with charges and reflections ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this presumption, that this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> and his party, (for we will no more contend about that expression) are <hi>in solidum</hi> possessed of all true and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Church state</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> so that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever are not of them, are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and I know not what besides, he being <q>—Gallinae filius albae</q> 
               <hi>nos viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis;</hi> I shall farther attend unto them. I must far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde that I was not so happy as to foresee that because I granted the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Party before the Reformation to have made outwardly a profession of the Religion of Christ, although I expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to be <hi>really a party combined</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:98349:21"/>
               <hi>together,</hi> for all ends of <hi>wickednesse,</hi> and in particular for the <hi>extirpation</hi> of the true Church of Christ in the world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no state of <hi>union</hi> but what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost calls <hi>Babilon</hi> in opposition to <hi>Syon,</hi> our Reverend Author would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 34. that I allowed them to be a true Church of Christ; but it is impossible for wiser men then I, to see farre into the issue of such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; and therefore we must take in good part what doth fall out; and if the <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> insteed of having his <hi>zeale warmed</hi> against me, would a little bestirre his abilities, to make out to the understandings and consciences of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested men,</hi> that <hi>All ecclesiasticall power</hi> being vested in the Pope and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills,</hi> by the consent of that whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of men called the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and flowing from the <hi>Pope</hi> in its execution to all others; who in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of it from him, owned him as the immediate <hi>fountaine</hi> of it, which they sware to maintaine in <hi>him,</hi> and this in <hi>opposition</hi> to all Church power in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98349:21"/>
other persons whatsoever; it was possible that any power should be derived from that combination, but what came expressely from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mentioned. I desire our Author would consider the frame of spirit that was in this matter, in them, who first laboured in the <hi>worke of Reformation,</hi> and to that end peruse the stories of <hi>Lasitius,</hi> and <hi>Regenuolscius</hi> about the Churches of <hi>Bohemia, Poland,</hi> and those parts of the world, especially the latter from <hi>pag.</hi> 29. 30. and forward. And as to the distinction used by some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> makes use of to another purpose, then those did, who first invented it, (extending it only to the consideration of the possibility of salvation for individuall persons living in that communion before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) I hope he will not be angry if I professe my <hi>disability</hi> to understand it. All men cannot be wise alike; if the <hi>Papacy</hi> comprise the Pope, and all Papall Jurisdiction and power, with the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98349:22"/>
subjection of men thereunto, if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note all the <hi>Idolatries, false worship,</hi> and heresies of that <hi>society</hi> of men; I do know that all those are confirmed by <hi>Church Acts</hi> of that <hi>Church:</hi> and that in the <hi>Church Publick sense</hi> of that Church, no man was a member of it but by virtue of the union that consisted in that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> it being placed alwaies by them in all their definitions of their Church; as also hat there was neither Church <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> nor Church <hi>Power,</hi> nor Church <hi>Act,</hi> nor Church <hi>confession,</hi> nor Church <hi>Worship</hi> amongst them, but what consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in that <hi>Papacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because nothing doth more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, occurre then the objection of the difficulty in placing the dispensation of <hi>baptisme</hi> on a sure foot <hi>account,</hi> in case of the rejection of all <hi>authoritative</hi> influence from <hi>Rome</hi> into the ministry of the Reformed Churches, with the insinuation of a supposition of the <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization</hi> of all sutch, as derive not a title unto it, by that meanes, they who do so being supposed to stand upon an
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98349:22"/>
unquestionable foundation, I shall a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle examine the grounds of their <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and then compare them with what they have to plead, who refuse to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg</hi> the deriving any sap or <hi>noushri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from that rotten corrupt stock.</p>
            <p>It is I suppose, taken for granted, that an <hi>unbaptized person</hi> can never effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>baptize,</hi> let him receive what other qualifications soever that are to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded, or necessary thereunto. If this be not <hi>supposed</hi> the whole weight of the <hi>objection</hi> improved by the worst supposition that can be made, falls to the ground. I shall also desire in the next place, that as we cannot make the <hi>Popish baptisme,</hi> better then it is, so that we would not plead it to be <hi>better,</hi> or any other, then <hi>they</hi> professe it to be; nor pretend, that though it be <hi>rotten</hi> or <hi>null</hi> in the foundation, yet by <hi>continuance</hi> and time it might obtaine validity and strength. When the claime is by <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> from such a <hi>stock</hi> or root, if you suppose once a <hi>totall intercision</hi> in the succession from that stock or root, there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98349:23"/>
is an utter end put to that claime; let us now consider how the case is with them from whom this claime is derived.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is notoriously knowne, that amongst them the <hi>validity</hi> of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depends upon the intention of the <hi>Administrator:</hi> It is so with them, as to every thing they call a sacrament: now to take one step backwards: that <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> will by some of ours, be scarce accounted <hi>valid,</hi> which is not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by a <hi>lawfull minister;</hi> suppose now that some <hi>Pope</hi> ordaining a <hi>Bishop</hi> in his <hi>stable</hi> to satisfy a <hi>Whore,</hi> had not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to make him a <hi>Bishop,</hi> which is no remote surmise; he being no <hi>Bishop</hi> rightly ordained, all the <hi>Priests</hi> by him afterwards consecrated, were indeed no <hi>priests,</hi> and so indeed had no power to <hi>administer</hi> any <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the baptisme that may lye, for ought we know, at the root of that which some of us pretend unto, was originally absolutely <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void,</hi> and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by tract of time, be made <hi>valid,</hi> or effectuall, for like a muddy fountaine,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98349:23"/>
the farther it goes, the more <hi>filthy</hi> it is: or suppose that any <hi>Priest,</hi> baptizing one who afterwards came to be <hi>Pope</hi> from whom all <hi>Authority</hi> in that Church doth flow and is <hi>derived,</hi> had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>baptize</hi> him? what will become of all that ensues thereon.</p>
            <p>It is endlesse to <hi>pursue</hi> the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and intanglements, that insue on this head of account; and sufficiently easy it is to manifest, that whosoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves his <hi>interest</hi> in Gospell priviledges, into this foundation, can have no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith nay nor tolerably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjecture that he is <hi>baptized,</hi> or was ever made <hi>partaker</hi> of any ordinance of the Gospell. Let them that delight in such <hi>troubled waters,</hi> sport themselves in them: for my owne part, considering the state of that <hi>Church</hi> for some yeares if not Ages, wherein the fountaines of all Authority amongst them, were full of filth and blood, there Popes upon their owne confession being <hi>made, set up</hi> and pulled downe at the <hi>pleasure</hi> of vile, impudent domineering <hi>strumpets,</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98349:24"/>
supplying themselves with officers all the world over of the same spirit, and stamp with themselves, and that for the most part for hire, being in the meane time all <hi>Idolaters to a man;</hi> I am not willing to grant, that their <hi>Good and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> intention is necessary to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a thing requisite unto my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in any priviledge of the Gospell of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an ecclesiasticall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of irrefragable Authority amongst them, that whosoever he be that <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters baptisme,</hi> so he use the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme,</hi> that baptisme is <hi>Good</hi> and valid and not to be reiterated: yea <hi>Pope Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> in his Resolutions and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations upon the enquiry of the <hi>Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> (whose decrees are authentick and recorded in their <hi>Counsells,</hi> Tom: 2. Crabb: p. 144.) declares the judgment of that <hi>Church</hi> to the full: They tell him, that many <hi>in their Nation</hi> were <hi>baptized</hi> by an <hi>unknowne person, a Jew or a Pagan they knew not whether;</hi> and enquire of him, whether they were to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98349:24"/>
be rebaptized or no; whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; <hi>si in nomine S. S. Trinitatis, vel tantum in Christi nomine, sicut in Act is Apostolorum legimus, baptizati sunt, unum quippe idemque est, ut</hi> S. Ambrosius <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressit, constat eos denuo non esse baptizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos:</hi> if they were <hi>baptized</hi> in the name of <hi>the Trinity</hi> or of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are not to be baptized againe. Let a blasphemous <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> do it, so it be done the work is <hi>wrought,</hi> grace conveyed, and baptisme valid. The constant practise of <hi>women</hi> baptizing amongst them, is of the same import: and what doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdry</hi> think of this <hi>kind of Baptisme?</hi> Is it not worth the contending about, to place it in the derived succession of ours? who knowes but that some of <hi>these persons,</hi> baptized by a counterfeit impostor, on purpose to abuse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the institutions of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, might come to be baptizers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yea Bishops, or Popes; from whom all ecclesiasticall Authority was to be derived; and what evidence or certainty can any man have, that his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98349:25"/>
               <hi>baptisme</hi> doth not flow from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

I blesse my God I have good security through Grace, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or others like minded with himselfe, intend any such thing or no, in those proceedings of his and theirs, which seemed to have in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a tendency thereunto, my <hi>repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> shall yet be <hi>preserved</hi> in that state and Condition, as is necessary to <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> me in the duties and workes of my Generation, that I shall through the hand of God be called out unto; And therefore being prepared in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to go through <hi>good report</hi> and <hi>bad report,</hi> I shall give him assurance, that I am very litle concerned in such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, from what ever intention they do proceed; Only I must needs tell him, that he consulted not his <hi>owne reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with peaceable godly men, what ever else he omitted, in the ensuing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring

And for my Concernment in this charge I shall subjoyne the words from whence it must be taken; <hi>Pag.</hi> 133. of my book of Perseverance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The first signall Issue and effect which is ascribed to this Indwelling of the Spirit, is Union; not a Personall Union with himselfe, which is impossible: He doth not assume our natures, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our Personality, which would make us one person with him, but dwells in our persons, keeping his owne, and leaving us our Personality infinitely distinct; But it is a spirituall Union; the great union</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:98349:29"/>
               <hi>mentioned so often in the Gospell, that is the sole Fountaine of our Blessednesse; our Union with the Lord Christ, which we have thereby. Many thoughts of heart there have been about this Union; what it is, wherein it doth consist, the causes, manner, and Effects of it; The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expresses it to be very Eminent, necre, durable, setting it out, for the most part, by similitudes, and Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall Illustrations, to lead poore weak Creatures into some usefull needfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with that Mystery, whose depths in this life, they shall never fathome. That many in the daies wherein we live, have miscarried in their conceptions of it, is evident; some to make out their Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Union have destroyed the person of Christ, and fancying a way of uniting man to God by him, have left him to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God nor Man. Others have destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Person of Believers, affirming that in their Union with Christ, they loose their owne personality, that is, cease to be Men: or at least, those, are these Individuall men.</hi>

now only <hi>enquire</hi> after that which is set up in opposition to any of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of my <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Schisme</hi> before mentioned, or any of the <hi>propositions</hi> of the <hi>syllogismes</hi> wherein they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, at the beginning of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; remarking in our way some such particular passages, as it will not be to the <hi>disadvantage</hi> of our Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to be reminded of. Of the nature of the thing enquired after, in the third Chapter I find no mention at all; only he tels me by the way, that the <hi>Doctor's</hi> assertion that my Booke about <hi>Schisme,</hi> was <hi>one great schisme,</hi> was not <hi>non sense;</hi> but <hi>usuall Rhetoricke,</hi> wherein <hi>profligate sinners</hi> may be called by the <hi>name of sin;</hi> and therefore a Booke about <hi>Schisme,</hi> may be called a <hi>schisme;</hi> I wish our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour had found some other way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing his <hi>Doctor,</hi> then by making it worse himselfe.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth Chapter</hi> he comes to the businesse it selfe; and if in passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>that,</hi> with the rest that follow, I can fix on any thing rising up with

any pretence of opposition to what I have <hi>laid down,</hi> it shall not be omitted; for things by my selfe asserted, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on all hands, or formerly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated to the utmost, I shall not againe trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> with them: such are the positions about the <hi>generall</hi> nature of <hi>Schisme,</hi> in things <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> antecedently considered to the limitation and restriction of it to it's <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> use; the departure from Churches <hi>voluntary</hi> or <hi>compelled</hi> &amp;c: all which were <hi>stated</hi> in my first Treatise, and are not directly opposed by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; such also is that doughty <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie</hi> he is pleased to raise, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue about the <hi>seat</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> of Schisme with it's restriction to the <hi>instituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God,</hi> pag. 18. 19: so placed by me, to distinguish <hi>the Schisme</hi> whereof we speake, from that which is <hi>naturall,</hi> as also from such <hi>differences</hi> and breaches as may fall out amongst <hi>men,</hi> few or more, upon <hi>civill</hi> and rationall accounts; all which I exclude from the enjoyment

of any <hi>roome</hi> or place in our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true nature of <hi>schisme</hi> in it's limited <hi>Ecclesiasticall sense.</hi> The like also may be affirmed concerning the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing strife of words about <hi>separation</hi> and <hi>schisme;</hi> as though they were in my apprehension of them, inconsistent; which is a <hi>fancy</hi> no better <hi>grounded</hi> than sundry other, which our <hi>Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi> is pleased to make use of. His whole passage also receives no other <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,</hi> than what is afforded to it by turning my <hi>universall proposition</hi> into a <hi>particular:</hi> what I say of <hi>all places</hi> in the Scripture where the <hi>name or thing</hi> of <hi>schisme</hi> is used in an <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> sense, as relating to a <hi>Gospell Church,</hi> he would restraint to that one place of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths</hi> where <hi>alone</hi> the word is used, in that sense: However if that one place be all; my proposition is <hi>universall:</hi> take then my proposition in it's extent and latitude, and let him try <hi>once more</hi> if he please, what he hath to object to it, for as yet I find no instance produced to alleviate it's truth. He much also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98349:36"/>
that there may be a <hi>separation in a Church</hi> where there is no <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a Church,</hi> and saith this was at <hi>first by me denyed:</hi> that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by me he cannot prove; but that the contrary was <hi>proved</hi> by me is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all impartiall men, that have Considered my Treatise; although I cannot allow that the <hi>separation</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was carried to that height as is by him pretended; namely as to <hi>seperate from the ordinances of the Lord's supper;</hi> their disorder and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>about</hi> and in it's <hi>Administration</hi> are reproved, not their separation from it: only on that supposition made, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse I was somewhat surprised with the delivery of his judgment in reference to many of his <hi>owne party,</hi> whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes of <hi>schisme</hi> for not administring the <hi>Lord's supper</hi> to all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with whom they pray and preach. I suppose the greatest part of the most godly and able ministers of the <hi>Persby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> way in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> are here cast into the same condition of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98349:37"/>
               <hi>Schismaticks</hi> with the Independents. And the truth is, I am not yet without hopes of seeing a faire coalescency in love, and Church Communion, between the reforming <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents; though for it they shall with some, suffer under the unjust imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of schisme.</p>

               </gap>; Hence have we the strange notions of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour about Schisme; decaies in Grace are Schisme, and <hi>errours in the Faith</hi> are <hi>Schisme;</hi> and Schisme and <hi>Apostacy</hi> are things of the same kind, differing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in degree; because the one leades to the other; as one sinne of one kind doth often to another; drunkennesse to whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and envy and malice to lying; that <hi>differences</hi> about civile matters, like that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are schisme; and this by one blaming me for a departure from the sense of <hi>antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> unto which these <hi>insinuations</hi> are so many monsters. Let us then proceed.</p>
            <p>

That <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9, 18: are pertinently used to discover &amp; prove the nature of Schisme in an <hi>evangelically ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall sense</hi> or were ever cited by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Antients</hi> to that purpose, I suppose our Authour on second consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will not affirme, I understand not the sense of this Argument, <hi>the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the city was divided, and part held with the Jewes, and part with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> therefore Schisme in a Gospell Church state, is not only a division in a Church; or that it is a separation into new Churches, or that it is something more than the breach of the Union ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Christ in an instituted Church; much lesse doth any thing of this nature appeare from <hi>Paul's seperating the Disciples</hi> whom he had converted to the Faith from the unbelieving harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jewes,</hi> an account whereof is given us, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 9. So then that in this Chapter there is any thing produced <hi>de novo</hi> to prove that the precise Scripture notion of Schisme in it's ecclesiasticall sense, extends it selfe any further than dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98349:38"/>
divisions, separations in a Church and that a particular Church I find not; and doe once more desire our Authour that if he be otherwise minded, to spare such another trouble to our selves, and others, as that wherein we are now engaged, he would assigne me some <hi>time and place</hi> to attend him for the clearing of the truth between us.</p>
            <p>Of Schisme <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28. <hi>Jud.</hi> 19. there is no mention; nor are those places interpreted of any such thing by any Expositors <hi>new</hi> or <hi>old,</hi> that ever I yet saw; nor can any sense be imposed on them enwrapping the nature of <hi>Schisme</hi> with the least colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reason.</p>
            <p>But now by our Authour, Schisme and Apostacy, are made things of on kind, differing only in degrees, <hi>pag.</hi> 107. so confounding <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>heresy,</hi> contrary to the Constant sense of all antiquity. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 30. The Apostle speakes, of men speaking <hi>perverse things, to draw away Disciples;</hi> that is teaching them false doctrines, contrary to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98349:38"/>
               <hi>truths</hi> wherein they had been by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed; in his <hi>Revealing unto them the whole counsell of God:</hi> vers. 27. This by the <hi>Antients</hi> is called <hi>heresie,</hi> and is contradistinguished unto <hi>Schisme</hi> by them constantly: So <hi>Austin</hi> an 100 times. To draw men from the Church, by drawing them into <hi>pernitious errours, false doctrine,</hi> being the cause of their <hi>falling off,</hi> is not <hi>schisme,</hi> nor so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture, nor by any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, that ever yet I observed. That the designe of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> is to preserve and keep them from <hi>Apostasie</hi> unto <hi>Judais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> besides that it is attested by a cloud of witnesses, is to evident from the thing it selfe to be denyed. <hi>chapt.</hi> 10. 25: he warnes them of a common en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that fearfull condition, which he describes, <hi>vers.</hi> 26: their neglect of the <hi>Christian Assemblies,</hi> was the doore of their Apostacy to <hi>Judaisme.</hi> what is this to <hi>schisme?</hi> would we charge a man with that crime whom we saw neglecting our assemblies, and likely to fall into <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daisme;</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98349:39"/>
are there not more forceable considerations to deale with him upon; and doth not the Apostle make use of them? <hi>Jude.</hi> 19: hath been so farre spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto already, that it may not faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be insisted on againe. <hi>Parvas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet spes Troja, sitables habet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the entrance of the <hi>fifth</hi> Chapter he takes advantage from my question, <hi>p.</hi> 147. <hi>who told him that raising cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse differences in a Church, and then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from it, is not in my judgment schisme;</hi> when the first part of the <hi>asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> included in that interrogation, expresseth the <hi>formal</hi> nature of Schisme, which is not destroyed, nor can any man be exonerated of it's guilt, by the subsequent crime of separation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is aggravated. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19: is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine mentioned to this <hi>purpose</hi> of <hi>schism,</hi> to as little purpose, so also is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25: both places treat of Apostates, who are charged and blamed under other termes than that of <hi>Schisme.</hi> There is in such departures, as in every divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatever, of that which was in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98349:39"/>
somewhat of the generall nature of <hi>schisme:</hi> but that particular crime and guilt of schisme in it's restrained Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall sense, is not included in them.</p>
            <p>In his following discourse he renewes his former Charges of denying their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and <hi>ministry,</hi> of <hi>separating</hi> from them and the like; as to the former part of this Charge I have spoken in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of this <hi>discourse;</hi> for the <hi>latter,</hi> of <hi>separating from them,</hi> I say we have no more separated from them, then they have from us; our <hi>right</hi> to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ordinances of God's worship, according to the light we have received from him, is in this nation as good as theirs; and our plea from the Gospell we are ready to maintaine against them, according as we shall at any time be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto. If any of our judgment deny them to be <hi>Churches,</hi> I doubt not but he knowes who comes not behind in returnall of Charges on our Churches. Doth the Reverend Authour thinke or imagine, that we have not in our owne judgment more reason to deny
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98349:40"/>
their <hi>Churches</hi> and to charge them <hi>with Schisme</hi> though we doe neither, then they have to charge us therewith, and to deny our Churches? can any thing be more fondly Pretended than that he hath proved that we have separated from them; upon which, <hi>pag.</hi> 105, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the performance of my promise to retreat from the state wherein I stand, upon the establishment of such proofe. Hath he proved the due administration of Ordinances amongst them whom he pleads for? Hath he proved any Church Union betweene them <hi>as such,</hi> and us? hath hath he proved as to have broken that <hi>Union?</hi> what will not selfe-fulnesse and prejudice put men upon?</p>
            <p>How came they into the sole <hi>possession</hi> of all Church state in <hi>England;</hi> so that who ever is not of them, and with them must be charged to have separated from them; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdrey</hi> sayes indeed, that <hi>the Episcopall</hi> men and they agree in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialls,</hi> and differ only in <hi>circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials;</hi> but that they and we differ in <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials;</hi> but let him know they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98349:40"/>
not of his <hi>compliances;</hi> they say he is a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> and that all his party are so also; let him answer their Charge <hi>solidly</hi> upon his owne principles; and not thinke to owne that which he hath the weakest <hi>claime</hi> imaginable unto, and was never yet in possession of. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that since the Gospell came into <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> as by them stated, was ever set up in <hi>England,</hi> but in the <hi>wils</hi> of a party of men; so that here as yet, unlesse as it lyes in <hi>particular Congregations,</hi> where our right is as good as theirs, none have <hi>separated</hi> from it, that I know of; though many cannot <hi>consent</hi> unto it.

            <p>In the beginning of Chapter the 6: he attempts to disprove my assertion that the <hi>Union of the Church Catholick visible</hi> which consists in the professing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving doctrine of the Gospell, &amp;c: is broken only by Apostacy. to this end he confounds Apostacy and Schisme, affirming them only to differ in degrees;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98349:41"/>
which is a <hi>new</hi> notion unknowen to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and contrary to all sound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; by the instances he produceth to this purpose he endeavours to <hi>prove</hi> that there are things which break this union, whereby this union is not broken; whilst a man continues a member of that church which he is by virtue of the union there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and his interest therein, by no act doth he, or can he break that union.</p>
            <p>The partiall breach of that union which consists in the <hi>profession</hi> of the truth, is <hi>error</hi> and heresy and not <hi>Schisme.</hi> Our Author abounds here in new notions which might easily be discovered to be as fond, as new, were it worth while to consider them; of which in briefe, before. Only I wonder why giving way to such thoughts as these, he should speak of men with contempt under the name of <hi>Notionists,</hi> as he doth of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Du Moulin;</hi> but the truth is, the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, and were it not for some considerations that are obvious to me, I should almost wounder, why this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> should sharpen his leasure and <hi>zeale</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:98349:41"/>
against me, who scarse ever publickly touched the grounds and foundations of that Cause which he hath so passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly espoused, and pase by him, who both in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> hath laid his Axe to the very Root of it, upon principles <hi>sufficiently destructive</hi> to it, and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, by the best learned in our Authors way, that ever these nations brought forth; but as I said, Reasons lye at hand, why it was more <hi>necessary</hi> to give me this opposition; which yet hath not altered my Resolution, of handling this controversy in <hi>another manner,</hi> when I meet with <hi>another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of Adversary.</p>
            <p>Pag. 110. He fixes on the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a particular passage about the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>John</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2. of whom I affirmed that it <hi>is probable</hi> they were rather ignorant of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous dispensations of the Holy Ghost, then of the person of the Holy Ghost; alledging to the contrary that the words are more plaine and <hi>full then to be so cluded, and that for ought appeares,</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:98349:42"/>
               <hi>John did not baptize into the name of the Holy Ghost:</hi> I hope the <hi>Author</hi> doth not so much dwell at home, as to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this to be a <hi>new notion</hi> of mine; who almost of late in their <hi>criticall notes</hi> have not either (at least) considered it, or confirmed it? neither is the question <hi>into whose name</hi> they were expressely baptized, but in what doctrine they were instructed: He knowes who denies that they were at all actually <hi>baptized,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were baptized by <hi>Paul.</hi> Nor ought it to be granted without better proofe then any as yet hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, that any of the <hi>Saints</hi> under the old Testament, were ignorant of the <hi>being of the Holy Ghost.</hi> neither do the words require the sense by him insisted on; <gap reason="foreign">

wicked, and denying them to be <hi>members of any Church</hi> whatever: he bids me, <hi>answer his arguments to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from the</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7. 2 Thes. 13. 17. and I cannot but desire him that he would impose that task on them that have nothing else to do: for my owne part, I shall not intangle my selfe with things to so little purpose: Having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised my Reader to attend only to that which looks toward the <hi>merit of the cause,</hi> I must crave his pardon, that I have not been able to make good my resolution: meeting with so little or nothing at all which is to that purpose, I find my selfe entangled in the old diversions that we are now plentifully accustomed unto: but yet I shall endeavour to recompence this losse, by putting a speedy period to this whole trouble, despairing of being able to tender him any other satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilst I dwell on this discourse. In the meane time to obviate all strife of words if it be possible for the future, I shall grant this Reverend Author that in the generall large notion of <hi>Schisme</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:98349:43"/>
which his opposition to that insisted on by me hath put him upon, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> are both <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and any thing else shall be so, that he would have to be so, rather then to be engaged in this contest any farther. In this sense he affirmes that there was a <hi>Schisme</hi> between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and so one of them at least, was a <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;</hi> as also he affirmes the same of 2 <hi>les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> men, though great in their generation <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> so error and heresy, if he please shall be <hi>Schisme</hi> from the Catholick Church, and <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> of life shall be <hi>Schisme:</hi> And his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be true, that schisme is a breach of union in a Church of Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, therefore in that which is so only by call, not to any end of joynt worship as such; of any union; that which consists in the <hi>profession</hi> of the saving truths of the Gospell, and so there may be a schisme in the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and <hi>so those Presbyterians</hi> that reforme their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and do not administer the sacraments to all promiscuously, shall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98349:43"/>
be guilty of Schime; and indeed, as to me, what <hi>else he pleaseth,</hi> for my inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concernes only the <hi>precise limited na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Schisme,</hi> in its evangelically ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall sense.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I at present, (alloting very few houres to the dispatch of this businesse, which yet I judge more then it deserves) consider the scattered en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing passages about <hi>Ordination, Church Government, number of Elders,</hi> and the like, which all men know, not at all to belong unto the maine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy which was by me undertaken; and that they were against all lawes of disputation, plucked violently into this contest, by our Reverend Author. One thing I cannot passe by, and it will upon the matter put a <hi>close</hi> to what I shall at present offer to this Treatise; having said that Christ hath given no direction for the <hi>performance of any duty of worship of soveraigne institution,</hi> but only in them and by them (meaning particular Churches) he answers that, if <hi>I would imply that a Minister in or of a</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:98349:44"/>
               <hi>Particular Church, may performe those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances without those congregations, he contradicts himselfe for saying a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is the seate of all ordinances,</hi> but why so, I pray? may not a particular Church be the seat of all ordinances <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,</hi> and yet others be the <hi>object</hi> of them, or of some of them? but saith he, <hi>if he meane those ordinances of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are to be performed only by a minister of a particular congregation, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the people?</hi> I suppose they shall be <hi>instructed</hi> and built up according to the mind of Christ, and what would people desire more. But whereas he had before said, that I denyed <hi>a Minister to be a Minister to more then his own Church:</hi> and I had asked him <hi>who told him so;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that explication of my judgment, that for <hi>so much as men are appointed the objects of the dispensation of the word, I grant a Minister in the dispensation of it to act ministerially, towards not only the members of the Catholick Church, but the visible members of the world also in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction thereunto;</hi> he now tells
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98349:44"/>
me a story of passages between the <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wallis <hi>and my selfe about his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in the Vespers</hi> 1654. namely that as to that question <hi>An potestas ministri E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelici ad unius tantum ecclesiae parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularis membra extendatur?</hi> I said that, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wallis <hi>had brought me a challenge, and that If I did dispute on that question, I must dispute</hi> ex animo; although I grant that a Minister as a Minister may <hi>preach</hi> the word, to more then those of his owne congregation, yet knowing the sense wherein the <hi>learned</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>VVallis</hi> maintained that question, it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but I might say, if I did dispute I must do it <hi>ex animo;</hi> for <hi>his bringing me a challenge,</hi> I do not know that either he did so, or that I put that interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on what he did; but I shall crave leave to say, that if the <hi>learned</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> do find any ground, or <hi>occasion</hi> to bring a <hi>challenge</hi> unto me, to debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point of difference between us, I shall not wave answering his desire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he should bring M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Cawdry</hi> for his second; for the present I shall only
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98349:45"/>
say, that as it is no commendation to the moderation or ingenuity of any one whatever, thus to publish to the world private hearesaies, and what he hath been <hi>told</hi> of private conferences; so if I would insist on the same course, to make publication of what I have been told hath been the private discourse of some men, it is not unlikely that I should occasion their shame and trouble: yet in this course of proceeding a progres is made in the ensuing words; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Stubbes</hi> (who is now called my <hi>Amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis,</hi> who some five yeares ago, transcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>a sheete of paper for me,</hi> and not one line, before or since;) is said to be <hi>employed or at least encouraged</hi> by me to write against the <hi>learned</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wallis</hi> his <hi>Thesis</hi> being published; this is as true as much of that that went before, and as somewhat of that, that followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and whereas it is added that I said what he had written on that subject, was <hi>a scurrilous rididulous piece,</hi> it is of the same nature with the rest of the like reports. I knew that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98349:45"/>
               <hi>Stubbes</hi> was writing on that subject; but not untill he had <hi>proceeded</hi> farre in it; I neither <hi>imployed</hi> him, nor <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him</hi> in it, any otherwise then the consideration of his <hi>papers,</hi> after he had written them, may be so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; and the reason why I was not willing he should proceed, next to my desire of continuance of <hi>peace</hi> in this place, was his using <hi>such expressions of me,</hi> and somethings of mine, in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places of his discourse, as I could not <hi>modestly</hi> allow to be divulged; the following words to the same purpose with them before mentioned, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not; nor did ever think to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the consideration of such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of the common rules of <hi>humane society</hi> as those now passed through; Reports, heresayes, talkes, private discourse between friends, allegations countenanced by none of these, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing else, are the weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am assaulted. <hi>I have heard, I am told, if reports be</hi> true, twas <hi>vox po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli at Oxford, is it not so, I presume</hi>

               <hi>he will not deny it,</hi> are the ornaments of this discourse: strange! that men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and gravity should be carried by the power of these temptations not only to the <hi>forgetfulnesse</hi> of the royall law of Christ, and all Gospell rule of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards his professed Disciples: but also be ingaged into <hi>wayes</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, contrary to the dictates of the law of nature, and such as sundry hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens would have abhorred. For my owne part, had not God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence placed me in that station, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in others also that feare him are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in me, I should not once turne aside to looke upon such heapes as that which I have now passed over: my judgment in most heads and articles of Christian Religion is long since pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the world, and I continue through the grace and patience of God preaching in publick answerably to the principles I doe professe; and if any man shall oppose what I have delivered, or shall so deliver, in print or in the pulpit, or in divinity lectures, as my

judgment, I shall consider his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and doe therein, as God shall guide: with evill surmises, charges upon hearesayes, and reports, attended with perpetuall excursions from the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand, I shall no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>

And I am againe Charged with an attempt to vindicate them from schisme; my thoughts of them I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the full; &amp; have no reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any thing from what was then spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or to adde any thing thereunto; if it may satisfie our Authour, I here grant they were <hi>Schismatickes,</hi> with what aggravations he pleaseth; &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their <hi>schisme</hi> consisted, I have also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: but he sayes, I undertake to exempt some others from schisme <hi>(I know whom)</hi> that suffer with them in former and after ages, under the same imputation; I doe so indeed, and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our <hi>Authour</hi> may <hi>ghesse</hi> at whom I intend: himselfe amongst others; I hope he is not so taken up in his thoughts, with charging schisme on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to forget, that many, the greatest part and number of the true Churchs of Christ doe condemne him for a Schismatick; a <hi>Donatisticall</hi> Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick:

I suppose he acknowledges the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church; the <hi>Lutheran I</hi> am perswaded he will not deny, nor perhaps the <hi>Grecian,</hi> to be so: The <hi>Episcopall</hi> Church of England, he contends for; and yet all these with <hi>one voice</hi> cry out upon him for a <hi>Schismaticke:</hi> and as to the plea of the last, how he can satisfie his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to the rejection of his lawfull <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,</hi> upon his owne principles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending any such crime against them, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did against <hi>Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus, I</hi> professe <hi>I</hi> do not understand: new mention is made of <hi>Episcopall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> p. 120, And they are said to have had their successive ordination from <hi>Rome</hi> who ordained therein; so indeed some say, and some otherwise; whether they had or no, is nothing to me, I lay no weight upon it; they held <hi>I</hi> am sure, that place in England, that without their approbation no man could publickly, preach the Gospell; to say they were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and ordained as <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I</hi> know not what satisfaction can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise

unto <hi>Conscience</hi> thereby. Party and argument, may be countenanced by it; they professe they ordained <hi>as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> that for their lives and soules they durst not ordaine but as such; so they told those whom they ordained, and affirme they have open injury done them, by any ones deniall of it: As it was, the best is to be made of it; this shift is not handsome; nor is it ingenious, for any one, that hath looked into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to charge me with departing from their sense in the notion of <hi>schisme,</hi> declared about the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> &amp; 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ages, &amp; at the same time to maintaine an <hi>equality</hi> between <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters;</hi> or to say that <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> ordained as <hi>Presbyters,</hi> not as <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:</hi> nor doe <hi>I</hi> understand the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of that order which we see in some Churches, where they have two sorts of Elders; the one made so, by <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> without <hi>Election,</hi> and the other by <hi>Election</hi> without <hi>ordination;</hi> those who are ordained, casting off all power and Authority of them that ordained them; and those who are elected, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

            <p>Nor did I, as is pretend, plead for their <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way in the yeare 46; all the ministers (almost) in the county of Essex, know the contrary; one es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, who being a man of great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and moderation of spirit, and for his knowledge in those things, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind any man, <hi>I</hi> know, in <hi>England</hi> of his way, with whome in that yeare, and the next following, <hi>I</hi> had sundry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences at publicke meetings of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as to the <hi>severall wayes</hi> of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, then under proposall.

            <p>My description of a particular Church he once more blames as applicable to the <hi>Catholicke Church invisible,</hi> and to <hi>the visible Catholick Church</hi> (I suppose he meanes as such) when a participation in the same ordinances numerically, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:98349:49"/>
               <hi>somebody hath dealt more uncivilly with him in that respect, which he took very ill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this Reverend Authour, make what use of it he please, I cannot but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine tell him, that these things become neither <hi>him,</hi> nor any man professing the <hi>Religion of Jesus Christ,</hi> or that hath any respect to <hi>truth</hi> or sobriety; can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man thinke, that in his conscience, he gives any credit to the insinuation which here he makes, that I should thanke him for calling me <hi>Reverend Authour,</hi> or <hi>Reverend Doctor,</hi> or be troubled for his not useing those expressions? Can the mind of an <hi>honest man</hi> be thought to be conversant with such <hi>meane</hi> and <hi>low thoughts?</hi> for the Title of Reverend, I doe give him notice that I have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle valued it, ever since I have conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the saying of <hi>Luther; Nunquam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclitatur Religio nisi inter Reverendissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</hi> So that he may as to me forbeare it for the future, and call me, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> doe, and it shall suffice. And for that of <hi>Doctor;</hi> it was conferred on me by the <hi>University</hi> in my <hi>absence,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:98349:50"/>
and against my <hi>consent,</hi> as they have expressed it under their <hi>publicke</hi> seale: nor doth any thing but <hi>gratitude,</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> unto them, make me once own it; and freed from that obligation, I should never use it more, nor did I use it, untill some were offended with me, &amp; blamed me for my neglect of them. And for that <hi>other,</hi> whom he mentions, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, gave so farre place to <hi>indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> as to infinuate some such thing, I doubt not but by this time he hath beene <hi>convinced</hi> of his mistake therein, being a <hi>Person</hi> of another manner of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and worth, then <hi>some others,</hi> with whom I have to doe; and the truth is, my manner of dealing with him in my <hi>last reply,</hi> which I have since my selfe not so well approved of, requires the <hi>passing</hi> by such returnes. But you will say then why doe I preface this discourse, with that Expression; <hi>with thankes for the civility of the enquiry in the manner of it's expression?</hi> I say! this will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the iniquity of this Authour's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, in this particular: His enquiry

was, <hi>whether I did not in my Conscience think that there were no true Churches in England, untill the Brownists our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Anabaptists our elder brothers, and our selves arose, and gathered new Churches;</hi> without once taking notice, or mentioning his <hi>titles</hi> that he sayes he gave me, I used the words, in a sense obvious to every man's first considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a reproofe of the expressions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; that which was the true cause of my words our <hi>Authour</hi> hides in an <hi>&amp;c:</hi> that which was not by me once taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is by him expressed; to serve an end of drawing forth an evill surmize and suspition, that hath not the least colour to give it countenance; Passing by all indifferent Readers, I referre the <hi>honesty</hi> of this dealing with me, to the judgment of his owne conscience; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe, what I neither <hi>expressed,</hi> nor tooke <hi>notice</hi> of, nor had any <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> occasion in that place so to doe, the words being often used by him, hiding, and concealing what I did <hi>take notice</hi> of, and expresse, and which to every man's

               <hi>view</hi> was the occasion of that passage, that conclusion or unworthy insinuation is made, which a Good man ought to have abhorred.</p>
            <p>Sundry other particulars there are, partly false, and calumniating, partly impertinent, partly consisting in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, that I thought at the first view, to have made mention of; but on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall accounts, I am rather willing here to put an end to the Readers trouble, and my owne.</p>

               <p>The Reconciliation of this Seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Contradiction</hi> were obvious and easy; take the words as they stand in the <hi>Scheme;</hi> for so it might be said, <hi>Brethren,</hi> are sometimes put for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate members of the Church, and Contradistinguished from such as beare office in the Church. As when it is said in the <hi>Synodicall Letter</hi> (Act.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98349:53"/>
15. 23.) <hi>The Apostles, Elders, and Brethren.</hi> Sometimes Brethren are put more generally, as Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the members of the Church, both officers and private members as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1: and frequently else where: In the former Sence, the Passage in the <hi>Keyes</hi> speaketh, when it saith, <hi>the sense of the words will be most full, if</hi> Peter <hi>be conceived as Receiving the Keyes in the Name both of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and private members, to wit, in the Name of the Apostles, Elders, and Brethren.</hi> In the latter sense, the words of the Scheme might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Runne, That the Power of the keyes was given to <hi>Peter,</hi> not as an Apostle (for then it had been Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only to the Apostles:) nor as an Elder (for then it had been only to <hi>Elders)</hi> but as a <hi>Profest Believer.</hi> And under the Generall Name of <hi>Profest Believers,</hi> not only private Brethren, but <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> may be comprehended. For all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles &amp; all the <hi>Elders</hi> are profest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98349:54"/>
And so all of them may claime their Interest in the Power of the keyes, according to the severall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and latitude of Power assigned to them in the Scriptures. But I will not so answer; because in the <hi>Way</hi> the context speaketh of such Brethren, as have not power to exercise the <hi>Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ministry</hi> of the word &amp; Sacraments. But notwithstanding that the Assoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the contradiction is no lesse faire and cleare. For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cawdrey</hi> well knoweth (and so doth any <hi>Logician:)</hi> That to a contradiction, It is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Requisite (amongst others:) That both speake <hi>ad Idem.</hi> But here it is otherwise. In the <hi>keyes</hi> I spake of such a power of the <hi>keyes,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> Received Formally, standing in the roome both of an Apostle and of an Elder, and of a Profest Believer: that is, such a Power as <hi>Peter</hi> having Received might exercise in his own person, and each one of them respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively. In <hi>the Way,</hi> I spake of such a power, as the Brethren of the Church
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98349:54"/>
have Received not formally (farther than concerneth their own liberty) but virtually only.</p>
               <p>For though the Brethren have not a <hi>formall Power</hi> to excercise the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall ministry</hi> of the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet they have a <hi>virtuall Power</hi> to exercise them by choosing and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forth such Officers as have a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Power</hi> to exercise the same. And there is nothing in the <hi>keyes,</hi> or in the <hi>way,</hi> or in the <hi>Defence,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth this. So that both these two Passages (in the <hi>keyes,</hi> and in the <hi>way)</hi> are so farre from making a Contradiction (and that so <hi>flat as never any more)</hi> as that they doe not indeed amount to an <hi>Opposition.</hi> In an Opposition both parts cannot be true: here both are true. <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as standing in the Roome of an Apostle, Elder, and Profest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, did receive Formally all the Power of the keyes: The Body of the Brethren have received, though the power of their liberty Formally;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98349:55"/>
yet all other Parts of Church Power which belongeth to Officers, they have Received only virtually and this very distinction is expressed <hi>in terminis,</hi> in the very same Page (27. of the way) whence this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is fetched. As for his Exageration of the Contradiction, That is was as <hi>flat, as never any more,</hi> though he to make this Comparative Speech seem lesse <hi>hyperbolicall,</hi> doe tell us in a <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> That Contradictions doe not <hi>Recipere magis &amp; minùs</hi> (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they make any Contradiction at all It must needs be as slat, as ever any was:) He may be pleased to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That such a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> though it make his Speech, lesse <hi>hyperbolicall,</hi> yet it maketh it the more <hi>irrationall;</hi> If I should say <hi>Nero</hi> was as wicked a man as ever any was, and yet presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all men were equally wicked (wickednesse in men did not <hi>Recipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re magis &amp; minùs)</hi> there were very little <hi>Reason</hi> in Such Exaggeration. In my former Answer to this Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98349:55"/>
(intituled, <hi>The way of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall Churches cleared)</hi> I said the words whereon the Assertour groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this <hi>Contradiction,</hi> were his own not mine. For He reporteth me to say (in the <hi>keyes pag.</hi> 4.) That the keyes were delivered to <hi>Peter as an Apostle, as an Elder, as a Believer.</hi> But in his Preface <hi>(Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>Num.</hi> 1.) He confesseth;</p>
               <p>That the words are not mine <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis:</hi> but in sense, (he saith) they be. For I said take <hi>Peter</hi> not as an <hi>Apostle</hi> Only, but as an <hi>Elder</hi> also, and a Believer too, all may well stand together.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he Inferreth; <hi>Doth not this discourse clearly hold forth this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as the sense of that Text, The keyes were delivered to</hi> Peter <hi>as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, as an Elder, as a Believer too? all may well stand together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That discourse of mine is so farre from <hi>clearly holding forth</hi> that Proposition, that it clearly holdeth forth the contrary in expresse termes:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98349:56"/>
my expresse termes be, <hi>Take</hi> Peter <hi>considered not only as an Apostle &amp;c. now</hi> if <hi>not only</hi> as an Apostle, than not as an Apostle, For if they were delivered to him as an Apostle, then to all the Apostles, and <hi>only</hi> to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: which my words <hi>in Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> doe expresly Deny.</p>
               <p>But saith he, <hi>This Apology maketh it worse, For if it be so that whatsoever is Attributed to any as such, is given to all such universally, reciprocally, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to such:</hi> Now Assume.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the keyes were given to</hi> Peter <hi>as an Apostle, Therefore they were given only to the Apostles, and not to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here the Assumption is <hi>Palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly false,</hi> not at all delivered by me, but dragged out of my words against the letter and against the sence of them. I say the <hi>keyes</hi> were not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Peter</hi> as an Apostle only: why then not to him as an Apostle, but as He is joyntly considered with other Officers and Brethren. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98349:56"/>
he Appealeth to the Judgment of any <hi>Logician,</hi> whether to say <hi>Peter</hi> Received <hi>the keyes not as an Apostle only, but an Elder also, and a Believer, be not as much as to say,</hi> Peter <hi>had the Power of the keyes given Him, as an Apostle, as an Elder, and as a Believer:</hi> Verily if that were the Judgment of all <hi>Logicians</hi> I should conclude, either that <hi>Logick</hi> had forsaken the world, or at least that my selfe were forsaken of <hi>Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Christ Promised the keyes to <hi>Peter,</hi> though he spake Indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, keyes, yet he meaneth universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the keyes of the kingdome of Heaven. And to put all the <hi>keyes</hi> into <hi>Peter's</hi> hand as an Apostle, though it would communicate them indeed to all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> yet since the <hi>Death</hi> of all the Apostles, all the Churches and all the <hi>Elders,</hi> have been left destitute of the Power of the keyes.</p>
               <p>And if so, then why doe we blame the Seekers who have cast off all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98349:57"/>
and all Ordinances, 'till new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles come?</p>
               <p>Againe the <hi>Replyer</hi> Argueth thus on the contrary (from that Passage in the way <hi>pag.</hi> 27:) <hi>If the keyes were given to</hi> Peter, <hi>not as an Apostle, nor as an Elder, but as a Believer, then to all Believers, and only to Believers. But (saith the</hi> Way) <hi>the keyes were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to</hi> Peter <hi>not as an Apostle, nor as an Elder, but as a Believer, therefore they were given to all Believers (Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and all) and only to Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It hath been shewed above, That in that Place in <hi>the Way,</hi> I speak expresly of <hi>Profest Believers,</hi> to have received all the power of the keyes not <hi>Formally,</hi> but <hi>virtually.</hi> So that if there be some Power of the keyes which they cannot exercise <hi>Formally</hi> as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet they may exercise the same <hi>virtually,</hi> by choosing and calling forth such, as may formally exercise the same for them: which presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed I answer to the <hi>Major,</hi> If the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keyes (which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98349:57"/>
in the Church) were given to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> not as an Apostle, nor as an Elder, but as a Believer, then it was <hi>Given to all Believers,</hi> and only to believers, &amp; to such whom Believers shall orderly choose, and call forth to execute the same. As to instance in a like example, If heate be Given to Fire, as such, then to all Fire, and only to Fire, &amp; to such other things, as Fire communicateth his virtue to. When therefore the <hi>Publishers</hi> of the <hi>keyes</hi> say, <hi>The Power of the keyes may be Disposed in a due Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotment into divers hands.</hi> The Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had no cause to say, <hi>Herein they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Agree with me, nor with them. They say it is put into diverse hands, And he saith it is Given only to Believers: And is not this a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans:</hi> No verily; For when I say It is given to Believers as such, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>virtually,</hi> as well as <hi>Formally,</hi> The meaning is cleare, It is given to all Believers, and only to Believers, and by them Communicated to such, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98349:58"/>
they doe orderly choose and call forth, to the exercise of the same. And the <hi>publishers of the keyes</hi> I doubt not, will say as much. When I said (in the way) That the brethren might not administer Sacraments in Defect of all Officers, And therefore made it appeare that one sort of men (the brethren) had not Received all the Power of the keyes Formally. The Replyer returneth, <hi>Truly this is to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Contradiction the more. For if the Power of the keyes be Delivered to Believers as such, then the Power of Administring the Sacraments is Given to them: for that is a Part of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the keyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is wearysome to repeat so often the same Answer; yet let me say it once more, and leave it; He that saith, <hi>Believers</hi> Receive all the Power of the keyes as Profest Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, He saith all of them have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Power, and they only, and such as Receive their Power from them. And this is the force of <hi>quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98349:58"/>
                  <hi>Tale;</hi> That whosoever Receive any thing as such, all such doe Receive it, &amp; none but such as <hi>Derive</hi> it from them.</p>
               <p>But saith the Replyer, <hi>In the Way, he giveth the greater part of Church power to the Body of the</hi> Church <hi>(pag.</hi> 45.) <hi>to wit,</hi> to Ordaine, and in some cases) to excommunicate <hi>all their Church</hi> Officers: which are the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Acts of <hi>Rule</hi> (as else where he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:) Therefore he may not <hi>Deny them the lesser, which is to Administer the Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The answer is ready at hand, and was ready at his hand (in Part 2: of the <hi>Congregationall way clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> pag. 29.) where I Distinguish <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas</hi> into <hi>officiariam</hi> and <hi>honorariam.</hi> Excommunication by the Brethren is the highest Act of <hi>Honoraria Potestas:</hi> but not of <hi>Officiaria Potestas.</hi> To Preach the word with Authority, and to Administer the Seales of it, are acts of the highest office-Power in the Church. Popish Divines would take
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98349:59"/>
it very ill, if any Act of Church Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er were said to be higher than <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere corpus Domini.</hi> But excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication largly taken is an Act of a Power proper to a Community. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny community hath power <hi>ex Natura rei,</hi> to Receive into their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp; to cast not of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Every sound Body hath a power to cast out his own superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and to cut off his own Putrid members: As for <hi>ordination,</hi> though we looke at it (with D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ames)</hi> as <hi>Adjunctum consummans</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Election, and vocation of their Officers (and therefore not utterly Excentrical from the Peoples power;) yet our Churches doe not Practise it ordinarily, where they have Elders of their own, or can Procure other Elders to Joyne with them.</p>
               <p>As for that last words in the Scheme of the first Contradiction, I know not whether the <hi>Replyer</hi> put any weight, or stresse, in that, in the first <hi>Columne,</hi> the keyes are said to be given (to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98349:59"/>
wit, partly) to Believers, and in the same Columne againe to the <hi>Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> with the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in the second Columne to Profest Believers, In the third to Believers Publickly Professing their Faith: And (in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hookers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) Not to <hi>Believers</hi> as Believers, but as Believers Covenanting.</p>
               <p>But if it be requisite to say any thing to this, I would say. 1. That the <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> and <hi>Profest Believers,</hi> and <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Publickly Professing</hi> their Faith, are all one. And the common Name of <hi>Believers</hi> is often put for all the rest, They that were <hi>Added to the Church</hi> (Acts 2. 47: and 41:) are called by the common name of Believers <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44. <hi>and</hi> 4. 32. when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> saith <hi>the Power is not Given to Believers as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> but as Believers Covenanting, He meaneth the same that I do, by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for women (whom the Replyer cast in our way before) though they be Believers and so partake in the same common Salvation, as also in the word
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98349:60"/>
and seales: yet because of the frailty of their sex, they are expresly exempted by the Apostle from any Act of Power in the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35. <hi>and</hi> 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 2. 11, 12. Yet that Impeacheth not the Generality of the Proposition; That all the <hi>Fraternity</hi> of Believers have Part in the Power of the Keyes: <hi>That all men once Dye is</hi> the generall Proposition of the Apostle <hi>Heb:</hi> 9. 27. which is not Impeached by the Translation of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus cleared the first Answer to this contradiction, Let us weigh next what he saith to the second Answer, which saith he is given to help out the former, for I had said.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If there had been some Difference between the</hi> Keyes <hi>and the</hi> Way, <hi>in some expressions: yet it lay rather in</hi> Logicall Termes, <hi>then in the</hi> Doctrine of Divinity, <hi>or Church Practise, and such is this, about the first subject of the Power of the Keyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What saith the Replyer to this? He Returneth a double exception.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Saith He, <hi>Had it been only a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98349:60"/>
                  <hi>Difference about a Logicall Notion (as he minceth it) the Assertor had not Observed it. But a difference (of the highest magnitude) to Contradiction, in Delivering a New way is very Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. How shall we be brought to Agree with them that contradict not only one another, but one man himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 1. It was not any weaknesse of the first Answer, that needed a second to Help it out, but variety of fit matter for a just Defence produced it: It need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no help, but to cleare it selfe from groundlesse exceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 2. The seeming Difference between the <hi>way</hi> and the <hi>Keyes</hi> (if any be in this point) it lyeth rather in <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call expressions,</hi> then in the Doctrine of Divinity, or Church Practise. For what ever the Different Judgments of men of our way may be, touching the first subject of the Power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> (some Placing it in the Body of the Church, others Dividing it between officers and Brethren:) yet in the <hi>Doctrine of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> we all Agree with one Accord, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98349:61"/>
the Church (even the Body of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members) have power to choose their officers, to Admit members, and to censure offenders: And that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers only have Power to Preach the word with office and Authority, and to Administer the Sacraments. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this unity of judgment is the uniforme Practise of our Churches. And therefore let <hi>mincing</hi> be left to <hi>curious Cookes</hi> to prepare their shread meat for queazy stomackes: or let it be left to such as would make the best of a bad cause: we neither <hi>Distrust our Cause</hi> to be of God, nor do feare any thing more then that it should be hid, and clouded with prejudices and calumnies from such as know it not, and yet seek the Truth in sincerity. And therefore let the <hi>Replyer</hi> be pleased to consider, whether the Difference be indeed any more then in a <hi>Logicall Notion:</hi> and whether they be the words not only of an <hi>Assertour,</hi> but of an <hi>Avenger,</hi> to style it a <hi>Difference of the highest magnitude?</hi> Surely if there were not some more then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98349:61"/>
common zeale and Indignation in the cause, A <hi>Contradiction in Logicall Termes,</hi> would not be counted a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>of the highest magnitude in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> nor vvould such Difference in vvords so easy to be reconciled, be blovven up to so high an opposition, as <hi>a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His second exception is, <hi>That Howsoever the first Subject is indeed a Logicall Terme, yet the matter Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is Doctrinall Divinity: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Practise be, It is a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Divinity as well as in Logick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer:</hi> But I hope it hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there hath been found no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all, neither in Logick nor in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, though there have wanted no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> to search it, nor <hi>animosity</hi> to charge it. And therefore your Question is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily Answered, <hi>How shall we be brought to Agree with them, that Contradict not only one another, but one man himselfe?</hi> For here is yet no Contradiction found of one man to himselfe, nor any Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Contradiction neither in one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98349:62"/>
man nor other, unlesse it be only in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall Termes,</hi> and scarce therein. But If the <hi>Replyer</hi> deferre his Agreeing with <hi>Divines</hi> or Churches, in any way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, till he meet with such as neither <hi>Contradict themselves,</hi> nor one another, He must neither be Protestant nor Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan (as they have been called) nor of the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> nor <hi>Congregationall</hi> way.</p>
               <p>What if it be said (in the way, pag: 45.) <hi>The brethren of the Church might Proceed (to wit, upon just, and weighty grounds) against all their officers as well as one? yet in such cases our Churches are never wont to proceed, but in the Presence, and with the Consent and approbation of other Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why then saith he their Doctrine and Practise agree not, which is the greater Blemish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How hard is it for a heart <hi>leavened with Prejudice</hi> to take good things in good part? A free man, <hi>sui juris</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his fathers consent) might marry a wife (if he would) without his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns consent: And for <hi>Adultery,</hi> he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98349:62"/>
might put her away also without their Consent, And yet he will not do either, without their consent, and Approbaion. Is this mans Judgment contrary to his Practise, and is it the greater Blemish? what say we to <hi>Paul?</hi> He Received his <hi>Gospell, neither of man, nor by man.</hi> And he might have Preached it every where boldly and confidently, and have called an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all such as had gainesayed Him, whether <hi>Angells or Apostles</hi> Gal. 1. 8, 9. yet he chose rather to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to conferre with the <hi>Apostles</hi> about his whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 1, 2. and that lest he <hi>had Runne in vaine,</hi> or <hi>should Runne in vaine.</hi> What then? shall we say Then <hi>Pauls Doctrine and Practise Agree not, which is the greater Blemish?</hi> God forbid. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prudence and Religious care to Prevent offence, will condescend to cleare Righteous Proceedings to all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and equall mindes. And yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crosse his owne judgment of his owne Right, nor blemish (but rather Honour) himselfe by Approving it to others.</p>

3. I gave a third Answer to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Charge of Contradictions, which he saith, I <hi>Added to succour both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Truth is, they need no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to Defend themselves against such exceptions: but it is an Honour to truth, to have many witnesses to attend upon it.</p>
               <p>I said it for a third Answer, <hi rend="margQuotes">That it were no just matter of calumny, If in some latter Tractate, I should Retract or expresse more commodiously, what I wrote in a former lesse safely: as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto he Replyeth, Truly S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>It had been no just Calumny so to do, but matter of Honour and Reputation rather. But to write Contradictions, and to take no Notice of them, till observed by others: and then to be so farre from Retracting, as to stand upon Justification of them, is nothing like Augustines Practise, and so falleth short of his Reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer:</hi> Though <hi>Augustine</hi> Retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, what he was convinced of, to be erroneous, or unsafe, yet he did not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98349:63"/>
what every one objected against him, (not only what <hi>Faustus, or Petilius or Julian</hi> objected, but not so much as what <hi>Jerome</hi> himselfe objected,) but justly stood upon his owne Defence. Had <hi>Vindex</hi> his objections been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, Reason, and (I hope) consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would not have suffered me to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify knowne Errours. He doth himselfe beare me witnesse, That he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard, I have often <hi>changed my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</hi> And (I thank God) I take it for no shame to change for the better.</p>
               <p>But to confesse I am <hi>convinced,</hi> when I am not, and to Retract what a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (though a Brother) conceiveth erroneous, to wit, in his Judgment, but not in mine own, It were as much as to live by another man's Faith, and not mine own: and with all to cast my selfe under that Reproach, which the Title of his Booke implicitly casteth upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A wavering minded man is unstable in all his wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Preface he saith, there are in that Prefatory Epistle to the</hi> Way,

                  <hi>and in that other to the keyes, other Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences observed, betweene the Author and the Prefacers, but the Author is not pleased to take Notice of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is too hard perhaps to Reconcile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is well if he can Reconcile himselfe to himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is the word not of an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertour</hi> but of an <hi>avenger,</hi> (whose heart is hot, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 6.) But Though M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi> know not so much, yet I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice of those Differences, and have Advertised the Prefacers of the same, whom it concerned. My letters to them are not present at hand with me: If they were I should not think it meet to publish them. In the Preface to the <hi>keyes,</hi> the Prefacers note a Difference between me and them about the <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying of Private Brethren,</hi> concerning which I sent them word, I <hi>Discerned</hi> no Dissent at all between them and me in that Point, though they had Added a case or two of liberty, more than there they did expresse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98349:64"/>
Whether it be too <hi>hard</hi> for me or no to Reconcile others with my selfe it is enough, that I <hi>keep the unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with them in the bond of Peace:</hi> and that I have learned <hi>Placidè ferre contra Sentientes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But howsoever I hope (by the help of Christ) I shall soone <hi>Reconcile my selfe to my selfe,</hi> unlesse the Replyer can prevaile with me so farre, as to make me not only to <hi>fall out</hi> with my selfe, but to <hi>fall off</hi> from the Truth too, or else convince me that I have so fallen, and yet even so I hope the Lord will help me rather to Reconcile my selfe to the Truth, than my selfe to my selfe.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The former Columne in all the three Places speaketh of <hi>Elders</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the right Administration of their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98349:67"/>
office then in Propriety of speech the <hi>Key</hi> of Authority and Rule is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. and is there made the proper Act of their office, Then it is that the People Discerning the will and Judgment of Christ in their Judgment, they do give <hi>Consent</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the will of Christ in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures Advised by them, Then it is also that they walke in orderly subjection to their Elders, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>But the latter Columne speaketh of the Power of the Church over the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders chiefly in case of the Elders <hi>mal-Administration</hi> of their office, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government of themselves. But then the Power which the Church putteth forth, It is not office Power (which is properly Authority:) but <hi>Potestas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraria.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 2. In Columne the second when it is said; The People have some <hi>stock of Power</hi> and Authority in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, <hi>Keyes</hi> pag. 36. They are the words of an objection, not of mine owne Assertion, And though
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98349:68"/>
some where I speak of Acts of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Elders, I do clearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine my selfe in the <hi>Keyes</hi> (pag. 36.) That Authority is taken in a large sense, and after a sort, when it is Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the People over the Elders, As</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a man acteth according to his owne will freely, he is then said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Answer</hi> 1. Here is indeede a Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance in Expressions between the <hi>Way,</hi> and the <hi>Keyes.</hi> But it was not my Act, that any such Discrepance should have been extant. The truth is, That many yeares agoe, (and some yeares before the suppressing of the Bishops in England) I was <hi>seriously</hi> moved by some of our Brethren, and fellow Elders here, to Draw up an <hi>Historicall</hi> Narration of our <hi>Church-way</hi> together with some familiar grounds of the same briefly. In short time as God Helped, I dispatched it, which when our brethren had perused, I saw they did not close with it. Yet a Brother going for England, got some where a Copy of it, and Presented it to some of the <hi>Congregationall</hi> way there:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98349:69"/>
and I afterwards heard, that neither did they close with it: and in particular not with that Passage, which is here reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as a part of the Contradiction. Which since appeareth more openly, by the <hi>Asterisk</hi> put upon that Passage, and upon sundry other in the Book: But before I saw that, and had only heard, That they did not fully Accord, I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it had met with a timely suppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then an impression: for I heard no more of it, for two, or three yeares after: Meane while perceiving That one maine Point of Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was the Authority given to the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, I considered more seriously and Distinctly, of the whole Power of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> and expressed my Apprehensions in that Treatise of the Keyes, which our brethren here did well Accept, and so did the brethren (of like Judgment) in England, and some of them were pleased to Attest it with the Preface which is now extant before it: yea I have heard (as well as some other of our Brethren here) by some letters from England, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98349:70"/>
Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Rutherford</hi> (who was a great Part of the Assembly at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster) offered to the Dissenting bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, That if they would come up to the Treatise of the Keyes, themselves would meet them there. But this was sundry yeares, after the Treatise of the <hi>way</hi> had been finished, and carried to England, and (as I hoped) suppressed. But it seemeth some Brother there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got a Copy of it, being zealous of the Authority of the <hi>Fraternity,</hi> and Perceiving that their Authority was not so fully Acknowledged in the <hi>Keyes</hi> as in the <hi>Way;</hi> He caused his Copy of the <hi>Way</hi> (which was indeed abrupt in the entrance, and imperfect otherwise) to be Published in Print: which when I saw, It troubled me not a little, as knowing, That the Discrepant Expressions in the one, and in the other, might trouble friends, and give Advantage to Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. Afterwards M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> coming downe from <hi>Connectiquol,</hi> to consult with the Elders here about his Book; He pleaded seriously for the Placing of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98349:70"/>
all Church power, primitively, in the Body of the Church, and also for their Judiciary Power of Censure over the Presbytery, suitable to what I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the <hi>Way;</hi> Now, though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, that his Reasons did prevaile with me, to lter the Placing of the <hi>First Subject</hi> of the <hi>Power of the Keyes,</hi> from what I had delivered in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the <hi>Keyes:</hi> yet Perceiving that some mens Judgments did more Adhere as to his Judgment, so to the former course of the <hi>Way:</hi> others to that of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> I suffered both to stand as they did, especially seeing I could not help it, the Book of the <hi>Way</hi> being published without my Consent; and both the <hi>Way,</hi> and the <hi>Keyes</hi> being disperst into many hands (past my Revoking) and Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some; So that if the Replyer find some <hi>Discrepancy</hi> in one of these bookes from the other, Let him know that the Doctrine of the <hi>Way</hi> (in such few Points wherein it differeth from the <hi>Keyes)</hi> was not then mine when the <hi>Keyes</hi> were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, much lesse when the <hi>Way</hi> was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98349:71"/>
published, which was many yeares after, though it had been penned many yeares before. And yet take all the Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancyes, and weigh them (I will not say with Candour but with Rigour) and I do not yet remember, nor can I yet find any of them, but they lye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Difference of <hi>Logicall Notion,</hi> then in <hi>Doctrine of Divinity,</hi> or Church Practise, as I said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 2. This further; let me Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint both the Replyer, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der withall, that sometimes there hath growne a Question, amongst us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Excommunication be an Act of <hi>Officiaria Potestas,</hi> or not some <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria</hi> only? If of <hi>Officiaria,</hi> It cannot be Dispensed by the Brethren only, as the first Columne hath it. If of <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria,</hi> It may, and so the second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne hath it: and then the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not <hi>ejusdem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is this Censure dispensed by the brethren (as I conceive) one of the highest Acts of Rule (which is to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto Satan 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.) but Reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98349:71"/>
only to cast their Elders, out of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of office to them, and out of Church Communion with them. The Truth is, <hi>Ego libenter in eorum me nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero esse Profiteor, qui proficiendo Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt, &amp; Scribendo proficiunt;</hi> which gave me occasion to Adde the third Answer given above to the first Contradiction, Some things in the way which I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more laxly, I expresse more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Treatise of the <hi>Keyes</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after: and some things more fully and clearely, in the way cleared, then in either of the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 3. When I say No Act of the <hi>Peoples</hi> part, doeth properly binde, unlesse the Authority of the <hi>Elder</hi> joyne with it <hi>(Keyes</hi> pag. 36.) I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to speak it as I meant it, of the Elders walking without offence; in the Right Administration of their office, and Conversation of their lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer</hi> 4. When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> saith. Excommunication is not an Act of <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Power,</hi> nor of Rule, but of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame <hi>Judgment</hi> seated in the <hi>Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98349:72"/>
I easily grant that the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation dispensed by the <hi>Fraternity</hi> is not an Act of <hi>Office-Power;</hi> But it may Justly be Inquired, whether Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, being Dispensed by the Elders with the consent of the Church, be not an Act, as of the Churches honourable Judiciall Power, so of the Elders Office-Power, and Rule in the Church? For as the Pastorall Preaching of the Elders is <hi>Officiall,</hi> and so <hi>Authoritative,</hi> though the Preaching of other Brethren (as of the Sonnes of the Prophets) be not so: so why may there not be the like Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, observed here? To deliver unto Satan seemeth to be an Act of <hi>Judiciall Office-Power,</hi> as when in another case it is said, <hi>The Judge delivereth a man to the Officer, and the officer casteth him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prison</hi> Matth. 5. 25. He that <hi>casteth into Prison</hi> is an Inferiour officer. The Judge must therefore be a Superiour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, that delivereth an offendour to the officer, to be cast into Prison. In the Excommunication of the <hi>Incestuous Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> (where both the Elders and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98349:72"/>
Brethren concurred) the sentence might well be delivered in Termes that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse an Act of highest Authority, To <hi>deliver unto Satan.</hi> But where the Church is called to Act against their <hi>Elders</hi> (who corrupt them with false Doctrine) there the Apostle Requireth the Church, to <hi>mark them, and Avoyd them,</hi> Rom. 16. 17, 18. which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse an Act of liberty, and <hi>Judiciall Power,</hi> but not of Authority.</p>

This Contradiction is not of <hi>me</hi> to my <hi>selfe,</hi> but of some others, who whether they be <hi>Independants</hi> truly so called, I doe not know: sure I am, that Presbyterians and Independants are not <hi>membra Dividentia,</hi> though I see, that all that are not for <hi>Popery,</hi> or Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, or Presbytery, doe commonly lurke under the style of <hi>Independancy.</hi> I hope the Replyer would be loth to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Protestant Religion, because

For I would not say that it is a Sacrilegious usurpation, for well gifted Brethren (where ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministers cannot be had) there to Preach ordinarily and Publickly, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they be Approved by those that have Power, and requested there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the People, wherein I goe further in giving way to the Prophecying of Private Brethren, than my Reverend Brethren (the Prefacers to the <hi>Keyes)</hi> doe, who only Allow them to <hi>Preach occasionally,</hi> and not ordinarily, which I speak only to this end, That the Reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and others may know, there is more

                  <hi>Ans:</hi> 1. This is one of those Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which I spake before, that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rather in <hi>Logicall Notion,</hi> than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Doctrine of Divinity,</hi> or in Church Practise. Against which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception made above, hath been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered above, in clearing the first Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. There is no <hi>colour of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> betweene the two former <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes.</hi> For when I say A Particular Church is the <hi>first Subject</hi> of all the Church Officers and their Gifts, I speak not of this or that particular Church, (which is but an <hi>Individuall)</hi> but of a Particular Church taken <hi>Indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which (by meere errour of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is without sence said, taken <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,</hi> which is the Disadvantage of us, who live so far remote from the Presse, that we can neither prevent their mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes nor correct them afterwards. But take a Particular Church <hi>Indefinitely</hi> &amp; it comprehendeth all <hi>Particular Churches:</hi> And that God hath given to Particular Churches all spirituall officers together
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98349:76"/>
with their Gifts, for the Discharge of their offices, is Proved by evident Texts of Scripture, in that very Page of the <hi>Keyes</hi> 31. I doe not say (as some doe) that the <hi>Church</hi> meaning the <hi>Fraternity</hi> is the <hi>first subject</hi> of all spirituall Gifts (for then they had received them <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> without officers:) but I say the offices and Officers, not devoid of Gifts, but furnished with their gifts, are given by Christ to the <hi>Church freely,</hi> and not to any other Person or Society, from whom the Church Receiveth them.</p>
               <p>But this no whit crosseth, what is said in the second <hi>Columne,</hi> That <hi>Elders</hi> are the <hi>first Subjects</hi> of ordinary Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Power, and Apostles of <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Power,</hi> and Synods, of <hi>Synodicall</hi> Power. A wife may be the first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her <hi>own Dowry,</hi> but yet her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is the first Subject <hi>Recipient</hi> of his wife with her Dowry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. As for what is said different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by my <hi>Brother Hooker</hi> in the third Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, as his Person and Gifts and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98349:76"/>
Friendship were pretious and deare to me whilest he lived: so now that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in Glory, his Name and memory, and labour (saving some very few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Notions) are honourable, and blessed, with me, and I suppose with all that knew him. But in this <hi>Logicall Notion,</hi> I crave leave, not so much to dissent from him (for he herein Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from me, who wrote first, rather than I from him) but leave I crave not to Retract what I formerly wrote in the <hi>Keyes</hi> touching this Point, though I should as much suspect mine own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he Dissenteth from me, as where any man. It is true he taketh the Church of Covenanted Believers to be the first Subject of the power of the keyes, vvhich if he meane no more, than that they have all Church-Power ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>formaliter,</hi> or <hi>Radicaliter,</hi> and <hi>Virtualiter,</hi> then there is no Difference in our expressions; but if he meane that that they are the first Subject of all Church-Povver properly, two or three things Detaine me from consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98349:77"/>
with him herein. 1. That vvhich is the first Subject of any Povver Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it immediately vvithout any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Intervening Subject. As <hi>fire</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first <hi>Subject</hi> of Heate, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not his Heate from any former Subject. But it is evident, That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Church of Believers, hath not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Pastorall Gifts,</hi> nor it may be any Gifts fit for office, 'till they fetch them from other Churches, and sometimes from some who are not members of any Particular Church at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The first Subject of any Power, as it hath immediately Received it: so it may immediately exercise it: as Fire (the first subject of Heate) can Heate without Intervention of any other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>But the Church hath not Power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to exercise <hi>Pastorall Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 'till it have procured and chosen, and called forth some or other Gifted Persons to exercise the same.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I might Adde a third Reason to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98349:77"/>
both the former. Whatsoever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the <hi>first Subject</hi> of any Power, It hath that same Power, or some other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent, and <hi>analogicall</hi> to it, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>radicaliter</hi> and <hi>virtualiter,</hi> but <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter</hi> also. And because <hi>formaliter,</hi> therefore <hi>radicaliter</hi> and <hi>virtualiter.</hi> For whatsoever is in any Subject Firstly, (whether it be proper Adjunct, or proper effect, or any other proper Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) it either floweth from the <hi>forme,</hi> or from the <hi>matter</hi> so formed; As for instance, capacity of Learning, or <hi>Risibility</hi> is in Man, as in the first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The former floweth from the <hi>Reasonable</hi> soule: the latter from the <hi>matter</hi> of a man so formed. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these are in man <hi>radicaliter</hi> or <hi>virtualiter,</hi> but only because they are in a man <hi>formally,</hi> and so either flow from the <hi>forme,</hi> or from the <hi>matter</hi> so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Take another Instance, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort. The People that have power to <hi>elect a King,</hi> though they have not <hi>formally</hi> kingly power, yet have they a <hi>formall Power,</hi> to submit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98349:78"/>
themselves to Kingly Power. And so haveing a formall Power to put one of the Relatives, they have an aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and <hi>Analogicall</hi> Power to put the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Correlative. For, <hi>Posito uno Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorum, Ponitur etiam &amp; alterum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that which is quoted by the Replyer from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker,</hi> in the last clause of the third Columne of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, I see not how it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me, or contradicteth any thing in the former Columnes. For I doe not make any first Subject of Church-Power, and yet others to share in that Power, but not by meanes of that. But as the <hi>keyes of the kingdome of heaven</hi> are diverse: So I see no Inconvenience, that the first Subjects to whom the severall keyes are committed, may be diverse also. Neither doth the letter of the Text seeme to me to gainesay that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. For though it speak, not to <hi>Them</hi> but to <hi>Thee;</hi> a Representing one state or Condition of men: yet say that one condition to be believers and take Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in a large sence, It comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98349:78"/>
all sorts of Professing Believers, whether Private members, or Elders, or Apostles, indeed all. But neither doe I see any convincing reason seeing <hi>Peter</hi> stood in a threefold Ecclesiasticall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (being both an Apostle, and an Elder, &amp; a Profest Believer) why Christ committing the keyes to him (saying to Thee will I give them) might not Intend to give all the keyes; and the severall sorts of them, according to the severall Relations he stood in.</p>
               <p>If it be said All that share in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to whom the keyes are Given (in these words, <hi>To Thee)</hi> they all share alike in the same <hi>equall Power</hi> of the keyes, because they have all the same Commission: I Answer it would indeed so follow, If there were no other <hi>severall Commissions,</hi> granted in Scripture else where, but only here; But cleare it is from other Scriptures, That Power of <hi>Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Preaching,</hi> and Administering the Sacraments, is Given only to Apostles, Elders, and such like officers: but Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98349:79"/>
of Priviledge and Judgment, is given all the Fraternity.</p>

                  <hi>Answer:</hi> In that Place of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> I only Assert and Prove, That a man of <hi>Sufficient Gifts</hi> chosen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Church, and Ordained by the Presbytery of his owne Church, wanteth nothing to the compleat Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his calling.

               <p>But when I say that in want of a Presbytery of their owne, they want a warrant to Repaire to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of another Church for his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I no where say, That the <hi>Officer</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:98349:81"/>
                  <hi>Elected,</hi> wanteth the complete Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his calling, for want of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hand, of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of another Church. And yet that had been requisite to make up a pretence of a Contradiction. The Replyer knoweth that a Church wanting a <hi>Presbytery</hi> of their owne to lay hands upon an Elect Officer in our Judgment, they may appoint some of the <hi>Elders</hi> and graver Members of their owne Body, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Defect of their owne <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi> which we Account sufficient to the completing of his calling in such a case.</p>

For it is against that which both the Reasons Plead, which I there Alleadged for that Purpose. But I no where dislike, That a Church wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Presbytery of their owne may

send for Elders of other Churches, to Assist them, and to Joyne with them in the Ordination of their Elect Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. When I say (in the <hi>Way)</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were ordained
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98349:82"/>
to the <hi>Apostolick</hi> office by Imposition of hands of some officers of the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> (Act. 13. 1, 2, 3.) It is not Disproved (by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker)</hi> saying that they had had their office before. For I noe where say, That ordination Giveth the office, but only Approveth it and Solemnely, (as it were) Installeth the elect officer into it, and sendeth him forth with a Blessing into the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it. Neither when he saith, That there is there no Ordination unto office at all, doth he contradict what I affirme, For his meaning is, to Deny it in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Rutherford's</hi> sence, who speaketh there of Ordination, as <hi>Giving the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> unto the office: which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> Disproveth, and therein I concurre with him. For it puts no New office upon them, but Bare witnesse to that calling, which the Holy Ghost had given them.</p>
               <p>When M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, The Officers of one Church did what was done in an ordinary way, He himselfe inferreth the consequence, <hi>Therefore it is no Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the Pastors of many Churches,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:98349:83"/>
                  <hi>what either they may or should doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Inferences which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cawdry</hi> gathereth, as from my Doctrine out of that Text, either will not hold, or not hurt our cause. For this Inference will not hold, <hi>That then the Officers of one Chuch may be ordained in another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For they were as much Officers of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as of any other Churches, It will only inferre, That they who are officers in many Churches, may be <hi>Ordained</hi> in any one of them.</p>
               <p>The other inference will in part follow That some of the Apostles (who were Officers in all Churches) may be <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> in a Particular Church, when the Holy Ghost calleth for it. For they Act now not in their own Name, or Power, but in the great Name, and Soveraigne Power of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is the Head of all Churhes.</p>
               <p>But what Prejudice is that to our cause? or wherein doth it contradict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Tenents?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Contradiction is made part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the concealment of Part of <hi>my</hi> words in the first Columne, and Partly out of the <hi>Addition</hi> of some words of his <hi>own</hi> in the second Columne. In the former Columne I say, If the <hi>whole Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery offend, or such a Part as will draw a Party, and a Faction in the Church with them, the readiest course then is,</hi> to bring the matter to a Synod where those words, <hi>such a Part as will draw a Party, or Faction in the Church with them,</hi> are given for the just Reason, why in such a case, the case of the offending <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> or other such Leading members
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98349:84"/>
in the Church should be brought to a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> before it be censured in the Church. But in the words recited in the latter <hi>Columne,</hi> I speak of the Congregation as Agreeing together, and both faithfull and willing to Proceed against <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Doctrine and Scandalous crimes in whomsoever. And then they need not Trouble the <hi>Synod</hi> to cleare the case, which is already cleare unto themselves, so that this Contradiction speaketh not <hi>ad Idem.</hi> The one <hi>Columne</hi> speaketh of a Church, Divided into <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> and their readiest course is to bring the matter to a Synod. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Columne</hi> speaketh of a Church both <hi>faithfull</hi> and willing to Proceede against offences with one accord. And then they have sufficient Power within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to judge that which is right, and to execute their Judgment. That which is Added of the <hi>Replyers own words,</hi> in the latter <hi>Columne,</hi> doth help not a little to make up an Appearance of the Contradiction. In the <hi>Keyes</hi> I had sayd (In the case above mentioned)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98349:84"/>
It is the <hi>readiest</hi> course to bring the matter to the Synod. In the <hi>Way</hi> he quoteth my words, as if I had said, <hi>There is a readier and nearer way.</hi> The Brethren may censure them all. If these words had been mine, there had been an <hi>Appearance of Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To say this is the <hi>readyest course,</hi> and yet to say, a Discrepant course is a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and nearer way,</hi> is (at least, <hi>verbo tenus)</hi> an apparent Contradiction. But the Truth is, Those words are <hi>none of mine,</hi> but the <hi>Replyers own.</hi> And so it will be an easy matter to make up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions <hi>(tot quot)</hi> if we may take leave, in one sentence to <hi>conceale</hi> Part of the words necessary to make up the sense, and in another sentence to <hi>Adde</hi> words of our owne.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This <hi>Contradiction</hi> laboureth of the same Disease (as the rest gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Doe) It speaketh not <hi>ad Idem.</hi> Such as require the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish Pure Religion, in Doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Government, and to Restraine the willfull opposers and Disturbers thereof by civill Punishments, They speak of <hi>Fundamentals in Religion,</hi> and such opinions as apparently tend to <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinisme,</hi> and licentious ungodlynesse, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>But the <hi>Toleration</hi> which they Allow
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98349:85"/>
and call for, is of such opinions, as neither subvert the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Religion, nor Practise of Piety. Both these may be maintained without the least shew of the face of Contradiction. Further I find this in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Bartlet,</hi> That himselfe and some others are not free, That Hereticks should be put to Death, in case they keep their errors to themselves, and doe not seek to seduce, and corrupt others. And though I grant, that such an Heretick after once or twice Admonition may be Rejected out of the Church (according to <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10, 11.) yet I doe not finde, that <hi>Moses</hi> condemned them unto <hi>Death,</hi> unlesse they became <hi>blasphemers,</hi> or <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,</hi> or <hi>Seducers to Idolatry.</hi> What Christ, and <hi>Moses</hi> doe both of them To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, the Servants of Christ need not to be ashamed of such Toleration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. This Contradiction (for ought I can Discerne) laboureth also <hi>Crimine falsi.</hi> For it seemeth a manifest untruth, what he speaketh in <hi>Columne</hi> 2. That the Brethren call for, or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate Toleration of all opinions, and

                  <hi>Answer:</hi> 1. Though my <hi>reverend Brethren</hi> crave leave to dissent from me in some expressions (which they may safely and freely do without my leave, for I professe my spirit subject to the Prophets:) yet about the <hi>Prophecying</hi> of private Brethren, I must againe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse as I did before, That I do not <hi>know,</hi> wherein I Dissent from them: unlesse it be that I Allow somewhat more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the <hi>Prophecying</hi> of private Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, then they do. The Allowance, which they give is with foure limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That is be done <hi>occasionally,</hi> and not in ordinary course.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By men of such Abilities, as are fit for office.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not assuming this to themselves, but as they are allowed, and designed to it by such, as have Power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That their Doctrine be subjected to the Teaching Elders of the Church. Graunt these limitations, and I never scrupled (to my remembrance) the liberty of Prophecying by private Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98349:88"/>
yea this liberty I should further graunt, that though the private Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be not furnished, with abilities fit for publick office, yet there may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to call them forth to exercise their gifts; as in the suddaine sicknesse or absence of the Minister, and other officers, why may not a private brother be called forth by the Church, or stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by the Spirit of God in himselfe to stand up, and with leave, instruct and exhort the Church, to make a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed use of such a suddaine stroke of Providence? Or what if a private Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of good credit in the church shall observe the Doctrine of the Ministers not so much válued as were meet? why may he not take occasion, to speak some words of encouragement, and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both to the <hi>Minister</hi> and to the <hi>Congregation? Jehosaphat's Nobles,</hi> though Princes, yet were but as <hi>Private Brethren</hi> in the Church, as bearing no Publick Church-office: yet they taught in the Cities of <hi>Juda,</hi> what Respect was due to the Ministery of the <hi>Levites,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98349:89"/>
whom they brought with them, when my beloved Brethren do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Assembly of Apostles, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Brethren <hi>Acts</hi> 15. To have been a formall Synod of Messengers sent out of a set and combined Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from neighbour churches, They do not herein Dissent from me. For the two Churches of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> were too farre remote to stand in a set, or combined Association, and therefore they may well deny it to be a <hi>Formall Synod,</hi> according to the Forme of Synods now in use in <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> Churches. But that that assembly had the true matter and forme of a just <hi>Synod,</hi> As I do believe it, so I do not see that my Brethren deny it. For the efficient cause of the <hi>Synod,</hi> the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> sent messengers: and the Church of Jerusalem (whose officers were sent unto) they freely gave them a meeting, and the Church with them. For the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Synod,</hi> they had the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,</hi> officers, and Brethren of both Churches met together in the Name of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98349:89"/>
Christ. It is not necessary to the being of a <hi>Synod</hi> the convention of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers and members of many Churches, The convention of two Churches (by themselves or messengers) may make a Synod. If the convention of one Church may make a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> why may not the convention of two churches make a <hi>Synod?</hi> The forme of a <hi>Synod</hi> they had, in Arguing, and disputing the case in hand, and freely giving in their <hi>Judgments</hi> from scripture grounds, and at length determining the whole cause with the Joynt consent of the Apostles, Elders, and Brethren, and Publishing the same by letters, and messengers to all the churches whom it concerned. The establishment of Peace and Truth in the churches, was the <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> as it ought to be the end of all. It is true, here was a consultation, in that the church of <hi>Antioch</hi> sent for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: and the Apostles and Elders met to consult, and consider of the matter. But consultation was but one Act of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, many other <hi>Formall</hi> Acts of a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98349:90"/>
                  <hi>Synod</hi> they put forth besides, which have been specified. The Apostles though they did put forth some Acts of their Apostolicall Power, in helping to cleare the Truth by explayning obscure Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in Ratifying the conclusion with some greater <hi>Plerophory</hi> of the mind of the Holy Ghost: yet in Putting such things to Argumentation, and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and allowing Elders and Brethren liberty of Putting in their votes, and determining, and publishing the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in the Name and with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of all, herein they Acted as <hi>Ordinary Elders</hi> and messengers of churches, might and ought to do.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Notes</hi> of about Ten <hi>Passages</hi> in the <hi>Way,</hi> wherein our Reverend Brethren in <hi>England</hi> (or some of them) say they could not fully close with them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Affixing an <hi>Asterisk</hi> to them, If I knew where, the Pinch of the Difficulty lay, I would Addresse my selfe, to give them fuller satisfaction either by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending to them, or giving them just Reason why I could not.
