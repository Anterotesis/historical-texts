         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Abraham had the same antiquitie that the

it is, that the word which he beleued was
the self same word which God pronu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced
vnto the woman in the Gardine, speaking
aganis the Serpent, saying: I shall put ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

<pb facs="tcp:7078:15"/>
In thy sead shall all the Natiounis of the

lyke as that it was the ground of the faith
of Adam, Abell, Seth, and of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

had continued amonges Godis elect from
the beginning. For trew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the word and promise which the faithfull
beleue. Is the word from the beginning,

faith that thereupon is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, not onlie

that it should preuale against Godis sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
treuth, and against his worshipping
prescriued in his word: then had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheit
Helias bene into a miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Who being but one man opponed
him self to the King, to his counsall, to his
Prophetes, Preastes and people, and in
plane wordes accused thame all of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie
from God, from his trew wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping,
and from the obedience of his
Law: and planely conuicted them to be
Idolatoures, becaus they had imbrased a
worshipping of God not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in his
word. It is a wonder that the King with
his Preastes and Propheites excepted not
against the Propheit and said: how can y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7078:17"/>
be Idolatrie, which our Kings and people
sence the dayis of Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue vsed and
manteyned for Gods trew seruice. Thow
art but one man, and we ar a multitude:
how can it be that we all should erre, and
that thow alone should please God. But
no such thing find we obiected vnto the
Propheit. But his requeast, being but one
man was obeyed: quhilk was, that God
him self should iudge betuix him and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
as that he did be fyre from the heauen.</p>
               <p>This priuiledge craue we to be granted to
vs of the Papistes in our days: to wit, that
they suffer God to Iudge betuix our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioun
and theirs: What he approueth,
let it be approuen of bothe, and what be
him is not commanded, nor be the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of Iesus Christ established and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
let it be of bothe reiected, and so
shall we suddanelie aggre. But if that they
will still cry, that we ar Schismatykes and
Apostates, becaus we refuse to defyle our
selues with their abhominationis: We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not but appeale from their corrupt sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to the vncorrupt Iudge, of whose
fauoures we are assuredly perswaded in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
point, becaus he hath said follow not the
multitude in euill doing: and becaus that
<pb facs="tcp:7078:17"/>
we find Kingis, Propheites &amp; people be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foir
vs, to haue done the self same thing
in their days (and therefore to haue bene
approued of God), whiche we in Godis
feare haue done in our dayis. To wit, they
haue distroyed the monumentis of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
&amp; haue repressed the same externally
be power and force, notwithstanding the
antiquitie thereof, &amp; that great multitude
adheared vnto it. And this muche for the
multitude, and that which the multitude
moste commonly beleueth. Now to the
further ressounis of the wryter.</p>
               <p>He first tauntis and mockis vs and our
Kirk, calling it your inuisible Kirk of
Scotland. Secundly he affirmeth, that the
Kirk whereof the Prophet speakes shalbe
manifest and visible through all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
And for his profe alledges y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Chap.
of the Prophet Isai. And last he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludes
in these wordes. Wherefore if ye can not
shaw in what place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, afoir thre
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth yeare, your Kirk was into: It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
of necessitie that it is no Kirk.</p>
               <p>To these heades we must answer in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
and first we will pray the wryter in
his nixt answer, to signifie vnto vs, why he
<pb facs="tcp:7078:18"/>
calleth the Kirk of Scotland inuisible: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the ground and the persones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
within the same ar subiect to the
senses of all those that list to looke vpone
them: yea, the doctrine taught vnto vs is
so patent, that the verray enemies them
selues ar not forbidden to heare and to
iudge of it. And finally the administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the Sacramentes within our Kirkis are
so p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>blict, that none iustly can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleane,
that they ar either debarred from hearing
or from sight. And therefore howsoeuer
it pleaseth the wryter to delite him self in
his owen vanitie, we feare not to affirme,
That the Kirk of god within Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this
day, is as visible, as euer it was in Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
after that Christ Iesus ascended to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes,
or as that it was visible in Samarea

                  </gap>he Euangell: Yea,
we will further affirme, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trew Kirk
of Iesus Christ is as visible, yea, &amp; as beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in all her proper ornamentes this
day, within the Realme of Scotland, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
she was in Corinthus, Galacia, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi
(yea or yet in Rome it self) what tyme
that any of the Apostles rewled them:
or that when they wer saluted be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
in his Epistles for Kirkis. And this
<pb facs="tcp:7078:18"/>
for the first head.</p>
               <p>The answer to the secund can not be so
short, for his assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aggreis so lytle with
the place of the Propheit, that we stand
greatly in dout whether that euer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of the Prophet. His assertion is this. Of
the Kirk whereof the Propheit speaketh,
It is said be him in the secund Chap. that
it shalbe manifest and visible through all

are these.</p>
               <p>It shalbe in the last dayes, that the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

montane of the Lord, to the hous of the
God of Iacob, and he will teache vs his
wayes, and we will walk in his pathes. For
the Law shall go furth of Syon, and the
word of the Lord from Ierusalem, and he
shall iudge among the Nationes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
many people. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In these wordes of the Prophet we find
no such thing as the Kirk shalbe manifest
and visible through all the worlde, We
<pb facs="tcp:7078:19"/>
acknawledge a promise of glade thinges
to cum to be ioyned to Ierusalem, &amp; vnto

that his wordes cut the throttes of

that then lyued. And least that Maister

without authoritie. We remit him to the

<pb facs="tcp:7078:31"/>
whose wrytinges if he shall diligentlie

from the day that ones the Popes wer de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cored

               <p>AGainst this exhortation wil we obiect
nothing. For our ernest desyre is that
men diligently considder what doctrine
they imbrase, what fundation and ground
<pb facs="tcp:7078:39"/>
their faith hes, and finally what way they
follow, thinking thereby to atteane to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

dampne, and euer haue dampned: But this
we feare not to affirme, as before we haue
written, that the doctrine of the Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

bene altogether corrupt: that their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which they call their Catholick faith, hes
no sure ground within the word of God:
And that the way which they for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moste

of perdition, to all suche as without trew
repentance departed this lyfe in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

not knowen. For her tentation was not in
the fleshe, nor for any thing that appertey

                  <p>For Sathan did continually buffette her, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
