            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173556:6"/>
altercations, or queſtions to be rayſed, which may nouriſh faction both in the Church and Common-wealth. We have therefore upon mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with the advice of ſo many of Our Biſhops as might conveniently be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, thought fit to make this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration following. That the Articles of the Church of England (which have been allowed and authorized heretofore, and which Our Clergie generally have ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto) do contain the true doctrine of the Church of England, agreeable to Gods word: which We do therefore ratifie and confirme, requiring all Our loving Subjects to continue in the uniform profeſsion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and prohibiting the leaſt difference from the ſaid Articles, which to that end We command to be new printed, &amp; this Our declaration to be publiſhed therewith.</p>
            <p>That We are ſupream Governour of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173556:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church of England: and that if any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ariſe about the externall policie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Injunctions, Canons,</hi> or other <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> whatſoever thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clergie in their Convocation is to order and ſettle them, having first obtained leave under Our broad Seal ſo to do: and We approving their ſaid Ordinances and Conſtitutions, providing that none be made contrary to the Laws and Customes of the Land.</p>
            <p>That out of Our Princely care, that the Churchmen may do the work which is proper unto them; the Biſhops and Clergie, from time to time in Convocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, upon their humble deſire ſhall have licence under Our broad Seal, to deliberate of, and to do all ſuch things, as being made plain by them, &amp; aſſented unto by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, ſhall concern the ſetled continuance of the doctrine &amp; diſcipline of the Church of England now eſtabliſhed;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173556:7"/>
from which We will not endure any vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or departing in the least degree.</p>
            <p>That for the preſent, though ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have been ill raiſed, yet We take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this, that all Clergie-men within Our Realm, have alwayes moſt willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the Articles eſtabliſhed, which is an argument to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that they all agree in the true uſuall literall meaning of the ſaid Articles, and that even in thoſe curious points in which the preſent differences lie, men of all ſorts take the Articles of the Church of England to be for them, which is an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t again, that none of them intend any deſertion of the Articles establiſhed.</p>
            <p>That therefore in theſe both curious and unhappy differences, which have for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeers, in different times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, exerciſed the Church of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> We will that all further curious ſearch be laid aſide, &amp; theſe diſputes ſhut up in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,

as they be generally ſet forth to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, in the holy Scriptures; and the generall meaning of the Articles of the Church of England according to them. And that no man hereafter ſhall either print or preach, to draw the Article aſide anyway, but ſhall ſubmit to it in the plain and full meaning thereof: And ſhall not put his own ſenſe or Comment to be the meaning of the Article, but ſhall take it in the literall and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſenſe.</p>
            <p>That if any publique Reader in either Our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, or any Head or Maſter of a Colledge, or any other perſon reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively in either of them, ſhall affix any new ſenſe to any Article, or ſhall publiquely read, determine, or hold any publique diſputation, or ſuffer any ſuch to be held either way, in either the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities or Colledges reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively; or if any Divine in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities ſhall preach or print any thing either way, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The Baptiſme of young children is in any wiſe to be retained in the Church, as moſt agreeable with the inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THe Supper of the Lord is not onely a ſigne of the love that Chriſtians ought to have among
<pb facs="tcp:173556:15"/>
themſelves one to another: but rather it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of our redemption by Chriſts death. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that to ſuch as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the ſame, the bread which we break, is a partaking of the body of Chriſt: and likewiſe the Cup of bleſſing is a partaking of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Tranſubſtantiation (or the change of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ: but it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the plain words of Scripture, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to many ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>The body of Chriſt is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Chriſt is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</p>
               <p>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not by Chriſts ordinance reſerved, carried about, lifted up, or worſhipped.</p>
