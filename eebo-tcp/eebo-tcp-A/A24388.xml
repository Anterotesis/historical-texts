            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A RELATION OF SEVERAL wonderful Storms, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere have been divers Strange and Wonderful Relations lately Publiſhed either with Licenſe or Allowance, of ſome Prodigious Accidents; and among the reſt, not long ſince, there was an Account, That at a Town in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> there fell ſuch a Tempeſt of <hi>Rain, Hail, Lightning,</hi> and <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> the like hath been ſeldom or never heard of in <hi>England:</hi> It began about Eleven a Clock in the Morning, the Sky being for a conſiderable time very Black and Dark; when on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there fell in great abundance an incredible Storm of Hail, which, by the aſſiſtance of a ſtrong Eaſt-wind, came down with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47899:3"/>
that fierceneſs, that the Hailſtones rebounded Three foot high from the Ground; after which followed a terrible ſhower of Rain, which ſeemed rather to fail by Pailfuls, and Diſhfuls, than in the common way; which ſo affrighted the Inhabitants, that they went out immediately into the Fields to ſave their Sheep, Lambs, and other ſmall Cattel, but they had much ado to return with the preſervation of their own Lives.</p>
            <p>BUT alas, This was but the Prologue or beginning of their ſucceeding ſorrow, for during this dreadful Storm of Hail and Rain, the Heavens ſent forth ſuch huge and frequent flaſhes of Fire, that notwithſtanding that deluge of VVater, which at that inſtant was falling from the Skyes, the Lightning took hold of ſome Houſes, but was happily quenched without doing any conſiderable dammage; but ſeveral Barns, notwithſtanding the utmoſt diligence of the Inhabitants, were burnt down to the Ground, and all contained in them conſumed to Aſhes; and one of them was burnt with ſo much violence and fury, that a Man who was Thraſhing therein, had much ado to make his eſcape, before the Barn was utterly ruined and deſtroyed;</p>
            <p>And among the reſt a Youth being overtaken in the Storm, endeavoured to ſhelter himſelf in a Windmil, but the illnatured Miller began to Swear and Curſe at him; asking him, If he was ſuch a Fool and Changling, to be afraid of a little Lightning and Thunder; the Boy had ſcarce time to Anſwer before he was ſtruck off the Stairs, &amp; the Miller was forced to go down, &amp; take him up half dead; But this unkind Miller had hardly recovered the Youth, e're he himſelf was ſtruck down with the Thunder, and taken up without any appearance of life for the preſent, though it is ſaid he afterward recovered.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe another Relation, That at a Town called <hi>Blois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> about one a Clock in the Morning, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazeing Tempeſt of Wind began with ſuch violence, as ſoon affrighted the moſt ſleepy from their repoſe; and in a ſhort time by its fury, beat, or blew down all the Body of the Church of Saint <hi>Soulucas,</hi> except the Belfry, and likewiſe half of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Church, and Two fair Houſes into the <hi>Highſtreet,</hi> the People whereof were glad to run into their Arched Cellars to ſave themſelves, which they happily did, though the Ruines fell
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47899:3"/>
upon, and round about the Arch, but the Rubbiſh being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they were afterward drawn out alive.</p>
            <p>This Tempeſt was accompanied with a moſt prodigious Hail, many Thouſand Stones being found as big as a Mans Fiſt, a thing ſo wonderful to relate, that had there not been ſufficient Eyewitneſſes, it would ſeem incredible; This unuſual Artillery of Heaven, did break all the Slates wherewith the Houſes are covered, and the Glaſs Windows all over the Town as if they had been beaten in a Mortar. Without the Town there were Eight whole Pariſhes utterly ruined by the Hail in ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manner, that it ſeemed as if no Corn had been ſown, or Vines planted there; ſo ſtrangely were all things batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down, and laid in a confuſed deſolation; There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Four other Pariſhes much endamaged, and Multitudes of Chimnies beaten down; ſo that the dammage by that, and the breaking of Windows and Tiles, was valued to be about Two Hundred Thouſand Crowns, and the harm abroad in Cornfields and Vineyards was invaluable.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of Judgment Gods Mercy is juſtly to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church in that Town was in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner preſerved, though it ſtood as much expoſed to the Weather as any Building in the Town; and though all round it the direful marks of the Tempeſt were ſadly Viſible, yet this Church remained entire; without ſo much as a Slate or any Glaſs broken, which was generally taken notice of as a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Protection of Providence.</p>
            <p>Another thing was that it pleaſed God neither Man; Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Child were kill'd in this dreadful Deſolation, one Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Reaſon whereof was, that it happened at ſuch a time of Night, when all People were in their Houſes, whereas had they been ſtirring abroad, tis very probable much miſchief had befallen them.</p>
            <p>There likewiſe happened a ſtrange Accident upon a Ship Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at Sea, which being Attacqued by a Tempeſt of Rain, Hail, Wind, Thunder, and Lightning, was in very great danger of being caſt away; but on a ſudden there brake ſo dreadful a Clap of Thunder into the Ship, that they all Imagined their Guns had Accidentally been Fired: and in a Moment their Main Maſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47899:4"/>
was Split aſſunder from bottom to top as you would peel a Ruſh, the Maintop Maſt was ſhivered into ſmall pieces, and the Pendent at the head of it was burned to Aſhes; it came with ſuch Violence that it beat down fourteen Men which were upon Deck, and had like to have hurl'd them into Sea; and thoſe that were between Decks were likewiſe thrown down; one of theſe poor men had the ill fortune to be hurt by it; Five of them lay for Dead a conſiderable time having no Symptoms of Life, for there could not the leaſt Breath or Pulſe be perceived in them, their Eyes and Teeth were Imovable, and yet they had no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wound, Bruiſe or Hurt about them, but they ſtunk ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly of Sulphur or Brimſtone, that it was hardly to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; they continued in this condition about half an Hour, but at laſt by Rubbing and Forcing open their Mouths, and powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Cordials down they were Recovered; but ſeemed much crazed in their Senſes, At the ſame time there were ſix others miſerably Burned, their Fleſh being Scorched and yet their Garments not Conſumed; nor ſo much as Singed as far as could be perceived, their Skin was much diſcoloured, and look't as if Burnt by a Coal.</p>
            <p>And upon Tueſday the eighteenth of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> there hapned a very ſtrange and prodigious Storm in and about <hi>London,</hi> of which we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give a brief and true Account.</p>
            <p>About two a Clock in the Morning there began a furious Storm of Thunder and Lightning ſo extream, the Heavens ſeem'd to be in a flame, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with very large Hail, and extraordinary violent and haſty Showrs of Rain: This continued for ſeveral Hours, but about Ten a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrange and unuſual darkneſs overſpread the Face of Heaven, and immediately after that fell ſuch a terrible ſtorm of Hail, as the like was hardly if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen in <hi>England</hi>; the Hailſtones were ſo very great, that ſome of them being meaſured were found to be four inches, others five, others ſix in Compaſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47899:4"/>
nay it is confidently reported that ſome were ſeven, eight and nine Inches about, this ſtorm bred a ſtrang conſternation in the Inhabitants, but it pleaſed God, that it continued not above a quarter of an hour, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it might have done much greater damage than it did; yet abundance of glaſs windows were broken and ſhatered to pieces, eſpecially thoſe called <hi>Sky Lights,</hi> which are ſo frequent ſince the Rebuilding the City: The Stones were of different ſhapes and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, and the Fancies of the People have likned them to divers things; they fell with ſuch violence that they cut the Faces of ſome, and the heads and hands of others who were abroad; ſome others ran into the ground in the fields above an Inch, and being taken out, they were found to be as big as Pullets Eggs, and ſome larger; ſeveral of them were round, others ſquare and flat with very ſharp Edges: The loſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by this terrible Storm is not yet to be reckoned up, eſpecially if it fell with ſuch Fury in the <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> as it did in the City; of which we much doubt we ſhall have a ſad and unwelcome Account.</p>
            <div type="account">
               <head>Now to refreſh our Reader be pleaſed to take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account.</head>
               <p>The Right Honourable Sr. <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> Lord May or of <hi>London,</hi> having been ſometime ſince made Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of the <hi>Orange</hi> Regiment in the room of Sr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Davis</hi> Deceaſed, This Evening <hi>May</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi> was the firſt time of his Lordſhips going out with his <hi>Company</hi>; and ſeveral eminent <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> being reſolved to ſhew his Lordſhip all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reſpect poſſible, came to wait upon his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47899:5"/>
Lordſhip as <hi>Voluntiers,</hi> which was performed in the following Order.</p>
               <p>Firſt his Lordſhip went before in his own Coach, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Diviſion of His own Company; then a Diviſion of the Blew Regiment in their Buff Coats and Feathers; after them ſeveral Diviſions of the White, Yellow, Green and Red Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments: all the Volunteers being either Officers in the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bands, or other Worthy Citizens.</p>
               <p>Thus they marched from <hi>Smithffeld</hi> in all manner of Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pomp to his Lordſhip's Houſe in the <hi>Old Jury</hi>; their number being in all near ſix hundred Men; after which they were treated by his Lordſhip at a Magnificent Entertainment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them in <hi>Grocers Hall,</hi> conſiſting of about an Hundred Diſhes of Meat: Where all things were managed with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and Gallantry, which is natural to that Worthy Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
