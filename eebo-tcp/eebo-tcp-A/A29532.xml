            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

publick handle the latter part
of it, I not knowing what <hi>providence</hi>
there might be in this <hi>Motion,</hi> nor yet
where to pitch upon a moro useful <hi>Subject,</hi>
undertook the whole <hi>Verse,</hi> which having
passed through in the audience of some of
you, I do now present to the view of you
all. Whereunto I have been induced, as
for the <hi>furtherance of your faith,</hi> by
pressing and directing that greatest of
Christian duties, your <hi>coming unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> so for the confirming and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing
of you in the truth against some
of those Errors of the Times, which having
unhappily prevailed in some other places,
begin also to creep in amongst you, I mean
those of the <hi>Universalists</hi> and <hi>Free-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40368:3"/>
(as they are vulgarly called.) Against
these (as I have heretofore, and that
(through Grace) not without some successe
done against some other) I have here (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a just occasion for it from the Text)
born witnesse. And to this I shall desire
you to hearken, that so you may not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away with this <hi>wind of Doctrine.</hi>
So I presume to call that Doctrine, which
is so much cried up this day by some (and
those not a few) who understand it not,
the <hi>Doctrine of Universal Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
A Doctrine at the first hearing very
plausible to vulgar apprehensions (none
more) whilest it pretendeth to <hi>elevate,</hi>
to lift up and magnifie the <hi>Grace of God,</hi>
and <hi>Merit of Christ,</hi> by such a boundlesse
enlarging of them. But upon stricter <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
it will be found guilty of what it is
here charged with, of <hi>Elevating</hi> this
<hi>Grace,</hi>

just grounds) let me perswade you to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
how you hearken to it, or give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to those that bring it, Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for you, or any other (what is here
<pb facs="tcp:40368:3"/>
positively and clearly held forth in this
Text) that <hi>Whosoever they are that
come unto Jesus Christ</hi> (receiving him
as their Saviour and Lord) <hi>they shall be
received by him,</hi> obtaining from him
that great benefit of his death? This do ye
build your souls upon, putting them upon this
way, and then my soul for yours, they shall
not miscarry. In the mean time, as for
any other latitude, or extent of the <hi>Fathers</hi>

in what way, reaching to all, or confined
only to a select company, leave it (as safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you may) to the more acute disquisition
of the <hi>Schools,</hi> to which there is indulged
a liberty of disputing, what being not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
for vulgar heads to apprehend, is not so
safe for them to determine. Blessed be God,
you have so much of Christ, and of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
purpose towards all repenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
sinners in and through him clearly,
and convincingly held forth unto you, as that
you shall not need to trouble your heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
any such dubious intricacies, as are
by some (who, it may be, would seem to be
somebody) presented to you, and with some
colour of zeal obtruded upon you under the
notion of important truths. Let it be my
desire and earnest request to you, that you
<pb facs="tcp:40368:4"/>
would make much of <hi>old truths,</hi> those
Doctrines, which you have received, not
lightly and readily receding from any of

acknowledging him to be what he was, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that they had seen him and his
works, been eye-witnesses of the admirable
effects of his divine power, as in that miracle
which a little before he had wrought, the
multiplying of <hi>loaves</hi> and <hi>fishes,</hi> so in many
other. This he chargeth upon them in the
verse next before the Text, <hi>v. 36. [But I said
unto you, that ye also have seen me, and believe
not.]</hi> But how came this to pass, that they
should be so blind, so stupid, as seeing what
they did, yet not to acknowledge him to be
what he was, not to believe on him? For
this we have a <hi>Reason</hi> subjoyned in the words

number of those that were <hi>given</hi> to him by

but also of their <hi>Soules,</hi> receiving and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him; which if they had done, he would
have been as ready to do the like to them.

<hi>Links of that Golden Chain</hi> (as our Mr. <hi>Perinks</hi>

The First whereof is <hi>Gods gracious Donation,</hi>
his giving some amongst the sons of men to his

The Second, <hi>Mans effectual vocation,</hi> his
bringing home to Christ <hi>[All that the Father

all things with his <hi>Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, he had so, as <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Upon this
account we find them making claim to an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
interest in whatever his <hi>Father</hi> had,
<hi>Iohn 16. 15. All things that the Father hath
are mine.</hi> Christ being the Eternal Son of
God by generation, he communicateth with
him, as in his <hi>Essence,</hi> so in all his <hi>Properties,</hi>
and <hi>Interests. All thine are mine, and mine
are thine</hi> (saith he to his Father) <hi>Iohn 17. 10.</hi>
But here in the Text we are to look upon him
as <hi>Mediator,</hi> as <hi>God-Man.</hi> And so we shall
find him in the capacity of a <hi>Receiver;</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
whatever he hath from his Father. Thus
he is said to have received <hi>life</hi> from him, <hi>Ioh.
5. 26. As the Father hath life in himself, so
hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</hi>
that is, to be the fountain and well-spring of
eternal life. And in like manner he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> from him. <hi>The
Father hath given him authority to execute
judgment, because he is the Son of man.</hi> (So
it there followeth in the next verse) <hi>v. 27.</hi> As
the <hi>Son of God</hi> he hath Authoritie in and of
himself; but as the <hi>son of man</hi> he receiveth it
from his Father. The <hi>power</hi> which he hath as
<hi>Mediator,</hi> is a delegated power, given to
him. <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and

<hi>Thou hast given him power over all flesh,
John 17. 2.</hi> And thus giving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ower and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

may exercise that Authority. <hi>All that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
giveth me</hi> (saith the Text.) So then there
are some who are given by God the Father
unto his Son Christ as <hi>Mediator.</hi>

               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Question still runs on;<note place="margin">How only some given to him.</note> what,

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, in a general way they are so, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him as to a <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

all things into his hand:</hi> (So <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
tells the <hi>Iewes</hi>) John 3. 35. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

Thus, as all other creatures, so all the sons of
men are given unto him. But there are some
among them who are given to him in a more

that they may be to him <gap reason="foreign">

to him not only as a <hi>Soveraign,</hi> but a <hi>Saviour,</hi>
not only to be <hi>governed,</hi> but <hi>saved</hi> by him.
Thus are all, and only Gods <hi>Elect</hi> given unto

others to the Law, to receive the just
reward of their Rebellion. And who shall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40368:7"/>
herein charge him with injustice? Even such is
Gods dealing with the sons of men in respect
of their eternal estates. They being all involved
in the transgression of their first Parent, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in him, and so alike guilty of death, he
leaveth some to receive their just demerits,
whilest he maketh others the objects, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> but also of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi>
which he hath done meerly out of his

shew mercy, and I will have compassion on whom
I will have compassion.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> citeth that of
<hi>Moses, Exo. 33. 19. Rom. 9. 15.</hi> Thus hath God
an absolute power and liberty to dispose of all
the sons of men, as to their eternal estates,
looking upon them in that <hi>corrupt mass,</hi> that
lapsed condition.</p>
            <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Before the fall.</note> shall we rise higher, and with the
<hi>Supralapsarians</hi> (as some at this day, from
their difference in judgment from others about
this point, are called) and look upon man in
his <hi>pure naturals,</hi> as not yet fallen, meerly as
Gods creature, simply and absolutely conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
yet here shall we find that which will
sufficiently vindicate God in his proceedings
and dealings with him. It was the plea of that
<hi>Housholder</hi> in the Gospel, when some of his
labourers whom he had hired into his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
quarrelled with him about the unequal
distribution of their wages, <hi>What</hi> (saith he)
<hi>is it not lawful for me to do what I will with

               </gap>. So do men look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which they have a <hi>Property</hi> in, they
make account they have power and liberty to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40368:8"/>
dispose of it as it pleaseth them. And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they justly might, were that property

in whatever they enjoy.) Now such is the
Interest which God hath with all the sons of
men, who being his <hi>Creatures, live and move,
and have their being in and from him,</hi> he hath
an <hi>absolute property</hi> in them; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an <hi>absolute power</hi> over them, so as he may
dispose of them, not only in regard of their
<hi>temporal,</hi> but <hi>eternal</hi> estates, as it pleaseth him.
And out of this <hi>plenitude of power</hi> it is, that
he <hi>electeth</hi> some, whilest he <hi>rejecteth</hi> others;

God giveth his elect unto Christ, that he may

God hath (say they) made choise of the <hi>way</hi>

clearly intimating a <hi>Personal Election,</hi> a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Hence was it that some of these <hi>Capernaites,</hi>
some among the rest, did not believe on him,
as some others did, because they were not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

So again <hi>Arminians</hi> would have it;<note place="margin">Nor simply conditional.</note>
that men should be Elected upon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it resteth in their power to null and make void

Telling us that those whom God

them unto him, not if they shall believe

            <p>4. Again, Election is not only to the <hi>End,</hi> but
also to the <hi>Meanes.</hi> God electing his people

will not rightly and orderly follow.</p>
            <p>In the second place, make we the like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
touching the Doctrine of <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

So indeed some, and not a few, at
this day would have it, who cry up this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as if it were the very Basis and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
of all Religion, That <hi>Christ died, and
died alike for all.</hi> But how will this comply
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40368:12"/>
and agree with this Text? where our Saviour
speaketh of a certain select company, which
were given to him by his Father. <hi>All that the
Father giveth me;</hi>] clearly intimating that
there were some among mankind whom God
having a gracious purpose towards, gave them
to his Son Christ, that he should undertake
for them, do what he did for them, that he
should be a surety for them, making satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for them, redeeming them. Such was
the <hi>Fathers intention,</hi> his <hi>will;</hi> not that Christ
should <hi>die for all;</hi> If so, he would have <hi>given
all</hi> to him, but for some. And this <hi>will</hi> Christ
came to perform. <hi>In the volume of thy Book
it is written of me, Loe, I come to do thy will O
God,</hi> Heb. 10. 7. <hi>I came down from heaven not
to do mine own will, but the will of him that
sent me</hi> (saith he in the verse after the Text,
<hi>v 38.</hi>) That is, to redeem and save those, all
those, and only those, whom God my Father
hath given me. Thus it is (as Divines justly
determine it) <hi>The work of the Son in Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
doth not exceed the work of the Father in
Election.</hi> Such is the order of <hi>working</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Persons in the Trinity, as of <hi>being;</hi>
the <hi>Son being</hi> from the <hi>Father, worketh</hi> from
him. This he doth as the <hi>Son of God;</hi> And
the like he doth as the <hi>Son of man,</hi> as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.
His work was to do his Fathers work.
<hi>I have finished the work which thou gavest me
to do</hi> (saith he to his Father) <hi>Ioh. 4. 17.</hi> Now
what that work was we have seen, <hi>viz.</hi> he had
imployed himself for the good and benefit of
those whom his Father had given him, for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40368:12"/>
whom he was now ready to lay down his
life. So then, <hi>Redemption</hi> is not <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for those Texts which seem to speak it
so,<note place="margin">Texts seeming to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal</hi> how to be understood</note> they admit of a fair construction consistent
with this truth. As that of the Apostle, <hi>1 Tim.
2. 6.</hi> where it is said, that <hi>Christ gave himself
a Ransom for all.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, for this
<hi>[All]</hi> here in the Text, All those whom his
Father had given him; who are elsewhere
called <hi>many, Mat. 20. 28. The Son of man
came to give his life a ransom for many;</hi> viz.
his Elect: who are also elsewhere called a
<hi>world, 2</hi> Cor. 5. 19. <hi>God was in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
the world unto himself;</hi> that is, the
world of his Elect, made up of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
And so look we upon the Text, which
of all other (as our last Translation renders
it) seemeth to speak most fully for the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
<hi>Heb. 2. 9.</hi> where it is said of Christ, that
<hi>he by the grace of God tasted death for every man.

               </gap>,
this <hi>All</hi> herein the Text, All and every one
whom his Father had bestowed upon him (as
<hi>Diodate</hi> rightly expounds it.) Thus doth this
word <hi>[All]</hi> here, as sometimes elsewhere, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the universality, not of <hi>Mankind,</hi> but of
<hi>Gods Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For them it was,<note place="margin">Christ died <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tentionally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> and only for them that
Christ intentionally died. <hi>I lay down my life
for my sheep,</hi> saith the obvious Text, <hi>Ioh. 10.
15.</hi> Which (whatever evasions are sought
out to elude it) speaks this truth so clearly, so
fully, as putteth it beyond contradiction,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40368:13"/>
whilest it restraineth the Intent on of Christ,
in laying down his life, unto a select company,
his <hi>sheep,</hi> viz. those that were given him by his
Father.</p>
            <p>Which truth being thus bottomed, I desire
you to take notice of, that you may not be
carried away with that <hi>wind of Doctrine,</hi> that
plausible error which is so taking with many at
this day, who cry up the Doctrine of <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Redemption</hi> as the most comfortable truth,
and glorious Doctrine that can be held forth,
tending highly (as they apprehend) to the
magnifying of the grace and mercy of God,
and merit of Christ, which are thus extended
unto all. But herein how are they mistaken?
In thus <hi>extending</hi> this grace, how do they <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate</hi>
it?<note place="margin">Grace extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it.</note> Of all Doctrines I know none that
in truth more <hi>derogates</hi> from this <hi>grace of God
in Christ,</hi> than this; whilest it asserts alike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to all, that all being alike given to
Christ by his Father, are alike owned by him;
the Redemption and Salvation of all alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by both, of <hi>Esau</hi> as of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
as of <hi>Peter,</hi> so as the one is not more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This (whatever any may conceive)
is in truth no small derogation from, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation
of this grace, which being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
(as it ought to be) to a narrower chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
riseth higher. Being restrained only to a
certain number, a small number (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively)
of Gods Elect, it is thereby rendred the
more glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:40368:13"/>
And so let it be in the eyes of all the Lords
people,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> to whom God hath evidenced and
made known this his gracious purpose,<note place="margin">The grace of Election glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace.</note> that
they are in the number of those whom he hath
thus given to his Son Christ, <hi>Let them give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him the glory of this his Grace, Free Grace.</hi>
Such it was, as I have shewen you: All men
being alike in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the same state and
condition by nature, all alike <hi>children of wrath,</hi>
that God should single out some, some few,
to make them objects of his grace, ingrafting
them into another stock, the stock of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Adam,</hi> giving them unto his Son <hi>Christ,</hi>
to be reconciled, redeemed, and saved by him,
whilest he passed by others, the greatest part,
leaving them to themselves, to work out their
own everlasting condemnation, and to receive
the just reward of their demerits; this he did
meerly out of his own good pleasure, his free
grace, there being no other motive out of
himself that might induce him to it: Let him
then have the glory of it from all those who
apprehend their interest in it. Let them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the <hi>freenesse.</hi> And as the freeness,
so the <hi>Greatnesse</hi> of it, admiring and adoring
it, blessing and magnifying God for it. <hi>Blessed
be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
in heavenly places</hi> (or <hi>things) in Christ; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he hath chosen us in him,</hi> Eph. 1. 3, 4.
Indeavouring to express their thankfulness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, by walking answerably thereunto,
living to the praise and glory of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</hi> This is that which the Apostle
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40368:14"/>
presseth upon his <hi>Corinthians, 1</hi> Cor. 6. 19, 20
<hi>Ye are not your own,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore glorifie God
in your body, and in your spirit, which are Gods.</hi>
And so let me press it upon you all you, who
lay any claim to an interest in this blessed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
of being thus <hi>given to Christ.</hi> Know
you now that ye are no longer your own, at
your own dispose, so as to serve what Masters
you please; No, you are <hi>Christs.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> tells
those his <hi>Corinthians, 1</hi> Cor. 3. 23. <hi>Ye are
Christs.</hi> And so are all believers; and that by a
double right, as of <hi>purchase</hi> (of which he
there speaketh in that former Text, <hi>Ye are
bought with a price,</hi> the blood of Christ) so
of <hi>Donation,</hi> being given unto him by God
his Father. And being thus his, now <hi>live</hi> to
him. <hi>None of us liveth to himself, and no man
dieth to himself</hi> (saith the same Apostle, <hi>Rom.
14. 7, 8.</hi> speaking <hi>de jure,</hi> what Christians
ought to do;) <hi>For whether we live we live unto
the Lord, or whether we die we die unto the Lord.</hi>
And O that all of us may thus live and thus
die; not to our selves, but to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
shewing our selves his loyal subjects, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
servants in our lives, seeking his honour
and glory, and then yielding up our selves unto
him in our death, being ready to die for him,
if he should call us to that service. This let
all of us do who expect any benefit by him,
and that, as upon the account of what Christ
himself hath done for us, in <hi>redeeming</hi> us, so
of what <hi>God the Father</hi> hath done for us, in
<hi>giving</hi> us unto him. Thus I have done with
the first of these <hi>Propositions,</hi> which holdeth

               <hi>Here is
the second</hi> Proposition, <hi>which sets forth unto
us</hi> Mans effectual Vocation <hi>following upon
Gods</hi> Election, <hi>as an undoubted consequent of
it. So the Apostle sets it forth in that known
Text,</hi> Rom. 8. 30. Whom he did predestinate,
them also he called. <hi>Which in effect speaketh
the same thing with this of our Saviour here</hi>
[All that the Father giveth me shall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How come unto him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For the explicating of the Phrase, we

            </p>
            <p>1. There is an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>formal coming</hi>
unto Christ, which is common to all that make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
a profession of his name.<note place="margin">Outward and formal.</note> Thus do <hi>Hypocrites</hi>
and <hi>formal Professors</hi> come unto him, who
being led and drawn by some sinister respects,
hold forth this profession. Thus did these
<hi>Capernaites</hi> here come unto Christ, they flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, and followed after him. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was it? Not out of any true respect they
had to his <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but for some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
advantage which they expected from
him, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might be fed by him. So
he himself, who knew their thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40368:15"/>
chargeth it upon them, <hi>v. 26.</hi> of this
Chapter <hi>[Ye seek me not because ye saw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but because ye did eat of the loaves.]</hi> It
was not his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>works,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
but their own bellies. And in such a
way there are many that <hi>come</hi> unto Christ, who
were never <hi>given</hi> to him by his Father; even
all <hi>Carnal Gospellers,</hi> who profest themselves
the followers of Jesus Christ, take upon them
the profession of his name, but it is not ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of any true inward respects which they have
unto him, but out of some by and sinister ends
for their own <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Profit,</hi> or for <hi>fashion</hi>-sake.
Such <hi>followers</hi> Christ had many in the
dayes of his flesh. And many such he hath
wherever he cometh, wherever his Gospel
is preached. But let we these go as they come;
not owned by God before they come, nor any
more owned for this their coming.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In the second place there is a coming to
Christ, which is <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Real.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inward and Real.</note> When
men come to him <hi>non tantùm pedibus, sed &amp;

soules, out of an inward respect and entire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which they bear unto him. Thus did
some of his followers, his <hi>Disciples,</hi> at this

               <hi>Believe on me.</hi> So the 35th verse explaines it.
<hi>He that cometh unto me shall never hunger,<note place="margin">Coming to Christ, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him.</note> and

where the latter word is <hi>Exegetical</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository
to the former. To <hi>come</hi> unto Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is to <hi>believe</hi> on him. Such is <hi>Faith;</hi> as it is
the <hi>Eye,</hi> and <hi>Hand,</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> so also the
<hi>Foot</hi> of the Soul. As the <hi>Eye,</hi> whereby the
soul beholdeth Christ, looketh up unto him,
as they did to their <hi>Brazen Serpent;</hi> and the
<hi>Hand,</hi> whereby it taketh hold of him; and
the <hi>Mouth,</hi> whereby it feedeth on him, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his flesh, and drinketh his blood; so the
<hi>Foot,</hi> whereby it cometh unto him, cometh
to him as to a <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> expecting
salvation only by and through him, desiring
to have Union and Communion with him.
This it is to <hi>believe</hi> on Christ, and this it is to
<hi>come</hi> unto him.</p>
            <p>A Metaphorical expression,<note place="margin">Faith, the coming of the soul unto Christ.</note> fitly setting forth
the nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> saving, justifying Faith.
Which is (as I said) <hi>A coming of the soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ.</hi> Even as those Patients of his of
whom we read in the Gospel, feeling their
own infirmities, and hearing of his fame, and
expecting to partake of the like benefit from
him that others had done, they come unto him,
casting themselves down at his feet, imploring
his aid, some of them touching him, as that
<hi>Haemorrhoisse,</hi> that woman with the bloody
issue is said to have done, who coming behind
him touched the hem of his garment (which
she did, as with her <hi>finger,</hi> so with her <hi>faith</hi>)

call all those whom he hath predestinated,

came to seek. And being in Heaven, he hath
now an eye to them, such among them as are

them to himself. This doth <hi>God the Father,</hi>
(as you have heard.) And thus also doth
<hi>Christ. When I am lift up</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will
draw all men unto me,</hi> John 12. 32. Christ
being lift up, first upon the <hi>Crosse,</hi> then upon

of the Gospel, and withall sending forth
his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which accompanying the Word,
maketh it effectual. Thus is <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> as

<hi>Quum dicit venire quicquid datur, inde colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus

it, that God foreseeing who they are that will

it otherwise, making their coming to Christ
not the <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>cause</hi> of Gods <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

               <hi>Obj. 1.</hi> Is it so that All and Only they shall
come unto Christ, whom God his Father hath
given to him? Doth not this then excuse those
who do not come unto him?<note place="margin">No excuse for unbelievers.</note> May not they
justly take up this for their plea, that they
were never given to him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I find divers Answers return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as by <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> (who moveth this
doubt) so by some others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Tolet An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Text.</note> which I shall not
trouble you with. In brief (for I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to inlarge upon any of these Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies)
let it suffice. This can be no just plea
for those who shall take it up and make use of
it, in as what herein they do, they
do it <hi>willingly.</hi> Their rejecting and refusing of
Christ being offered and tendered unto them, is
in them a <hi>voluntary act,</hi> whereunto they are
no wayes compelled, and so renders them
without excuse. Neither is Gods <hi>Decree of
Reprobation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reprobation not the cause of infidelity.</note> his not giving them to Christ,
properly the <hi>Cause</hi> of this Infidelity and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
in them. True it is, it is an <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
to it, but not properly the <hi>Cause</hi> of it.
That instance, which I find made use of by
some in this case, illustrates it well. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the night-season, is an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi>
to, but not the proper <hi>Cause</hi> of the
freezing of the water, which cometh from
the coldness of the Air. Even so is it here.
Gods <hi>Decree of Reprobation</hi> (as it is called)
his not giving some men to Christ, it is <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>
to their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> but not properly the
<hi>Cause</hi> of it, which is their own <hi>Corruption.</hi>
Their not coming unto Christ, to believe on
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40368:22"/>
him, is indeed a <hi>Consequent</hi> of Gods <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>election,</hi>
his not giving them unto him, but
not properly the <hi>effect</hi> of it. So as this is no
excuse for them, who in refusing of Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to them, do it voluntarily, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But (in the second place) Is not this
a dangerous Doctrine,<note place="margin">No ground for security and carelesness.</note> tending to make men
careless and regardless of their spiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states?
If it be so that all that are given to
Christ shall certainly come to him, all that are
within the compass of Gods Election shall be
made partakers of such an effectual vocation,
why then should any trouble themselves about
this? why may they not take their course,
and live as they list? If they be in the number
of those that are given to Christ, If they do
belong to Gods Election; they shall come to
him, they shall be brought to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A <hi>desperate Inference,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A desperate inference.</note> speaking ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and horror to all those who shall dare to
take it up, and make such use of it. Of all
signes and evidences of a man that is not given
unto Christ, that is not within the compass of
Gods Election, I do not know a more fearful
one than this, when any one shall thus <hi>turn
this grace of God into wantonnesse.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed how you give way to such
wretched reasonings, how you give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to any such a thought. Taking notice
that <hi>God doth not bring men to Christ against
their wills.</hi> And they who are not willing to
come unto him when he is offered and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, what know they whether ever
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40368:23"/>
they shall have a second invitation? Just is it
with God to withhold his grace from those
who thus reject it, and to harden their hearts
confirming them in their infidelity, who have
first hardened their own hearts against the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of grace and mercy in Christ. This is
that which our Evangelist St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> John 12. 37. <hi>Though Christ had done
so many miracles before them, yet they believed
not on him.</hi> And why not? how came they
to be so stupid? The reason is rendered, <hi>v. 39,
40. Therefore they could not believe, because
Isaias said, He hath blinded their eyes, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. They had first wilfully
shut their own eyes against the light of the
Gospel, maliciously withstanding and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ. And thereupon God in his most
just and righteous judgment giveth them over
to a reprobate sense, taking from them those
abilities which they had of believing unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
O take heed that the like do not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to any of you! which you may justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
shall you dare upon this, or any other
pretence whatever, to reject and refuse the
gracious offers of Christ tendred to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. 3.</hi> But (in the third place) may not
this Doctrine minister matter of despair to
some drooping spirits,<note place="margin">No ground of Despair.</note> who may thus reason
against themselves. If only they shall come
unto Christ who are given to him by God the
Father, then with what confidence can they
come to him, not knowing whether they be
of that number, which they fear they are not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and if so, then all their attempts and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40368:23"/>
this way will be to no purpose. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they fear that they shall never come to
him, to receive any benefit by him and from
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For Answer to this,<note place="margin">A wrong way of. reasoning to begin with Gods decrees.</note> know we that
this is a wrong way of reasoning, to begin
with Gods <hi>decrees,</hi> which being secret to us,
and hidden from us, until God shall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to make them known in and by the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

no wayes profit or advantage any by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

And to this command we have a gracious <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this an Answer is soon returned
by consulting the verse there next following,
which giveth us an account of the ground of
this his ejection. <hi>For many are called, but few
are chosen,</hi> v. 14. Many <hi>called</hi> outwardly to
an outward visible communion with Christ,
who are not truly given to him, are not in the
number of Gods Elect. And in this number
was this <hi>guest,</hi> who here crowded in for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
sake, a <hi>hypocrite</hi> joyning himself to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40368:29"/>
visible Church, not being that in truth which
he made profession of. So much we may learn
from the 11th verse, which informs us that he
<hi>had not on the wedding garment;</hi> he was one
that was not regenerated, one that had not put
on Christ by faith. And therefore no wonder
that he was cast out. So shall all <hi>Hypocrites</hi> be
sooner or later. But so shall not they who
come unto Christ in sincerity. So coming to
him he will receive them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. And receiving them (in the second place)
he will <hi>retain</hi> them.<note place="margin">Christ receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those that come to him retaines them with him.</note> So much also is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

and continued communion with them.<note place="margin">Non solum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manter ad se venientes susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, sed suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Having

Herein (saith <hi>Musculus</hi>) doth this <hi>our King</hi>
differ from other <hi>Kings and Princes,</hi> who are
often inconstant in their affections, loving to
day, loathing to morrow. What more common
with them than to cast their favourites out of
favour? But so will not the Lord <hi>Christ</hi> do by
his favourites. Those whom he once affecteth,
he never rejecteth. <hi>Having loved his own which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40368:29"/>
were in the world, he loved them unto the end</hi> (saith
our Eavngelist) <hi>Ioh. 13. 1.</hi> Not only his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
but all his <hi>Elect</hi> (who are there called <hi>his
own,</hi> in as much as they were given to him by
his Father) having set a peculiar affection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, he continued it to them <hi>unto the end,</hi>
the end of his life, expressing it, as by taking
care of them, keeping them, <hi>Whilest I was with
them in the world, I kept them in thy Name;
Those that thou gavest me I have kept,</hi> John 17.
12. so by dying for them. And like affection
doth he still bear to all those, who being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him, come to him, believe on him. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them once, he loveth to the end, to the
end of their lives, and to eternity; once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
them, he will never <hi>cast them out</hi> of his
affection. Thus you see that it is so. <hi>Those that
come unto Iesus Christ he will not cast them out;</hi>
he will both receive, and retain them as his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> And why will he do so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For this take two or three Reasons,
or Grounds.</p>
            <p>1. This is his <hi>Fathers will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas. 1.</hi> This is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will.</note> that he should
thus receive those whom he giveth unto him.
<hi>This is the Fathers will which hath sent me, that
of all that he hath given me I should lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
(v. 39. of this Chapter. Now with this
<hi>will</hi> doth Christ perfectly and exactly comply.
<hi>I came down from heaven, not to do mine own
will, but the will of him that sent me,</hi> v. 38.
And hereupon it is, that he so readily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
embraceth all those who being thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him by his Father, come unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40368:30"/>
2. As this is his Fathers will, so his <hi>own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
inclineth him to it.<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> He being a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
a merciful,<note place="margin">Christs cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him hereunto.</note> a tender-hearted Saviour, he
pitieth the condition of poor perishing sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
When he was here upon earth, the story
tells us, how <hi>when he beheld the City (of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem)
he wept over it,</hi> Luke 19. 41. Taking
notice of the sad condition of it, what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
judgment hung over the head of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
his heart melted into tears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And with such
an eye of tender pity and compassion doth he
look upon poor sinners lying in their natural
estate, and therupon he readily receiveth those
that come to him, accepting the least beginnings
of faith. This is that which the Prophet <hi>Isai</hi>
fore told of him, <hi>Isa. 42. 3. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ised reed shall
he not break,</hi> and <hi>smoking flax shal he not quench.</hi>
Such is the clemency of Jesus Christ in dealing
with poor sinners, that where he seeth any
good desires, any beginnigs of grace, though
never so weak and slender, he is ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them. Being herein like that <hi>Roman
Emperour,</hi> of whom it is reported, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
came to him, he never sent them away
discontented. Thus whoever they are that
come unto Jesus Christ, come unto him in
sincerity, such is his <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mency,</hi> his <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
he will <hi>in no wise cast them out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Which if he should do in the third
place) it would be cross to the <hi>end of his
coming into the world,</hi>

               <note place="margin">To reject those that come, were cross to the end of his coming.</note> which was to <hi>seek and

Rom. 10. 14. A necessary preparation for

who, and what he was, and is, what he hath

made <hi>Peter</hi> so adventurous to come unto his

Now, this word every poor sinner which is

do you. Hearing this word of command

Remember that Proclamation forenamed;

no better welcome than what <hi>Simon

(saith he) <hi>Acts 8. 20.</hi> Would you be welcome

            <p>5. And thus making towards him then (in

or yet rigour? That wicked men are
excluded and cast out (as at that day they
shall be) they can charge it upon none but
themselves. Not upon Christ. It was not he
that first rejected them, he offered himself to
them, and was ready to receive them upon
their coming to him. That they are cast out
they may thank themselves. Such was their
stubbornness, they would not come when they
might; and therefore their exclusion is just.
<hi>Thy destruction is of thy self</hi> (saith the Lord

rejected the Lord Christ here, would not

therefore he hath also rejected you. Here is

of you, and whoever they are that profess the

Let us <hi>in no wise cast them out;</hi> but let them

No, their desire hath been, and is, that all

to his <hi>Table,</hi> to have Communion with him
in this Ordinance. Only they desire they
should come to it in an orderly way, not so as
to make a gap for others to break in upon it
who have no right to it. So as if any so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

it upon themselves, not us, who desiring to
