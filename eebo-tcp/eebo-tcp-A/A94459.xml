            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat by ſad experience we doe daily find the Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Deanes</hi> and <hi>Arch-Deacons,</hi> with their <hi>Courts, Iuriſd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctions,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> by them and their inferiour Officers, to be very dangerous both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> to be the occaſions of manifold <hi>Greevances</hi> unto his Majeſties Subjects, in their Conſciences, Liberties, and Eſtates, and likely to be fatall unto us in the continuance thereof, the dangerous effects of which Lordly power in them have often appeared in theſe particulars following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They doe (with a hard hand) over-rule all other Miniſters, ſubjecting them to their cruell Authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They doe ſuſpend and deprive many godly, Religions and painfull Miniſters, upon ſleight, and upon no grounds; whileſt in the meane time few of them preach the Word of God themſelves, and that but ſeldome, but they doe reſtraine the painfull preaching of others, both for Lectures, and for Afternoone Sermons on the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They doe countenance, and have of late encouraged <hi>Papiſt Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> bookes and perſons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They hinder good and godly bookes, yet they doe lycenſe to be publiſhed many Popiſh and Arminian and other dangerous Bookes and Tenents.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They have deformed our Churches with <hi>Popiſh Pictures,</hi> and ſeated them with <hi>Romiſh</hi> Altars.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They have of late extolled and commended much the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> denying the Pope to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, affirming the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be a true Church in <hi>Fundamentals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. They have practiſed and enforced antiquated and obſolete <hi>Ceremonies, as ſtanding at all Hymns,</hi> and at <hi>Gloriapatri,</hi> turning to the Eaſt at ſeverall parts of the <hi>Divine Service, Bowing to the Altar, which they terme the place of Gods Reſidence upon earth, the reading of a ſecond Service at the Altar, and denying the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt to ſuch as have not come up to the new ſet rayle before the Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. They have made and confirmed new illegall Canons and Conſtitutions, and framed a moſt pernitious and deſperate Oath, an Oath of covenant and confederacie for their owne <hi>Hierarchicall greatneſse,</hi> beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other very dangerous and pernitious paſſages in the ſaid Canons.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They doe diſpenſe with pluralities of Benefices, they doe both prohibit and grant Marriages, neither of them by the rule of Law or Conſcience, but doe prohibit that they may grant, and grant that they may have money.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They have procured a lycentious liberty for the Lords Day, and have preſſed the ſtrict obſervation of the Saints <hi>Holydayes,</hi> and doe puniſh, ſuſpend and deprive godly Miniſters, for not publiſhing that Booke for liberty of ſports on the Sabboth day.</p>
            <p n="11">11. They doe generally abuſe the great <hi>Ordinance of Excommunication,</hi> making a great ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of it, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to the great diſcomfort of many poore ſoules, who for want of money can get no abſolution.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They claime their <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> and doe exerciſe the ſame contrary to Law in their owne names, and under their owne Seales.</p>
            <p n="13">13. They receiue and take upon them temporall Honours, Dignities, places and Offices in the Common-wealth, as if it were lawfull for them to uſe both ſwords.</p>
            <p n="14">14. They cognizance in their Courts and elſe-where of matters determinable at the <hi>Common-Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. They put Miniſters upon <hi>Pariſhes</hi> without the <hi>Patrons</hi> and without the peoples conſent.</p>
            <p n="16">16. They doe yearly impoſe Oaths upon <hi>Church-wardens,</hi> to the moſt apparent danger of filling the land with perjuries.</p>
            <p n="17">17. They doe exerciſe Oaths <hi>ex officio</hi> in the Nature of an inquiſition even unto the thoughts of men.</p>
            <p n="18">18. They have apprehended men by <hi>Purſevants</hi> without citation or miſſives firſt ſent, they break up mens houſes and ſtudies, taking away what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p n="19">19. They doe awe the Iudges of the Land with their greatneſſe to the inhibiting of prohibition, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> when it is due.</p>
            <p n="20">20. They are ſtrongly ſuſpected to be confederated with the Roman party in this Land, and with them to be <hi>Authors, Contrivers, or Conſenters</hi> to the preſent <hi>Commotions</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> and the rather becauſe of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution by the Clergie and by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the laſt Yeare 1639. and becauſe of an ill-named benevolence of ſix Subſidies, granted or intended to be granted this yeare, 1640. thereby and with theſe monies to ingage (as much as in them lay) the two Nations into blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is therefore our humble and earneſt prayer, that all this Hierarchicall power may be totally abrogated, if the wiſedome of this Honourable Houſe ſhall find that it cannot be maintained by Gods word and to his glory.</hi>
