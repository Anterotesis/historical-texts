            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE Reader may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
wonder, why at
this time of day he is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Particulars of a
Contest, which by its stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may reasonably have been
long since superannuated and
forgotten. But, besides that
those that retail Ink have usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a different Opinion of
their own Performances from
<pb facs="tcp:99975:3"/>
the rest of the World, and
consequently Reasons to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that 'twou'd be hard to
convince others of, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by two Considerations
to make this Piece free of our
Tongue. One is, that 'tis
the only publick Specimen of
the manner of Pleading in
<hi>France,</hi> and perhaps the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatest,
that cou'd have been
procur'd of their Bar Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which it may be
worth while to compare with
our own, which is not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be done in different
Languages: The other is, that
it contains a Defence of the
Dutchess of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:99975:3"/>
by Monsieur St. <hi>Evre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
whose Works need no
other Character, or Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
than his Name. I
thought it pity, that any
thing of his shou'd be denied
to the <hi>English</hi> Reader, at a
time, when all the rest of his
Works are Reprinting in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
with large Additions,
never before Publish'd in any
Language. I cou'd not doubt
the Welcome, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of his Pen wou'd
find from those, that gave all
his former Pieces so just, and
so kind a Reception.</p>
            <p>A more particular Account
perhaps may be expected of
<pb facs="tcp:99975:4"/>
Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi> whose Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
make up the greatest part
of this Book; but, besides
that I know nothing of him
more than I can collect from
his own Pleadings, 'tis suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the Reader to know,
that he was an Advocate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by the Duke, and had
no other Interest in the Cause,
than his Fees, or his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as a Pleader at most.
Nor will the Violence of his
Declamation, his hard Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations,
and gross Reflections
upon the Dutchess surprize
those that are acquainted with
the Practice of the Bar; they
know, that all this bustle is
<pb facs="tcp:99975:4"/>
not for nothing, and that
Gold will purchase a Wind
there, surer than in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his Performance,
scarce any thing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
is more Artificial; his
Charge is amplified, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agerated
with the Vehemence
and Boldness of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi>
and his Suggestions insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
with the Art, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
of <hi>Tully.</hi> I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to equal him to either
of those matchless Orators,
whom he may be allow'd to
fall very far short of in their
several ways, and yet excell;
but I may venture to say,
<pb facs="tcp:99975:5"/>
that he has not unsuccessfully
Copyed the Manner, and
Graces of 'em both, at least
as far as the Modern way
of Pleading, and the Genius
of the <hi>French</hi> Nation and
Language, will permit.</p>
            <p>I shall not here attempt
to forestall the Satisfaction of
the Reader, by entring into
a Comparison between the
<hi>French,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Barr. I
shall leave that to himself,
who ought to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of judging for himself,
in order to which I lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him the means. I shall
only take the Liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
one thing to him, which
<pb facs="tcp:99975:5"/>
will, if We shall be found to
come tolerably near 'em, turn
the Scale very much on our
side; that is, that all their
Pleadings, as appears by these,
were studied, labour'd Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
compil'd at Leisure,
and spoken without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which must needs give
'em a vast Advantage, both
in the Composing and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
against our Lawyers,
who perhaps Read their Brief
over the first time at the Bar,
and Argue the Case <hi>Ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi>
This Method, tho' it
may spoil the Eloquence of
our Pleadings, prevents the
puzling of the Cause by the
<pb facs="tcp:99975:6"/>
Intricacy, which the false Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of a studied Harangue
might Introduce.</p>
            <p>One thing more I ought
to take notice of, which may
seem to require an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
which is, that I shou'd
by this Version promote the
spreading of these Pleadings,
which are in a manner so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Libels, not only upon
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but upon
our King, and Nation.</p>
            <p>I might indeed have left
out those rude, unmannerly
Passages relating to our King,
and Country; but, besides
that as a Translator I cou'd
not justifie such a Liberty, I
<pb facs="tcp:99975:6"/>
cou'd not discover any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so to do. For when we
consider out of what Mouth
these Opprobrious Speeches
come, a Mercenary <hi>French</hi>
Advocate's, a profess'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our Religion, and
Nation in general, and our
King in particular, with whom
his Master was then at War,
and who alone gave a Check
to his Ambition; while they
had amongst 'em another
Prince, whose Pretensions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Crown, they us'd
their utmost Endeavours by
Arms to enforce upon us:
What he has said, no more
affects the King, or Nation,
<pb facs="tcp:99975:7"/>
than the Yelping of senseless
Currs does the Moon, or
the old Womans tit for tat,
the Thunder, which she fart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against. But for another
reason those Passages cou'd
not be omitted, because they
shew the true Spirit and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the Advocate, and
in some Measure of the whole
<hi>French</hi> Nation, or at least of
the Court, when such things
come seriously to be pleaded
before a solemn Bench of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and obtain the King's
Priviledge to be Printed.</p>
            <p>Neither cou'd they have
been left out without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> since
<pb facs="tcp:99975:7"/>
by such an Omission, I shou'd
have Represented the Duke's
Advocate as a Man of
more Candour than he is,
and thereby perhaps have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
weight to his False, and
Injurious Insinuations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her.</p>
            <p>As for the rest of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,
I think it no way to
the Dutchesses's Disadvantage,
that they shou'd be seen to
all the World. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the Art, that
is us'd to conceal it, the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is too apparent for the
Dose to go down; or if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
incautious Person shou'd
swallow it, the Antidote is
<pb facs="tcp:99975:8"/>
ready at hand to expell it.
One Advantage the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
gains by these Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against her, which is,
that the Truth of her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
is incontestably esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd.
For they have not
contradicted 'em in one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
point of Fact, except
in the Story of the Bishop
of <hi>Frejus,</hi> which the Duke
purges himself of, as well as
he can, by a simple Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All that his Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
insists upon is, that the
Duke has not used her ill
enough to warrant a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
according to form of
Law. Now he will allow
<pb facs="tcp:99975:8"/>
nothing to be a justifiable
Cause of Separation, but
Cruelty; by which he means
downright breaking her Bones.
As if causeless Jealousie, and
Confinement, studied Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
Vexations, Frights,
and Fatigues, were not Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
enough to a Lady of
her Quality, and Fortune, that
brought him 1625000<hi>l.</hi> Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and made him the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Subject in <hi>Europe.</hi> His
Advocate is pleas'd to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his Spleen, and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm
with the Name of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
which never suffer'd
him to put a value upon any
thing, that deserv'd it; and
<pb facs="tcp:99975:9"/>
consequently drove from him,
that Treasure of Beauty, and
Wit, which all <hi>Europe</hi> knew
how to Esteem, but the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
Possessor.</p>
            <p>But I shall not attempt
to prepossess the Reader; let
him hear both sides, and
judge amiss if he can.</p>

shou'd be depriv'd and divested of her
Dower, and Right of Alimony.</p>
                  <p>To these Conclusions, at the beginning of
the Cause, it was added,</p>
                  <p>That it shou'd be at the Discretion of
the Council, to allot her a certain time
to return into <hi>France,</hi> and to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
House; after which she shou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the Penalty of this Sentence without
further delay, or Judgment to be given.</p>
                  <p>He demanded further,</p>
                  <p>That it might be lawful for him to
seize her wherever he cou'd find her,
and to cause her to be conducted to his
own House.</p>

ARGUMENT
OF
Monsieur HERARD.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AFTER the Information you have
receiv'd from the Mouth of the
Publick, of the Causes of Complaint
given by Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> to Monsieur
the Duke of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> for two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years past, of her Elopement out of
the Kingdom, and her long Absence, of
which I shall open the Circumstances;
I doubt not but you will be equally
amaz'd at the Indulgence of Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> who endeavours to recover a
Wife by whom he has been so unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated; and at the obstinacy of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> who refuses the Grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
by her Husband, and makes more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99975:11"/>
difficulty of forgetting the Injuries she
has done him, then he of forgiving
'em.</p>
                  <p>How many Husbands wou'd have had
so much Tenderness for a Wife, that had
so far provok'd 'em? How many wou'd
have shut their Gates against her, and,
being in the Flower of their Years, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the Sweets of Conjugal Society
by her Caprice, wou'd at least have given
themselves the Liberties and Diversions
of a single Life, at an Age when they
were most agreeable?</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, How many Wives
are there, who after having so highly
offended their Husbands, from whom they
had receiv'd nothing but Honourable
Treatment, wou'd earnestly wish'em so
well dispos'd to accord 'em a Title they
so little deserv'd, and allow 'em the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of a Sacrament, the Conditions of
which they had so ill observ'd? How
happy wou'd many think themselves, to
find after so many Rambles, so many
suspected courses in the Houses of their
Husbands, an honourable Retreat, a safe
Harbour from the Scandal of their past
Lives?</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, GENTLEMEN, but
this wou'd be the very Sense of Madam
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99975:11"/>
                     <hi>Mazarin</hi> her self, nor but that she cou'd
easily resume that Esteem and Affection
which she formerly had for Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> if she listen'd to her own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Interest, rather than the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Advice of one of her Family, whose
hatred Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> has the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to lye under, without having
drawn it upon himself.</p>
                  <p>These are not the first Tracks of this
Enemy of his Repose, which he has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.
You see, GENTLEMEN, by
the Pieces which I have communicated
to you, that by this dangerous Relation,
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was instigated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
and favour'd in her Escape; and
'tis but too apparent, that 'tis he that
still keeps up in her this humour of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and hinders her from taking the
Advantage of the good Disposition of my
Client, to a Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> therefore does not
impute so much to Madam his Wife the
Injuries she has done him, her Coldness,
and her apparent Slights, as to those,
that have infus'd this Humour into her;
And this consideration alone has induc'd
him so easily to pardon her without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
any other Satisfaction than that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99975:12"/>
she wou'd return home, and mend her
Conduct.</p>
                  <p>He avows likewise, that while she
offer'd him the most cruel Outrages, he
always took pains to justifie her to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and that he has ever preserv'd a
tenderness for her, that has baffled all
her violent efforts to tear it from him:
Judge therefore, GENTLEMEN, how
dear she must needs be to him, wou'd
she but return to her Duty, and resume
the Place due to her in his House, and
which is the only one that she can fill
with Honour.</p>
                  <p>But, since she is deaf to the Voice of
her Husband, since thro' ill Advice she
is obstinate in her denyal of what is due
to him, and to her self, he is oblig'd to
have recourse to you, GENTLEMEN,
who know her true Interest better than
her self, that your Prudence may supply
the deficience of hers; that thro' the fear
of those Pains, which she has made her
self obnoxious to, she may be compell'd
to accept those Advantages which are
offer'd her; and that you may, by a
Law, oblige her to that which wou'd be
her sole desire, if she knew her own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99975:12"/>
He desires you to re-establish betwixt
his Wife, and him, that Commerce,
which is the Principal End, and makes
all the Happiness of Marriage; that you
wou'd knit again those Sacred Knots;
that you wou'd reunite two parts of the
same Body which have been long since
disjoyn'd, and can find no true repose,
but in their Coalition.</p>
                  <p>As this Cause is altogether serious,
and of the highest Importance, not only
to Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but to the Honour
of the Publick, I shall handle it with that
Sobriety, that it requires; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the humour of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
I shall decline, as much as possible, the
saying any thing that may offend Madam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> or occasion the Publick to make
any Reflections to the Prejudice of her
Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur the Cardinal of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> that
Minister so enlighten'd, and so powerful
in Wealth, and Authority, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the approach of his End, was solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to find a Man, whom he might make
Heir of his mighty Estate, and Name, one
that might worthily support the glory
of the latter.</p>
                  <p>For this purpose he cast his Eyes upon
the Lords of the Court of the greatest
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99975:13"/>
Merit and Quality, for he might choose
whom he pleas'd; there not being one,
who wou'd not have been extreamly proud
to have been his Choice. After having
well consider'd 'em all, he pitch'd upon
Monsieur <hi>de la Meilleraye,</hi> and offer'd him
Mademoiselle <hi>Hortensia de Mancini</hi> his
Niece in Marriage, with a great part of
his Wealth, and the hopes of succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him.</p>
                  <p>This Minister, who wanted no Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,
must needs have beheld him with
other Eyes, than those which Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> (or rather those that possess her)
wou'd have us look upon him with. The
Judgment of so great a Man is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Apology for my Client, a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Proof against all the Calumnies
that this Cabal have spread in the World
upon him, and which have been receiv'd
in it, only through a malicious Pleasure,
that the common People take in hearing
Scandal, and Raillery, especially when
it falls upon People that have the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Piety, and a more regular Life
than other Men.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur the Cardinal inserted one
Article extraordinary into the Marriage
Settlement; he does not give immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to his Niece alone the Estate, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99975:13"/>
he settles upon the future Couple, but he
gives 'em jointly to Monsieur, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin;</hi> and to strengthen his
Gift, he in that very Clause of Gift ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
two Motives, one relating to
Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the other
to his Niece. <hi>And in Consideration,</hi> says
that Clause, <hi>of the choice he has made of
the aforesaid Lord, her Husband, that is
to be, to bear his Name, and Arms, and
to testifie his Affection to the said Lady his
Niece, and in favour of the present Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
he gives to the said Lord and Lady,
future Spouses,</hi> &amp;c. These are the express
terms of the Clause.</p>
                  <p>This, GENTLEMEN, ought not to be
look'd upon as a mark only of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Esteem, that the Cardinal had for
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but as a means also
to bind Madam his Niece more firmly to
the Husband, which he had chosen for
her, and to oblige her to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon him, as well knowing
the inconstant humour of the Lady.</p>
                  <p>In one point he has given Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> an advantage above her. For
having setled the Reversion of his Estate
by a perpetual Entail, which equally
took away from either of 'em, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of alienating i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; He orders that in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99975:14"/>
case Monsieur <hi>de Mazarin</hi> shou'd survive
her, he shou'd enjoy the whole, altho'
he shou'd Marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;<note place="margin">§ 50000l, Sterling.</note>
but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if she surviv'd
him, she was to enjoy but to the value
of § 600000 Livres.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur the Cardinal was so satisfied
with his Choice; and the Conduct of
Monsieur the Duke after Marriage, so
strongly confirmed him in the great
Esteem he had for him, that he gave
him fresh Marks of it in his Will. He
made him joint Executor with his
Dutchess of his whole Will, and therein
repeated again the former Condition:
<hi>That in case Madam</hi> Mazarin <hi>died before her
Husband, he shou'd remain in Possession of
the whole Estate; but she being the Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
shou'd enjoy the Interest only of six
hundred thousand Livres, to which she had
by the Marriage Settlement been reduc'd,
without being capable of receiving any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of addition, or augmentation to this
allowance by the general Legacies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Monsieur and Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> liv'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in perfect good understanding, and
tasted all the Felicity of a happy Match
for near seven years. They had several
Children, the birth of which ought to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99975:14"/>
have united 'em more strictly, especially
since the extraordinary Gifts, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of these Children were manifest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of the peculiar Blessing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon their Match.</p>
                  <p>But after seven happy years of Peace,
the Poyson of Discord crept in betwixt
'em upon this occasion.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> had the misfortune
to fall under the displeasure of Monsieur
the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> without having
ever offended him. Whether this Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
were the effect of any natural Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
or whether it arose from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
conceiv'd by Monsieur <hi>de Nevers,</hi>
at seeing a Stranger share with him the
Spoils of his Uncle, and to see him even
preferr'd to himself in his last Will, and
chosen by Monsieur the Cardinal for the
chief support of his Name and Family.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> has always look'd
upon Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> as
the main Instrument of the Separation of
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> from him; he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that 'twas he, who urg'd by his
hatred, and perhaps by some motive of
Interest, and the hopes of being their
Heir, which he was appointed to be,
in case Monsieur and Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
had died without Issue, had chang'd the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99975:15"/>
Affections of his Wife, and infus'd that
Contempt into her, which has since been
so notoriously apparent. And Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> has been farther confirm'd in
this Opinion by the hand which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nevers</hi> had in the carrying off
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> by all the Measures he
has taken since, and by his present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                  <p>The first and main aim of Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> since she gave her self up to be
seduc'd, has been always to withdraw
from the Presence, and dependance of
her Husband. She cou'd have wish'd,
that either by some Violence, or Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he wou'd have given her a Pretext
to sue for a Divorce. But the mildness
of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and the respect he
always paid her, not only out of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to her Person, but also out of a regard
which he will ever have to the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Benefactor, having taken away
all colour for such an Action, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
her self to form in the Year 1666,
a demand for a Division of Effects.</p>
                  <p>Not that she had any hopes of succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in her Suit: The regular Oeconomy
of Monsieur <hi>de Mazarin,</hi> the Moderation
he always observ'd in his Expences, and
the vast Estate he was then possess'd of,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99975:15"/>
cover'd him sufficiently against such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
The sole design of Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
was to furnish her self with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to abandon her Husband's House,
while the Suit was depending.</p>
                  <p>This succeeding for a while, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to the Nunnery of St. <hi>Mary;</hi> but
the Religious being soon weary of her
Conduct, in a few Months she took a
progress thro' three Convents more,
which edified as little by her, as the
former.</p>
                  <p>In short, GENTLEMEN, her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being at a loss where to lodge her any
longer, propos'd an Accommodation; and
caus'd both Parties to sign a mutual Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
wherein 'twas agreed, that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> shou'd return to the Palace of
<hi>Mazarin;</hi> but that during the Process,
she shou'd be lodg'd in a separate Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The first Exploit she did, was to open
a Passage thro' the Wall, between <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
House, and her Apartment, thro'
which she went and came at all hours
of the Day, or Night, without passing
thro' the Palace of <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this was not all; for thro' this
Breach she convey'd away all the Plate,
and richest Furniture of her Apartment,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99975:16"/>
which amounted to an immense Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
                  <p>At the Expiration of the Term of the
mutual Obligation, when the Cause of
Separation was ready to be heard, she
truly foresaw that 'twas impossible it
shou'd go for her. Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> was
too far off (what is call'd) <hi>Vergere ad
inopiam, falling into want,</hi> which is the
Case, in which the Law allows a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Effects. Matters standing thus,
she had recourse to her last Stratagem.</p>
                  <p>'Tis with Grief that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
is oblig'd to revive this unhappy Story;
but since the absence of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi>
which is the Subject of our Complaint,
is the consequence of her being carried
away, it makes a necessary part of the
matter before you, and may be of great
weight in the Decision of it. Besides,
this Story is already so publick, that the
recital which I shall make will contain
nothing new, to the greatest part of the
Audience here present.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Mazarin</hi> in the Habit of a
Man, attended by one only of her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the same Dress, came thro' the
Communication aforesaid, into <hi>Nevers</hi>
House, where Monsieur the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> her Brother, who waited her
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99975:16"/>
coming, took her into his Coach, and
conducted her to a Stage before appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, where he left her under the
Guard and Conduct of some of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks,
and those of another Person
of the first Quality, who died some years
since of the most Tragical Death in the
World, whose Name the Council will,
I hope, give me leave to pass over in
silence.</p>
                  <p>The Captains of her Convoy, and
Principal Conductors, were a <hi>Valet d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Chambre,</hi> and one of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>'s
Gentlemen, one nam'd <hi>Narcissus,</hi>
and t'other <hi>Parmillac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> had taken care to
have fresh Horses laid all along the Road,
that she might leave the Kingdom with
more Expedition.</p>
                  <p>This Escape was made on the <hi>13th.</hi>
or <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> in the Night, in the
Year 1667. All the next day, her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
pretended, that she was indispos'd,
and at rest, and suffer'd no body to come
into her Apartment, so that Monsieur <hi>de
Mazarin</hi> was not inform'd of her flight
till the Night following.</p>
                  <p>Never was Anguish comparable to
that of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin;</hi> he procur'd
the King's Orders to all the Governors,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99975:17"/>
to stop her passing the Frontiers, and
caus'd her to be pursu'd with all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
imaginable. But she having the
start by four and twenty hours, and
travelling exceeding swift, render'd all
the Care and Diligence of Monsieur her
Husband, ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>de Mazarin</hi> brought an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
for a Rape against all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices:
And here I must intreat you,
GENTLEMEN, to take notice, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and Honour he shews for Madam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> in not suffering any Information
to be brought, or any Decree to be given
directly against her; he desir'd no more
in relation to her, than liberty to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her, which was granted.</p>
                  <p>By these Informations it was fully
prov'd, that Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
was assistant in this Rape. I am sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
upon the account of the Respect I
have, not only for his great Quality,
but for his Personal Worth, that I am
forc'd to rake into these matters; but
they are of too great importance to my
Cause, to be pass'd over in silence.</p>
                  <p>Warrants were issued out against his
Domesticks, and Personal Process de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
against himself, and the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Quality: A Contempt was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99975:17"/>
and ready to be adjudg'd, when
Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> presented himself
to Examination. All these Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are yet in the hands of the King's
Council.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>de Mazarin</hi> perceiving, that
these Processes were not likely to regain
Madam <hi>de Mazarin,</hi> which was all that
he aim'd at, and upon which account
only he began 'em; but that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the continuance of 'em did but
exasperate the adverse Party, and render
'em more indispos'd for a Reconciliation;
let drop his Suit, and left the accus'd in
quiet.</p>
                  <p>I shall not amuse my self about a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the several Voyages that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> has made, the different Climates
she has visited, nor the Adventures she
has met with; such a recital wou'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be for her Honour, nor his Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And so far is he from entertaining
the Publick with any such things, that
he uses his utmost Endeavour to conceal
'em from himself, and to raze 'em from
his Memory; which the Presence and
sincere re-union of Madam wou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
effect.</p>
                  <p>'Tis sufficient to inform you, that she
went first for <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99975:18"/>
privately to <hi>France,</hi> and lay some
time conceal'd; that her next remove
was into <hi>Savoy,</hi> and thence after some
Months into the Dominions of the King
of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that at last she retir'd into
<hi>England,</hi> where she has made her longest
abode.</p>
                  <p>For the two first years, Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
who still hop'd for her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
return'd considerable Summs to
her, besides what she carried away with
her.</p>
                  <p>But at length touch'd to the quick
at her obstinate refusal to return, but
more at the ill Reports, which she had
occasion'd of her self, which yet he
was so wise, and so happy, as not to
believe; and knowing the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
gave her a yearly Pension of
58000 Livers, in Consideration of the
Summ of 300000 Crowns, which he
ow'd to Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> he put a
stop to his returns.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> dying, and
his Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Throne, he had the Bounty to
continue her Pension to Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
upon the account of the honour
she had to be related to the Queen
his Consort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99975:18"/>
While the King and Queen of <hi>England</hi>
remained in peaceable Possession of their
Realms, and had their Court at <hi>London,</hi>
and by their Presence, their Zeal for the
true Religion, and their Pious Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
restor'd the free Exercise of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Monsieur, the Duke of <hi>Mazarin</hi>
contented himself in secret to bewail
the scorn, and hardness of his Wife's
Heart.</p>
                  <p>He suspended his Right, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Resentments, out of Respect to
the Protection which their Majesties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and out of that
Veneration which he testified for their
Sacred Persons; to be near which, even
Strangers born in the remotest Climates
might be drawn and retained by a pure
Admiration of their Heroick Vertues:
And tho' he knew that her Presence was
in no wise necessarily conducing to the
re-establishment of Religion at <hi>London;</hi>
that her way of living there was not
likely to give the Catholicks much Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Sanctity; that she observ'd but
ill the wise Advice the King and Queen
honour'd her with; and that she consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
less their Persons, than the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd
Liberty and Pleasure she enjoy'd
in their Country: Yet he was willing to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99975:19"/>
be cheated by a Pretence so specious,
and that bore so honourable an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>But the Revolution which fell out in
<hi>England</hi> a year ago, has taken away
that false pretence; and not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
her of all excuse for any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
stay in <hi>London,</hi> but it has laid fresh
Obligations upon her to return into
<hi>France,</hi> besides those of her particular
Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>Matters are come to that pass in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that 'tis no longer lawful for a
Catholick, a <hi>French</hi> Man, nor scarce for
an honest Man to stay in <hi>London;</hi>
much less for a Person loaded with the
Favours of the King and Queen, and
one that has the honour to be allied to
'em. The stay which she has made
there since that time, (and which 'tis
evident she designs to make there all
the rest of her Life, if you, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
don't compell her to leave it,)
has pluck'd off the Mask, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the real Motives that drew her
to, and keep her still at <hi>London;</hi> and
at the same time shews how little
worthy she was of the Protection the
King and Queen honour'd her with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99975:19"/>
If she had any Affection for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
any Gratitude for their Bounties,
or indeed but a bare Sense of Honour
or Religion, she ought to have follow'd
'em. Cou'd she see, without horrour,
the Usurper of their Kingdoms, and the
Enemy of our Faith, establish his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
upon the Wrack of their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Throne, and the ruine of the
true Religion? And so far from seeking
(as she did) Grace in his Eyes, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his leave to stay in a Place which
she ought to fly; or from labouring to
be excepted from that general Law which
banish'd all Catholicks, ought she not
to have prevented it by a voluntary
departure?</p>
                  <p>Let her not pretend her Debts were
any impediment; I shall shew in due
Place, the fallacy of that Excuse; as
likewise of those pretended Debts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Let her tell us nevertheless, who
hinder'd her from going, when so many
<hi>English</hi>-born Catholicks left their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and sought Refuge in <hi>France;</hi> the
greatest part of whom must needs have
Debts more considerable than hers?</p>
                  <p>With what Face can we be told that
she had not Liberty to go, when she
scarce had leave to stay? Have not we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99975:20"/>
here, and all the World, heard of it?
And was she not inform'd by the Votes,
and Gazetts of <hi>England,</hi> of the Efforts
of the Convention to drive her thence;
and their Addresses to the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> that he wou'd order her to be
gone?</p>
                  <p>Did they lay any condition upon her?
Did they order her to be detain'd till
she had paid her Debts? No, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
of her only, the favour to be gone:
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was forc'd to call to her
Assistance, the Power of the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and procure Licence from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to stay.</p>
                  <p>What an Indignity is it for Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> to prefer a Country that labours
to be rid of her, before the House of a
Husband that longs for her: <hi>England</hi> in
Flames, the Theatre of Rebellion and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
before <hi>France</hi> Peaceable, Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Catholick: The Court of an
Usurper, before that of the greatest, and
justest Prince in the World; and that for
this she shou'd implore an Authority,
which she ought to have in abhorrence;
that she shou'd seek support from him,
that came unjustly to dethrone her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99975:20"/>
With a becoming assurance we must
needs be told after this, of the unsepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableness
of Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> from the
Queen her Relation and Protectress, and
that made the reason of her almost twenty
years residence in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> after having given
Madam his Dutchess time sufficient, since
the revolt of that People, to return into
<hi>France,</hi> seeing her resolute to continue in
<hi>London,</hi> against all those reasons that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
her return; and being mov'd at the
Peril to which her stay in <hi>England</hi> exposes
both her Person and Religion, as she her
self says in her defence, has at length
resolv'd to try by your Authority, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that, which the Instances of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of <hi>England</hi> cou'd not.</p>
                  <p>He has presented his Petition to the
Council, to declare her depriv'd of her
Settlement during her unjust Retreat,
and her obstinate Absence from him, and
from the Kingdom. But that you may
see his design is not to gain her Estate,
but her Person, he at the same time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
another Petition for leave to seize
her, wherever he can find her, and to
convey her to his own House. And, I
know his Mind so well, that I venture
to add, without fear of having it disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99975:21"/>
by him, That altho' Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
has sufficiently incurr'd the Penalty
of Privation of her Settlement by her
Flight, and by her Contempt, Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd be highly satisfied that
she shou'd avoid it by an immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to him, or within such limited time
as you shall prescribe: But on this express
condition, That on her default of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
within the time by you appointed,
she shall by Virtue of your Sentence,
without occasion for any other, remain
divested and depriv'd of her Dower, and
Settlements.</p>
                  <p>This, GENTLEMEN, is our demand,
of which I shall lay you down the means;
after which it will not be difficult to
overthrow those incidentally form'd by
Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi>

Second Hearing
OF
Monsieur HERARD.</head>
                  <opener>

                  </opener>
                  <p>HAving laid the whole matter of Fact
before you at the last Hearing, it
remains that I now settle the means of
my demand; and, since Master <hi>Sachot</hi>
urges me to insist upon the rigour of my
Petition, and will allow no Moderation,
I shall endeavour to satisfie him, and
shew you just cause to declare Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> depriv'd of Dower, and Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and that her past Conduct does
but too well justifie such Deprivation.</p>
                  <p>In order to which, I hope to prove,
that 'tis the usual Correction given to
Wives, that abandon their Husbands
without lawful Cause, and break that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99975:22"/>
indissoluble Society out of Levity: That
this Punishment is adjudged by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Law, which is conformable to the
Intentions of the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> and
Authoriz'd by the Practice of all the
Courts.</p>
                  <p>There are two Cases wherein the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Law deprives a Wife, that divorces
her self from her Husband, of Dower
and Alimony.</p>
                  <p>The first is, when she withdraws, and
divorces her self from her Husband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
just cause.</p>
                  <p>The other is, when a Wife by her ill
Conduct gives her Husband just cause to
divorce himself from her. The Emperor
in the <hi>22d,</hi> and the <hi>117th Novels,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
what those just causes are; <hi>Si Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierem
adulteram inveniat</hi> (this, Heaven
be prais'd, is none of our case) But he
immediately subjoyns, <hi>aut Viro nesciente,
vel etiam prohibente, gaudentem conviviis
aliorum virorum nihil sibi competentium;
vel etiam invito viro citra rationabilem
causam foris pernoctantem, nisi forsan apud
proprios parentes.</hi> I am very well aware
that this does not extend to Wives, who
may accidentally eat with other Men, or
lie a few Nights out of their own Houses,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99975:22"/>
but to those only that make a common
Practice of it.</p>
                  <p>In either of these cases the Law deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,
That the Restitution of her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and all Advantages that she may
claim by virtue of her Marriage, shall
be denied to her: The reason why the
Law in this case submits her to the same
Penalty with an Adultress is, because if
these disorders be not a demonstrative
proof of her being debauch'd, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to a violent suspition at least;
and for the satisfaction of a Husband,
'tis not enough that his Wife be free from
the Guilt, unless she behave her self so
as to keep clear of the Scandal.</p>
                  <p>Tali aliquo facto, dat lex haec licentiam
viro abjicere mulierem, si vel harum unam,
vel solam probaverit causam, &amp; lucrari qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
dotem, antenuptialem vero habere do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem.</p>
                  <p>Cujacius <hi>upon one of these Novels uses
these Expressions:</hi> Paenae dissidii sunt; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
quae absque probabili causa discedit a
marito, vel quae discedendi causam marito
praebet, dotem amittit, &amp; lucra nuptialia.</p>
                  <p>I suppose, GENTLEMEN, That't will
not be alledg'd, that our Wives are not
oblig'd to have the same respect for and
dependance upon their Husbands, or so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99975:23"/>
much regularity in their Conduct as the
<hi>Roman</hi> Ladies. They have, I confess,
in <hi>France,</hi> somewhat more of that honest
Liberty, which offends not against Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty;
we are not so severe as that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in matters simply Innocent. But
we dispense no more than they with the
essential Obligations of Marriage, nor
connive at what may give just ground
to suspect 'em of a Crime, which is so
sollicitously conceal'd, and of which we
can judge only by appearances. To
grant that, were to wrong the purity of
the Age we live in.</p>
                  <p>It was objected to me at <hi>Parquet,</hi> that
these Penalties were establish'd by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Law, only in case of a legal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
which the Law of those times
allow'd, which imply'd a total Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Marriage; and that such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces
being no longer allow'd, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
inflicted on the Woman that gave
occasion for, or practis'd it, cou'd no
longer be retain'd in use.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, I maintain, That
if they punish'd Violations of the Rights
of Matrimony in such a manner, at a
time when they were not sufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the dignity of it, when
they scarce look'd upon it as more than a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99975:23"/>
civil Contract; they ought to be more
severely chastised now, when the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Sacrament is better known,
and its Rights are become more sacred.
I maintain, that if a Wife shall abandon
her Husband, or fall into those disorders
mention'd in these Laws, since she can
no longer be punish'd by Repudiation,
which was but one of the Penalties
which by those Laws she incurr'd, she
ought at least to suffer all the other
which they annext to it.</p>
                  <p>Otherwise we must avow that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Laws have too severely provided
to vindicate the Honour of Husbands,
and Matrimony, or ours not enough.
The former gave the injur'd Husband
double Vengeance, and double Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the one in ridding him of a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Wife, the other in giving him her
Portion; so that at the very same time
she injur'd him by a causeless desertion,
she repair'd it by leaving him his Liberty,
and her own Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Will they pretend, that we by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Value, have impair'd the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Matrimony, and the right of
Husbands? Will they say, that because
a Wife is more straitly, and inseparably
bound to her Husband, that therefore she
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99975:24"/>
may with impunity abuse him, fail of
her Duty, and commit without fear all
those Enormities which these Laws pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with Repudiation, and loss of
Dower? Were not this to judge very
hardly of our Policy, and cou'd there be
any thing more dangerous than such an
Impunity?</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN, Let us apply these
Maxims to the case before us; Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> is a delinquent both those ways;
which demand a Privation of Dower.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> She has given, and still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to give Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> such cause
of Complaint, as wou'd heretofore have
empower'd a Husband to turn off the
Wife; and keep the Portion. <hi>Mulierem,
viro prohibente, gaudentem conviviis alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
virorum nihil sibi competentium,</hi> Is
not this Madam <hi>Mazarin? Virorum ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
sibi competentium,</hi> Those Gamesters
by Profession, those <hi>Milords</hi> who eat
constantly, and pass whole days, and
part of their Nights with her. Is this
fit Company for her? Is there any sort
of Men, with whom she ought to hold
less Correspondence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vel etiam invito viro foris pernoct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> has not only
spent Days and Nights so, but Weeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99975:24"/>
Months, and Years. Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
therefore, according to these antient
Laws, has a right to put away his
Wife, and detain her Fortune. But since
our Religion permits not the former, the
Law is for that reason the more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
bound to relieve him otherwise, and
to preserve to him the other mean to
compell his Wife to return to her Duty,
or to punish her Disobedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> is guilty of
the other Fault, which these Laws punish
likewise with loss of Dower; she has,
as far as in her lay, causelesly divorc'd
her self from the Duke. She has not, I
must confess, made a true divorce, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the word in its strictest Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for a <hi>nullity</hi> of Marriage, because
the Law has put that out of her Power;
but she has made a divorce in Fact, much
worse than the other; because being his
Wife, she lives as if she were not so;
and robs him of the Pleasure of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Society, without easing him of the
Bondage of Matrimony.</p>
                  <p>But if you please, GENTLEMEN, to
reflect upon the Circumstances of this
Absence, this Divorce, you will find
that all Circumstances concur to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99975:25"/>
it extreamly, and call for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
severity of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> How did Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> make
her Elopement from her Husbands House?
In the Night, disguis'd in the Habit of
a Man, thro' a Passage which she had
caus'd to be open'd into the adjoyning
House; after she had convey'd away
all her Plate, all her silver Stuffs, and
the rich Furniture of her Apartment,
she at length causes her self to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
away. But by whom? 'Tis true,
the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> her Brother, just
lent her his hand, and parted from her;
but he left her in the hands of one of the
most gallant, handsomest young Lords
in all the Court, who was no Relation,
who furnish'd her with Equipage, laid
Horses necessary for her Escape; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
born her company some days, left
one of his Gentlemen, and part of
his Retinue to convoy her out of the
Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Can it be deny'd, that all these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumitances
of her Escape are extreamly
Criminal in themselves? May we not
suspect some greater Crime, and believe
that she has but ill preserv'd that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which by the danger she wilfully
threw it into, she appears to value so
little.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99975:25"/>
Wou'd not a Husband, that had the
least spark of Jealousie, look upon such
an Elopement as demonstrative proof?
Wou'd not the Judges themselves have
been amaz'd, had this Suit been prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?
And ought not Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
to be extreamly oblig'd to Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
for the Justice which he does her,
and the favourable Thoughts he has all
along entertain'd of her Virtue, in spight
of the imprudence of her Conduct.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second Circumstance;</hi> When Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> left her House, did she retire
to any Monastery, or any honourable
House in the Kingdom? No! She left
<hi>France</hi> to ramble over the World, and
carry her Shame and her Husband's all
over <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third Circumstance;</hi> How long has
Madam <hi>Mazariu</hi> absented her self from
her Husband's House, and from the
Kingdom? Is it one of those short Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
which the Lawyers call <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusculum,</hi>
which ceases as soon as the
first Emotions are appeas'd. 'Tis now
full Two and Twenty Years, that she
has persisted in her revolt from the
Authority of her Husband, in her alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from her Duty, and in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
to her Country, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99975:26"/>
Is it not time that the Magistrates
shou'd interpose their Authority to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
her to that, which the Sense of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the love of her Country, and the
consideration of her Duty and Honour
ought to have exacted from her long
ago?</p>
                  <p>There is yet one Circumstance more;
Has Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> since her Elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
liv'd with that Modesty, and
Retirement, that Decency requires of a
Woman that is forc'd to quit her House,
her Family, and Country, by domestick
Discontents; which they wou'd make us
believe to be her Case? I shall upon this
occasion take notice of nothing, but
what is publick, and which I shou'd la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in vain to conceal. Madam <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
left <hi>France</hi> to set up a Basset Table
in <hi>London,</hi> to make her House a publick
Ordinary for Gaming, and all the loose
Practices which Gaming draws after it,
or rather serves as a colour for.</p>
                  <p>And shall the Magistrates behold this
Scandal and Disorder, without applying
any Remedy? Shall not the Law be able
to punish, and vindicate a Husband af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
to that degree? Nothing can
be more injurious to the Honour of the
Publick, than such a Supposition: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99975:26"/>
more repugnant to the Nature of
the Laws of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Divers of our Customs, as that of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> Article 376, and that of
<hi>Brittany,</hi> Article 430, declare expresly,
That if a Husband dies during the Elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Wife, without Reconciliation,
she shall lose her Jointure, and other
Settlements, upon the bare complaint of
her Husband's Heir, altho' no suit were
commenc'd in his Life-time.</p>
                  <p>Judge then, GENTLEMEN, What
in proportion the Woman ought to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that runs away, as Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
did; and absents her self from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
two and twenty years, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
deaf to the Complaints of her
Husband.</p>
                  <p>In the Canon Law, the Authority of
which amongst us in Matrimonial Cases
is well known, We have a positive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
in this Case: 'Tis in the
Chap. <hi>Plerumque decretal. de donation. int.
Vir. &amp; Vxor. Si Mulier ob causam Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis
judicio Ecclesiae.</hi> This is the first
case; <hi>Aut propria voluntate a viro recesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
See the second, <hi>Nec reconciliata
postea sit eidem, dotem, vel dotalitium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petere
non valebit.</hi> This Chapter ranks
her that causelesly deserts her Husband,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99975:27"/>
with her that is convict of Adultery;
it looks upon both these Injuries as
equal, and punishes both alike with loss
of Dower, and Settlement.</p>
                  <p>In short, 'tis plain, consider it how
we will, that such a Desertion ought to
be punish'd in a Wife with such a Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>For first 'tis not to be deny'd, that
'tis a manifest Opposition to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
which by her Marriage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
she enter'd into; and an absolute
Infraction of the Conditions of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
Now 'tis a certain Maxim, that
he that runs counter to the Conditions
of a Contract, and fails to perform his
part of the Obligation, loses the Benefit
of it, and can claim no right under it:
By consequence, the Restitution of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Right of Jointure, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of Effects appertaining to a
Wife only by vertue of her Marriage
Contract, the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onditions of which she
has broken, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ought without dispute
to lose all title to 'em.</p>
                  <p>If the Law be so severe upon Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
that marry before their year of
Mourning be expir'd, only because so
precipitate a second Match looks like a
disrespect to the Memory of the dead
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99975:27"/>
Husband; if they punish this Fault not
only with loss of Estate, but with Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
likewise; What Correction can be
too severe for a Wife, who shews so
much contempt of her Husband while
alive, and persists in it so many years?</p>
                  <p>If the Son, who is wanting in his
Respects to his Parents, or who aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
them, and refuses to return at their
desire, renders himself unworthy to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit:
If a freed Man, by the least affront
to his Patron, lost his Liberty, and
Estate: If a Vassal amongst us, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring,
or not acknowledging his Lord,
forfeits his Fee: When a Wife, who is
undoubtedly oblig'd by stricter Bonds to
her Husband, than to her Father, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to pay more Respect than a freed
Man to his Patron; and more Honour,
and deference, than a Vassal to his Lord:
When this Wife, I say, violates all her
Obligations, when she disowns him,
when she shews an open Contempt of
him, can a less Punishment than depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Dower, and of all those Rights
that depend on Matrimony, suffice?</p>
                  <p>You see therefore, GENTLEMEN,
by all these Reasons, there is but too
much cause to pronounce Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99975:28"/>
All that was alledg'd at <hi>Parquet,</hi> in
defence of her Desertion, and long Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
was, that the <hi>Novelle,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
Women of their Dower for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
themselves from the Houses of
their Husbands, has this Exceptian, <hi>Nisi
forsan apud proprios Parentes;</hi> Madam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> say they, is hereby manifestly
excepted, for she retir'd to <hi>London</hi> near
the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to whom she
has the honour to be related: They
pretend, that so August a Name, not
only excuses her Absence, but justifies
her Conduct, and protects her from all
manner of suspicion.</p>
                  <p>I shall not throw away my time,
GENTLEMEN, in canvasing the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of Words, <hi>proprios Parentes;</hi>
tho' they have always been understood
of Relations in the Ascendant Line, and
not the Collateral. I shall readily agree,
that a Relation clad in the Regal Purple,
how far soever remov'd in Blood, may
well supply the place of a Father, and
with preference be allow'd the same
Priviledge: I shall grant likewise, that
if it be in some sense true, that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
have no Kindred, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which surrounds 'em, divides 'em from
those to whom Nature had joyn'd 'em,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99975:28"/>
and cancels the Obligations of Blood;
that 'tis no less true, that they become
to their whole People in general, what
they cease to be to particulars; their
whole State becomes their Family, and
they are the common Fathers, not only
of their own People, but of all that they
please to adopt; that is to say, to take
into their Protection.</p>
                  <p>Nor shall I here insist, that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
in the <hi>Novelle,</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of a short absence only, of a Wife
that spends a few days with her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that the Law did not extend
this Favour to those that remain'd from
their Husbands ten, fifteen, or twenty
years, tho' with a Father or Mother.</p>
                  <p>But my main answer is drawn from
the manner of Madam <hi>Mazarin's</hi> living
with the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> did the Queen invite her to
<hi>London?</hi> Did she desire her Company?
Did she detain her with her? On the
contrary, had Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> follow'd
her Advice, she had never left her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
or at least, she had made a quick
return.</p>
                  <p>Chance brought her to <hi>London,</hi> after
having visited an infinite number of other
States; or rather she was led thither
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99975:29"/>
by a desire to be parted from Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> by the Sea, that she might not
inhabit so much as the same Continent
with him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Her good Fortune threw
her upon the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who
was willing to receive her, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to tender her hand to her, in hopes
that her Presence, her Advice, and the
Deference that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> ought
to have for her, might moderate the
violence of her Resentments.</p>
                  <p>But what use has she made of this
Grace? How has she liv'd near that
Great Queen? Was she assiduous about
her Person? Did she imitate her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Piety? Did she follow her
Example in any thing? Nothing cou'd
be more opposite.</p>
                  <p>The Queen devoted her self wholly
to the care of Salvation, and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Exercise of our Religion.
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> gave her self up to
the Follies of the Age, and seem'd to
have no aim but to ruine her self and
others.</p>
                  <p>The Queen made it her business to
gather the Elect into her Palace, and
turn it into a House of Prayer, and
Edification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99975:29"/>
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> made her House a
publick Rendezvous for Gaming, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and Galiantry; a new <hi>Babylon,</hi> where
People of all Nations, Sects, and Tongues
march'd confusedly together under the
Standard of Luxury, and Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Queen labour'd to relieve the
Necessitous, and knock off the Fetters
of Prisoners: Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Rich, and make 'em her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                  <p>The Queen descended from her Throne
to humble her self at the Feet of God's
Altars, and to pay him that Worship,
and Adoration, which are his due: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> idoliz'd her self, sought
Adorers, and exacted a prophane, crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Worship from 'em.</p>
                  <p>Do you call this being with the Queen
of <hi>England?</hi> You were farther off her,
than Heaven from Earth; and your
Conduct divided you more, than your
abode in <hi>London</hi> brought you together;
and this very Honour of seeing her, and
enjoying her Protection, aggravates your
Guilt. How can you excuse the having
such great Examples before your Eyes,
without attempting to follow 'em; at
least imperfectly, and at a distance; for
few can come near 'em; the having
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99975:30"/>
liv'd in her capital City, only to raise
an Altar to <hi>Belial,</hi> on the very spot
where that Princess rais'd one to the
true God; the having plac'd the Idol
of <hi>Dagon</hi> so near the <hi>Ark;</hi> the having
applyed your self, as much as in you
lay, to combat by your Life those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Maxims, which she establish'd by
hers?</p>
                  <p>Had you liv'd with that Sage Queen,
as you ought to have done, you wou'd
not have been so averse to return to
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin:</hi> His way of living is
not by abundance so different from the
Queens, as yours. You wou'd at least
have learn'd not to make a Monster of
the Piety of your Husband; you wou'd
have learnt to come over to his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and besides the Authority of a
Husband, to have rever'd in him, the
Character of an Elect, which you make
the Subject of your Mockery, and the
reason of your Separation.</p>
                  <p>But which way can the Names of
the King, and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> be
made use of to excuse the Escape, and
Absence of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> after what
I have had the Honour to observe to
the Council at the last Hearing? While
she lives in the same Tranquility at
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99975:30"/>
                     <hi>London</hi> since their departure, that she
did in their peaceful Reign; while she
pays the same Incense to the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> that she offer'd to them, with
as much baseness and unworthiness, as
it was Honour to her, to pay that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
which she ow'd to them.</p>
                  <p>What Excuse has she now? Is the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> her Kinsman? Are all
these Gamesters, Libertines, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Episcopians, Quakers? In a word,
are all this Rabble of all Religions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the true one, which resort to her
House, her Relations? Let her shew
these unknown Alliances. But there are
none; 'tis only to have her Swinge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controul'd,
that she stays there.</p>
                  <p>GENTLEMEN, by this time, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
you are convinc'd, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was any case, that with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
requir'd the rigour of the Law:
Never any Woman that more amply
deserv'd to be declar'd incapable of
Dower, or Settlement, than Madam
<hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if your Indulgence still holds
your Arm, what greater Favour can
you afford her, than to suspend the
blow some Months, and give her time
to repent, and return to her Duty.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99975:31"/>
But if, instead of making a right use of
this Grace, she continues obstinate, and
to the slight of the Conjugal Authority,
adds a Contempt of yours; what Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can be too severe?</p>
                  <p>It is therefore but just, if you will
allow her any time to return to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> that you at the same
time declare the Penalty she incurrs, in
case of Disobedience; and pronounce her
<hi>ipso facto</hi> depriv'd of Dower, and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by virtue of this Judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
occasion for any other.</p>
                  <p>You must needs be sensible, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN,
that this is the only way to
procure Obedience to your Decrees; and
that without it, whatever Commands
you lay upon her to return, she, being
out of the King's Dominions, beyond
which you can exert no Authority, will
but laugh at your Orders: Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Power does not extend to her
Person, you must necessarily exercise it
upon her Estate, if you will compell her
to regard your Sentences.</p>
                  <p>This course was taken by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon an occasion, wherein 'twas
much less necessary, and against a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that less deserv'd it than Madam
<hi>Mazarin.</hi> 'Twas in the case of the Count
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99975:31"/>
of <hi>Clermont</hi> against the Countess his Wife.
She had not been so long withdrawn from
her Husband, as Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> from
hers: She went from him in a manner
no way scandalous, without being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off: She was in <hi>Paris,</hi> not <hi>England,</hi>
and her Conduct was much more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s: She had
likewise a plausible reason not to return
to her Husband, because She had a Suit
actually depending for the Separation of
Effects.</p>
                  <p>Yet because She appear'd to protract
the Suit, the Count of <hi>Clermont</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that She shou'd be oblig'd to return
to his House during the Process, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
remain depriv'd of her Settlement,
which was accordingly order'd.</p>
                  <p>The like Judgment was also obtain'd
by <hi>Torinon,</hi> the Notary, against his Wife,
altho' there was an actual Separation of
Effects, and the Separation adjudg'd, and
executed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see therefore, that Judgment
against Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> can by no
means be dispenc'd with, in case She
obstinately refuses to return to Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I believe, GENTLEMEN, that my
Demand is sufficiently fortified; I shall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99975:32"/>
now proceed to obviate the incident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She dares not openly declare, that She
will not return to <hi>France;</hi> She knows,
that She can't with Honour avow any
such thing, much less maintain it with
success: She declares therefore, that She
is ready and desirous to do it, but She
at the same time endeavours to elude
her offer, by the Conditions which She
tacks to it.</p>
                  <p>She alledges first, that She is detain'd
in <hi>England</hi> by her Debts, which She
has been forc'd to
contract, and which
amount to<note n="*" place="margin">8333l.—6s.—8d. Sterling.</note> 100000
Livers; that if Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd have her, he must
pay that Summ. She demands likewise,
that he be condemn'd to it, that She
may quit a Country, where, as She says,
for these are her Words, She can't stay
without endangering both Life, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
She says nothing of her Honour,
or Reputation; those She thinks safe in
all Countries.</p>
                  <p>You see, GENTLEMEN, that She sets
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> a price upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of seeing her, and that She rates it
pretty high: 'Tis plain, that her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99975:32"/>
is only to baffle his design,
well knowing, that in the present posture
of his Affairs, he can't raise so great a
Summ of ready Money, and that 'twill
not be easie to borrow it for that use.</p>
                  <p>In short, GENTLEMEN, I shall shew
you, that these Debts are but a sham
Pretence, and that She has nothing to
detain her in <hi>England,</hi> but her own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Will. To do this, I desire you to
make some Reflection thereon.</p>
                  <p>The first respects the time, when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> bethinks her self of saying,
that she is willing to return into <hi>France.</hi>
upon condition that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
may be oblig'd to discharge, and pay her
Debts. This She did not think on till
the Tenth of the last Month, in her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Petition.
Till then she was not aware of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
she had to return into <hi>France,</hi> or of
her being detain'd in <hi>England</hi> for her
Debts; She liv'd undisturb'd at <hi>London,</hi>
not only after the departure of the King
and Queen, but even after the Petition
of Monsie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which bears date
the 13th of <hi>April</hi> last. Seven Months
were requisite after this Petition, to make
her feel her own Wants, and the Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
She lay under to quit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Country,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99975:33"/>
where (according to her own words) her
Salvation and Life were in such Danger.
'Twas necessary, that her Councel at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
who drew her Answer, shou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her how things went at <hi>London,</hi>
before her Eyes, in her own Concerns,
and even in her own Breast. Had not
this been, and had She not been prest
to put in an Answer to the Petition of
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which was ready to
go by default, She had not only not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that She was in Debt, and that
her Life was in danger, but She had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
agreeably, and commodiously
there, and <hi>France</hi> had been forgotten for
ever.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not, GENTLEMEN, but this
Remark has already satisfied you, that
neither the Condition, nor the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> are such, as She
wou'd perswade us they are.</p>
                  <p>The second Reflection, which is yet
more convincing than the former, is,
That ever since the departure of the
King and Queen, it has lain wholly in
the Breast of Madam <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>rin</hi> whether
She wou'd return, or not, and is still
in her choice.</p>
                  <p>Upon reading her Defence, wou'd not
one conclude, that She were a close Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99975:33"/>
in <hi>London,</hi> or that she had a Guard
upon her House at least? Yet there is
nothing like it: We don't hear, that they
have made so much as a seizure of her
Goods; which if they had, She might,
by letting them go, purchase her own
Liberty; and Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> never
expected that She wou'd bring back,
what She carry'd away from <hi>Mazarin</hi>
House.</p>
                  <p>They have indeed produc'd an <hi>English</hi>
Certificate, sign'd, as they say, by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
at Law, and a Barrister of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London.</hi> But it certifies only, <hi>That
by the Law of that Country, the Creditors
of any Stranger might stop his Effects, and
Body, and proceed so against him, that he
shou'd not have the liberty of stirring out
of the Kingdom, till he had paid his Debts,
or given Security.</hi> These are the Terms
of the Certificate. What may we infer
from hence? Why, that the Creditors of
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> have perhaps a power,
to stop her, if they please; but so long
as they don't exert it, as assuredly they
have not yet done, nothing hinders her
leaving <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already, GENTLEMEN, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to you in the former Audience,
that they were so far from stopping her,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99975:34"/>
that the Convention, or Assembly of
Estates did their utmost to expell her;
and that She had not been suffer'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
there, but thro' the Interposition
of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it then that detains her? Is
it a tenderness of Conscience that will
not suffer her to leave her Creditors
in danger of losing their Debts, or the
fear of being tax'd with the breach of
her word, if she shou'd go without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
But were it not a just excuse, to
plead that She went away to put an
end at once to the Complaints of the
Convention, and Monsieur <hi>Mazarin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had not this Niceness, and these Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
been much more seasonable when
She took up her Resolution of running
away from the Palace of <hi>Mazarin?</hi>
Who cou'd imagine, that Madam <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
shou'd make a difficulty of leaving
<hi>England,</hi> because She owes a little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the <hi>English,</hi> that made none of
stealing her Self from her Husband, and
the Kingdom, to which She ow'd all,
to go into <hi>England?</hi> Does She think these
pretended Debts more sacred than the
Obligations of Wedlock, which She has
so highly outrag'd, and which incess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
recall her?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99975:34"/>
But let us enquire a little into these
pretended Debts: you shall see, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN,
not only that She cou'd
not have any Legal ones, but that in
reality She has not contracted any.</p>
                  <p>'Twere no hard matter to prove, that
supposing Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Debts, that they are <hi>Null,</hi> and can
neither oblige her, nor Monsieur <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi>
In the proof of this it may be
sufficient to observe, that She is a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
under <hi>Covert Baron,</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
incapable of obliging her self
without the consent of her Husband.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> her self has so far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
her own Incapacity, not
only of contracting, but even of sueing
without the Authority of her Husband,
or a Court of Justice, that, as you
know GENTLEMEN, She has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
presented her Petition to the Council
for leave in this very case, to draw up
against him such incident Demands, as
She shou'd think necessary for her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
And the Council has expresly
authoriz'd her for that purpose, judging,
that without that She was not in capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to engage her self in these pretended
Debts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99975:35"/>
It is not enough to say, that this were
a good Argument against Debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in <hi>France,</hi> but that our Laws,
which disable a Wife for entering into
Obligations, are of no force in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, the Council knows, that to
judge of any Person's Capacity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting,
the Laws of the Place of his
Habitation only are consulted; and by
those Laws the State of his Person is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated;
and wheresoever he goes, he
carries along with him those Personal
Qualities, that Character of Capacity,
or Incapacity, which they impress upon
him. By consequence, Madam <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
being Married under the Laws of
this Kingdom, and having her Mansion
always here, notwithstanding her Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
She bears her Subjection to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of her Husband about her every
where; and before whatsoever Judges
these Obligations may be brought, they
can't but declare 'em <hi>Null,</hi> pursuant
to the tenour of our Laws.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>English,</hi> or other Strangers, who
may have contracted with her, ought
to have inform'd themselves of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
They ought to have known, that
a Woman Married in <hi>France,</hi> who has a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99975:35"/>
Husband actually living, has not by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, shaken off her dependance,
or acquir'd any right of disposing of her
Effects; and therefore they ought to
thank themselves for those Loans. And
I am perswaded, that the <hi>Judges</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> wou'd in this case do her the
same Justice, that the Council, and
other Soveraign Tribunals of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
do every day to Strangers, whose
Differences are brought before 'em.</p>
                  <p>I question not likewise, but these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
are void by the particular Laws
of <hi>England;</hi> which, as we all know,
are deriv'd from those of the <hi>Normans,</hi>
who have always us'd their Wives to a
greater Subjection to their Husbands,
and laid 'em under a more absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
from entring into Obligations,
than the rest of our Country: But this
is a superfluous enquiry, since 'tis indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> is subject
to the Laws of <hi>France,</hi> and that her
Subjection and Incapacity of contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is inseparable from her wherever
She is.</p>
                  <p>It is not enough, GENTLEMEN, to
prove to you the <hi>Nullity</hi> of these pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Debts, I shall farther prove to you,
that they are supposititious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:99975:36"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> What probability is there, that
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> shou'd have occasion to
borrow? She carried off with her above
100000 Crowns in Jewels, Plate, Silver
Stuff, and rich Moveables, which be
sure She wou'd first turn into Money,
before she came to borrowing.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, as I have already told
you, Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> remitted to her
divers Summs in the first Years of her
Absence; and as soon as She set foot in
<hi>England,</hi> the deceas'd King allow'd her
a Pension of 58000 Livers a Year, in
consideration of the Summ of 900000
Livers which he ow'd to Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin;</hi>
and this Pension was continued
to her by the present King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who never
kept either Horses or Equipage in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
say, that She is not able to subsist
on this Pension? Without reckoning the
Advantage (not so honourable as real)
which She makes of those that play
daily with her, and which amounts
higher than one wou'd imagine. Can
it be possible, that with so considerable
an Income, She shou'd be reduc'd to a
necessity of borrowing? Wou'd not this
argue her of an inexcusable Profuseness,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99975:36"/>
of which we are not willing to suspect
her?</p>
                  <p>But if it ben't probable, that She
shou'd have any occasion to borrow, it
is much less so, that She shou'd find any
Lenders of so confiderable a Summ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they were willing to lose it, and
make her a Present under colour of a
Loan. Cou'd any one be so imprudent,
as to trust his Money with a Fugitive
Stranger under <hi>Covert Baron,</hi> that cou'd
dispose of nothing? Which of us wou'd
lend his Money to a Stranger in her Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances?
These Debts therefore are
a meer Sham.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> has not made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that She is prosecuted by any
of her Creditors, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd;
She does not produce Copies of
those Obligations, which She pretends
to have enter'd into; nor has She so
much as brought in the State of these
Debts, or given a List of the Names of
the Creditors; Wou'd She have omitted
these Proofs, if the Debts had been real?
And without 'em can She expect, that
upon her bare word, that She owes a
hundred thousand Livers, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the occasions of her contracting these
pretended Debts, or the Names of her
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99975:37"/>
Creditors, we shou'd condemn Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> to pay her 100000 Livers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to lavish upon her Creatures, and
pay 'em for Services, which Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> has no reason to reward? But
you, GENTEMEN, are too clear sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
too wise to suffer your selves to be
taken in so palpable a Trap.</p>
                  <p>Let us proceed to t'other incident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> She demands,
that upon her return into <hi>Frante,</hi> She be
permitted to retire into a Convent, and
that the Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
to pay her
<note n="*" place="margin">2000 l. Sterling.</note> 24000 Livers a year.</p>
                  <p>I shall not advance any thing that's
new to you, GENTLEMEN, when I
say that 'tis a constant Rule in Law, that
a Wife can't be allow'd the liberty of
leaving her Husband, and fixing her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
apart from her Husband, unless he
give her occasion for it by his harsh
Treatment of her. Thus <hi>Anthony Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ac</hi>
observes upon <hi>l. 5. Cod. de repud, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire
semper cogi potest, nisi doceat de saevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis
mariti.</hi> How long soever She may
have been absent from him, She may still
be compell'd to return, because no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99975:37"/>
will hold against the Rights of
Marriage.</p>
                  <p>This has been a Rule in all Ages, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all People, and all Religions;
even the <hi>Pagans</hi> themselves, who were
ignorant of the Sanctity of Matrimony,
observ'd it by the meer light of natural
Reason: How much more inviolable
then ought it to be amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who look upon it as a Type of the
inseparable Union of CHRIST, and his
<hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> ought to set forth the
evil Treatment She has receiv'd from
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which may autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
such a Separation of Habitation, as
She desires, and make her Husband her
Tributary. This is what Master <hi>Sachot</hi>
ought to do; after which, I hope the
Council will grant me one hour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> from those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
which I can't at present fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time I beseech the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
by way of advance, to make some
Reflections upon this Matter.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> does
so far acknowledge, that She has not
sufficient occasion to demand a separate
Habitation; that She dares not bring her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99975:38"/>
Action for it; but endeavours to obtain
that indirectly, which She can't directly
pretend to: She desires, that without a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Separation, which She dares not
offer at, you wou'd separate 'em in effect,
by alloting her a Habitation apart from
her Husband.</p>
                  <p>My second Observation is, that She
cou'd not have from him any ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or lawful cause of Separation:
Of this I have an undeniable proof from
the Fact of the adverse Party her self.
At the time when She left her Husband's
House, and the Kingdom, She had a
Suit actually depending against him for
a Separation. But what sort of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did She desire? A simple Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Effects. Wou'd this Lady, that
try'd all Methods possible or impossible
to withdraw her self from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and sight of her Husband, have
fail'd to have brought an Action for
Separation of Habitation, which was
her most natural way, if She had thought
She had the least Pretence to support it?
Wou'd She have taken this strange Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of running away in a scandalous,
criminal manner, which wou'd not only
stick an eternal blemish on her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but had expos'd her to the severest
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99975:38"/>
Punishments, if She had been overtaken,
and Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd have left
her to the rigour of the Law.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore certain, nor can a more
convincing proof be given, that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> at the time of her flight had
met with no ill Treatment from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin.</hi> And this, GENTLEMEN,
is a Demonstration of the extraordinary
Temper of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin;</hi> for he
must have a vast stock of Patience to
bear so long, without being provok'd,
all the occasions of complaint, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> gave him during the two
last years that they liv'd together. Nay,
I may say, that he has given us an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that he never will be provok'd
against her, let her do what She lists;
for 'tis impossible She shou'd give him
greater reason to be so, then She did in
those two last years.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, at the meeting of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,</hi>
nothing was objected against Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> that was worthy the least
notice; they did not accuse him of any
ill usage: The only thing that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Party reproach'd him with,
at which all their Complaints, or rather
their Railleries were level'd, was his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:99975:39"/>
But was it ever heard, that Devotion
was a reason for Separation? It has been
pretended, that a Man turning <hi>Jew, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
or <hi>Heretick,</hi> his Wife might sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
her self from him, and even procure
a dissolution of the Marriage. But may
She forsake him for being devout? Must
he abjure his Devotion to recover his
Wife? This is Doctrine that they will
not dare openly to maintain.</p>
                  <p>Yet 'tis all that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> has
to object against her Husband, She can't
deny, but that he has always carried
himself with all possible respect towards
her; that he has always furnish'd her
with all that's necessary, not only for
the convenience of Life, but for her
Pleasure, and the support of her Quality
with Splendor.</p>
                  <p>She can't deny, that he has all those
Qualities, which make a Man of Honor,
and true Merit; Courage, and Valour,
of which he gave sufficient Proof, when
he was great Master of the Artillery,
and Lieutenant General; Constancy,
Acuteness, Delicacy of Wit, Greatness
of Mind, which makes him despise
Wealth, or not desire it, but to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it well; great Liberality to the
Poor, and as great Moderation in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99975:39"/>
to himself: His Absence gives me
opportunity to say that, which his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
wou'd not suffer, were he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> acknowledg'd all
these great Qualities in him for the first
five or six years of their Marriage, and
paid that Justice to 'em, that was
due.</p>
                  <p>'Tis his Fault I confess, to be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and solicitous for the Health of his
Soul; a Fault, which wou'd not appear
such to any Wife, that were not her self
somewhat irreligious. I will own too,
if you please, that there may be both
in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> gayer, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanter,
sprightlier Men, which have an
Air of tenderness beyond Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
and more agreeable to the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Madam <hi>Mazarin;</hi> but will
that justifie the slighting and leaving
such a Husband as he?</p>
                  <p>A Wife, that meets with no ill usage
from her Husband, shou'd not believe,
that there is in the World a genteeler,
more agreeable, better humour'd Man,
than he: And tho' She cou'd not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her self of that, yet She ought
to consider, that Providence having join'd
her to him, She is no longer at liberty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99975:40"/>
to choose, nor examine whether another
might please her better.</p>
                  <p>She ought to think of those Texts of
Scripture, which bind Women insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to the Persons of their Husbands;
which enjoins 'em to serve, and obey
him; which say that they two ought
to make but one Flesh. Have we any
other Law, any other Gospel, which
allows Wives to shake off all Duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such frivolous Pretences?</p>
                  <p>How will this agree with that other
Precept given to all Christians, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Husbands and Wives, because a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Union is requir'd betwixt 'em, which
enjoyns 'em to bear with one another's
Faults? Is the Devotion of a Husband
a Fault so insupportable, that it deserves
a peculiar Exception?</p>
                  <p>On the other side, has Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
nothing to remit to Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin?</hi>
Does She think her self without
Faults? We shall not indeed accuse her
of that; But has She none, that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to it, and more grievous to a
Husband, than that can be to a Wife?
If we put the Faults of one, and t'other,
into the Ballance, do you think, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN,
that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd
have so much the advantage, and that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99975:40"/>
hers wou'd not surpass his, both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and weight? Nevertheless, Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> is willing to excuse, to forgive,
and to forget all: He is ready to receive
her, and to treat her honourably, as he
has always done: Will not Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
pardon him this one Crime, Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which most reasonable Women
wish for in their Husbands?</p>
                  <p>There is one Reflection on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
yet behind; Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> refuses
to return to her Husband, only because
his House is too severely regulated for
her, because he will have no Plays in
his House, for he does not forbid her see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em elsewhere; in a word, She is
afraid of want of Diversion, and the
liberty of inviting the Gamesters thither,
and receiving as much Company as She
desires. These are the only reasons that
induce Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to desire permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to retire into a Convent.</p>
                  <p>But does She think, that these things
will be more tolerated in a Convent,
than in his House? Are not these pretty
Dispositions to carry into a Religious
House? What can you expect, but an
entire Dissolution of Discipline in that
Monastery, to which you make so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a Present?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:99975:41"/>
What I say, GENTLEMEN, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by Experiments divers times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> had already,
before She left the Kingdom, honour'd
several Convents with her Presence. The
Abbies of <hi>Lys Chelles,</hi> and of the Nuns
of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and some others, will never
forget the honour of those Frollicks Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> has had there; the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of which will be kept up by
Tradition in those Houses for many
Ages.</p>
                  <p>The Question then is, Whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> shall go into a Convent,
which She will undoubtedly spoil; or
return to Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who will
endeavour, if possible, to mend her. I
doubt not, but you are easily determin'd
in the choice of these two Expedients.</p>
                  <p>I am fully perswaded, that if these
two Princes, as great by their Merit, as
Birth, who have hitherto afforded her
the honour of their Protection, had been
rightly inform'd of the State of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
they wou'd have been very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of espousing her Quarrel.</p>
                  <p>They had been told without doubt, of
what has been reported in the World,
that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> had a mind to
possess himself of his Wife's Estate, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99975:41"/>
to that end aspers'd her Conduct: But
being inform'd by the Pleadings which
they have honour'd with their Presence,
that the sole aim of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> is
to reunite his Wife to him; We are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd,
that they will be so far from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
her revolt, that they will give
her Advice becoming them, and their
Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>What Interest can they have to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
this Vagabond Life in a Person, that
has the honour to be their Relation? Or
what motive of Justice can induce 'em to
rob Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> of a Wife, which
themselves, and all their Family, have
solemnly given to him at the Altar?</p>
                  <p>What probability is there, that they
shou'd consent to have their Great Names,
and Authority made use of to divide
those whom the Church has joyn'd, and
to destroy the handy work of God? We
will not fear any such thing from the
Blood of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and <hi>Lewis the Great;</hi>
from the Blood which has always defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the right of Altars, and the Discipline
of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus, GENTLEMEN, all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
you to restore Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to
her Husband; the Law enjoyns it, the
Honour of the Publick requires it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99975:42"/>
                     <hi>Mazarin</hi> earnestly desires it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> alone opposes it, but She
opposes it not only without reason, or
lawful Occasion, as I have already shewn,
but even against her own proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
                  <p>Does She think it nothing by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
to put a stop to all those foul Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
which since her Elopement, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
has assum'd a sort of right to spread
concerning her Conduct? Is not She a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of confirming 'em by her obstinate
refusal to return to her Husband, from
whom She has never met with any ill
Usage? Is not She apprehensive, that
the care She takes to fly from him, and
hide her self from his Sight, shou'd be
imputed to the Reproaches of her own
Conscience, and the Shame of her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour
towards him, rather than the
Imperfection of her Husband?</p>
                  <p>But let us leave this Worldly Glory,
which Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> perhaps despises:
She testifies at least some serious concern
for her Soul in her Answer, since to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the danger that in <hi>England</hi> 'tis in,
She demands 100000 Livers to enable
her to come away. This is a laudable
Disposition, but we must not leave this
great Work imperfect; which it wou'd
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99975:42"/>
be, if returning into <hi>France,</hi> Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> lives separate from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
contrary to the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> her self will not be
long e're She acknowledges the Grace,
that you will do her. When She feels
that happy Calm, which is not to be
found out of that State, wherein Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has been pleas'd to place us, She
will bless the Storm that drove her into
the Harbour; She will thank you for
the obliging violence you do her, to
draw her out of her Labyrinths.</p>
                  <p>I despair not but in time She will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recover
that Esteem, and Tenderness
for Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> which She had
in the first years of their Marriage:
They were too vigorous to be quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd;
and the reflection She will
make on his Goodness in making the first
Advances towards their Re-union, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
tendring her his hand, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
all past occasions of Complaint
and Resentment, which She has given
him, will redouble her Respect, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for him.</p>
                  <p>They will find in themselves more
Sympathy, than even in their first years:
If the Zeal of the Duke in the fervour
of its first Sallies had something too
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99975:43"/>
rough, and austere, as it usually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens;
The Dutchess will find it mellow'd
by time and habitude. And I doubt not,
but that on her part, Maturity of years,
the Fatigues She has undergone, and the
Reflections She has made, have qualified
the immoderate Passion for Pleasure, which
She then had.</p>
                  <p>But tho' Time shou'd have made no
alteration in her Humour, yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> having
been so severely punish'd by a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of twenty years, for offering to take
the Liberty to correct her, will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it any more, without the nicest
Precaution; and that he will pay such
an extraordinary Complaisance, as will
gain extreamly upon the Heart of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> when She considers how
little She has done to merit it.</p>

                  <p>IF Marriage were such a Society, as
either Party might dissolve, by a
simple Renunciation: If a Husband held
his Title only by Commission, which
might be taken away at his Wife's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
Or, if we liv'd in those happy times,
which have been with such pleasure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99975:44"/>
on, and seem to be so much regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when Women counted their years
by the number of their Husbands; and
when a simple change of Mind was a
sufficient reason for a Divorce; there
might be something in what has been
urg'd to you, whereon to ground this
Separation, which Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
wou'd indirectly obtain.</p>
                  <p>More Zeal cou'd not have been shewn,
than her Council have made appear in
their Plea for a Separation; but the
means whereon to ground it according
to our Customs, amongst Christians
that look upon the Rights of Marriage
as Sacred, and this Society as indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble;
that ill usage which a Husband
must shew to his Wife, to lay a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for a Separation, is what I have
not heard the least offer to prove, thro'
the whole Plea of the adverse Party.</p>
                  <p>I shall venture to say farther, that
their way of expressing themselves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
what I have had the honour of
telling you in the first Audience; that
this desire of being remov'd from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> did not flow from the
proper Motions of Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s
own Heart, but that She was acted by
the Spirit of another in all this matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99975:45"/>
This, GENTLEMEN, appears suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
in the hard opprobrious terms
that have been cast upon Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
which cou'd never proceed from
the Mouth of a reasonable Woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her Husband; She ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
without insulting, to endeavour to
raise the Compassion of her Judges, and
not the laughter of the Audience: She
ought to lay open the Injuries he does
her, and not affect to do him any:
She ought in short to acknowledge, and
respect in him always the hand of God,
which has given him to her for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
                  <p>This Character a Woman of Sense
wou'd always maintain in these sort of
Actions; and tho' She thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in her Heart, yet Prudence wou'd
forbid her to let it appear.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
have kept up that Character of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and Sweetness, that is so very
natural to her, and that She has for all
the rest of the World; and She wou'd
have inspir'd it into those, that She had
charg'd with her Defence, if that had
been any part of her Care. She wou'd
have avoided dishonouring, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
a Name which She bears; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99975:45"/>
making that Man ridiculous, whose Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Infamy She is by her Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
oblig'd to share.</p>
                  <p>But what still better proves how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> is concern'd in what
has been pleaded to you, is the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
between the principal Facts,
which they have advanc'd, and those
which She her self has publish'd in her
Apology, under the Title of her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs;
to excuse that Conduct, which
She judged rightly, that all the World
wou'd blame. It is not likely, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd give Instructions
for a Defence to be made before you,
so different from that which She has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to all Nations of the Earth in that
History, which is translated into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
different Languages.</p>
                  <p>This, GENTLEMEN, Master <hi>Sachot</hi>
honestly avows, that he has receiv'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Memoirs, nor Instructions, from
Madam <hi>Mazarin:</hi> And I am very glad,
for the Interest of his Client, as well as
mine, that he has made this Confession,
which justifies 'em both; by informing
us that these biting Railleries, these scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Charges, the Accusations of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy,
Hypocrisie, and Folly, do not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99975:46"/>
come from Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but are
suggested by some Foreign Malice.</p>
                  <p>But Master <hi>Sachot</hi> must excuse me, if
in praising at once his Zeal, and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
I make bold to complain of his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in pleading in the Name of a Wife,
so many injurious things against her
Husband; not only without the least
proof, but even without the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
or Warrant for it. Methinks
a Man so exact as he, that expects that
I shou'd produce Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s
Hand to warrant my saying, that he
will suffer his Wife to go to a Play,
shou'd be much more oblig'd to have
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s, to give the Publick
this Farce at her Husband's Expence;
and to make such a Satyr upon him, as
reflects upon her self.</p>
                  <p>But from what hand soever these shafts
come, which are let flye at us, 'tis no
difficult matter to ensure Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
against 'em; and to shew, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that has been urg'd against him, in
all these Pleadings, ought to do him the
least damage, either in his Cause, or in
the Opinion of the World.</p>
                  <p>I might, GENTLEMEN, neglect the
Story, as foreign to our Cause as it is
false, of 50000 Crowns promis'd by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99975:46"/>
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> to Monsieur the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Frejus,</hi> to promote this Match;
of which, as they say, he has since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Payment. But since they have
taken occasion from it, to harangue, not
only against Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but in
some measure against Devotion it self;
I think it convenient to acquaint the
Publick, that this Story is a meer Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>As there is no proof offer'd, a bare
denyal may suffice; but to give it the
more weight, I desire your leave to read
what Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> writes to me
hereupon, in a Letter which I receiv'd
yesterday from him; 'tis well known
how incapable he is to assert a Lie, or
deny a Truth; and how tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd
he is in that point; so that I doubt
not but the Council will do him the
honour to believe him, before Madam
<hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing can be more false, than the
Agreement for 50000 Crowns, with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur,
the Bishop of <hi>Frejus;</hi> he never said,
or stipulated a Word; the late Cardinal
<hi>Mazarin</hi> projected our Marriage, with
Monsieur <hi>Tellier</hi> the Chancellor: 'Tis true,
that Monsieur the Bishop of <hi>Freius</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99975:47"/>
made a Confident. Where's the Sense
of drolling upon a falshood, an imaginary
breach of Word?</p>
                  <p>Having read this, I shall make but one
Remark, which is, that to me it seems
very difficult to reconcile the Fact of this
Perjury (for so they call it, and such it
were, if true) with the Character which
they have given Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> thro'
all the rest of their Pleadings. Wou'd
a Man, that gives all his substance to the
Poor, that sacrifices Millions to purchase
Heaven, be guilty of Perfidy, to save
50000 Crowns?</p>
                  <p>You make his Devotion prodigal, and
covetous at the same time; charitable,
and perfidious, giving profusely where
'tis not due, and refusing basely where
'tis. You ought at least to give him a
more equal Character, and to sort your
Fictions better, if you wou'd have 'em
believ'd.</p>
                  <p>Let us now return to those Facts,
which have Relation to our Case.</p>
                  <p>They have pass'd very slightly over
the manner of Monsieur and Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s living together in the first
years of their Marriage; because indeed
they dare not deny, that they liv'd in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99975:47"/>
great Concord. Now this is a matter
of extream Importance: For they have
told you, and it is true, GENTLEMEN,
that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> was devout at
the time of his Marriage, as he still is.
How then comes this Devotion to be
so odious to her, after She had born with
it for six years together, without the
least diminution of her Affection for
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin?</hi> What reasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
can She make for her Elopement,
or for the Demand that She makes to
be authoriz'd to live apart from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Temper is no way
alter'd, his Sentiments are the same that
they were at the time of their Marriage;
that golden Age, when they liv'd in
perfect Union. 'Tis therefore Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> that is chang'd; which can be
nothing, but the effect of her Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
had She continued in those good
Inclinations, She had with my Client
enjoy'd the same Happiness and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
to this day.</p>
                  <p>They pass thence to the time of her
Flight; they thought themselves oblig'd
for her honour, to say, that She had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
abundance before She took up that
Resolution: But since these Grievances
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99975:48"/>
never appear'd, since She never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of 'em, since She contented her
self with a simple Action for a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Effects; they are forc'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that her silence was the result of
her Discretion; that She thought her self
oblig'd as a Mother, to demand a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Effects, to hinder the ruine of
her Children; but that She neglected
what related to her own proper Ease
and Interest only.</p>
                  <p>Here's a very laudable Discretion,
that will not suffer Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to
tell her Case, and seek Remedy from
Justice; yet does not hinder her from
running away in the Habit of a Man,
with one of the most agreeable, but
least discreet Lords of the Court.</p>
                  <p>But the point of Discretion is no
longer to be disputed; the Mask is off;
therefore you must immediately lay
open, that ill Usage, those intolerable
Hardships, which have forc'd her upon the
cruel necessity of throwing her self into
the Arms of the Chevalier <hi>de Rohan;</hi> For
'tis to no purpose to suppress his Name,
since you have nam'd him. Or if Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> has not proceeded so far as
ill Usage, tell us at least what Menaces,
what disobliging Discourses She has had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99975:48"/>
from him? You owe an account of 'em
to the Council, to the Publick, to the
Justification of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> and
to the Defence of her Cause.</p>
                  <p>Wou'd you perswade the Council,
that 'tis out of Modesty, that you conceal
these things? Do you think it sufficient
to affect a mysterious Air, and to say,
that you are unwilling to affront Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> so far, as to tell necessary
Truths, when you offer him so many,
and so gross Injuries; and lay, without
any occasion, so many false Crimes to his
Charge?</p>
                  <p>You see therefore evidently, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN,
that the Silence of Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> before her Flight, and of her
Advocate at present concerning those
hardships, which they in general Terms
say She has suffer'd, are in a manner so
many formal Acknowledgments, that
She has not met with any.</p>
                  <p>You have been told, that what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to flie, was, that
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> foreseeing that he
shou'd be cast in the case of Separation,
frighted Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> away design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
by false Intelligence; that he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn'd
Persons to tell her, that She wou'd
be overthrown, and that then he wou'd
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99975:49"/>
shut her up between four Walls; but
what confirm'd this Resolution, was, that
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> obtain'd a Decree to take
her into his Custody, and that She fear'd
that he wou'd seize her by Virtue of it.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> in her Memoirs,
which are in every Bodies hands, says,
that what made her take up a Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of leaving the Kingdom, was, that
She knew that the GENTLEMEN of
the great Chamber wou'd reject her Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
for Separation of Effects, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
her to return to her Husband: That
this Advice came from so good hands,
and he that gave it her made so ticklish
a step in it, that She wou'd never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his Name. Give me leave, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN,
to read this Passage to you,
which is conceiv'd in Terms more strong
than I have reported.</p>
                  <q>
                     <bibl>Memoir, Fol. 119.</bibl>
                     <p>During these Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ils, Our Suit went still
fowards; Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> was as much
favour'd by the Old Men, as I by the Young
Ones. At the end of three Months, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
advice, that he had made himself
Master of the Great Chamber; that his
Party cou'd do any thing there, and that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99975:49"/>
he might have what Decree he pleas'd; and
that they wou'd not only deny me a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Effects, which I desir'd; but wou'd
take from me that of the Body, which I then
enjoy'd, and did not sue to them for; that
in short, according to the Rules of Law,
the Judges cou'd not avoid ordering me to
return to my Husband, tho' they had been
as favourable to me, as they were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
If this Advice had come from a
less friendly hand, I might have nam'd my
Authors; but as in doing it, they made a
very hazardous step, they exacted Secrecy of
me, which I will keep for ever. Judge
then, what I was to expect from Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> if I had return'd to him upon
a Decree, having the Court, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
against me; and, after so many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of Resentment, as he thought he
had. These were the Motives of that so
strange, and so much blam'd Resolution of
retiring into <hi>Italy</hi> to my Relations.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>You see, GENTLEMEN, what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> her self says; it is not
therefore true, that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
was like to lose his Cause; nor that he
caus'd false Intelligence to be given to
Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99975:50"/>
As for the Warrant to take Madam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> How can that be pretended to
have been the occasion of her Flight,
which was not obtain'd till two days
after She was gone; and which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
only on that occasion? And 'twas
this very Warrant, which gives him Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to make pursuit after her. She
made her escape in the Night, on the
13th or 14th of <hi>June,</hi> and the Warrant
was issued on the 15th. How cou'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> petition for leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> when She was
actually lodg'd in his House.</p>
                  <p>All these Excuses therefore are stark
naught, and we may take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> had no other
reason for her Flight, than her own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and Passion.</p>
                  <p>But, say they, Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> saw
strange Waste, the rich Furniture dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd
day by day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She saw her self
upon the brink of Ruine, and her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
like to be the poorest Gentlemen
in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Who wou'd have believ'd, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
that Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Heiress
shou'd have run away, and left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for fear of Poverty, and Starving
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99975:50"/>
in <hi>France?</hi> So that this Pretence is as
frivolous as the rest.</p>
                  <p>But the rich Moveables disappear'd,
you say; If you mean those of your
own Apartment, you are in the right;
for you carried 'em away your selves;
and they disappear'd in a very ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for they have serv'd to facilitate
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Flight, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
her foolish Extravagancies.</p>
                  <p>But all the other Moveables remain'd,
and do so still; those only excepted,
which Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> gave to my
Ladies, his Daughters, upon their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
and there is yet in the Palace of
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> to above the value of a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
In the same case are all the Effects
of the Cardinal; my Client has not
sold one Farthings Worth, as I shall shew
by and by, in the proper Place.</p>
                  <p>But suppose there had been squander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will that excuse the Flight of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin?</hi> Will that justifie her
abandoning her Husband, and his House?
On the contrary, is not a Woman the
more oblig'd to stay at home, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
or hinder by her Advice, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness
of her Husband; or, by her
Oeconomy, to repair it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:99975:51"/>
You have been told, GENTLEMEN,
that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> rejoyc'd at the
Flight of his Wife, tho' he feign'd an
Affliction; that his Friends came to
wish him Joy of it, and that he wou'd
not lay hold on those occasions of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
that were offer'd him.</p>
                  <p>Don't insult the Sorrow, that this scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Flight has given Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
for himself, and her Interest; It has
been but too piercing, too publick, and
of too long continuance; Madam <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
her self says so of it in her Memoirs;
She raises a Trophy upon it, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
will take it ill, that you pluck it
down, and rob her of the Honour.</p>
                  <p>My Client's Friends might perhaps
be glad of it, because being unprejudic'd,
they judg'd more truly of the matter;
but as for him, he is not asham'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his weakness, and avow, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ever wounded him so deep; and
that he did his utmost to prevent her
going out of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This it was, that drew that Answer
so full of Spirit, and Wisdom, from a
Mouth accustom'd to deliver nothing
but Oracles. <hi>(You ought rather to desire
my Orders to the Governours to keep her
out of</hi> France, <hi>than to keep her in.)</hi> But
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99975:51"/>
how cou'd Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> advantage
himself by that Advice, which, as you
see, he is not yet in a Capacity to make
use of?</p>
                  <p>They have trump'd up again the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what past, when Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
return'd into <hi>France</hi> with Monsieur, the
Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> that She was brought
to Court by order of the King, and had
the honour to talk with him. They give
an account of this matter directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Truth, and to that which
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> her self has given of it
in her Memoirs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that the King understanding
that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was at <hi>Nevers,</hi> and
being griev'd to see the Misfortunes into
which She plung'd her self, and reduc'd
her Husband, had the Goodness to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in order to reconcile 'em.</p>
                  <p>He Commanded Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to
come to Court, and gave her his Word
(which is the best Safeguard that even
his Enemies can have) that She shou'd
have no violence offer'd her; and that if
She did not come to an Accommodation
with Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> She shou'd be
reconducted out of the Kingdom in safety.
The Lady <hi>Belizany</hi> went for her by his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99975:52"/>
Order, and brought her to Madam <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's</hi>
House.</p>
                  <p>She had the honour to talk with the
King, who did not propose to her, what
they have pleaded, to stay at <hi>Paris,</hi> and
prosecute her Suit of Separation. Had
not that been a pretty Accommodation,
and worthy the Care of so great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch?
Such a hand as his ought perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to heal all that it touches; and She
had another sort of Process to look after,
than that of Separation of Effects; and
She wou'd have been very happy, if one
might have compensated for t'other.</p>
                  <p>The King propos'd (as She her self
owns in her Memoirs) to her, to be
perfectly reconcil'd to her Husband, and
to return to her House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propos'd it, as She confesses, but he
advis'd it likewise.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty had the Goodness to add
such Conditions, as ought to have stifled
all her Caprices, and with which any
other Woman wou'd have been highly
satisfied; <hi>(That Monsieur</hi> Mazarin <hi>shou'd
have no Inspection of her Servants, and
that She sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>'d not accompany him in his
Journies;)</hi> and some other such like, in
which he was willing to indulge the ill
humour of Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:99975:52"/>
Yet all this wou'd not content her,
She prefer'd her own Whimsies before
the obliging Counsel of the wisest Prince
on Earth; She declar'd positively, that
She wou'd not return to Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> and desir'd him to reconduct
her into <hi>Italy,</hi> with the Pension of 24000
Livers which he had given her hopes
of. It is not true, that She chose to
stay in <hi>France,</hi> and that the King oblig'd
her to leave it; and the Placet, or Letter
which they have read in this Audience
is a spurious Piece, and her own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
give the lye to it; I desire the
leave of the Council to read her Account
of this matter.</p>

with an Exempt, and Guards, in Madam
<hi>Colbert</hi>'s Coach, with whom my Brother
had desir'd the King to lodge me, as a place
where no body cou'd oblige me to disguise my
Sentiments: Two or three days after he
made me come to Madam <hi>Montespan</hi>'s to
talk with him; I shall never forget the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with which he receiv'd me, even to pray
me to consider, that if he had not made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99975:53"/>
Terms for me in what had pass'd, <hi>my
Conduct had depriv'd him of the means;</hi>
that he wou'd have me speak my Mind free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if I was absolutely determin'd to
return to <hi>Italy,</hi> he wou'd give me a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of 24000 Franks, but <hi>that he wou'd
advice me to stay;</hi> that he wou'd make my
Accommodation as advantagious as I pleas'd;
<hi>that I shou'd not follow Monsieur</hi> Mazarin
<hi>in any of his Journeys; and that he shou'd
have nothing to do with my Domesticks;</hi>
and that if his Caresses were ungrateful to
me, I shou'd not be oblig'd to suffer 'em; and
that he wou'd give me till to morrow to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it.</p>
                     <p>I cou'd easily have answer'd him upon the
spot, as I did the next day.</p>
                     <p>That after having endeavour'd to take
away my Honour, as Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> has
done; after refusing to receive me again,
when I offer'd to return without any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he knew the extream neeessity I
was in, I cou'd not prevail upon my self to
return to him; that whatsoever Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might be taken, he was of such a Humor,
that I must necessarily suffer twenty hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
from him daily, which it wou'd not be
proper to trouble his Majesty withal; and
that I accepted with abundance of thanks,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99975:53"/>
the Pension which he was pleas'd to bestow
upon me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After so substantial Reasons, you will be
surpriz'd to hear,</hi> that all the World blam'd
my Resolution, <hi>but the Judgments of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
differ very much from those of other
Men. Madam</hi> de Montespan, <hi>and Madam</hi>
Colbert <hi>did all that lay in their Power to
oblige me to stay; and Monsieur</hi> Lauzun
<hi>ask'd me,</hi> what I intended to do with my
24000 Franks? That I shou'd eat 'em out
at the first Inn, and be forc'd to return
shamefully for more, which wou'd not
be given me.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>You see, GENTLEMEN, what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they had of this good Manager, that
accuses her Husband of Profusion.</p>
                  <p>The King not being able to perswade
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> was oblig'd to make
good his Word, and to cause her to be
convey'd in safety out of the Kingdom.
After this manner things went: we
shall in the sequel examine those Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> pretends to draw
from hence.</p>
                  <p>We shall now proceed to an Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the means, which have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
you. I shall not reply to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Curiosities, which they have
brought, the use of the Divorce in Old
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99975:54"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Inclination the <hi>Roman</hi>
Ladies had to put it in Practice; 'tis
nothing to our Cause, unless they mean
'em as Precedents, to shew that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> is not the first, whose Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have stood that way; that She does
not degenerate from those Ladies from
whom perhaps She is descended; and
that She has in this a Soul truly <hi>Roman;</hi>
but all this does not exempt her from
the Penalties enacted against those La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in the <hi>Novells,</hi> which I have
cited.</p>
                  <p>They have endeavour'd to avoid the
force of those Laws by a twofold An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> they pretend 'em to be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in Force, since the abolition of the
Divorce; after which only the Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Dower took place, of which it was
a consequence, and without it never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
                  <p>I have already in my Plea, provided
against this Objection, and shewn you,
GENTLEMEN, that the Abolition of
the Divorce, which was one of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
of the ill Conduct of Wives,
ought to be so far from exempting 'em
from t'other, which was the Privation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99975:54"/>
of Dower, that this latter becomes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the more necessary.</p>
                  <p>You have seen likewise, that 'tis the
Intent of our Customs, divers of which
conclude expresly for it; that 'tis the
Practice of the Soveraign Courts, that
'tis an adjudg'd Case, to all which I have
not heard any Answer.</p>
                  <p>We must therefore allow, that our
Law in this agrees exactly with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Laws; and that the abolishing the
use of Divorces, has not abrogated this
Penalty.</p>
                  <p>The second Objection which they
make, is that there is in the <hi>Novells,</hi> a
Clause of Exception for those Women,
that retire to their Fathers, or Mothers.
This they say extends to Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin;</hi>
because in case of a want of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Mother, the other near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
fill their Room; and especially
when they are cloth'd with eminent Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which challenges for them the same
respect that is due to Parents; and to
this Position I agree.</p>
                  <p>Now say they, when Madam with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
first into <hi>Italy,</hi> She Lodg'd with
Monsieur the Cardinal <hi>Mancini,</hi> a Man
of great Virtue: This likewise is true;
but they ought to add that Cardinal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99975:55"/>
                     <hi>Mancini</hi> soon finding his Authority too
weak to keep her within those Bounds,
that he desir'd, put her into a Convent,
of which Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the Cardinal's
Sister, was Abbess: Here likewese I allow
that her honour was safe, She was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from Scandal; but She had been
here but 15 days, when She escap'd by a
Stratagem, under colour of reconducting
Madam her Sister. She tells this Story
her self in her Memoirs, and closes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
in these words, <hi>The Poor Old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
says She speaking of her Aunt, <hi>took
this adventure so much to heart, that She
died of Grief a few days after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is an Illustrious Testimony of the
Respect that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> has for her
Relations, and their Dignities, and of
her own Good Nature.</p>
                  <p>They add, that in her second Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Italy,</hi> Monsieur the Constable
<hi>Colonna</hi> receiv'd, and lodg'd her in his
House.</p>
                  <p>This too is true; but they don't tell
you, how well She observ'd the Laws
of Hospitality; Her first care was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
in to Madam the <hi>Constable</hi> her Sister
the same Sentiments for Monsieur the
<hi>Constable,</hi> that She had for Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin;</hi>
and She wrought so effectually, that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99975:55"/>
She soon perswaded her to go to <hi>France</hi>
in the same manner, that She had done
to <hi>Italy:</hi> And as Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> was by
Experience vers'd in all the Stratagems
that are requisite to such Enterprizes,
Madam the <hi>Constable</hi> set sail under her
Conduct, and arriv'd safe at <hi>Marseilles,</hi>
in spight of all the diligence of Monsieur
the <hi>Constable</hi> to pursue, and take 'em.</p>
                  <p>At last you are told, GENTLEMEN,
that in <hi>England</hi> She was lodg'd in the
Palace, and near the Person of the
Queen; I shall not add any thing on this
occasion, to what I have already said in
the first Pleading, except that 'tis not
true, that She did ever lodge in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of the Queen, while She was Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
of <hi>York,</hi> or in the King's Palace after
that Princess came to the Throne; She
always lodg'd in an Apartment belonging
indeed to the Palace of St. <hi>James,</hi> but
St. <hi>James</hi>'s Palace is not the Place of the
King's Residence, which is call'd <hi>White-hall,</hi>
not <hi>Louvre;</hi> for the Name of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre</hi>
is taken from the place where the
Palace of our Kings is built. It is in
respect of <hi>White-hall,</hi> what the Castle of
the <hi>Tuillerie</hi> is respect of the antient
<hi>Louvre;</hi> and Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Lodgings
are to the Castle of St. <hi>James,</hi> what the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99975:56"/>
                     <hi>Sieur Renard</hi>'s House formerly was to the
<hi>Tuilleries.</hi> Judge then, GENTLEMEN,
if this be near enough the Palace, to
say, that the Queen's Presence, and the
Respect, that Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> had for
her Person, are sufficient to banish all
Suspicion; and if any one wou'd upon
this bottom warrant all, that pass'd in
her Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>But this is an un-necessary Enquiry,
since Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> is willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
what's past, provided that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> will without delay return to her
Duty. Don't therefore give your selves
the trouble of a too difficult Justification,
which Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> does not exact
from you: He will believe her Innocent,
content your selves with that, and take
care, that your Over-Officiousness to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
her, does not, by opening too much,
produce a quite contrary effect.</p>
                  <p>The same reason shall make me pass
lightly over their distinction between the
two retreats of Madam <hi>Mazarin:</hi> They
say, that if her causing her self to be
carried away at first, had any thing cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
in it, 'tis cover'd, and Reparation
made by her voluntary return into <hi>France.</hi>
That the second is wholly innocent, as
being involuntary, and done by the King's
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99975:56"/>
Permission, and in Obedience to his
Order.</p>
                  <p>But first, how can they pretend, that
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s coming back into <hi>France</hi>
without returning to her Husband, is a
Reparation of her Fault in running away
from him? Does a Woman, that has
made an Elopement out of the Kingdom,
recover her Innocence, as foon as She
sets foot upon <hi>French</hi> Ground?</p>
                  <p>I agree, that if a Woman returns to
her Husband, and he receives, and lives
with her without Prosecuting his Revenge
for the Injury, he shall not afterwards be
allow'd to revive his Complaint, because
such a Cohabitation shall be construed a
Remission. But here's nothing like it.
Monsieur the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> carried
away Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and he
has brought her back again into <hi>France,</hi>
without joyning Monsieur <hi>Mazarin;</hi> this
is rather a continuation of the Affront,
than a Reparation.</p>
                  <p>As for the second retreat, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
acquainted you, GENTLEMEN,
that they have not truly represented the
matter of Fact, and that if the King did
reconduct Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> out of the
Kingdom, 'twas in conformity to his
Word, and the desire of Madam <hi>Mazarin;</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:99975:57"/>
that this did no way wipe off the Wife's
Guilt, nor impair the Rights of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>Don't we see Fugitives, and Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
appear every day upon the credit of
Protections, which are granted either
by their Creditors, or by order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?
When the time of their Protections
are expired, and they withdrawn, are
not the Processes against 'em continued,
and they esteem'd not a whit the less
culpable?</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> her self was so little
perswaded of her own Innocence, or that
the King's Permission to retire into <hi>Italy</hi>
was a Protection against the Pursuits of
her Husband, or the right he had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
her; that when She return'd with
Madam the <hi>Constable</hi> her Sister, into
<hi>France,</hi> She durst not appear, but in
disguise; and being inform'd that the
Duke, who had some notice of her arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
was in quest of her, She made all
the speed She cou'd into <hi>Savoy,</hi> and thence
She went into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these false Defences therefore must
be retrench'd; but (once more I repeat
it) what signifies it to enter into a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion,
which can be of no service to
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> since my Client is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99975:57"/>
to pardon her all that is past, upon
condition, that She returns immediately
to him. What reason can She have to
refuse him? I wish her going away, her
travels, her long abode in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and her Conduct there, I wish, I
say, that all this were cover'd, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that it were Innocent; But can her
refusing to return to <hi>France,</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> be excus'd? Can her obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
be look'd upon otherwise, than as a
fresh Injury, a new Crime? Is She a
Widdow, has She transfer'd her self to
any other Man's Authority? The Church,
and the Laws of the Land have given
him to her for a Husband, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her to obey him; has any other Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
dispens'd with her?</p>
                  <p>Tho' it were true, that the King had
given her leave, or even order'd her to
retire for some time to her Relations in
<hi>Italy,</hi> is it not a manifest abuse of his
Permission, to extend it to so long a stay
in Foreign Parts, and to plead it still for
the continuance of it? Can She pretend,
that 'twas the Design of a Prince so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and so zealous for Discipline, to
separate her from her Husband for ever?
Has he not plainly enough signified the
contrary, when offended at her obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99975:58"/>
he has taken away the Pension of
24000 Livers, which he allow'd her
for the two first years of her Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?</p>
                  <p>Dare any one maintain, that in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
her to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> he gave her
leave to harbour among his Enemies, in
the Court of an Usurper, in a Heretick
Country, the Object of Heaven's Wrath,
and Man's Aversion?</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore certain, that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> is without Excuse; that her
Flight, her two and twenty years stay
in a strange Country, and her refusal yet
to return, are so many breaches of her
Duty, and of her Matrimonial Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the natural, and legal Punishment
of which is deprivation of Dower, and
Settlement. If you do her the Favour
to allow her time to avoid this Penalty,
in case She does not within that time
yield Obedience to your Orders, you
can't too severely punish her past Faults,
and her present Contempt.</p>
                  <p>Let us now proceed to consider what
has been said to support her incident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and begin with the 100000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
for the payment of her pretended
Debts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:99975:58"/>
I shall not, GENTLEMEN, repeat
any thing that I have already had the
honour to say to you on this Head.</p>
                  <p>I shall only cite you one Decree of
Parliament of the 23d of <hi>March, 1672,</hi>
as 'tis reported in the second part of the
Journal of the Palace, which rejects the
like Demand of a Woman in a Case much
more reasonable on her side, than 'tis in
this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frances Frottier</hi> having quitted her
Husband during the Prosecution of an
Appeal which She had brought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Abuse in the Celebration of her
Marriage, which was not ill grounded,
She having been Married under the Age
of twelve Years: She contracted during
this Absence, some Debts to 5000 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
for things necessary for her Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
only. After She had been cast upon
the Appeal of Abuse, She demanded, that
her Husband shou'd be oblig'd to pay
these petty Debts: She grounded it upon
the Obligation he was under to give her
Maintenance, upon the cause, and the
smallness of these Debts contracted for
her Subsistance; upon the necessity She
lay under of quitting his House, because
in continuing with him, She had ratified
the Marriage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:99975:59"/>
Monsieur <hi>Maupeou,</hi> since Advocate
General, was Council for the Husband,
and shew'd, that he ow'd no Alimony
to her, but while She liv'd with him;
and that the Obligation to maintain her
was inseparably bound to an actual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation;
his Argument is reported in
the Journal; upon this a Decree was
obtain'd, avoiding the Demands of the
Wife, and her Creditors.</p>
                  <p>How much more strongly will it take
place against a Woman, that has absent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her self not only from her House, but
from the Kingdom, without any necessity,
out of meer Caprice; and against Debts
contracted by Expences absolutely super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous?</p>
                  <p>It has been objected, GENTLEMEN,
that all this wou'd be good, if the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
were subject to our Laws; but We
have to do with <hi>English</hi> Men, whose
Laws differ from ours; who will by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
extort, what they can't by Justice.
They have in a very pathetical manner,
aggravated the Peril She is in of her Life;
as if they put in Execution in <hi>England,</hi>
that old Law, which allow'd the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of an Insolvent to tear him to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and they have represented Madam
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99975:59"/>
                     <hi>Mazarin</hi> to you, as one that every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
expected Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>But how shall we reconcile this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Representation to what we see clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it has been Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s
Fault alone, that She did not come to
<hi>France,</hi> when so many natural born <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Men, the greatest part of which left
Debts undoubtedly more effective, than
hers, came without impediment? How
does this accord with what I have already
observ'd, that there has yet been no Suit
commenc'd against her, no obstacle rais'd
by her Creditors to hinder her coming?</p>
                  <p>Does not all the World know, that
instead of being arrested at <hi>London,</hi> She
was forc'd to have recourse to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Authority for leave to stay? If her
Life was in danger, as She says; if She
was expos'd to Martyrdom, wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d She
make Application to continue there?
Wou'd She prefer such an Abode to her
Husband's House? Unless some splendid
sit of Zeal makes her covetous of that
glorious Palm, and gives her a holy Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of being sacrific'd by that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nation; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that at least in
common with that
<note n="*" place="margin">Joan of Orleans.</note> Illustrious Maid, whom our Nation
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99975:60"/>
acknowledges to have been her Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer.</p>
                  <p>But we need not fear any such thing
from Madam <hi>Mazarin;</hi> a Woman that
takes it ill, that her Husband employs
any part of his Wealth in Works of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
will never be prodigal of her Blood
for Religion. Undoubtedly She must be
in great Security in <hi>England,</hi> since She
can't resolve to leave it, till She has
articled for her Habitation, and Pension
in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, GENTLEMEN, I have shewn
you, that her Debts are a meer Sham,
a Pretence devis'd by her Counsel at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
to excuse her Obstinacy: I shall not
repeat all the Particulars; but I shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
only to some Letters, which were
read to you last Hearing, to prove the
reality of these Debts.</p>
                  <p>These Letters, they tell us, are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
naturally, and without Study, they
come from the heart, and by consequence
we are not to doubt the truth of what
Madam <hi>Mazrrin</hi> says in 'em; that her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
are importunate, and that She is
afraid of being sued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> these Letters are not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:99975:60"/>
But, if they were, are we oblig'd to
believe Madam <hi>Mazarin?</hi> Shall we give
her a 100000 Franks, because She writes
word, that She ows so much, and has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for it?</p>
                  <p>But I desire the Council to observe,
that these Letters don't mention the
Summ of her Debts: Now if the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
of <hi>Nevers</hi> had any Letter, that was
more particular in the Summ, She wou'd
undoubtedly have produc'd if; It must
therefore be Monsieur or Madam <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
or he that drew up this Defence,
that has officiously tax'd Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
at a 100000 Livres.</p>
                  <p>But pray let me ask you, who inform'd
you that these amounted to 100000
Livres, since as you confess, you have
receiv'd no Memoirs nor Instructions
from Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> but these Letters,
which are not particular? 'Tis then by
guess, that you make this Demand; and
do you think the Judges will fine Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> 100000 Livres upon this,
and give a Judgment at random, as you
have made your Demand?</p>
                  <p>'Tis further evident, that these Debts
were invented at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> writes nothing in these Letters
but by Instruction from hence, which I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99975:61"/>
shall make clearer, than the light, by two
or three Circumstances.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that in the Letter of the
eldest date of the three, which is of the
15 of <hi>October</hi> last, Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> writes
to Madam <hi>Nevers</hi> in these Terms; <hi>I
send you the Certificate you desir'd;</hi> this
Letter is not preceeded by any other,
by which it appears, that Madam <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
requir'd a Certificate of Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
and that She requir'd it before
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> had said any thing to
her of her Debts, or the difficulty of
leaving <hi>London</hi> without paying 'em;
and by consequence 'tis plain, that these
pretended Debts, and the Detention of
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> are of the growth of
<hi>Paris,</hi> in which Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> is not
concern'd.</p>
                  <p>The stile it self of these Letters, which
you say is so natural, is far from it; and
may serve as a farther proof, that they
were written by Direction. When Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> writes naturally, and from
her Heart, She writes incomparably bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but especially, if She were in the
condition there pretended; her Danger,
and her Wants joyn'd to her natural
Eloquence, wou'd have made her write
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99975:61"/>
in a Stile much more lively, and moving,
than that of those Letters.</p>
                  <p>What probability is there, that She
who writes from a Country, where She
had been an Eye Witness of such great
Revolutions, and where She must needs
have had a particular Share in many
singular Events; of which She might
believe Madam <hi>Nevers,</hi> who had so much
kindness for her, wou'd be glad to be
inform'd; what probability, I say, is
there that She shou'd take no notice at
all of 'em, not so much as a single word
concerning Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> or her
Sentiments of him? She speaks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but her Creditors, because She
was order'd to speak of nothing else
in these Letters devis'd on purpose,
which were undoubtedly accompanied
by others more Instructive; but in these
She talks so slightly, that the Man must
be blind, that can't see that She is not
in earnest.</p>
                  <p>You see therefore, GENTLEMEN,
that there never was any Demand more
rashly made, nor with less Foundation,
than this of 100000 Livers.</p>
                  <p>Let us proceed to their other Demand,
which requires Permission to live in a
Convent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:99975:62"/>
You know, GENTLEMEN, that this
is not to be granted, but upon very
weighty Considerations; the Caprice of
a Woman, or a disgust taken to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
are not sufficient Reasons for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Society, to which they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
oblig'd; there ought to be such
hard Usage, as may merit the Name of
Cruelty, with which they are usually qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.
Do they offer Proof of any such
thing? No, they don't so much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it.</p>
                  <p>All the reason they give, why Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> can't return to her Husband's
House, is, that things are not at that
pass. What Language is this? What
do you mean by it? What is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to bring things to such a pass,
that a Wife may, and ought to return
to her Husband, more than a valid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that the Husband be willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her, and that has never treated her
amiss? All this is to be found here.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> they say, is averse
to it; this is all, that they have to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to it.</p>
                  <p>But first, who told you, that She was
averse to it? Have you a Deputation
from her to say it? No! You have not
so much as Memoirs from her; the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99975:62"/>
themselves say nothing of it. 'Tis
Monsieur, and Madam <hi>Nevers,</hi> who,
not loving Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> themselves,
think that She ought not to be willing
to live with him, and demand for her a
Separation from her Husband of their
own Heads.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary I maintain against
you, that no Warrant or Memoirs from
her appearing to support your Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is all that we have for this
Aversion, We ought to presume She
has none, because we ought to believe,
that every Person wishes, and acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Duty, till the contrary be
made to appear.</p>
                  <p>But tho' it were true, that Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> had some reluctance to return
to the Duke, is that a good reason why
She shou'd be dispens'd with, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from him? If all the Married Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
either of which had conceiv'd any
disgust for the other, were to be parted,
how many Divorces shou'd we see? Are
there any Persons so exactly form'd for
one another, so perfect, or so happy,
as not to give one another reciprocal oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of dissatisfaction in so strict a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety?
Insensibility is none of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of this Life, and I question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99975:63"/>
it be lawful to desire it. We are
not therefore to regard these Niceties,
when there are no essential Reasons for
Separation, especially from the Mouth
of a Woman that has liv'd with her
Husband six years in perfect Unity;
that has had in that time four Children
by him, the Pledges of their mutual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and the living Proofs of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy.</p>
                  <p>They object to Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> that
he has three great Faults, (they don't
indeed say it just in this Place, but it has
been scatter'd all thro' the Pleading of
the opposite Party,) He is Jealous; He
is Devout, and scrupulous to Excess; He
is Profuse, and squanders more in Alms,
than others in their Debaucheries.</p>
                  <p>Let us see if any of these be foundation
sufficient to ground Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s
Demand upon.</p>
                  <p>First for his Jealousie, if it were real,
it is obliging; and even when it becomes
troublesom, it is excusable upon the score
of the Principle from whence it springs;
at least, while it proceeds not to Rage,
and Violence.</p>
                  <p>But what signs of Jealousie do you
discover in Monsieur <hi>Mazarin?</hi> You can't
instance in any. How can you accuse
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99975:63"/>
him of that Weakness, who does not
yet call your Virtue in question after
so much matter of Suspicion as your
imprudent Conduct has afforded him?
Can you believe, that he was ever Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
whose good Opinion cou'd abide
the severe Trials you have put it to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diminution?</p>
                  <p>As for his Devotion, 'tis a Fault too
lovely to stand in need of our Defence;
is that a ground for her Demand? If
the Apostle does not allow a Wife, that
is a Believer, to leave a Husband, that
is not; How can we suffer Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
to desert her Husband, because he
is faithful and exact in the Duties of his
Religion? Especially, GENTLEMEN,
since, as Master <hi>Sachot</hi> has told you, he
was so at the time of his Marriage. She
Married him Devout, and I shall add,
that She lov'd him such, why wou'd She
not have him continue such? If we may
apply to this Quality, which is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a Christian, what has been
said of the real Faults of Matters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
might we not with Justice op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> the common
saying, <hi>Prudens emisti vitiosum, dicta ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
est Lex?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:99975:64"/>
But perhaps Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> will not
find it so difficult to reconcile her self to
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s way of Living. The
Seeds of Devotion are stronger in her,
than She her self suspects. It wou'd be
strange, that a Lady, that springs from
the same Blood, that has given to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that Mighty Queen, and to <hi>France</hi>
that Virtuous<note n="*" place="margin">The late Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Conty.</hi>
                     </note> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
whose Piety
will be rever'd in all
Ages, shou'd have
no Spark in her of that holy Fire, with
which they were so inflam'd; not one
Ray of those lively Beams of Faith, which
shin'd so bright in them.</p>
                  <p>But you see, GENTLEMEN, by her
Defence, that She is in fear for her Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
this Fear is the beginning of
Wisdom. She desires to retire into any
Nunnery, that you please to assign:
'Tis therefore probable, that She finds
her self now better dispos'd, than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
to live after the manner that She
ought, in such Houses. Why then will
She not comply with that of Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin?</hi> Nothing can resemble the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of a Convent, better than his
House. All the difference is, that in a
Convent, She wou'd be out of the Rank
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99975:64"/>
wherein Providence has plac'd her;
whereas with her Husband She wou'd
be in her proper Station. And tho' She
shou'd at first feel a little Reluctance, a
short time wou'd reconcile her to a Yoak,
that is all Sweetness to those, that have
once submitted to it; and it wou'd hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to her, as the Apostle says in the
same Place, that the believing Husband
shall sanctifie the unbelieving Wife.</p>
                  <p>Let us proceed to the pretended Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations.</p>
                  <p>How dare Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> accuse
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> of squandering? She
that tells you, that She cou'd not subsist
singly, and without Equipage, upon a
Pension of 20000 Crowns a year, which
She constantly receiv'd from the King
of <hi>England;</hi> She that has carried away,
and squander'd 100000 Crowns worth
of Jewels, and rich Moveables, and still
pretends her self to be in Debt: She in
short that made it one of the ordinary
Diversions of her Youth, to throw Baggs
of Gold away by handfuls, out of the
Windows of the Palace of <hi>Mazarin,</hi> for
the Pleasure of setting the Mob together
by the Ears?</p>
                  <p>Has She not great Right to call my
Client to account for his Management
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99975:65"/>
of their Estate, and House, after She has
her self entirely abandon'd the care of
'em? If Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> after her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
had quitted his House, and gone
to live at <hi>Venice,</hi> or elsewhere, as She
did at <hi>London,</hi> what had become of their
Family, and Fortune? 'Tis ridiculous to
bring in Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> like the Master
of the Family in the Gospel, requiring
of his Servants upon his return from his
Journey, an Account of the Talents he
left with 'em to be improv'd. And tho'
it were true, that some waste had been
committed during her Absence, is not
She as much, and more culpable for
her Flight, than He for his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>But in the next place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What is this
Profusion, of which they accuse Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin?</hi> He is, say they, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
in his Alms. Let us refer that
to the Gospel, which says, <hi>That to give
Alms, is to heap up Treasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor shall I stick to say, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
Estate was such, as requir'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
of what you call, Prodigality.</p>
                  <p>These overgrown Estates are like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
too full of Blood, that wou'd be
suffocated with Health, if they were
not reliev'd by seasonable Bleedings:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99975:65"/>
They are like Rivers, whose Waters will
not be damm'd up, but purge by flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diffusing themselves; they wou'd
become corrupt, or break their Banks,
and be entirely lost, if they were
too straitly penn'd up. Those that
have the Management of such great
Fortunes, ought to imitate the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Pilots, that throw part of
their Goods into the Sea, to secure
the rest. To dissipate after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is not to destroy, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What relation have these
Facts of dissipation to our Cause? They
wou'd be to the purpose in a Tryal for a
Separation of Effects, but the question
being only, whether Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
ought to return to her Husband, tho'
there were really such waste committed,
is that any reason, that She shou'd be
dispens'd with? On the contrary it
ought to engage her the more to it, that
She might be assistant to Monsieur <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
with her Care, and Advice, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
in conjunction with him for the
Preservation of their Estate.</p>
                  <p>But in short, the Fact is false, there
has been no dissipation of the Cardinal's
Goods by Monsieur <hi>Mazarin.</hi> On the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99975:66"/>
contrary he has clear'd 'em, and added to
'em at the expence of his own Patrimony.</p>
                  <p>Tho' these Matters be altogether For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> might
very well wave taking any notice of 'em,
without Prejudice to his Cause: Yet,
GENTLEMEN, since he has been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated
to You, 'tis his Interest to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
himself to You.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Has Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> alienated
any one of the Cardinal's Effects? I
challenge you to declare, and defie you
to name One: He hath had of him Lands,
Governments, and Pensions from the
Crown, all which are yet in his Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
or his Children's, to whom he
has given 'em upon their Marriage:
Wherein then does this waste consist?
Has he run you into Debt? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whence
then this fear of Poverty for your self
and Children in Possession of so great an
Estate, without a Farthing of Encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?</p>
                  <p>Let us follow this Enquiry: Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> has indeed made use of 1200000
Livers of the Portion which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
himself to lay out in the Purchase of
an Estate, with a Title annext to it, to
which he was to give the name of <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi>
Has he acquitted himself according
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99975:66"/>
to his Obligation? To this end he bought
the Dutchy of <hi>Rethel,</hi> not for 1200000
Livers, but 2200000 Livers. 'Tis true,
that to make up this Summ, he borrow'd
of the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> 400000 Livers,
for which he pays Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> Interest;
but there are 600000 Livers more, which
come out of his own Pocket.</p>
                  <p>As for the Moveables, the Jewels,
Statues, Pictures, they are all yet forth
coming; those excepted, which Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> carried away with her. My

                        <hi>Here Monsieur</hi> Sachot <hi>interrupted Monsieur</hi> Herard, <hi>to tell him, that the Statues were broken; Monsieur</hi> Herard, <hi>made this Reply.</hi> A very seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Interruption! Did your Client run away, and does She still refuse to retun for this? Is this your Excuse for her Flight.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, he has not been so good a
Husband of his own Patrimony; he has
sold his Place of Great Master of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
and the Governments, which he
had from Monsieur the Marshal <hi>de Meil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leray,</hi>
his Father. But, besides, that this
concerns not Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> why
has he sold 'em? To pay part of the
Price of the Dutchy of <hi>Rethel,</hi> and to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99975:67"/>
refund 1500000 Livers out of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Benefices of Monsieur the Cardinal,
which have been decreed against him.</p>
                  <p>Is it not strange after all this, that they
shou'd take the Liberty to publish to the
World, and to say before you, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> ruines
his Wife, and Children, and that he has
squander'd five Millions? Will you
know, GENTLEMEN, what these five
Millions are? We'll lay 'em immediately
upon the Table before you: They are
five Millions in Bills of the Exchequer,
and bad Debts, of which we have never
receiv'd a Penny, and will afford a very
good Pennyworth to any Purchaser.</p>
                  <p>This, GENTLEMEN, is the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
the ill Husband, that sells his own
Estate, to clear and improve his Wife's.
He gives Alms, but he does it out of
his own Estate, out of what his Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and Frugality retrenches from the
usual Superfluity, and Luxury of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of his Quality.</p>
                  <p>You see, GENTLEMEN, that of
all the Arguments that have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to support the Demands of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> that not one has the least
Foundation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:99975:67"/>
Let 'em not pretend, that they have
been too long asunder to be brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of a sudden. For on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
because they have been too long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd,
we can't reunite 'em too soon;
that their Coalition may put an end to all
ill Reports, and silence Slander, whose
Mouth their Divorce has open'd. We
ought to efface even the minutest track
of this unhappy Division. Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>'s
Retirement to a Convent, wou'd
be but covering the Ashes, whence the
Flame might break out afresh. They
wou'd not fail, as you see, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
they already threaten us, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
her to renew her old Suit for a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of Effects, as unjust, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
as it is, in hopes to make it a means
to hinder their Reunion; whereas by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
her to return immediately to her
Husband, you will raze the Memory of
all past Differences, and prevent any that
may hereafter arise.</p>
                  <p>Their last recourse is to the Number,
Quality, and Worth of the Persons, that
solicite for Madam <hi>Mazarin.</hi> I grant,
that you have on your side the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Nature, Fortune, Greatness, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
Favour, Graces, and even Eloquence
it self; every thing is for you, except
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99975:68"/>
the Law. Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> has nothing
for him but his just Right supported by
my weak Voice, and the obliging Care
of a Friend, that acts for him in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
not from any prospect of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
as you upon false Memoirs have
suggested; but frankly upon a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Friendship founded upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
he has to be related to Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> and upon a grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of those Favours, and Marks
of Esteem, which he has for many years
receiv'd from him.</p>
                  <p>But you are not therefore to insult over
our Weakness, and Solitude; We are
no way apprehensive of those Foreign
Advantages before Judges of such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
Integrity, that they will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
weigh your Reasons only, without
counting the Suffrages, and Solicitations
of your Friends.</p>
                  <p>I dare likewise boldly maintain, that,
tho' all these illustrious Persons out of
their great Generosity thought themselves
oblig'd to favour the absent, and weakest
Party; they can't possibly approve the
Conduct of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> nor wou'd
in earnest obstruct her Reunion to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:99975:68"/>
In short, GENTLEMEN, 'tis noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
that all Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Relations
turn'd against her after her Escape, and
joyn'd with Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> in the
Prosecution of the Indictment; and that
they all sign'd an Instrument, in which
they desir'd Monsieur the Constable not
to receive her, that She might be oblig'd
to return to her Husband; This Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> confesses likewise in her Memoirs;
What has happen'd since, that shou'd
turn the Minds of those very Relations,
or their Children, so very contrary at
this time?</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that Madam the Dutchess of
<hi>Nevers</hi> was not then of the Family;
but the prudent Conduct of that Lady
leaves us no room to doubt of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that in her Heart she makes of
Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> tho' Family Reasons
oblige her to appear here to support her
Interests. Wou'd to Heaven, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> instead of begging her
Assistance, wou'd improve by her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
and imitate, I will not say all
her Vertues, but some part only of her
Regularity, Sweetness, and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
to the Will of Monsieur her
Husband; it wou'd be more than
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99975:69"/>
enough to restore Peace betwixt 'em,
and to make Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happy.</p>
                  <p>I don't see, GENTLEMEN, that, in
all that has been objected, there is any
thing, that may start to you the least
difficulty in doing Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
the Justice he desires. He expects it
from you, as compleat, as he was about
to have had it, as you have seen, from the
Great Chamber, when they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by the Flight of Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin;</hi>
and he has great Reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
as much from you, since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the adverse Party from that time
has neither better'd her Cause, nor mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Condition.</p>
                  <p>He does not fear, that in a Cause of
such importance, You shou'd, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
You give; take any Measures from
the unjust Reluctance, which they, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
falsly, ascribe to Madam <hi>Mazarin;</hi>
We are not now to consult, what the
Inclinations of the Adverse Party are,
but to examine, and determine what is
her Duty.</p>
                  <p>You have before You, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
a Publick Concern, wherein you
ought more to consider the Interest of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99975:69"/>
Discipline, than that of either Party,
You are now to decide not between the
private Interests of Monsieur and Madam
<hi>Mazarin</hi> only; but between the Morals
of the Publick on one side, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> on the
other. 'Tis in your Breasts whether
you will sacrifice the former to the
vain Niceties of the latter, or rather to
her Errors, and Caprices.</p>
                  <p>Your Sentence is expected by the
Publick, as an Example, that shall be
remembred to the Maintenance of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and the Rights of Marriage, or
that shall slacken 'em, and Authorize
Licentiousness; that shall break down
the Barriers, and open a wide Field for
Worldly, and Rash Women, or that
shall keep 'em in their Duty.</p>
                  <p>Without doubt, GENTLEMEN, you
will not suffer it to be said hereafter,
that in the Reign under which we
live, You introduc'd this pernicious
Maxim, that the Devotion of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
his Regularity, and Charity to
the Poor, without Prodigality, were
Reasons sufficient for a Wife to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him. 'Tis not possible, that while
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99975:70"/>
we behold Piety upon the Throne of
our Kings, that it shou'd be so far
affronted in one of the most Sacred,
and most August of their Courts of
Justice, where it has always hitherto
found most assur'd Protection.</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT is not honest to pry into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of Families; much less to
expose 'em publickly. But since
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> has thought fit to
open 'em to the Great Council, and
Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi> his Advocate to
put 'em into Print, 'tis not fair that
the World shou'd hear, but one side;
And the Answer to the Pleadings
falling into my Hands, I thought my
self bound to make the Publick Judge
betwixt 'em: And I hope, that after
a thorough Examination of the matter,
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> will by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
be found worthy of a better Fate,
and another sort of Husband.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99975:73"/>
If the Duke had proceeded no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than Coldness, Reservedness,
or Rigour, the Dutchess had quietly
lamented her Misfortune in secret, in
hopes at length by the constancy of her
Sufferings, and the sweetness of her
Compliance, to have won upon so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
a Temper. But when he
came to that degree of excess, that
took away all her Repose; and to such
a rate of Profusion, as must absolutely
ruine her Family, She had recourse
to those Methods, that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her Estate, and Liberty.</p>
                  <p>The Relations treated, the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
engag'd, the King interpos'd his
Authority, but Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>
persisted inflexible to all. Must a
Wife be eternally enslav'd to the
Caprices, Enthusiasms, and false
Revelations of her Husband?</p>
                  <p>This is what Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi>
has maintain'd with as many Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as Calumnies. These few Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
<pb facs="tcp:99975:73"/>
may serve to shew the violent
Spirit of the Advocate.</p>
                  <p>Matters are come to that pass
in <hi>England,</hi> that 'tis no longer
lawful for a Catholick, a <hi>French</hi>
Man, nor scarce for an honest
Man to stay in <hi>London.</hi> page 20.</p>
                  <p>If She had any Affection for
their Persons, any Gratitude for
their Bounties, or indeed but a
bare Sense of Honour or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
She ought to have follow'd
'em. Cou'd She see, without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
the Usurper of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and the Enemy of our
Faith, establish his Dominion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wrack of their Legitimate
Throne, and the ruine of the true
Religion? p. 21.</p>
                  <p>But which way can the Names
of the King, and Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99975:74"/>
be made use of to excuse the
Escape, and Absence of Madam
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> after what I have had
the Honour to observe to the
Council at the last Hearing?
While She lives in the same
Tranquility at <hi>London</hi> since their
departure, that She did in their
peaceful Reign; while She pays
the same Incense to the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> that She offer'd to them,
with as much baseness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness,
as it was Honour to
her, to pay that Respect which
She ow'd to them. p. 42, 43.</p>
                  <p>What Excuse has She now?
Is the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> her Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?
Are all these Gamesters,
Libertines, Presbyterians, Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copians,
Quakers; In a word,
are all this Rabble of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
except the true one, which
<pb facs="tcp:99975:74"/>
resort to her House, her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
p. 43.</p>
                  <p>Unless some splendid fit of Zeal
makes her covetous of that glorious
Palm; and gives her a holy Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of being sacrific'd by that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nation. <hi>p. 101.</hi>

lawful Separation. But he boasts,
that he has forgot nothing that might
procure a Reunion; and 'tis certain
that he sent Articles to that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

In those Difficulties, that will
undoubtedly arise, a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as soon as may be.</p>
                  <p>To Copy the best Management
of the Kingdom, and by that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
to form ours.</p>
                  <p>Never to give the Publick any
account of our Domestick Affairs;
much less to let the Curious into
any of our Secrets, but to tell 'em
in short, that we are very well
reconcil'd.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> is not contented
to have laid down Rules for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Husband and Wife, but he
must needs make Regulations thro' his
whole Estate, without regard to the
Authority of the Bishops, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.

Affairs, which in Reason ought
to go before the Civil. These Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

in the Publication of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days,

form the Capacity of so great a Man!</p>
                  <p>To say, that Monsieur <hi>Nevers</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
his Sister to the end of the first
Stage; which is false.</p>
                  <p>That Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> carried off rich
Moveables, and abundance of Plate, who
never had abroad, either Goods, Plate,
or Jewels, except one Necklace, which
She usually wore in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That She resided in the Territories of
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thro' which She only
travell'd quietly as her way led her.</p>
                  <p>That She scandaliz'd all the Convents,
where She has been; tho' we are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
how much She was made of, and
what Honours were paid her by Madam
<hi>de Chelles,</hi> Madam <hi>Dulis,</hi> and all the
Superiours of the Houses in which She
liv'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:99975:77"/>
That her Pension in <hi>England</hi> was given
her in acknowledgment of a Debt due to
the Cardinal; a Debt which the two
Kings always laugh'd at as Chimerical,
and Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>To invent a hundred things of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to disguise, feign, and suppose, have
been, as it were, the steps, by which
Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi> has mounted to the
heighth of his bold Elogy on Monsieur
the Duke, and the Impudence of his
Invective against Madam the Dutchess of
<hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If all these Praises, all these Calumnies
ben't the Creatures of your own Brain,
tell us Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi> who cou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you of the Vertue of Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin?</hi>
Had you these fine Notions from
the Court, from the Provinces, or from
the Villages? Who has found out these
ill Qualities in Madam <hi>Mazarin?</hi> Did
your Information come from <hi>Paris, Rome,
Venice,</hi> or <hi>London?</hi> I can give you better
Lights concerning 'em both; and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you from falling any more into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
in Charity I will tell you, that
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> makes himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
every where, as well where he
is not, as where he is; and that Madam
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99975:78"/>
                     <hi>Mazarin</hi> is as generally esteem'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
She is, or has been.</p>
                  <p>But in what Country are you? In what
obscure Hole do you spend your days,
that you are ignorant how this Match
with Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> was brought
about?</p>
                  <p>Monsieur the Cardinal, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Illness, was inquisitive into
the Merit of our Courtiers, in order to
find one worthy of his lovely Niece, and
fit to support the Honour of his Name.
As he had yet some remains of Vigour,
he found no difficulty in resisting Virtue
without Wealth; but his Infirmity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
daily, and his Judgment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
with his Strength, he cou'd not
withstand the false report of the Riches
of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi> this was that
Noble and Glorious Choice of Monsieur
the Cardinal; a choice, to speak soberly
of it, that almost ruin'd his Reputation,
notwithstanding all the Merit of his past
Life. By it he lost the Respect of the
Court; the most cautious cou'd not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
their Railleries; and the Foreign
Ministers wrote to their Masters, that
they ought not any longer to make any
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99975:78"/>
account of his Eminency, since the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Match he had made.</p>
                  <p>What Aversion soever you may have
for Truth, for once do your self the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to hear, what I have to say of
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin.</hi> You can't have a
greater Repugnance to Truth, than I
have to Lies. Yet I have been forc'd to
hear all you have said of Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
with as much Villany, as Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Upon the Death of Monsieur
the Cardinal, the Courtiers, who did
not yet understand the Niceness of the
King's taste, were afraid, that Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> shou'd inherit as well the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
as the Estate, and Name of his
Eminence. Monsieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was
heard to say, that if he shou'd see such
an Indignity, he cou'd leave <hi>France</hi> with
the same ease, that he had heretofore
done, when he went into the Service
of Monsieur the Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Marshal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> who, having
been his Majesties Governour, ought to
have been better acquainted with his
Sagacity, was not without his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</p>
                  <p>The Marshal <hi>de Clerambaut,</hi> who had
signaliz'd himself in ridiculing this Match,
was allarm'd at it; but Monsieur <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99975:79"/>
more in their Interests, than his
own, staid only long enough at Court
to decry himself, and to give the King
that judicious contempt of his Person,
which he has retain'd for him ever
since.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, they were not yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
rid of their Fears. They were
afraid that the Marshal <hi>de Meilleraye,</hi>
who in his time had always held the
first Post in War, shou'd by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rouse the Ambition of his Son, to
make himself more considerable.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> was too honest a
Man to suffer the World to continue in
an Errour. He bid farewell to War, as
he had done to the Court; and you will
grant me, GENTLEMEN, that 'twas
none of the unwisest Actions of his
Life.</p>
                  <p>He had yet but too much left to make
him considerable. His Places, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Riches, in which he outdid
all the Subjects of <hi>Europe,</hi> procur'd him
Respect enough; but like a Philosopher,
he shook off all these things, as superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
or, like a Christian, as dangerous
to his Soul. However it were, he left
himself nothing of that vast hoard so
precious in the Opinion of Men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:99975:79"/>
Of a thousand Rarities which the
Wealth, and Curiosity of the Cardinal
had brought together, of an infinite
number of Pictures, Statues, and Tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries,
all was either Sold, or disfigur'd;
of all his Places he did not keep one; of
all his Governments, he kept only that
of <hi>Alsace,</hi> where he knew he shou'd not
be suffer'd to command.</p>
                  <p>In short, GENTLEMEN, I am asham'd
to Name the poor Remains
of<note n="*" place="margin">1625000 l. Sterling.</note> Twenty Millions, that
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> brought
him; and the only reason,
that he gives, is, that he can't in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
keep ill gotten Wealth. It was
not ill gotten, GENTLEMEN, it was
not; the defence of the Crown against
so many Forces within, and so great a
Power without, was the Purchase of 'em,
which the Bounty, and Justice of the
King have confirm'd; but these Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
have been as ill bequeath'd as they
have been kept. The Memory of the
Cardinal is responsible for the foolish
choice he made of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin;</hi>
and Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> for the ill use of
that vast Wealth.</p>
                  <p>Let us spare Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> the Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of hearing a long descant upon the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99975:80"/>
Confusion of her Fortune: Let us spare
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> the shameful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the manner of his confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a hard case for Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to
have her Wealth confounded; a harder
to bear continually the sight of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder
of it. These were the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Journies; She expected the succour
of the Night, which relieves the most,
unhappy from the Sense of their Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but this Comfort was denied her.
No sooner were her fair Eyes clos'd, but
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> (who had the Devil
always present in his black Imagination)
this amiable Husband wakes his best Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
to make her Partaker—You
wou'd never guess of what; GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
to make her Partaker of his Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
Visions.</p>
                  <p>Flambeau's are lighted, and search is
made; but no Spectre does Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin
find,</hi> but that which lay by her in
the Bed. His Majesty was more oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
treated; He was made the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his Revelations, those Divine
Lights, which Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s usual
Commerce with Heaven afforded him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:99975:80"/>
The World has been fully inform'd of
his Revelations; and since Monsieur the
Advocate has set such a value upon that
Devotion, which has procur'd him this
Grace, I beg your Patience, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
to hear some of the Effects of it;
they are singular, and worth your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>During the time that Monsieur <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
courted Mademoiselle <hi>Hortensia,</hi> he
gave a Note for 50000 Crowns to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Frejus,</hi> upon Condition, that he
shou'd promote the Match, which with
Reason he sollicited so hotly. The Match
was made, and Monsieur <hi>de Frejus</hi> had
a great hand in it. But it being neither
easie, nor honourable for a Bishop to
exact the Payment of such a Note, he
return'd it to Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> trusting
rather to his Word, than his Note. Some
time after this piece of Generosity, the
Bishop had occasion for Money to settle
his Nephews, and demanded it of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mazarin;</hi> who, doing violence to
his good Nature, refus'd to pay it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inform'd by his Director, that 'twas
a more criminal Simony in him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the Sacrament of Marriage, than
in a Bishop to purchase his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:99975:81"/>
See, GENTLEMEN, the nice ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conscience of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin:</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Frejus,</hi> like a Bishop as he
was, wou'd have taken the Money, and
never bogled at the Simony; Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> a meer Layman, makes a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of paying it, and religiously pays it
not.</p>
                  <p>This is an Example, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
your Opinion of his Piety.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> had a Suit of great
Importance, an Agreement very much
to his Advantage was offer'd him; He
answer'd those, that propos'd it to him,
That our Saviour came not to bring
Peace into the World; that Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Disputes, and Processes were of
Divine Right, but Accommodations of
Humane Invention: That God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Judges, but never thought of
Arbitrators; and that therefore he was
resolv'd to be in Law all his Life, and
never come to a Reference: A Promise
that he has hitherto kept like a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and will ever.</p>
                  <p>Modesty forbids me, GENTLEMEN,
to open to you the occasion of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Dauphiny</hi> to consult Monsieur <hi>de
Grenoble:</hi> I will only tell you, that a
Case of Conscience so extraordinary, a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99975:81"/>
scruple so nice, so delicate, was never
heard before.</p>
                  <p>But the most signal Act of Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Devotion, was this: He caus'd
one of Madam <hi>de Richelieu</hi>'s Children to
be brought up, with express Prohibition
to the Nurse from suckling it on <hi>Fridays</hi>
and <hi>Saturdays;</hi> that instead of Milk they
might suck in the holy use of Fasting and
Mortification.</p>
                  <p>This is the Devotion of Monsieur <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin,</hi>
of which his Advocate has the
Confidence to give so great a Character;
a Devotion, that serves to confirm our
Refugees in their Belief; tho' the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
as well as they, laugh at so ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
a Piety; and you, GENTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN,
whose Piety is so solid, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
no less than the Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>The greatest Misfortune, that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
a Man, is to be depriv'd of so much
Sense, as is necessary to Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The next, to be oblig'd to live with
those, that are. These two Calamities
are to be found in Extremity in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Marriage of Monsieur and Madam
<hi>Mazarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nature has set Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> at
such a distance from Reason, that 'tis
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99975:82"/>
almost impossible they shou'd ever come
together: The only excuse that his
Friends, if he has any, can make for his
Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> has by her ill Fortune
been compell'd to live with Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin.</hi> Joyning the Living to the
Dead was not a greater cruelty, than
linking Prudence to its Reverse; yet this
Torment was Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> for five
years forc'd to endure: Befieg'd all day,
alarm'd all night, fatigu'd with Journey
upon Journey, to no purpose; subject
to extravagant and tyrannical Orders,
seeing none but Spies, or Enemies; and
which is the worst of all Conditions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
without Consolation.</p>
                  <p>Any other Woman wou'd have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
her self from Oppression, by an
open Resistance; Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> sought
only to escape from her Misfortunes, and
to find in the Place of her Birth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
her Relations, that Security, and
Repose, which She had lost.</p>
                  <p>While She was at <hi>Rome,</hi> She was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
by all that were Illustrious, and
Great there. Upon her return to <hi>France,</hi>
She obtain'd of the King a Pension for
her Subsistance, and an Officer and
Guards for her Convoy out of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99975:82"/>
Kingdom, where She neither cou'd, nor
wou'd stay.</p>
                  <p>After so long fluctuation, She fix'd
her retreat at <hi>Chambery,</hi> where She pass'd
three years undisturb'd in Study and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;
at the end of which She came
by the Permission of his Majesty, into
<hi>England.</hi> All the World knows the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that King <hi>Charles,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>
had for her: All the World knows the
Favours that She receiv'd from 'em; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
bestow'd only on her Person, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
relation to Monsieur the Cardinal's
Demand. 'Tis therefore to the meer
Bounty of their Majesties, that She owes
her Subsistance. For her Husband, as
just, and charitable, as he is devout, had
procur'd the Pension to be taken away,
which the King of <hi>France</hi> gave her.</p>
                  <p>This is acting little like a Christian,
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> tho' you talk of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Gospel. True Christians
render good for evil; you leave a Wife
to starve, that brought you a greater
Fortune, than all the Queens of <hi>Europe</hi>
together, brought to the Kings their
Husbands.</p>
                  <p>True Christians pardon the Injuries
they receive; you can't forgive those,
that you do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:99975:83"/>
One Persecution draws on another;
your ill Humour grows fierce, and your
blood's warm in Mischief; and the more
you persecute, the more you inflame
the Persecution.</p>
                  <p>Is it not enough to rob Madam <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
of all, while you Live? Must you
needs take pains to make her miserable
after your Death? Must you needs be
solicitous to provide, that her Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
may be endless, and continue when
you shall no longer be in a Capacity to
take Pleasure in 'em?</p>
                  <p>Don't think, that it suffices, that
your Advocate's Mouth is perpetually
full of <hi>The August and Venerable Name
of Husband, the Sacred Bands of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
of Civil Society:</hi> We have for us
Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> against the Husband:
We have his vile Qualities against these
fine, magnificent Expressions. Our first
Engagements are to Reason, Justice, and
Humanity, and the Quality of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
can't dispense with so natural an
Obligation. When a Husband becomes
extravagant, unjust, or inhumane, he
turns Tyrant, he breaks the Society,
which he contracted for with his Wife.
The right of Separation is already made,
the Judges make it not, they only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99975:83"/>
its validity by a solemn Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
provided of all those Qualities,
that make such a Divorce, no one can
doubt.</p>
                  <p>His Humour, his Proceedings, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
all his Actions prove it. The
difficulty will be to find one that does
not, and Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi> has a fine Task
to seek what is not to be found. He'll
tell us, that Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> is devout;
I own it, but his Devotion is such as
scandalizes all good Men. He'll say, that
he fasts, and mortifies himself; 'tis true,
but the Pain, that he puts others to, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
him more Pleasure, than his Auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
give him Pain. To refrain from
Mischief, to abstain from doing Evil,
were an abstinence agreeable to God,
and useful to Men. But the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wou'd be too great for Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin,</hi> and without an extraordinary
Grace from Heaven, he will never put
it in Practice.</p>
                  <p>From his Religion Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi>
will perhaps descend to his Morals, and
tell us of his Liberality; to which we
shall oppose his Avarice in all honest
things, and his Prodigality in things that
are not so. To speak properly, he gives
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99975:84"/>
nothing, but he throws away all: He
takes from his Wife and Children, what
he lavishes upon Strangers.</p>
                  <p>Virtues change their Nature in his
hands, and become more criminal, than
Vices.</p>
                  <p>Wou'd to God, GENTLEMEN, we
had occasion for false Vices, as Monsieur
<hi>Herard</hi> has had for sham Virtues: To
our Misfortune we have but too many
real ill Qualities to alledge.</p>
                  <p>Vexatious Suits with his Neighbours,
irreconcilable Quarrels with his Friends,
tyrannical Treatment of his Children, and
perpetual Persecution of his Wife, are
the sad and incontestable Proofs of our
Allegations.</p>
                  <p>As for Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi> after having
rejected all Truth, as low, gross, and
unbecoming the delicacy of his Wit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having exhausted his copious Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in inventing, feigning, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
false Colours of Virtues to Vices,
and of Vices to Virtues, baulk'd of the
Success of his Artifices, he has recourse
to Laws extinct, whose Authority he
wou'd revive. He flies to the old, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Novel of <hi>Justinian,</hi> a pretty
Refuge for so famous an Advocate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:99975:84"/>
Let us see this terrible Law, GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLEMEN,
so redoutable to Humane
Society; this Novel, that takes from
honest Folks the sweetest Consolation of
Life, by punishing a reasonable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Conversation.</p>
                  <p>If a Woman eats with Men without the
Permission of her Husband, She loses her
Rights; She can claim no benefit of her
Marriage Articles.</p>
                  <p>Happily for us this Novel is not in
force at this time. If this good Law had
held its Credit, every Wife in the <hi>Low
Countries, France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
her Jointure.</p>
                  <p>I wonder that Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi> to
shew his Skill in Antiquity, did not lead
you from the time of <hi>Justinian,</hi> to that
of <hi>Romulus,</hi> when Husbands, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
us'd always upon their first coming
home, to kiss their Wives, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to discover whether they had drank
Wine, or not; and if they had, they
punish'd 'em for those Faults, which
Wine might occasion, altho' the Faults
were not really committed.</p>
                  <p>I confess, that the Laws give a very
great Power to Husbands, but then there
were no <hi>Mazarins,</hi> when they were
made; if there had, the whole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99975:85"/>
had been lodg'd in the Woman.
Reason taught the Antients to make just
Laws, or such at least as were necessary
for the Government of their Age: But
you, GENTLEMEN, are not to be
concluded by 'em against the Rights of
your own; you have still the Liberty
of judging Soveraignly of your own
Interests by your own Lights.</p>
                  <p>Husbands wou'd be too happy, if
Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi>'s Enthusiasm might
prevail: Wives too unhappy, if it had
any Influence over your Judgments.</p>
                  <p>To be a Husband, wou'd be sufficient
to excuse all Faults, justifie all Crimes,
and commend all Defects.</p>
                  <p>To be a Wife, enough to suffer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
to be despis'd for Merit, and
decry'd for Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Let Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> spoil, waste,
and ruine all, he is Master; He's the
Husband: Let Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> be left
to Necessity, abandon'd to Misery, and
the Tyranny of her Creditors: What
Right has She to complain of Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin?</hi> Says his Advocate, She's his
Wife.</p>
                  <p>A Custom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> a Law of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> or some Novel of <hi>Justinian,</hi>
are matter sufficient for a Declamation.</p>

Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> eats with Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave from Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> She
loses her Dower, and Matrimonial
Rights. She loses all that She can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to.</p>
                  <p>Moderate your self Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi>
cool a little. Otherwise I shall bestow
that Character upon you, that <hi>Salust</hi>

                  <q>Eloquentiae satis; Sapientiae parum.</q>
                  <q>Eloquence enough, very little Sense.</q>
                  <p>Let us come to the wonderful Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which we can't think on without
astonishment. Here it was, says Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Herard,</hi> that She ought to have
left <hi>England,</hi> and thereupon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
the Shame of her staying behind
the Queen, to whom She had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to belong.</p>
                  <p>No doubt but Madam <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> and
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> wou'd have waited on
the Queen with Pleasure; but the Secret
of leaving her Kingdom was of such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
that it was not imparted to
any one; so that the Ladies were left
of Necessity in a Storm, which nothing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99975:86"/>
but the Presence of the new Prince cou'd
allay.</p>
                  <p>Since that time, it has been impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to leave a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where She has been in a manner
block'd up by her Creditors; or rather
by Monsieur <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who has forc'd
her to contract inevitable Debts, which
he will not pay.</p>
                  <p>He demands with the Authority of a
Husband so dear to his Advocate, that
She return to <hi>Paris,</hi> while he necessitates
her Absence, and complains of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which he causes. He pretends
to desire her Person, but in Reality he
covets only the Estate, that he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the Confusion of it.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> wou'd have
sent away Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> I confess,
but She had no occasion to ask the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the present King, his Justice
prevented her Request.</p>
                  <p>But tell me, Monsieur Advocate, who
set you on to declaim so furiously against
the King? You call him the Destroyer
of our Faith without Reason. But for
his Humanity, Goodness, and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not a Catholick had been left in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
You thought to make your Court
by it to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99975:86"/>
A Prince, that has so true a
taste of Glory, a Prince so clear-sighted,
distinguishes great Merit, wherever he
finds it. His Judgment, and his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
don't act always in concert; His
Generosity to his unfortunate Friend does
not hinder him from being just to the
Virtues of his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>To return to Madam <hi>Mazarin,</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
only that I justifie her against
three Charges, which will give me very
little trouble.</p>
                  <p>The first is, That She keeps a Bank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the second, That She sees Episcopal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and Presbyterians; the third,
That She converses with <hi>Milords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hear, GENTLEMEN, hear your
Orator Thunder. Never did <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</hi>
of <hi>Greece</hi> flash his Wild-fire
against <hi>Philip,</hi> at the rate that <hi>Herard</hi>
of <hi>France</hi> does his against Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> keeps a Bank, what
a Disorder is this! a Basset Table in her
House, what a Shame!</p>
                  <p>She sees Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, and
Presbyterians; O Impiety in a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick!
the Wife of Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
absolutely to Congregations, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99975:87"/>
Fraternities, speaks to <hi>Milords;</hi> O De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
of Manners!</p>
                  <q>O Tempora, O Mores!</q>
                  <p>Cool this heat of Eloquence, Monsieur
Orator, and bring your self into Temper.
Great Genius's are apt to fly out; Give
a little Attention, afford your self lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to consider things a little.</p>
                  <p>Do you think, that three Great Queens,
Devout and Virtuous, as any ever were;
Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> now in
<hi>France,</hi> the present Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and
the Princess her Sister, who is so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
Do you think, they wou'd have
had publick Basset Tables, if Basset was
not an honest Diversion, an innocent
Game.</p>
                  <p>The Accusation of seeing Church of
<hi>England</hi> Men, and Presbyterians is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.
To reproach Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>
for seeing Protestants at <hi>London,</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as just as to upbraid Protestants
with seeing Catholicks at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it be a Crime to see Protestants
in <hi>England,</hi> sure 'tis much more so to
espouse 'em. Yet a Daughter of <hi>France,</hi>
an Infanta of <hi>Portugal</hi> made no difficulty
of it. Their Chamberlains, their Ladies
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99975:87"/>
of Honour were Protestants. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Officers to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were such;
then how cou'd Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> go to
Court without seeing 'em? The Queen's
Eyes cou'd bear the sight; why shou'd
it offend Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s?</p>
                  <p>But if ever any Persons signaliz'd their
Zeal for the Catholick Religion, 'twas
King <hi>James,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> yet they
made no scruple of being crown'd at
<hi>Westminster;</hi> of Praying with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and Receiving the Crown from
the Hands of the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Society has indispensable Laws, Laws
equally Enemies to Impiety, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Scruples.</p>
                  <p>We are come now to the <hi>Milords,</hi>
which Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi> is as great a
Stranger to, as the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s, and <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins.</hi>
I'll inform him then, that these
<hi>Milords</hi> are the Peers of the Realm of
<hi>England,</hi> the most considerable Subjects
of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> will confess, that
She knows a great many, whom She
esteems as much for their Merit, as She
respects 'em for their Rank, and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
She will own, that She has receiv'd
great Services from 'em in difficult Times,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99975:88"/>
that they have given her great Assistance
in her Necessities; after this Confession,
methinks I hear Monsieur <hi>Herard</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,</p>
                  <q>O! Depravation of Manners!</q>
                  <q>O Tempora, O Mores!</q>
                  <p>But he must give me leave to answer
with more Reason.</p>
                  <q>O Stultitiam inauditam!</q>
                  <q>O unheard of Impertinence!</q>
                  <p>Well! GENTLEMEN, Let Monsieur
<hi>Mazarin</hi> have leave to dishonour the Name
he bears thro' all the Villages; let him
settle the great point of keeping Sheep
decently; let him tax the leaps of Bulls.</p>
                  <p>He shall give Rules to Apothecaries
Boys for the decent Administration of
Clysters; and prohibite Women from
Milking Cows, and Spinning at the
Wheel.</p>
                  <p>And shall not Monsieur Orator suffer
Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> to support the Dignity
of her Name in all Courts and Nations
where She comes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:99975:88"/>
You are Eloquent, Monsieur <hi>Herard,</hi>
you talk well: But fine things without
Reason, make no Impression upon sound
Judgments: Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> shall return
to her Husband to be admitted into the
Society of Shepherds, Herdsmen, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
Boys, Milk Women, and Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at the Wheel. This is what all your
fine Words will-never perswade Men of
Sense to. If you harangued to ignorant
People, you might dazle, if not move
'em; but to your Misfortune, you have
to do with Judges of Sagacity, Wise
Men, provided against your false Lights,
and all your vain Exaggerations.</p>
                  <p>I wish, GENTLEMEN, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur,
and Madam <hi>Mazarin</hi> cou'd appear
before you together at a Hearing, you
wou'd read their Separation in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Every Line in Monsieur <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s
wou'd confirm it.</p>
                  <p>Heaven has already made the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the contrariety of their Humors,
the opposition of their Tempers; by their
good and bad Inclinations; by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of one's Soul, and the Meanness of
t'others.</p>
                  <p>Nature has separated 'em as well as
Heaven, by a Beauty that Charms all
Eyes, and an Aspect that Offends all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:99975:89"/>
Some unluckey Star knit this Knot,
which Reason has instructed Madam <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarin</hi>
to untye.</p>
                  <p>Thus, GENTLEMEN, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, the Cause of Heaven, of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of Reason: 'Tis hop'd your
Wisdom will give the finishing stroke to
this great Work; that it will confirm this
Separation for ever; and, taking out of
his Hands the Administration of the
Estate, secure to the Children the poor
Remainders of that prodigious Wealth,
which he has confounded.</p>
