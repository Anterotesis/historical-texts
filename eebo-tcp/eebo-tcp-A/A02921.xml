            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the godly and reuerend Father, <hi>and faythfull Miniſter of Chriſt, M. Alexander Novvell,</hi> Deane of the Cathedrall Church of S. Paule in London, W. Gace wiſheth grace and peace from God the father through Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lorde.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD FROM THE BEGINNING, hath as in a moſt cleare and euident glaſſe, ſette forth himſelfe to be beholden and knowne of vs, euen in his creatures, &amp; in the orderly courſe of the worlde. For when we ſee and conſider the vnmeaſurable greatnes of the worlde, and the partes thereof to be ſo framed, as they could not poſsibly in beautie be fayrer, nor for profit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: we vnderſtande thereby the omnipotent power of God in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, his diuine wiſedome in ordering and diſpoſing them, his infinite goodnes in continually preſeruing them, that they runne not to ruine and vtter decay, but are by him vpholden, euen to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie vſe and ſuſtentation of mans lyfe. Although this creation of the worlde, and the maruaylous ordering and preſeruing thereof were ſufficient whereby men might knowe God, and worſhip him being knovvne, or elſe be without excuſe: yet it hath pleaſed God of his great mercie to giue vnto vs his worde, wherein he hath more plainly and fully reuealed himſelfe, and his will, to our moſt ſingular commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie and comfort. For we through the fall of our firſt parentes being become blinde in vnderſtanding, corrupt in deſiring, and wicked in working, are by the worde of God fruitefully of vs receyued, lightned in our myndes, reformed in our affections, and ordered aright in our doings: in ſo much as the Princely Prophet Dauid ſayth, that the meanes whereby a yong man ſhall clenſe his waye, is to rule himſelfe after this worde, which worde alſo he pronounceth to be his delight and his counſeller, yea he perceyued it to be of ſuch vertue and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, that he preferreth it before all worldly treaſures whatſoeuer: I loue, ſayth he, thy commaundements aboue golde and precious ſtone. Agayne, thy lawe is dearer vnto me then thouſandes of golde and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But I mynde not to enter here into the worthye commendation of this worde, or to rehearſe the manifolde and moſt ſingular commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which redounde to the godly thereby. Onely that which I haue mentioned out of Dauid may ſuffice to declare that it is a treaſure of all other moſt precious.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch then as the worde of God is a treaſure ſo excellent, what
<pb facs="tcp:4126:3"/>
ſhall we thinke or ſay of the true and ſyncere Preachers and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof? VVe acknowledge great friendſhip in them, by whoſe meanes we attayne to an earthly commoditie, and howe ſhall we be affected towarde them, which open to vs the way to an heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? VVe thinke our ſelues much beholden to thoſe, which miniſter vnto vs the foode of this fraile life: but vvhat recompence ſhall we render vnto them, by whoſe meanes we come to enioy the foode of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting lyfe? VVherefore right worſhipfull, if I ſhould render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my labour beſtowed in tranſlating this treatiſe into the engliſh tongue, I thinke it were ſufficient if I ſhould ſay no more, but that the word of God is therein ſoundly and ſyncerely expounded. Although I may deſcend vnto particular pointes, and ſhew other weightie cauſes thereof. For you are not ignoraunt howe the Papiſts both haue bine and alſo be grieuous enemies to the doctrine of iuſtification by faythe onely in Chriſt, pretending for their chiefe defence the teſtimonie of S. Iames, where he ſeemeth to attribute iuſtification to workes and not to fayth onely, whoſe authoritie they haue wrongfully wreſted and miſinterpreted. VVhereby they haue not onely erred themſelues, but alſo haue cauſed many other to erre. VVhich falſe interpretation of theirs is in this treatiſe very learnedly and throughly improued, and the meaning of the Apoſtle truly and playnely declared.</p>
            <p>Againe, your wiſedome doth well know, that the myſteries of God are wiſely and diſcretely to be diſpoſed, and not onely the doctrine of fayth faithfully to be taught, but alſo the doctrine of workes diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vrged, both to ſtoppe the ſclaunderous mouthes of many pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Papiſts, and alſo to remedie many abuſes very rife among vs. For whereas the ſyncere preachers of Gods worde doe according to the Scriptures teach, that the bloud of Chriſt is a ſufficient ſalue for the ſore of ſinne, and that we are iuſtified by fayth alone in him, without mens merits, workes, or ſatiſfactions: many ſclaundering Papiſts are not aſhamed moſt falſly to affirme, that they are louers of luſts, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of preſent pleaſure, and giuers of libertie to all licentious liuing, and making no ſtore of good workes, doe caſt onely fayth vnder mens elbowes to leane vpon. VVhen as the true preachers haue alway preached, and all the writinges of the godly haue moſt diligently taught, that that fayth, which is not liuely and fruitefull of good works did neuer profite any but to the increaſe of their owne damnation: and contrariwiſe, that that fayth, whereby alone according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they teach that we are iuſtified, hath good workes neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, not as cauſes of our ſaluation, but as neceſſarie fruites of a liuely fayth, as is alſo in this treatiſe of S. Iames very learnedly and diligently declared. VVhereby not onely the Papiſts are admoniſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:4126:3"/>
that they doe not open their lying lips ſo wrongfully to rayle vpon the true preachers of Gods word, but alſo many other are aduertiſed of their dutie, who by profeſſion are Chriſtians, but in life more then prophane, who are not aſhamed to ſay: if faith iuſtifie without works, then let vs worke nothing, but let vs onely beleeue and doe what we liſt, and ſo like carnall and careleſſe liuers they turne the libertie of the Spirite into wantonnes and fleſhly libertie. But let theſe men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that ſuch prophane profeſſion and careleſſe contempt dooth highly diſpleaſe almightie God, and is diligently detected and ſharpely reproued of his faythfull miniſters, both in wordes and writings, whoſe wholeſome admonitions let them carefully regard, and be aduertiſed and brought thereby to follow in workes that vvhich they profes in vvords, leaſt they deceiue them ſelues, and at the laſt reape moſt bitter fruites of their fayned fayth.</p>
            <p>Not onely theſe are in this preſent treatiſe admoniſhed of their dutie, but many other moſt profitable poyntes of Chriſtian doctrine and godly inſtructions are learnedly handled and liuely ſet forth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vvhereby the Chriſtian readers may learne to direct their doinges, and order their life according to the preſcript rule of Gods vvorde. As for them vvhich obſtinately refuſe, or at the leaſt vviſe little regarde ſuch godly inſtructions as God hath in theſe dayes (his name be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye prayſed therefore) by his faythfull Miniſters both by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and vvriting offered vnto them: let them remember that they that are of God heare and receiue Gods vvord, and if they doe the contrarie that they are not of God: let them knovv, if they be novv vvearie of it and come to the lothing of it, that their ſoule is fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a daungerous diſeaſe. For as a good appetite to naturall foode is a token of the helth of the body, and to refuſe and loth the ſame is a ſure ſigne of ſome ſickenes or diſeaſe: ſo is it likevviſe in the ſoule refuſing or lothing the heauenly foode of Gods vvord. Againe let them call to minde, that it vvas aunſvvered to the rich glutton being tormented in hell, vvhen he vvould haue one ſent from the dead to admoniſh his brethren, leaſt they came into that torment, that his brethren had Moſes and the Prophets, vvhom they ought to heare, if they vvould auoyde the like fierie flames and helliſh torments. Let them aſſure themſelues that the day vvill come, vvhen Chriſt Ieſus ſhall vvith vnſpeakable maieſtie and infinite power come to iudge the quicke and the dead, vvhen from the furtheſt corners of the vvorld ſhal be heard the ſound of the trumpet, vvherevvith all ſhalbe called to the iudgement ſeate, then the ſecretes of all heartes ſhall be layde open, and the doinges of euery man playnely diſcouered. Then the vngodly and vvicked ones, vvhich haue in this life deſpiſed the vvord of God,
<pb facs="tcp:4126:4"/>
neglected his commaundements and will contayned therein, and not repented them of their wickednes, ſhall in ſtede of comfort on euerye ſide feele extreme dread and horrour. If they looke behinde them they ſhall ſee the world conſuming with fire, if they looke on the right hand, they ſhall perceiue a ſinnefull conſcience accuſing them, if they turne to the left, there ſhall be the deuel readye to receiue them into endeles paynes, if they looke before them, they ſhall ſee a terrible and iuſt iudge comming to iudge them according to their wicked works. VVhereas the godly voyde of all theſe dreadefull terrours, ſhall ſee a moſt louing Sauiour, who ſhall then admitte them wholy into the ful fruition of eternall ioy and bleſſednes.</p>
            <p>Seing then the caſe thus ſtandeth, it is requiſite that all men, which minde to be ſaued, doe ſearch the Scriptures which teſtifie of this Sauiour, doe diligently heare and reade the worde of God, doe vſe ſuch meanes as God hath appoynted to come to the knowledge thereof, and knowing it, doe follow it in their life and conuerſation, yea and doe become moſt heartely thankefull vnto God, that it hath pleaſed him in mercy to ſende to reigne ouer vs, not a tyrannicall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod to oppreſſe vs, but a moſt gracious Princes ſo in peace and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes to gouerne vs, that the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt hath not in any age had freer paſſage, nor hath bin more abundantly and truly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and ſet forth, which God for his Chriſtes ſake graunt long to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. So farre then ought all to be of from deſpiſing or neglecting the worde and the Preachers and Miniſters thereof, that they ought to acknowledge the enioying of it to be an ineſtimable benefite of God, and to ſhewe themſelues thankfull for ſo great a benefite, not onely in hearing, reading, and meditating of it, but alſo according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and power it ſetting in forth and making it knowne vnto other. VVherefore I, according to that ſmall talent, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon me, haue employed my trauell in tranſlating this treatiſe into our mother toung, that thoſe my godly country men, vvhich are ignorant of the Latine tongue may become partakers of ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine, wholeſome admonitions, and godly inſtructions as are contayned therein: VVhich treatiſe, reuerend Father, I thought good to publishe the rather vnder the protection of your name, that therby it might be the more vvillingly accepted, and the better lyked of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, vvho haue of a long time knovvne you to be a learned and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preacher of Gods vvorde, and an earneſt furtherer of all godlynes vvhich God graunt that you may long be, to the great aduauncement of his glory, the ſingular commoditie of his Church, and the dayly comfort of your ovvne conſcience.</p>

            <p>The author of this Epiſtle vvas Iames the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">The author of this Epiſtle vvho &amp; vvhat he vvas.</note> vvho is called the brother of the Lord. He, togither with the reſt of the Apoſtles, vvas not onely the ſpace of three yeares inſtructed by the voyce and ſpirite of the Lorde: but alſo after the reſurrection of Chriſt vvith the other Apoſtles receiued the holye Ghoſt, and a commaundement to preach the Goſpell to all nations, and on the day of Pentecoſt vvas againe by a viſible ſigne authoriſed and confirmed in his Apoſtleſhip. Hereof it appeareth vvhat is to be iudged of this Epiſtle, to vvit,<note place="margin">Of vvhat au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie this Epiſtle is, and from vvhence the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> that vve muſt giue no leſſe credit to it, then to the voyce of God, for the author thereof is the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, vvho at the laſt ſealed the Goſpell of Chriſt vvith his blood. For vvhen he taught Chriſt to bee the conquerer of death, and to ſit at the right hand of God in heauen, the Ievves did caſt ſtones at him, and at the length he kneeling vpon his knees, and praying for his perſecutours, vvas ſlayne vvith a fullers clubbe, and that not long before the citie vvas aſſaulted by Veſpaſian. VVhether therefore thou conſidereſt the miniſterie of God, vvherin this man did labour, eyther his life, eyther his confeſſion, or his ende, thou haſt a teſtimonie of the infallible truth of his doctrine.</p>
            <p>The occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Iames had to write, ſeemeth to be double,<note place="margin">The occaſion vvhich mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Iames to vvrite this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, is of tvvo ſortes.</note> one the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, an other the hypocriſie in many. Hovv great the perſecution of the Church vvas in the time of Iames, the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall hiſtorie doth teache at large. For the Ievves were not onelye afflicted by being diſperſed through the vvhole vvorld: but alſo they vvere euen almoſt ouervvhelmed vvith diuers tentations of heretikes and deuels. For as invvardly they vvere moleſted by falſe brethren: ſo outvvardly by tyranes they vvere prouoked to forſake their profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſometime vvith threatninges ſometime vvith promiſes. Hypocriſie alſo did not a litle offend them. For many did profeſſe Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledging him to be a ſauiour, did extoll his benefites, but they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vvithout a liuely fayth and repentance. VVith theſe troubles vvas the Church then toſſed, vvith theſe vexations vvas the ſpouſe of Chriſt

then afflicted, vvhich vvhen Iames did ſee, he tooke therupon occaſion to vvrite, that by ſome meanes he might remedy theſe euils.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The end and purpoſe of the Apoſtle.</note>Of this occaſion the ſcope and purpoſe of Iames in this Epiſtle may be eaſily vnderſtande. For all which he here ſayth, tendeth vnto this ende, not onely to confirme and ſtrengthen Chriſtians and thoſe that be godly in deede, agaynſt the offence of affliction, vvhom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vnto patience, that they ſhould not, being ouercome vvith te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, giue ouer their confeſſion, but rather looke to the euent and end of affliction: but alſo that he may call backe hypocrites from their errour, whom as he teacheth hovv vayne the boſting of fayth is vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a liuely confidence in God and the true fruites of faith: ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them vnto maners vvorthy of a Chriſtian profeſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them from the vices contrarie thereunto, except they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer iuſt puniſhment for their ſtubburnneſſe and diſobedience.

Some doe call theſe Epiſtles Canonicall, thereby to put a difference betweene them and the Epiſtles of Paule, who are in a manifeſt errour. For the Epiſtles of Paule are no leſſe Canonicall then the Epiſtles of Iames, the Epiſtles of Peter, or of Iohn, bicauſe that whatſoeuer we read in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, we ought to embrace it as a canon or rule of the truth.</p>

Secondly, the Apoſtle maketh mention of them to whom he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. Laſtly he addeth a ſalutation. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Epiſtle is Iames, who by profeſſion was the ſeruant of God, but by office the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſte, that is,<note place="margin">To vvhom the Apoſtle vvriteth this Epiſtle.</note> an Apoſtle. He did write to the twelue tribes ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroade, and as Peter hath mentioned, diſperſed through the world. In hiſtories mention is made of the manifolde ſcattering abroade of the Iewes.

               <q>2 My brethren, count it all ioy, vvhen ye fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tentations.</q>
               <p>The propoſition of the firſt exhortation, to witte, that the beleeuing Iewes be not ouercome of tentations. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is worthely made firſt vnto them, who being driuen out of their countrye, were oppreſſed with diuers iniuries of their neighbours. Whereas he ſaith not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, be not ouercome of tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or ſome ſuch like thing, but count it all, that is, full ioye, when you fall into diuers tentations: he putteth a difference betweene the effectes of the tentation of the godly and of the vngodly.<note place="margin">The ends of the tentation of the godlye and of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> For as the ende of the tentation of the vngodly is ſorrowfulnes and deſperation: ſo the ende of the tentation of the godly is ioye and victorie ouer tentation. When he ſayth <hi>diuers,</hi> he ſignifieth that the beleuers are not tried with one kinde of tentation, but with many and diuers, wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Chriſtians to watch, leaſt that they being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with diuerſitie of tentations, doe fall into the handes of the aduerſarie.</p>
               <q>3 Knovving that the trying of your fayth bringeth forth patience.</q>
               <p>A reaſon of the propoſition taken of the effectes of the tentations of the godly. For firſt tentation is,<note place="margin">The effectes of the tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the godly.</note> as it were a touchſtone, whereby the faith of Chriſtians is tryed, we haue an example in Abraham. For they whoſe faithe is not true, in the time of tentation doe depart, according to the parable in the Goſpell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. Contrariwiſe they, whoſe faith is firme and ſure, are made ſtronger throughe tentations, for they are vphelde by the ſpirite of God. Moreouer, fayth being tryed worketh patience, that is, maketh that we doe patiently ſuffer affliction, for hope of

our deliuerance: Wherupon Paule ſaith, that experience bringeth forth hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed, that is, faileth vs not, that at the length we ſhoulde be aſhamed in the ſight of the ſonne of God.</p>
               <q>4 And let patience haue her perfect vvorke.</q>

                  <note place="margin">The finall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the croſſe of the godly.</note>The ende and effect of the affliction of the godly is here declared, which is the perfecting of vs in Chriſt. For all our life time we ought to endeuour to come vnto this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is dayly poliſhed and fined with affliction as with the inſtrument of God, vntill ſuche time as it be fully finiſhed. This place doth admoniſh vs to ſpeake ſome what of Chriſtian perfection, which Iames defineth here to be entirenes. But bicauſe the Papiſts doe but trifle and dally concerning Chriſtian perfection, it is expedient rightly to inſtruct the godly, that they may know what they ought to thinke concerning the ſame. We muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand therefore,<note place="margin">Two kinds of perfection mentioned in the ſcripture.</note> that there is a double perfection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs in the Scripture, whereof the one is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and is an imputation of the perfect righteouſneſſe and obedience of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. For as Chriſt by his obedience on the Croſſe doth make a full ſatiſfaction for ſinnes: ſo his obedience to the law impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth righteouſneſſe, ſo that euerie one that beleeueth, may appeare perfect and righteous in the ſighte of God through the perfection and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. We hauing confidence in this perfection, doe looke for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of immortalitie. An other perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4126:8"/>
which the word of God commendeth to all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye: <hi>walke before me</hi> (ſaithe the Lorde vnto our father A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham) <hi>and be thou perfect.</hi> Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note> ye ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be perfect,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.48.</note> as your father which is in heauen is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. There is no doubt, thou wilt ſay, concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, but it is demaunded wherin that perfection doth conſiſt. We muſt vnderſtand that Paule <hi>Philip. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </hi> vſeth the word of perfection after two ſortes. For he ſayth thus: <hi>Not as though I had already attained to it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 3.12.13.14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>neyther were alredy perfect: but I follow if I may comprehend that for whoſe ſake alſo I am comprehended of Christ Ieſus. Brethren I count not my ſelfe that I haue attained to it, but one thing I doe: I forget that which is behind, and endeuor my ſelfe vnto that which is before, and follow hard towarde the marke, for the price of the hie calling of God in Christe Ieſus. Let vs therefore as many as be perfect, be thus min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> In theſe wordes of Paule there is a moſt manifeſt contradiction, vnleſſe we will admitte, that there be more kindes of perfection then one. Firſt he ſaith that he is not perfecte, afterwarde hee numbreth him ſelfe among them that be perfect. There is therefore a double vſe of this worde, for ſometime one is ſayd to be perfect in ſubſtance, as we ſay that a childe is a perfect man, that is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Sometimie one is ſaid to be perfect in quantitie or degrees, as when we ſay: no man hath perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according to the lawe of God. After the firſt maner Abraham, Dauid, Paule, the theefe on the croſſe. &amp;c. were perfect. According to the latter maner no man in this life hath bin found perfect, beſide Chriſt Ieſus alone, but that perfection we ſhal obtaine in the lyfe euerlaſting, where we ſhall be made like vnto Chriſte. But that the ſtate of grace in this life is perfection after a ſorte,<note place="margin">Definitions of chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection taken out of the wordes of Paule.</note> it may be taught partly by deſcriptions, partly by examples. Of the wordes of Paule which I haue rehearſed, this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be gathered, that Chriſtian perfection is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb facs="tcp:4126:9"/>
ſinne, to reſt vpon Chriſt by fayth, and to preaſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the marke for the price of the hie calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus. Or as Paul defineth it in the Epiſtle to Timothe:<note place="margin">VVho may be ſayd to be perfect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vſe of the Scriptures.</note> Chriſtian perfection is to fight a good fight, to haue faith and a good conſcience. Whoſoeuer therefore forſaketh ſinne, renounceth lewd and wycked deſires, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth himſelfe with confidence &amp; truſt in the mediatour, and endeuoureth to approue his whole lyfe before God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his conſcience be not defiled: according to the vſe of the Scripture he is called perfect, and that in ſubſtance, not in degrees. For Chriſt onely was perfect both in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and in degrees. But this may more euidentlye be perceiued by examples. It was ſayd vnto Abraham <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ.</hi> 17. walke before me and be thou perfect.<note place="margin">A liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> How Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham obeyed this precept, and how he walked before God and was perfect, it is playnely declared <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 22. by the commaundement of God, and the obedience of Abraham. But that this may be the better vnderſtande, let vs annex the wordes of Moſes:<note place="margin">Gen. 22.2.3.4.6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold therfore,</hi> ſaith the Lord to Abraham,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</note> 
                  <hi>take now thine onely ſonne Iſaac whom thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, and gette thee vnto the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offring vpon one of the mountains, which I will ſhew thee.</hi> Here thou haſt the precept, the obedience followeth.<note place="margin">The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham tovvarde God.</note> 
                  <hi>Then Abraham roſe vp early in the morning, and ſadled his Aſſe, and tooke two of his ſeruants with him, and Iſaac his ſonne, and cloue wood for the burnt offring, and roſe vp and went to the place which God had tolde him.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Then Abraham tooke the wood of the burnt offring, and layde it vpon Iſaac.</hi> And afterwarde it followeth: <hi>And he bound Iſaac his ſonne, and layd him on the altar vpon the wood, and Abraham stretching forth his hand, tooke the knife to kill his ſonne.</hi> By this example of Abraham it plainely appeareth, what that perfection is, which the Lord requireth of his ſeruaunts in this life. God commaunded that Abraham, who was iuſtified before by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4126:9"/>
faith, ſhould kill his ſonne. Abraham had nothing more deare vnto him then this his ſonne, nothing more ſweete and pleaſant. For he was the onely comfort of life to the olde man Abraham, and to the moſt holy matron Sara. What doth Abraham here? He beholdeth and conſidereth two things, God commanding, and his ſonne, then whom nothing was more deare vnto him in this life. But he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the commaundement of God before the life of his ſonne. Hereupon therfore I conclude, that the perfection of the Saintes in this life is, by faith ſo to obey God,<note place="margin">VVhat vve muſt doe if vve vvill be counted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life.</note> that they preferre obedience towarde God before all worldlye thinges, whatſoeuer. They which are ſo affected, are by good right counted perfect. But they which at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God will not kill ſo much as one of their affections, how can they boaſt of this perfection? Let vs propound an other example out of the newe Teſtament.<note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vvhere by perfection and the partes thereof may be perceiued. Matth. 19.21.</note> Chriſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. ſaith to the yong man of whom he was aſked concerning the obtaining of eternall life: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go, ſel that thou hast and giue it to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen, and come and follow me.</hi> Chriſt knew that this rich yong man was to muche addicted to riches, and that he could not eaſily turne his minde from them. That therefore this yong man may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how farre he is of from the true perfection of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience toward the lawe, the Lorde biddeth him forſake his riches and follow him. The Lord ſeemeth here to make two partes of perfection, to wit, to leaue and forſake riches, and to follow Chriſt. But we muſt know that as it was a perſonall precept, in the which Abraham was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to kill his ſonne: ſo is this perſonall which is here giuen to this yong man. Wherefore neither of them particularly is to be tranſferred to the generall definition of perfection, but generally onely, otherwiſe neither Noe, neyther Dauid, nor Paule had bine perfect. Wherefore we will applye theſe examples to the generall definition
<pb facs="tcp:4126:10"/>
after this manner: As Abraham, bicauſe by fayth he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred obedience toward God before the life of his moſte deare and onely ſonne, is ſayd to be perfect, and the yong man following Chriſt, if he had preferred pouertie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie toward the poore before his riches, had bine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect according to the ſentence of Chriſte:<note place="margin">VVho is ſayde to be perfect and who to be vnperfect.</note> ſo euerye one which by a true faith preferreth obedience toward God, before all thinges of this world, is ſayde in the Scripture to be perfect. And on the contrarie. They which preferre worldly thinges, their owne affections, honour, glorie, pleaſures, and diuers other deceits, before obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, are vnperfect, yea, they doe but in vaine glorye of the name of Chriſtians. Theſe thinges agree with thoſe which we haue before mentioned out of Paule, of which alſo we gather this definition of Chriſtian perfection:</p>

                  <note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an perfection.</note>Chriſtian perfection is, imperfection being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to preferre obedience towarde God by fayth in Chriſt before all worldly things, and to make good and allowable the whole lyfe before God.<note place="margin">Two parts of chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> Of this chriſtian perfection, Chriſt maketh two partes, to wit: to followe him, which is done by true conuerſion: and to preferre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towarde him, before thoſe things which are euen moſt deare vnto vs. And hitherto of chriſtian perfection concerning the ſubſtance. But we ſhall then be perfect in degrees when the ſonne of God ſhall appeare, to whome we ſhall be like, bicauſe we ſhall ſee him as he is, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hath his hope repoſed in him, doth purifie him ſelfe, euen as he is pure.</p>
               <q>5 If any of you lacke vviſedom, let him aske of God, vvhich giueth to all men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and it shall be giuen him.</q>

               <p>He preſcribeth howe wiſedome is to be aſked of God, to

Secondly, it ſheweth that he is liberall to communicate of the fountaine of his goodneſſe to them that doe aſke. Alſo it declareth that prayer proceeding from faith,<note place="margin">Hovv al good things are to be obtayned at the handes of God.</note> is the ordinarie meane by whiche we may obteine and receiue good thinges at the hand of God. Agayne, it giueth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that in prayer is required faith, which reſteth vpon the goodneſſe of the mediatour. Furthermore of this place is gathered, that all douting is farre to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from prayer: for he which douteth or wauereth when he prayeth, doth onely poure out wordes vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and prayeth not effectually, whereupon this alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that if we muſt not wauer nor dout in prayer, it is but in vayne to make more mediatours.<note place="margin">A vaine thing to ſeeke after more media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures.</note> For they which ſeeke after more mediatours, doe thinke that they are not heard for the one and onely mediatour Chriſt. Moreouer with this ſaying of Iames diſagreeth the opinion of the Papiſts, who goe about to make faith and douting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree togither. To theſe may be added that all things that pertaine to the ſaluation of our ſoules, are to be aſked without any conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Finally, the opinion of the Stoicks is here confuted, concerning the neceſſitie of the falling out of thinges: for as wiſedome is here promiſed to him that aſketh it by faith, ſo the wiſedome wherof mention is here made, is not giuen to him that doth not aſke it.</p>
               <q>

                  <note place="margin">Our faith muſt not vvauer in prayer and vvhy.</note>This is a reaſon, why in prayer he requireth fayth without wauering: for he which wauereth, ſaythe he, is compared to a waue of the ſea, that is, he is vnconſtant. For as the waue of the ſea is driuen ſometime into this

The argument is concluded after this ſort: Bleſſed is the man that endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth tentation,<note place="margin">The reaſon why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to reioyce in tentations.</note> that is which fainteth not vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of tentation: therefore the godly oughte with good cauſe to reioyce, when they fall into diuers tentations. The antecedent he proueth by the ende of tentation being ouercome after this maner: when he that is tempted, is tried, he ſhall receiue a crowne of life,<note place="margin">The bleſſed ende of the tentations of the godly.</note> therefore he may well be called bleſſed. The antecedent is grounded vpon the promiſes of God, <hi>vvhich crovvne,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>God hath promiſed to them that loue him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Papiſtes abuſe of this place, and the confutation thereof.</note> This place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts abuſe to confirme their opinion concerning merites of workes. But the very circumſtance of the place confuteth them. For the Apoſtle dealeth here with them that are conuerted, who being iuſtified before by fayth, do go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row diuers tentations to the hauen of bleſſedneſſe: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, it is one thing to ſpeake of the cauſe of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and another thing to ſpeake of the way, by which we muſt come vnto ſaluation which is free. Neyther is the crowne of life a rewarde due to our fighte, but a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of our labour. For we doe not deſerue a crowne by fighting, but the father giueth it vnto his children of his mere goodneſſe, who conſidereth not ſo much what the children doe deſerue, as what he hath promiſed them of his fatherly loue. Furthermore, if any man obiect:<note place="margin">An obiection.</note> the crowne of life is promiſed to them that loue, therfore loue is a merit or deſert of the crowne:<note place="margin">The aunſvver.</note> We muſt aunſwere that there is committed a fallacion of that which is not the cauſe as of the cauſe. For the antecedent doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the cauſe of the crowne, but the qualitie or maner of crowning. And bicauſe there be two principles of things, one that the thinges be, the other that they maye be

For theſe doe make that thou maieſt be knowne to be righteous, and ſaued. Wherupon the Lord ſayth:<note place="margin">Matth. 25.35.36.</note> 
                  <hi>I was an hungred and ye gaue me meate, I was naked and ye clothed me.</hi> By theſe fruites of fayth the angels of God and men ſhall iudge the tree in the laſt day, and thereby ſhall account the righteouſneſſe and ſaluation of the elect. But here of more in the ſecond chapter, where ſhall be entreated of a liuely and of a dead fayth.</p>
               <q>13 Let no man ſay, vvhen he is tempted: I am temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God: for God can not be tempted vvith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, neither tempteth he any man.</q>
               <p>He being about to entreate of the cauſes of tentation, firſt taketh away the error of them which thought God to be the author of tentation,<note place="margin">God is not the author of tentation, or of ſinne.</note> and forbiddeth that any man, when he is tempted (that is, when he is prouoked to doe euill) ſay that he is tempted of the Lorde. For God wyll not haue ſinne, therefore he prouoketh not to ſinne, neither is delighted with the perdition of men. Wherfore as God himſelfe is voyde of tentation: ſo doth he tempt no man, that is, he doth not moue him forwardes to ſinne.

               <q>14 But euery man is tempted vvhen he is dravvne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay by his ovvne concupiſcence, and is entiſed.</q>
               <p>He ſheweth the cauſe and fountayne of tentation, that is,<note place="margin">From vvhence tentation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, and the maner hovve.</note> of prouoking to doe euill.

This of Plato is worthely called a beaſt with many heads, of which it is ſpoken prouerbially, Concupiſcence is the firſt beginning of all euells. For it is a moſt fruitefull mother of pernicious children: to this Marcus the Heremite did attribute ſelfe loue.<note place="margin">The plentifull frutes of fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</note> Of this do ſpring ſurfetting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, couetouſneſſe, thirſt after vayne glorye.

Of thirſt after vayne glory ſpringeth pride, wicked ambition, diuers ill practiſes, briefly contempt of God and of our neighbour. Thou ſeeſt what a fruitefull mother of all vices the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the fleſh is, which one hath called, and not vnworthely,<note place="margin">Fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence the roote of all miſchiefe.</note> the fountayne of all euel, in aſmuch as it is not onely the euident cauſe of all iniquitie and hatred of God, but alſo it calleth men from that which is good and honeſt. For when men doe ſtudy vpon heauenly thinges, and meditate vpon diuine matters, this commeth, and with entiſements as with certayne cordes draweth them backe. Wherefore Iames doth not without good cauſe affirme, that men are entiſed by their owne concupiſcence. But how ſhal we ouercome the concupiſcence of the fleſh?

a certayne newe concupiſcence, which is called the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the ſpirite.

<q>19 VVherefore my deare brethren, let euery man be ſvvift to heare, ſlovve to ſpeake, and ſlovve to vvrath.</q>
By the example of Chriſt, Paule, Peter, yea, and of all the Prophetes and Apoſtles, he, by the vertue of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration maketh a neceſſitie of liuing godly and holily, for godlyneſſe and holyneſſe is the proper effect of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the eares and lips wherein it conſiſteth.</note> And bicauſe God requireth a certayne circumciſion of the eares and of the lips, Iames vrgeth the ſame, and will haue him that is regenerate, ſwift to heare and learn thoſe things which are good and healthfull, but ſlowe to ſpeake. By which ſaying, he will haue firſt that the toung doe not runne before the witte. Secondly, that we doe flie trifling, vayne, and rayling ſpeaches. Thirdlye, that we ſpeake only things neceſſarie, whiche tende to edifying and honeſtie. Herewith very well agreeth the ſaying: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake that which is better than ſilence, or elſe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither keepe ſilence.</p>
                  <q>20 For the vvrath of man doth not accomplishe the righteouſnes of God.</q>
                  <p>What kynde of wrath is here forbidden, is to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both by the reaſon which is vnder annexed, and alſo by the concluſion, yea, by the whole circumſtance of this place. <hi>The vvrath of man,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>doth not accomplish the righteouſnes of God,</hi> that is, it doth not execute that,
<pb facs="tcp:4126:19"/>
which God ſpeaketh and preſcribeth,<note place="margin">VVhat kinde of wrath the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth.</note> nay it maketh that thou doeſt in vaine heare God ſpeaking. Wherfore wrath in this place is taken for that wrath, which proceedeth of a deſire to contende, whereby the audience is hindred. The Apoſtle therfore wil haue one to heare another, their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being appeaſed and quieted. For where tumults and contentions haue place, the righteouſneſſe of God is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that is, thoſe thinges are nothing accounted of, which God preſcribeth to vs, and requireth of vs.</p>
                  <q>21 VVherefore lay apart all filthineſſe and ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of malitiouſnes, and receyue vvith meekeneſſe the vvord that is graffed in you, vvhich is able to ſaue your ſoules.</q>
                  <p>This is the concluſion of the exhortation, in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs that we be ſwift to heare without wrath. This place doth verye well teach what hearers the worde of God requireth.<note place="margin">A deſcription of the true hearers of the word of God.</note> Firſt, filthineſſe and ſuperfluitie of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe ought to be away, that is, the affections of the fleſhe and reaſon ought to giue place to the word of God, that they ſtirre not vp contentions, wherevpon wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth. Secondly, meekeneſſe ought to be preſent, which ſuccedeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of wrath. Mekeneſſe here is as much as modeſtie or aptnes to learne. Thirdly, the mind being thus ordered &amp; prepared, the word which is graffed in vs is to be receiued, that is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word is to be receiued by faith which is graffed &amp; implanted in vs by the labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of the Miniſters.

If any man demaund how it commeth to paſſe that there is ſuch a ſlender knowledge and ſo weake a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye by the beholding of the glaſſe, let him know that the maner of doing according to the philoſophers doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the maner of being.

Wherefore they are not to be heard, which here ſharply reproue and find fault with Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes as a man ignorant of true religion. For it is one thing to define a thing and an other to ſignifie or ſhew it by certayne ſignes and tokens.

Wherefore this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apoſtle doth not ſubuert and ouerthrowe the order of God eſtabliſhed in the <note place="margin">The fift ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuiſion receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, for all do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements alike, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is a thing indifferent: he foloweth here the cuſtome of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> fourth commaundement concerning the honor of ſuperiours.

<q>
                     <p>2 For if there come into your company a man vvith a gold ring, and in goodly apparel, and there come in alſo a poore man in vile rayment,</p>
                     <p>3 And ye haue reſpect to him that vveareth the gaye clothing, and ſay vnto him, ſit thou here in a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, and ſay vnto the poore, ſtande thou there, or ſit here vnder my footeſtoole:</p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>By this example he declareth what maner of accepting of perſons he condemneth,<note place="margin">What maner of accepting of perſons the Apoſtle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alloweth.</note> to wit, that, which followeth a falſe iudgement for a true in iudging men. For he which doth that, is not onely condemned by the iudgement of his owne conſcience, but alſo his iudgement is peruerſe and naughtie, which taketh riches for a rule of difference.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4126:22"/>
He doth not therfore ſimply forbid to honor the rich, but he ſpeaketh by the way of compariſon, and condemneth him which honoureth wicked rich men with the contempt of godly poore men. Wherefore that accepting of perſons is here condemned, which followeth a falſe difference for a true, which keepeth not a right maner, which erreth from the right ende. If any man therfore preferreth a rich man before a poore, bicauſe he is rich, his iudgement is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and corrupt. Agayne, if thou doeſt ſo preferre a rich man before a poore, that thou handle the poore man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfully, there is ſinne in the maner thereof. Finally, if thou preferre a rich man before a poore to winne fauor thereby, thou haſt erred from the right ende. For what thing is more vnworthie than to deſpiſe the poore man which is godly and learned, and honourably to receyue and entertayne the rich man which is vngodly and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? He which maketh ſuch a difference with himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the poore man and the riche, is become a iudge of euill thoughtes, that is, is not rightly affected, but iudgeth peruerſly agaynſt the rule of godlyneſſe and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <q>5 Hearken my beloued brethren, hath not God cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the poore of this vvorlde that they shoulde be rich in fayth, and heires of the kingdome vvhich he promiſed to them that loue him?</q>
               <p>He doth in a ſhort entrance or preface ſtirre vp the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to be attentiue to the argument which he afterwarde annexeth. God hath choſen the poore of this world,<note place="margin">VVhy the poore of this vvorlde are not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed.</note> which are rich in fayth, that they ſhould be heyres of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which he hath promiſed to them that loue him.

of the Goſpel. For God hath choſen on this condition if men be engraffed by fayth in his ſonne without whom is no election but mere reprobation. In the third is put inheritance, whereby is ſignified adoption, by which the beleeuers receiue prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God. In the fourth is added loue, for that is the true fruite of fayth, and an affection proper to the ſonnes of God. It is no maruayle therefore if God hath promiſed a kingdome to them that loue him. For they by fayth haue obtayned power to be the ſonnes of God, yea and to be called heires of the heauenly kingdome. For it is manifeſt out of Paule that loue is not the cauſe of reigning when he ſayth:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note>

Paule ſayth. <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Brethren you ſee your calling, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath choſen the fooliſh thinges of the world. &amp;c.</hi>

For not a few rich and noble men are godly, choſen, and ſaued, and many poore men are vngodly, reprobates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Why therfore doth Paule ſay: <hi>Not many wiſe men, not many mighty, not many noble?</hi> Paule doth not ſpeake of the counſel of God, who will that al men ſhall be

Many being entiſed, and as it were made druncken with wiſedome, many with might, many with noblenes, many with riches, many alſo with other thinges cannot abide the ſweete ſauour of the Goſpell. Whereby it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that not by the counſell of God, which hath created no man to certayne damnation, but by their owne fault they are not elect. For God will haue all at length to be ſaued if ſo be that they doe embrace by fayth the author of their ſaluation. They which contemne him, doe worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall away from ſaluation. For God will caſt awaye thoſe and condemne them, no otherwiſe then an earthly father doth caſt of and diſherit an obſtinate and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſonne, which he woulde not haue done if he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed his father.<note place="margin">God will haue al to be ſaued, but yet by ſuch meanes as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, which they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, are iuſtly condemned.

For we muſt not thinke that God calleth them whom he will not haue ſaued. The latter part is a complaint of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt parte of men, which contemne the Goſpell, and will not liue worthy of ſo noble a calling. Wherof Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth in <hi>Matthew,</hi> where he is reprehended which had not a wedding garment, to the which reprehenſion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:4126:24"/>

                     </hi> will not. The meaning therefore of the ſaying of the Lord is: <hi>many be called,</hi> to wit, to obtayne ſaluation by Chriſt, ſo that they will beleeue the Goſpell. <hi>But fewe be choſen,</hi> that is, fewe haue the wedding garment, that is, fewe doe beleeue and are godly in deede. That this is the ſignification of the word election, it is manifeſt out of the pſalme, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and peruerſe or frowarde are ſet one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.25.</note> for he ſayth thus: <hi>with the elect thou ſhalt be elect, and with the froward thou ſhalt be froward.</hi> Therefore he is ſayd to be elect which is in deede a godly and ſincere worſhipper of God, keeping fayth and a good conſcience. Wherefore there is no cauſe that any man ſhould be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with thinking of his election, as though God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted ſome certayne men to ſaluation, and the greateſt part of men to certaine damnation: but rather let him thinke,<note place="margin">VVhom God will ſaue and whom he will condemne.</note> that this is the vnmoueable will of God, that as he will ſaue without difference all that be penitent: ſo on the contrarie he will condemne all that be impenitent.

                  <p>In theſe wordes are conteyned two plaine arguments.

                  <p>This is a preuenting of an obiection. For he preuenteth the obiection of hypocrites, by the which they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues, that they did well in honouring rich men, ſeeing that honour is included in the loue which the lawe doth require toward our neighbour.

But if ye regarde the perſon, ye commit ſinne, but that you regarde the perſon, it is manifeſt by your deede.

                  <p>He doth more forcibly vrge the hypocrites, which did flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them ſelues when as in one poynt of the law they had done their duty well,<note place="margin">He that faileth in one poynt of the lawe is guiltie of the whole lawe.</note> whoſe hypocriſie he reprehendeth by this argument: he which breaketh ſome one point of the law, is a tranſgreſſor of the lawe and giltie by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the lawe.

For when as the Apoſtle ſayth: <hi>as they that shall bee iudged by the lavve of libertie,</hi> he hath relation to the ſentence of the Lorde, who when he iudgeth the worlde, ſhall ſaye vnto them on his right hand: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my father,</hi>

may receiue the things which are done in his bodie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done whether it be good or euill.</hi>
                     </hi> That theſe ſayings and ſuch like are to be vnderſtand of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhal be ſaued, &amp; not of the cauſes of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the whole conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture, yea, the precious bloud of Chriſt doth ſhew, as ſhortly after I will more diſtinctly declare.<note place="margin">VVhy the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calleth as the lawe of libertie.</note> But why doth he call it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of libertie? That by that name he may ſhew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fruites of libertie are by good right required of chriſtians. For as he which doth commit ſinne, is the ſeruant of ſinne: ſo he which is deliuered by Chriſt, will be no more bonde but free, &amp; therefore will not take vpon him the yoke of bondage. He ſheweth a cauſe or reaſon when he ſayth: <hi>for there shall be condemnation mercileſſe to him that shevveth not mercie,</hi> but he that ſheweth mercie, is ſo farre of from being condemned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhal reioyce againſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, triumphing ouer death, ſin, and the deuill. Theſe things doe teach, how neceſſary continuall repentance and a perpetuall ſtudie of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and righteouſneſſe is among Chriſtians, leaſt by their owne fault they loſe the free benefit of ſaluation. But bicauſe the aduerſaries of free ſaluation doe abuſe this place and ſuch like, and make the cauſes of ſaluation of the tokens and qualities of them which ſhall be ſaued, I will briefly gather an aunſwere, whereby the godly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may haue, wherewith he maye be able throughly and truly to anſwere to this falſe cauill. Seing therefore that the Scripture doth expreſſely ſay,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.27.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Lord ſhall giue to euery man according to his deedes.</hi> Or as Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>according to that euery man hath done whether it be good or euill:</hi> Firſt of all, this is to be helde,<note place="margin">How the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be applied to the wicked, and howe to the godly.</note> that this generall ſentence which is the very voyce of God himſelfe, ought to be applied vnto two ſortes of men, according to the proportion of fayth, that is, to the wicked, according to the lawe, to the godly, according to the Goſpell after this maner: when the Lord giueth vnto
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4126:26"/>
the wicked according to their dedes, without all doubt he giueth vnto them hel and condemnation. For thoſe are the merits of the dedes of vngodlines. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly or regenerate, there are mo things to be conſidered. For firſt it is euident out of the infallible worde of God, that eternall life is not the wages of ſeruantes, but the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of children, and the free gift of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.6.8. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.3.5. Secondly, the proportion betwene the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father and an earthly father is to be conſidered: for as an earthly father doth giue vnto his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to their deedes, that is, inheritance to them that are obedient, and diſheriteth them that are diſobedient: ſo God the father promiſeth inheritance to his children, but thoſe which of children are made obſtinate and enemies, he ſuffreth not to enioy the inheritance. But nowe it is manifeſt that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an earthly father are neither children nor heires through deſert of their works.<note place="margin">VVe are heires not through workes but through grace</note> After the ſame ſort the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are neyther made children nor heires bicauſe of their works, but through the grace of adoption, which is receyued by fayth alone, notwithſtanding eyther of them doth giue vnto his children according to their dedes. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this may yet be more plainly vnderſtand, how God ſhall giue to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to his dedes, foure circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are to be weighed of vs, the firſt wherof is, that the rigour of the law is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. <hi>Christ hath redemed vs from the curſe of the lawe.</hi> The ſeconde is, that the perſon nowe beleeuing doth by fayth pleaſe God and is heire of eternall life. <hi>Iohn. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </hi> The thirde, that God doth not onely require obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the perſon that beleeueth, but alſo doth promiſe him a rewarde, and that not of debt for the worthineſſe of the worke, but of grace for his fatherly promiſe ſake: The fourth, that workes ſo done by fayth, are teſtimonies of fayth, as proper effectes are moſt certaine tokens of their cauſe. And therefore it is ſayde that God ſhall giue vnto
<pb facs="tcp:4126:27"/>
euery man according to his dedes,<note place="margin">VVhy it is ſayd that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man shall be iudged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deedes.</note> both becauſe dedes are the true tokens of the feare of God &amp; of fayth, and alſo that the whole creature maye beare witneſſe of the iuſtice of God in iudging. This anſwere is taken from the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Scripture, which we muſt of neceſſitie ſurely hold, leſt that with the Papiſtes we attribute ſaluation to the merits of works, or with the <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> we lay aſide all care and ſtudye to do well. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is made manifeſt by an euident example. <hi>Mat. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaith that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of heauen is likened vnto a certayne king, that is, that there is the ſame reaſon of the ſpiritual ſtate of the Church, which is betweene an earthly king and his ſeruants in the affaires of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life. For euen as the king, his ſeruant owing him ten thouſand talents, yet when he fell downe and beſought him, he forgaue him the whole dette freely and of his mere liberalitie: ſo God the father doth freely forgiue them all debtes, that is, ſinnes, which flie vnto him for ſuccour with truſt and confidence in Chriſt. Hereof it is manifeſt that remiſſion of ſinnes is free. But euen as the king called agayne vnto puniſhment that ſeruant, being vnthankefull and cruell toward his fellowſeruants, and that which before he forgaue him when he humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him, nowe he requireth agayne of him being ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and cruel toward his fellowes: So God, after he hath receiued vs being ſorie for our ſinne, into fauour, will haue vs imitate his example in liberalitie and goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our neighbour. This the Lord teacheth <hi>Luke. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding an example of two detters, the one whereof ought vnto the lender fiue hundred pence, and the other fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: who when they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them both. Here the Lord aſked the Phariſes whether of them will loue the lender moſt, to whom when the Phariſe had made aunſwere, he to whom he forgaue moſt, the Lorde ſayd, thou haſt truly iudged: ſignifying that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4126:27"/>
thankfulneſſe of them, whom he hath freely receiued into fauour. Hereof are gathered two thinges, to wit, both that forgiueneſſe is free, and alſo that they which haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned forgiueneſſe, doe owe thankfulnes vnto God.</p>
                  <q>14 VVhat auayleth it my brethren though a man ſayth he hath fayth, vvhen he hath no vvorkes, can that faith ſaue him?</q>
                  <p>Bicauſe there were among them to whom the Apoſtles did write, hypocrites, which when they were touched with no true repentance, yet they did boaſt that they were ſaued by faith, when as they had no true and liuely faith in dede:<note place="margin">That fayth which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not forth good workes, is not true, but vayne, and cannot ſaue.</note> he maketh a confutation of their erroneous opinion, and teacheth that that faith is vayne, which doth not bring forth it true fruites. This propoſition is diligently to be marked, faith which hath not workes is vneffectuall and vayne, or as Iames ſpeaketh, cannot ſaue. This onely propoſition is confirmed euen vnto the end of the chapter.<note place="margin">Paule and Iames ſpeake diuerſly of fayth.</note> Wherefore they are fowly deceiued which compare Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes with Paule, when as Iames diſputeth onely of the vayne boaſting of hypocrites, Paule of a liuely fayth. And therfore let vs diligently marke in this place, what faith the Apoſtle calleth vayne, to wit that, which hath no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience toward God accompanying it, in aſmuch as it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worſhippeth God nor dooth wel to it neighboure, wherevpon it manifeſtly followeth that Iames doth not ſpeake of a liuely and a right fayth, from which the ſpirit of Chriſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ſeparate. For where the ſpirit of Chriſt is, there are newe actions of the newe man, although not perfect, yet vnperfect, by which the force and vertue of fayth is acknowledged and brought forth.

<pb facs="tcp:4126:28"/>
it is a ſtoppe or let from ſaluation, it is a guider or leader vnto death, briefly it hath it portion with hypocrites and deuels.</p>
                  <q>

Euen as that ſpeech is vayne, wherein it is ſayde to the needy, warme your ſelues and fill your bellies, when as helping handes are not alſo put to: ſo that fayth is vayne and dead which is in the mouth without the fruite of works. Note here the name of faith, (which he calleth vaine) for when it is called deade, it is compared to a carkas, wherefore it deſerueth no better to be called faith, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a carkas deſerueth to be called a liuing creature.

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſumme of this reaſon is this: Such as the fayth of Abraham was,<note place="margin">That our faith ought to haue good workes ioyned with it, it is proued by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> ought alſo the fayth of other beleeuers to be.

The firſt reaſon.</note> This is the ſumme of the argument. Now let vs wey the wordes of the Apoſtle, which are wreſted of the Schoolemen againſt free iuſtification. Firſt the word <hi>iuſtified</hi> is to be diſcuſſed, which is as much, as if he had ſayd, was declared to be iuſt, or was knowen to be iuſtified and that this is ſo I proue by three neceſſarie arguments. The firſt is taken of the ſcope and end of this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Iames hath not purpoſed a diſputation of the cauſes of iuſtification, but onely doth ſhew by what effects iuſtification may be gathered, and as it were ſet before the eyes of men. Seing therefore it is an exceeding great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, of effects to make cauſes in reſpect of the ſame
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4126:29"/>
thing, they are by no meanes to be borne, which forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſcope &amp; ende of the diſputation &amp; propoſition that is to be proued, preſume very high, &amp; go about to diſproue the doctrine of Paul concerning free iuſtification,<note place="margin">Paule and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the one to the other, but there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence onely in the purpoſe of them both.</note> when as the purpoſe of Paul was far otherwiſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iames. For Paul ſeketh the cauſe of iuſtification: Iames the effects of the ſame: Paul deſcendeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effects: Iames contrariwiſe aſcendeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the effects to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes. Paul ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth how we are iuſtified: Iames how we are declared to be iuſtified. Paule excludeth works as cauſes of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Iames includeth the ſame, as the effectes of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Seing there is ſo great difference betwene the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Paule and Iames, who ſeeth not the vanitie of the Scholemen, which ſay that the Apoſtles are contrary the one to the other.<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the taking of this word iuſtified</note> The ſeconde neceſſarie argument is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the order of the cauſes and the effects, <hi>Geneſ. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham is pronounced to be iuſtified. <hi>Abraham beleeued the Lord, and he counted that to him for righteouſneſse.</hi> But this came to paſſe thirtie yeares at the leaſt, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued a commaundement concerning the offering of his ſonne Iſaac. <hi>Geneſ. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </hi> Howe therefore can it be that he ſhoulde be ſayde to be iuſtified by that worke, which he did the thirtie yere after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was by the voyce of God ſaid to be iuſtified. It is neceſſarie therfore that to be iuſtified in Iames doe ſignifie to be declared iuſtified.</p>
                  <p>The thirde neceſſarie argument is taken of the wordes of the Angell, <hi>Geneſ. <hi>22.</hi>

And thus briefly it is declared, what the word
<pb facs="tcp:4126:30"/>
of iuſtification doth ſignifie in this diſputation of Iames. Afterwarde when he ſayth <hi>that the fayth vvrought vvith his vvorkes,</hi> he expreſſeth the nature of a liuely fayth, to wit, that it is effectuall and full of good workes. Seing that the fayth of hypocrites hath not this nature, it is in no caſe to be iudged a true and liuely fayth. This ſaying therefore of Iames doth teach nothing elſe, but that good workes doe proceede of fayth. That which Iames addeth: <hi>through the vvorkes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VVhat it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams faith was made perfect tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row workes.</note> 
                     <hi>the fayth vvas made perfect,</hi> is nothing els than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fayth of Abraham was declared by his workes, not to haue bene counterfait or hypocriticall, but true and ſincere. For if thou doeſt cal that perfect here, which is in it degrees abſolute, no mortall man liuing at any time hath had a perfect fayth. Moreouer, when he ſayth that <hi>the ſcripture</hi> was fulfilled which ſaith: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham beleeued God, and it vvas imputed vnto him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is not to be referred vnto the cauſe, but vnto the effect. For by that deede Abraham declared that he was in very deede iuſtified before by fayth. This fulfilling therefore ought to be referred to the experience of men, and not to the iudgement of God.</p>
                  <q>25 Likevviſe alſo vvas not Rahab the harlot iuſtified through vvorks, vvhen she had receyued the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and ſent them out another vvay?</q>

                     <note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that true fayth is not deſtitute of good workes.</note>He proueth by another example y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a true &amp; a liuely faith is not without works.

                  <q>26 For as the bodie vvithout the ſpirit is dead: euen ſo the fayth vvithout vvorkes is deade.</q>

therefore no mouing or ſenſe of a liuing creature is founde in it. And thus Iames by ſixe firme reaſons hath proued that a true fayth is frutefull in good workes, and that the fayth of hypocrites, which is voyd of workes, is a vayne boaſting rather than fayth.</p>

For they onely which repent, are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, wherewith is ioyned iuſtification, ſaluation, and eternall lyfe. Hereof it eaſily appeareth, that nothing is more neceſſarye for a man in this life, than to vnderſtande wherein true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance conſiſteth, without the which forgiueneſſe of ſinnes commeth vnto no man.

                  <p>Theſe teſtimonies doe ſufficiently proue that mercye
<pb facs="tcp:4126:31"/>
through Chriſt is the foundation of the preaching of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For without all doubt, repent, or as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes ſpeake, returne, is not the voyce of the lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, but of God hauing mercie, and offering ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, life and deliuerance from the ſentence of the law that condemneth. Wherefore there is no doubt but the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of repentance is a part of the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, eſpeciallye ſince it is manifeſt that the lawe doth preach vnto ſinners eternall puniſhment: and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rayſed vp from the dead, doth affirme that repentance and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes is to be preached in his name. But bicauſe there are two things in man which doe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him that he cannot ſee his euilles,<note place="margin">Two thinges ther be which hinder repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in vs, wherunto the Lord addeth remedies.</note> and repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende at the voyce of the Goſpell, to wit, ignorance and dulneſſe or ſluggiſhneſſe. The Lorde doth giue a remedie for both theſe euils.<note place="margin">A remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt our ignorance.</note> He remedieth ignorance by the law. For by the preaching of the lawe he bringeth vs to the knowledge of ſinne, whereof the Goſpell biddeth vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20.</note> that we may be ſaued. <hi>By the lawe,</hi> as Paule ſayth, <hi>commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> Dulneſſe or ſluggiſhneſſe he ſhaketh of by diuers meanes:<note place="margin">How the Lord driueth away our ſluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</note> he ſetteth forth threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of eternall death, he denounceth wrath and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure agaynſt them that doe not amende. He chaſteneth the impenitent with corporal puniſhments, with diſeaſes, and by diuers other meanes, he ſetteth tragicall and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples before their eyes, as of <hi>Cain, Iudas, Saule, Achitophel,</hi> and diuers others, which examples Chriſt doth applie vnto all,<note place="margin">Luke. 13.3.</note> when he ſayth: <hi>Except ye amende your liues, ye shall all likewiſe perishe.</hi> He witneſſeth his wrath and diſpleaſure by diuers ſignes in the heauen, the earth, and in the ſea, ſometime by peſtilence, ſometime by warres he ſtirreth vs vp to obey the voyce of the Goſpell: he ſetteth forth the death of his ſonne, which doth witneſſe of the wrath of God agaynſt ſinners, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.

vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they being conuerted by repentance, may be eaſed of their burden, doth ſende the Lawyer, that doth not acknowledge his euill, vnto the law. We haue a moſt excellent and liuely example hereof <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.<note place="margin">A liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> in the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſonne. He being firſt pinched with hunger, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue his euill. Then a hope of a better ſtate if he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his father, gaue to the yong man a mynde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for he is encouraged by confidence in his fathers gentleneſſe, to ſeeke for reconciliation. This example doth teach plainly, that the beginning of repentance is an acknowledging of the mercy of God, which ſtirreth vs up to hope well, which doe ſee and perceyue our owne euils and perils. For as this yong man through truſt in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers clemencie, doth returne vnto his father, after that, he being taught by hunger did perceiue his euils: ſo we with confidence of mercy in Chriſt, doe returne vnto God, after that by the preaching of the lawe we haue come into the knowledge of our ſelues, &amp; by feeling the curſe and wrath of God doe ſhake of our dulneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Nowe what wholeſome and true repentance is, and of what parres it conſiſteth, we will declare by teſtimonies of the Scripture, and by examples. <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſayth: <hi>Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man returne from his euill way, and I will forgiue your iniquitie and your ſinnes.</hi> This ſaying conteyneth two things, a commaundement and a promiſe. The comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, that the vngodly doe returne from his euill wayes. The promiſe is of reconciliation and attonement for ſinne. Herevpon it is gathered,<note place="margin">VVhat true repentance is</note> that repentance is a conuerſion or a turning of man vnto God, in the which conuerſion, he doth depart from euill, he beleueth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of reconciliation, and ſtudieth to leade a newe lyfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Adam hauing fallen into ſinne, did hyde himſelfe with the leaues which he tooke of the tree, and did not ſee his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, neyther as yet did knowe the promiſe concerning the

Lyke vnto this were the examples of Manaſſes, of the ſinfull woman, of the theefe, of Peter, of Paule: which examples when we doe applie them to the rule, they doe moſt plainly ſet before vs the liuely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of true repentance. But bicauſe the doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is chiefe in the Church, and bicauſe it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for men to be well inſtructed concerning it: we will briefly declare by definitions the partes thereof, as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4126:32"/>
they are taught in our Churches oute of the word of God and by famous and well knowne examples.<note place="margin">The parts of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> The partes thereof as is ſayd before are contrition, fayth, and newe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                  <p>Contrition is not a miſliking of the fact,<note place="margin">Contrition the firſt part of repentance what it is.</note> as was in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, but it is the beginning of true repentance, to wit, an extreme feare of conſcience for ſinne, a true hatred of ſinne, and an auoyding of ſinne not without hope of pardon, as appeareth in the prodigall ſonne. For a knowledge of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy muſt of neceſſitie goe before true repentance, according to the ſaying of Ambroſe: No man can repent except firſt he hopeth for pardon: and that of Auguſtine. The mercye of God is neceſſary not onely when we doe repent, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that we may repent.</p>
                  <p>Fayth is a knowledge, conſent,<note place="margin">What fayth is, which is the ſeconde part of true repentance.</note> and deſire of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mercy, and a ſure confidence in Chriſt the mediatour. Although the former examples and the fourth chap. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> doe confirme this definition, yet let vs adde more reaſons concerning the properties of fayth. Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them ſaued that beleeue, therfore it muſt needes be that fayth doth ſignifie a truſt in the promiſe, ſeeing that no man is ſaued by knowledge alone. Agayne, Paule doth ſometime call this fayth a ſure truſt or confidence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a perſwaſion, whereby a man doth certaynely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe, that God both will, and alſo is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which he hath promiſed. This therfore is that fayth, by which alone without the workes of the law the Apoſtle affirmeth that a man is iuſtified before God. For ſuch a fayth onely as we haue deſcribed, doth apprehende Chriſt and poſſeſſe him with all his benefites. I will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet forth a playne and manifeſt doctrine concerning this iuſtification which commeth by fayth in Chriſt, and will briefly confute the errours with the which this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine both in time paſt and alſo in our age, is darkned and made obſcure.</p>

For fayth is imputed to hym for righteouſneſſe, which beleeueth in him that iuſtifieth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4126:33"/>
the wicked. Of theſe this alſo followeth,<note place="margin">Howe we are righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</note> that the qualitie of righteouſnes is in Chriſt, but is imputed vnto vs which is proper vnto him. For we are ſo iuſt before God as Chriſt was a ſinner. As he after a ſort tooke vpon him our perſon, whereby he might be made guiltie in our name, and might be iudged as a ſinner, not for his owne ſinnes, but for the ſinnes of other, ſeing that he himſelfe was pure and cleane fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſinne, and might ſuffer puniſhment due vnto vs and not vnto him: So we nowe are iuſt in him, not bicauſe we do ſatiſfie the iudgement of God with our workes, but bicauſe we are accounted righteous with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which by fayth alone we doe put on, that it might be made ours.<note place="margin">Accepting of vs vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe.</note> The fourth is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the perſon vnto eternall life.

                  <p>Although this doctrine of our Churches is grounded vpon the iuſt, ſounde, and perfite worde of God:<note place="margin">Diuers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the doctrine of iuſtification.</note> yet there be diuerſe and ſundrie errors ſpred abrode agaynſt it. For there be ſome which place this iuſtification of man in the workes done of men: other ſome will needes haue it to conſiſt of fayth and workes togither: ſome go about to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhe a certayne eſſentiall righteouſneſſe. Although theſe things which we haue ſpoken,<note place="margin">The firſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of them which ſaye that we are iuſtified by works, with a confutation thereof. Pſal. 143.2.</note> doe confute the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of theſe, yet we will ſpeake ſomewhat ſeuerally of them. They which affirme that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iuſtified by works, are more eaſily confuted, ſeeing that the moſt manifeſt oracles of God doe crie out agaynſt this errour. Dauid cryeth out openly: <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant:
<pb facs="tcp:4126:34"/>
for in thy ſight ſhall none that liueth be iustified.</hi> And Paule <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Therefore by the workes of the lawe shal no fleshe be iustified.</hi>

                     <hi>then Christ died without a cauſe.</hi> Their opinion therefore is manifeſtly falſe, which affirme that a man is iuſtified, that is, made iuſt by workes. But we acknowledge with Iames, that good workes are required to the declaring of this iuſtification, that the good tree may be knowne by it fruites, neyther is there any diſagreeing betweene Paule and Iames. For when Paul ſayth that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not iuſtified by works, he ſignifieth that he is not made iuſt and without fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by workes. When Iames ſayth that men are iuſtified by workes, he meaneth that men are by workes declared to be iuſt.<note place="margin">The ſeconde error of them which affirme that wee are iuſtified by ſayth and workes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed.</note> But the ſaying of them hath ſomewhat a fayrer ſhewe, which affirme that the righteouſneſſe whereby the wicked man is iuſtified before God, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of fayth and works togither. For they ſaye that fayth is the beginning of righteouſneſſe, and workes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof, whoſe errour S. Paule confuteth by theſe reaſons. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>I beare them recorde that they haue the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of the righteouſnes of God, and going about to sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe their owne righteouſnes, haue not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the righteouſnes of God. For Christ is the ende of the lawe for righteouſnes vnto euerye one that beleeueth.</hi> Here Paule maketh this to be the cauſe of the caſting of of the Iewes, for that they woulde ioyne their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe with the righteouſneſſe of God which is by fayth, and of both ioyned togither make one forme of righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">Verſe. 6.</note> Alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. he reaſoneth thus: <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace: but if it be of works, it is no more grace, or elſe were worke no more worke.</hi> Paule here firſt ſetteth downe two
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4126:34"/>
contrarie propoſitions without any meane betwene them: If election and ſaluation be of workes, it is not of grace: If it be of grace, it is not of workes, bicauſe that debt and gift are ſo contrarie, that neither of them may rightly be ſayde one of the other, or both of them of any thirde. Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore we are iuſtified and ſaued by fayth alone, or by workes: but the teſtimonies before alledged doe proue that no man is iuſtified by workes. Agayne, if chriſtian righteouſneſſe did conſiſt of fayth and works togither, the reaſoning of Paule were fonde and vayne. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>To him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fauour but by debt: but to him that worketh not, but beleueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly, his fayth is counted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Here Paule maketh two ſortes of righteouſneſſe, which differ the one from the other. For they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie cauſes. For the righteouſneſſe of fayth,<note place="margin">Two kindes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> by which he that beleeueth is iuſtified, is imputed and giuen freely, but the righteouſneſſe of works is not free. Furthermore, if one part is to be attributed to fayth, the other part to workes in the iuſtification of man, two abſurdities ſhould followe thereof: one that the promiſe ſhoulde be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine which ought to be certaine. Another, that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction of Chriſt coulde not ſuffice, except it were ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by our workes. Wherefore we embrace the ſaying of <hi>Augustine,</hi> which ſayth: It is grace in no poynt, except it be free in all poyntes. But the occaſion of the errour of the Papiſtes was a Philoſophicall imagination,<note place="margin">The errour concerning iuſtification by fayth and workes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whence it proceeded.</note> which knoweth no righteouſneſſe except it be a certayne qualitie in vs. For it vnderſtandeth not that a man may be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the imputation of the righteouſneſſe of another.</p>
                  <p>Nowe let vs come to eſſentiall righteouſneſſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which firſt it is to be vnderſtand,<note place="margin">The thirde er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the doctrine of iuſtification confuted.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are in no wiſe righteous before God by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſſential righteouſnes of God, but in reſpect of the principall efficient cauſe. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall righteouſneſſe, by which we are righteous before
<pb facs="tcp:4126:35"/>
God, is no other than the obedience of Chriſt, as Paule plainly teacheth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>By the obedience of one, many ſhall be made righteous.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt is double.</note> But the obedience of Chriſt is of two ſortes, of the croſſe, and of the lawe. By the obedience of the croſſe (<hi>whereby he humbled himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the croſſe. Philip.</hi> 3.) the Lorde doth make a full ſatiſfaction for our ſinne. The obedience of the lawe he imputeth vnto vs that beleeue, that by it we maye appeare righteous in the ſight of God. Paule ſayth that this righteouſneſſe or obedience of Chriſt is imputed to them that beleeue, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neyther ſubſtance nor qualitie abyding in them, whereby a man is made righteous formally. Wherefore this affirmance is ſurely to be helde,<note place="margin">Chriſtian righteouſnes.</note> that chriſtian righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes is the obedience of the ſonne of God imputed to him that beleeueth. But in the meane ſeaſon we muſt alſo vnderſtande this, that the Scripture maketh mention of three kindes of righteouſneſſe of man,<note place="margin">Three kindes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of man.</note> whereof one is of fayth, by which we ſtande before God, and this is perfect, as the obedience of Chriſt is perfect,<note place="margin">Perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in this lyfe.</note> neyther is it dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or increaſed by the diminiſhing or increaſing of fayth. For the Publicane had this full and perfect as well as Peter, although the fayth of Peter was much more manifeſt and knowne.<note place="margin">Vnperfect righteouſnes.</note> Another is the beginning of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which is alſo called the righteouſneſſe of a good conſcience. This is not ſet agaynſt the wrath of God, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not perfect obedience of the lawe, yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in as much as it is the proper fruite of fayth. An other there is,<note place="margin">Righteouſnes perfect and abſolute in the lyfe to come.</note> which is as yet looked for, whereof Paule ſpeaketh <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. <hi>For we through the ſpirite wayte for the hope of righteouſneſſe through fayth.</hi> And 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. <hi>Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued, nowe are we the ſonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare what we ſhall be: and we knowe that when we ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him: for we shall ſee him as he is: and euery man that hath this hope in him, purgeth himſelfe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4126:35"/>
euen as he is pure.</hi> This righteouſneſſe therefore is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of vs lyke vnto God, a dwelling of God in vs, a full fruition of God, an abſolute and perfect loue. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we muſt confeſſe, that the heartes of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue are the temples of the holy ghoſt, and Chriſt ſayth <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. <hi>If any man loue me, he will keepe my worde, and my father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and wil dwell with him:</hi> yet it doth not followe that this dwelling of God in vs is the righteouſneſſe whereby we ſtande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but it is a diuine preſence in vs, by which we are renued, doe feele comfort, and begyn to approch to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. Furthermore, if men were iuſtified here by eſſentiall righteouſneſſe, there ſhoulde be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the righteouſneſſe by which we are righteous in this lyfe, and that by which we ſhall be like vnto God in all eternitie. But Paule putteth a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two. For he ſayth that we haue the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of fayth, nowe here in this lyfe, but that we doe looke for another righteouſneſſe, which Iohn defineth to be a framing or faſhioning, whereby we ſhall be faſhioned lyke vnto God, which faſhioning ſhall proceede from hence, in that we ſhall ſee him as he is.<note place="margin">Newe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companye ſaith.</note> Newe obedience is neceſſarily ioyned with fayth. For regeneration, which cannot be abſent from a iuſtifying fayth, doth neceſſarily bring forth it fruites which are ſeene in newe obedience. For after that a man through the grace of regeneration is made a newe tree, he ought to bring forth newe, that is, good fruites, which Paule in his Epiſtle to the Philip. calleth the frutes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of fayth. Iames pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth in his own peculiar and proper phraſe that men are iuſtified by the ſame, that is, acknowledged and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red iuſt. This newe obedience is ſometime called ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which conſiſteth of the mortifying of the fleſhe, and of the quickening of the ſpirit. For Paule ſayth thus: <hi>Christ is made vnto vs wiſedome, and righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note> 
                     <hi>and

                     <note place="margin">Howe Chriſt is made our wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>and redemption.</hi> He is made our wiſedome in the preaching of the Goſpell. He is made our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by the attonement for ſinne, and imputation of righteouſneſſe. He is made our ſanctification, when he giueth vs the holy ghoſt, which doth after a ſort turne our nature, and make it, that the olde man being by little and little mortified, we maye liue after the ſpirite, that is, we may giue our myndes to godlyneſſe towarde God, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towarde our neyghbour, to holyneſſe of lyfe, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our vocation, briefly, that we maye ſubmit our ſelues wholy to the rule of the ſpirit. In what man ſoeuer the force and vertue of this regeneration, or of this ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is not felt, there of neceſſitie fayth cannot be. For a true and a right fayth is feruent in ſpirite, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to bring forth it true fruites, and deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to ſerue God in ſpirit, and to abounde in all knowledge and vnderſtanding. Seing that this is in very deede the propertie of a iuſtifying fayth and of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: who can beare or abyde the ſaying of them, which with all their might in words and writings do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the neceſſitie of good workes? which truly we ſay are neceſſary,<note place="margin">Howe good workes are neceſſarie to ſaluation.</note> not as merits and cauſes of ſaluation.

When we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde our ſelues conſidering our owne corruption, we are admoniſhed that we our ſelues doe not imagine workes by which we thinke to worſhip God. For by our ſelues we do not vnderſtand, what eyther pleaſeth or diſpleaſeth God, and the Lorde pronounceth that he is worſhipped in vayne with the commaundements of men: Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certaynly thinke that workes, albeit fayre and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which haue bene inuented of men, are in no wiſe good.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſider God, we are admoniſhed of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence toward him, whereby it commeth to paſſe that we thinke that that onely pleaſeth him, which he preſcribeth in his word. For he onely is our law giuer.<note place="margin">Such workes are to bee taught and done, as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs in his worde.</note>

                  <p>After that the mind of the godly man knoweth,<note place="margin">The ſeconde queſtion.</note> what workes are to be done forth with,<note place="margin">Howe thoſe works which God hath preſcribed, may be done.

The Apoſtle ſayth to the <hi>Hebr. without fayth it is vnpoſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And Chriſt ſayth: <hi>without me can ye doe nothing.</hi> Wherefore theſe thinges are required in order. Firſt, the knowledge of Chriſt. Secondly truſt and confidence in

Chriſt. Thirdly viuification, whereby Chriſt doth quicken vs by the Goſpell, and poureth his holy ſpirite vpon vs. Herevnto maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying of <hi>Eſay, chap.</hi> 40. <hi>But they that wayt vpon the Lord shall renue their strength: they ſhall lift vp the wings as the Egles: they shall runne, and not be wearie, and they shall walke and not faint.</hi> For there can be no loue, no obedience, except mercy and reconcilation for the mediatours ſake be firſt apprehended. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation the diuinitie doth dwell in the heart. For the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall father is effectuall in deede by his ſonne which comforteth by the voyce of the Goſpell, and the holye Ghoſt is giuen of the father and the Sonne which ſtirreth vp in vs ioye and calling vpon God, according to theſe ſayings:<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The thirde queſtion how good workes which are done of vs do pleaſe God.</note>After that the mind is taught how good workes may be done, it inquireth furthermore how they pleaſe, for they are done in vayne, except they pleaſe. <hi>Scipio</hi> fighteth for his countrey, Dauid alſo fighteth, but the workes of both of them doe not pleaſe God.

               <q>1 My brethren be not many maiſters.</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He meaning of this propoſition conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it ſelfe is doubtfull, but if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, as it needes muſt be, to the reaſons by which the propoſition is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, the meaning is eaſye. Seeing therefore that all the reaſons whiche are afterwarde added, doe contayne the diſcommodities of an intemperate tongue, we muſt of neceſſitie here take maiſters for them, which take vnto them ſelues au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to refourme and cenſure others, and doe ſeuerly and rigorouſly call other mens deedes vnto examination, and in the meane ſeaſon doe not ſee there owne faultes.<note place="margin">What the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth in the former wordes.</note> He doth not therefore condemne here brotherly admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which proceedeth of fayth and loue, which hath the commandement of Chriſt, and is the foundation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall diſcipline: but he condemneth the lightnes, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and pride of them, which doe not ſo much regarde edifying, as they doe giue them ſelues to ſclaunder and backbite. Chriſt ſayth: <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>Be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your maister, to wit, Christ, and all ye are brethren And call no man your father vpon the earth, for there is but one your father which is in heauen. &amp;c.</hi> If any contende vpon theſe wordes, that it is not lawfull for any godly man to take vpon him the title of maiſter or teacher:<note place="margin">The names maiſters and teachers are not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the words of Iames.</note> I obiect agaynſt him the forbydding of the name of a father. For here we are no leſſe prohibited to be called fathers then maiſters. Wherefore as it is not ſimply forbidden to be called fathers, but in this or that reſpect: ſo neither are we ſimplie forbidden to be called maiſters or teachers.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4126:40"/>
This meaning therfore is to be conſidered. Chriſt doth not eſteme by what name or title thou art called, ſo as thou abideſt vnder his gouernment, and maintayneſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly concord without ambition and contempt of others. Paule calleth himſelfe the maiſter and teacher of the Gentils, yet he hath not broken this commaundement of Chriſt, but rather obeyed it. For his maiſterſhip did tende vnto this ende, that he might bring all vnder the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and rule of Chriſt. They therfore which eyther vpon the wordes of Iames or the prohibition of the Lorde doe condemne ſcholaſticall promotions, doe miſtake and falſly apply the Scripture, and appayre and diminiſh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable gouernment of a common wealth concerning lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Let ambition be farre from vs, let vs ſubmit oure ſelues to the maiſterſhip and gouernement of Chriſt, and let vs reuerently retayne and keepe ſcholaſticall order.</p>
               <q>Knovving that vve shall receiue the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</q>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is taken of puniſhment: they which are ready to condemne others, who notwithſtanding them ſelues, are in the ſame faults or greater, doe prouoke the wrath of God agaynſt themſelues. For ſeing that loue doth couer a multitude of ſinnes, and they are deſirous to diſcouer the ſinnes of others, they doe ſufficiently declare, that they are voyde of loue.</p>
               <q>2 For in many thinges vve ſinne all.</q>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon taken of our common imbecillitie and weaknes.

Negligence of gouernours of maners and diſcipline, as in parents, miniſters of the Goſpell and ciuill rulers.</p>

               <p>The third reaſon taken of the profite of a bridled tongue. He that can temper his tongue is a perfect man, that is vpright or entire, and endued with many other vertues. Therefore he that doth vſe his tongue vnruly and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly is no whit vpright or entire: for he is polluted with many vices.

                  <note place="margin">The tongue is compared to the bit of a bridle, and to the rudder of a ship.</note>The fourth reaſon likewiſe is taken of the profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of a well ordered tongue. For as a bitte put into the horſes mouth, doth turne about all the body of the horſe, and as the rudder of a ſhip doth guide the whole ſhip: ſo a well ordered tongue boaſteth of great thinges, that is, it bringeth to paſſe great matters, and doth as it were direct the whole man into the way of perfection: when as contrariwiſe a diſordered and an vnruly tongue is like to a bitte that is lewſe, and a rudder that is ſet at libertie.</p>

But what is the courſe of nature, and what is it for the tongue to be ſet on fire of hell?

wickednes what can be greater?</p>
               <q>My brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be.</q>

               </q>
               <p>The ninth reaſon taken of that which is vnpoſſible. As it is vnpoſſible that a fountayne ſhould be able to ſende forth at one place ſwete water and bitter.<note place="margin">Vnpoſsible it is for a tongue accuſtomed to ſpeake yll, to vtter that which is good &amp; vndefiled.</note> For that can no more be, than that a figge tree ſhoulde be able to bring forth olyues, or a vine figges: ſo it can not be, that that tongue which is giuen to euil ſpeaking and ſclandering, ſhould be able to bring forth any good thing not defiled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the venim of the tongue &amp; the heart. Wherfore ſeing that it is ſo, let euery one applie his tongue only to ſpeak well, which will be counted godly &amp; among the children of God.

               <q>13 VVho is a vviſe man, and endued vvith knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge among you? let him shevve by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation his vvorkes, in meekeneſſe of vviſedom.</q>
               <p>Hitherto he hath beaten downe the ſtatelyneſſe of proude controllers of other, and hath with firme reaſons bridled the vnrulineſſe and ſaucineſſe of the tongue.

               <p>The firſt reaſon of the propoſition whereby he confuteth the peruerſe opinion of them,<note place="margin">We can not ſerue tvvo maiſters, we can not pleaſe both God and the worlde.</note> which woulde both be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alſo followe the pleaſures of this worlde: but he ſheweth that it is vnpoſſible for that to be.

                  <head>Of riches and contracts or bargaines.</head>
                  <p>SEing that Iames ſeemeth in this place to deale ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hardly agaynſt the rich men of this world, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me a thing worthie the labour to adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing herevnto concerning riches and contractes or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines, which ſerue to increaſe our ſubſtance, and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ende, that the godly may be admoniſhed, how farre it is lawfull for them to vſe ſuch ſtayes of their life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:4126:48"/>Foraſmuch therfore as ſome godly men doe get riches by the bleſſing of the Lorde, and alſo the ſocietie of man cannot want bargaines, it appeareth ſufficiently, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue riches, neyther to bargayne by it ſelfe is ſin. For we muſt not thinke that the Goſpell doth eyther breake the lawfull bonds of humane ſocietie or take away thoſe things which are neceſſarie to the maintayning of the life of man. But bicauſe it is often times offended in the getting of riches, likewiſe in the poſſeſſion and vſe of them, and alſo many faults are incident in bargaynes: it is needefull that the godly minde be rightly inſtructed, whereby it may know, both how to get riches without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to God, how to vſe them being gotten, and alſo how farre it may exerciſe vſuall bargaines with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore firſt of all let this rule of Chriſte be moſte ſurely kept: <hi>Seeke ye fyrst the kingdome of God and his righteouſnes, and other thinges ſhall be ministred vnto you. Matth.</hi> 6. This rule of Chriſt conteyneth two thinges,<note place="margin">The rule of Chriſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of two principall poynts, the firſt whereof is a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> to wit, a commaundement of Chriſt, and a promiſe ioyned with obedience toward the commaundement. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement is: <hi>Seeke fyrst the kingdome of God and his righteouſnes.</hi> He which will not obey this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he is not partaker of the grace of Chriſt: ſo he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in the kingdome of ſinne, and ſerueth Satan, to whom euerlaſting death is reſerued for his ſtipend. Let therfore obedience toward this commandement of Chriſt haue the principall place, that is,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> let the care of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be firſt and chiefe. The promiſe is: <hi>And other thinges ſhall be ministred vnto you.</hi> This promiſe will both haue fayth, to wit, that we doe aſſure our ſelues that Chriſte is true, and will haue a care of vs, if we will obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: and alſo it ſecretly requireth, that euery one by fayth doe diligently in the feare of God thoſe thinges which are agreable to his calling, Heatheniſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb facs="tcp:4126:49"/>
carefulnes being excluded. For we muſt not thinke that the promiſe of Chriſt doth commend ſlouthfulnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Wherefore let him that is endued with the faith of Chriſt, know, that it is a part of godlynes, without which fayth cannot be ſound, diligently to doe that dutie, to the which euerie man is called. To this pertayneth that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He that prouideth not for his owne, &amp; namely for them of his houſhold, denieth the fayth, and is worſe then an infidel.</hi> The promiſe therefore of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a holy diligence and an earneſt labour of euerye man in his calling. But leaſt that any man doth here by and by as it were in the entrie ſtumble, and doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his calling be lawfull or no:<note place="margin">A lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> I will briefly touch, what is required to a lawfull calling or function. Two thinges generally are to be conſidered, to wit, the kind of office, and the execution thereof. Concerning the kinde, this rule is to be obſerued.<note place="margin">VVhat offices are lawful &amp; to be allowed</note> Euery office that maketh for the maintayning and furniſhing of the ſtates ordained of God, as are, the ciuil ſtate, the ſtate concerning the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of an houſe, the eccleſiaſticall ſtate, is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the firſt and fourth commaundement, as the dutie of the miniſters of the word, the function of the magiſtrats, the ſeruice of them which helpe the magiſtrate, the care and charge of maiſters of houſholds, the occupations of them whoſe helpe is profitable and neceſſarie in the ſtates ordayned of God, the traffique of Marchants, which bring in profitable marchandice: briefly, all offices which ſerue eyther for the order of the Church of God, or of an houſe, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common weale, are lawfull in them ſelues, and alſo in the perſons, when they are lawfully called vnto them. And although it be free for euery man to chooſe any kinde of life, to the which he ſhall feele himſelfe apt: yet we muſt put a difference betweene a publike and a priuate office. To a publike office is required ordinarie authoritie. For no man may take vnto himſelfe a publike office either in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4126:49"/>
the Church, or in the common weale, except he be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto by ordinary authoritie, he that doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, doth ſume, and in affliction can haue no certayne comfort. Wherefore here the godly man will eſpecially take heede, that he doe not enter into a publike office without a lawfull calling.<note place="margin">Howe euery man may take a priuate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vpon him ſelfe.</note> A priuate office euery man may chooſe vnto himſelfe, yet the authoritie of parents ought not here to be contemned. He may applie his minde to the trade of marchandice, whom this kind of life doth pleaſe: he may follow huſbandry, which thinketh that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for him: he may chooſe ſome arte or occupation, which is perſwaded that it will be profitable vnto him. An idle life belongeth not vnto a godly man but vnto an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure rather, wherefore of that I will ſay nothing.</p>
                  <p>In the execution of the office or dutie more things are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered.<note place="margin">Moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rules to be obſerued of euery man in perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and dutie.</note> Firſt let faith &amp; loue be rules of the actions. Faith taketh hede that it offendeth not God, &amp; referreth al things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of God. Loue admoniſheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be no iniurie done to any man, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be furthered. Faith deſireth God to work with it, &amp; to be it helper. Loue embraceth our neighbor in God. Faith kepeth him that worketh, in the feare of God.<note place="margin">VVhat wee muſt doe if God bleſſe vs with increaſe of riches.</note> Loue kepeth him in charitie toward his neyghbour. Here if riches by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord come vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> laboureth in his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling, ſingular heede is to be taken, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our riches be not made vnto vs through our own fault, thornes &amp; ſnares. For they that are rich haue inſtruments both vnto vertues &amp; alſo vnto vices, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their minds are affected which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore <hi>Plato</hi> in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hath rightly ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out wiſedom are blind, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame do quickly ſee whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they folow true wiſedom. For true is this ſaying:
<q>
                        <l>Riches of euill and miſchiefe much</l>
                        <l>are ministers with ſpeede:</l>
                        <l>Which doe alſo contention</l>
                        <l>amongst vs often breede.</l>
                     </q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4126:50"/>
And for that cauſe the Lord ſayth:<note place="margin">Math. 19.23.</note> 
                     <hi>That a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi> For the moſt parte vſe their riches ill, which they might vſe well if they woulde take the counſayle of godly wiſedome.<note place="margin">How the rich of the worlde ought to be affected.</note> Firſt of all therefore, let the godly man knowe how he ought to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in his riches, this may very well be knowne both by the wordes of Dauid and alſo of Paule.<note place="margin">Pſal. 62.10.</note> Dauid ſayth: <hi>If riches increaſe ſet not your hearts thereon.</hi> Paule ſayth: <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>that they be not high minded, and that they trust not in vncertaine riches but in the liuing God.</hi> Theſe two ſayings doe preach both of the minde or affection of a rich man, and alſo of the vſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The mind ought not to be ſet vpon riches, or vpon a deſire to haue, a godly man ought not to meaſure his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie with the deceitfull meaſure of riches, but he ought to vſe them well, leaſt that he himſelfe layeth ſnares for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>Nazianzenus</hi> doth very well deſcribe the mind of a godly man toward riches ſaying:

                        <l>abundance and great store.</l>
                     </q>

                        <l>I doe much rather craue:</l>

                        <l>of wiſedome for to haue.</l>
                     </q>
Whoſoeuer therfore wil be godly,<note place="margin">How the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man muſt behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> let him caſt away truſt &amp; confidence in riches, leaſt that they be made ſnares vnto him, leaſt that they doe ſhutte from him the paſſage to the kingdome of heauen. Let a ſure hope be repoſed in God alone, whether riches be increaſed or diminiſhed, yea or quite taken away, let vs hold faſt the true treaſure which is Chriſt Ieſus. For he that hath him is rich in deede, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4126:50"/>
with Lazarus he doth beg his breade. Moreouer, when thy mynde is thus affected toward riches, this care ſhall come into it, that thou doe rightly diſpoſe the riches beſtowed vpon thee of God, and that thou be a faythfull ſtewarde of them. Wherefore I will herevnto adde a few wordes concerning the lawfull vſe of riches. <hi>Iſchomachus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> being aſked concerning the lawfull vſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, aunſwered in theſe wordes: I ought with my riches to honour the Gods royally, to helpe my frendes wherein they haue neede, and to ſuffer the Citie to be vnadorned in nothing wherein I am able.<note place="margin">The vſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diuided into three parts.</note> This man being ignorant of true religion, maketh three partes of the vſe of riches, the firſt part he attributeth to the worſhip of God, the ſeconde to his friends being in nede, the thirde to the maintaining and adorning of the common weale, wherein he liueth. But although this ſentence of a prophane Philoſopher is to be prayſed, and worthie to be commended to the godly: yet I will ſhewe more diſtinctly and plainly the godly and true vſe of ſubſtance and riches, which conſiſteth in foure poyntes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and principall vſe of riches ought to be,<note place="margin">The chiefe &amp; principall vſe whervnto ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ought to ſerue.</note> that they ſerue to the maintayning and increaſing of the glorie of God. This vſe is confirmed by the ende of man. Man was firſt made, and afterwardes regenerate by the holy ghoſt, that he ſhoulde glorifie God. Therefore what gifts ſo euer we haue, they ought to be referred to this ende of our creation and reſtoring agayne.<note place="margin">How the firſt and principall vſe of riches is vtterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of many.</note> Here many being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably deceiued, do ſin. For there are ſome which beſtow nothing at all to the mayntaining of the miniſterie. There are ſome which doe wickedly take away thoſe things that were appoynted of our auncetors for the ſeruice of God. There are ſome which with their riches doe encreaſe the power of tyrannes, to the oppreſſing of the church &amp; aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of religion, for whom it were better, if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bene borne. For their portion ſhall be with the deuill
<pb facs="tcp:4126:51"/>
whoſe members they are. Let the godly man therfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome riches haue chaunced in this worlde, loke vnto this ende of his creation, and beſtowe part of his goodes vpon this vſe, that he may ſet forth the glorie of God, and maintayne true religion.<note place="margin">Examples of ſuch as haue vſed their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches chiefly to the glorie of God.</note> Let him ſet before himſelfe the examples of godlye men, as of <hi>Dauid, Ioſias, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias, Constantine, Theodoſius, Iohn Fredericke</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie, Christierne</hi> the thirde king of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and other Princes and godly men, which deſired nothing more, than according to their abilitie to ſet forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, to helpe them which taught and learned reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to maintaine ſchooles, and honeſt priuileges of ſchooles, to defende the teachers of godlyneſſe agaynſt the crueltie and iniurie of wicked men, to whom nothing was more pleaſant, than to inuent diuers craftes and wayes, whereby they might oppreſſe both teachers and learners, the caſe of which men I do with all my heart lament. For by their reprobate mynde they doe more and more plunge themſelues in hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The ſeconde right &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note>The ſeconde true and lawfull vſe of riches ought to be, that we helpe and adorne the common weales in which we liue, according to the meaſure of our riches. For this cauſe tributes are inioyned, that by them as by ſinewes the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale may be kept and preſerued, that is, that they may be ornaments of peace, helpes of lawfull warre, the rewardes of them which gouerne the common weale. But here two kyndes of men doe not a little offende.<note place="margin">Two ſorts of men do chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offende in the ſeconde right vſe of riches.</note> For there are ſome, which although they abounde with wealth, renoume, and glorie in the time of peace: yet when anye thing is to be layde out to the vſe of the common weale, this they craftily put of from them ſelues to the ſilly and ſimple people who are compelled beyonde their ſtrength and abilitie to beſtowe thoſe things which are required. Here although the ſimple people doe rightly obey: yet theſe inuentors of miſchiefes are reſerued for their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4126:51"/>
There are alſo perhappes ſome, who being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their ordinarie rents, doe lay newe exactions vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſubiects, which are condemned by the teſtimonie of Iohn the Baptiſt, in as much as they doe not bring forth the fruites of repentance. Chriſt ſayth:<note place="margin">Matth. 22.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Giue to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar the things which are Caeſars, and giue vnto God thoſe things which are Gods.</hi> But let <hi>Caeſar</hi> knowe that there is a certaine rule which the lawes doe preſcribe vnto him. If he ſhall offende againſt this, he is made guiltie of the wrath of God. But thou wilt ſay,<note place="margin">A queſtion.</note> is it neuer therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the magiſtrate to exact of his ſubiectes anye thing beſide the ordinarie taxe?<note place="margin">The anſwere.</note> We muſt put a difference betweene the times of peace and warre. In the time of peace let him be content with his ordinarie reuenues, leaſt that he ſinne agaynſt God: In the time of warre the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes doe owe not only their goods, but alſo their bodies to the magiſtrate making iuſt warre, and the godly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may exact vnaccuſtomed tributes, and require the helpe of the Citizens againſt the enimies. There may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo neceſſities be incident in the time of peace, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtipendes are not ſufficient for the magiſtrate. When this commeth to paſſe, godly ſubiectes ought to helpe the preſent neceſſities, and the godly magiſtrate may require ſo much increaſe as ſhall be needefull. But they which do therevpon by litle and litle bring in a cuſtome to oppreſſe ſubiects, ſhall as inſidels looke for their puniſhment at the handes of the iuſt Iudge, which knoweth howe to bowe downe the neckes of the proude and tyrannes.</p>

thinges ſo to be taken, that the law giuer doe not ſwarue from the firſt foundation, and the tenne commandements, that is, that he make no law diſagreing with the loue of God and charitie towardes our neyghbours.

There commeth another hauing neede, whoſe ſtate is ſuch that thou mayeſt looke for no recompence at all of him. If thou wilt not lend this man, thou breakeſt the rule of Chriſt, following rather the wicked cuſtome of the heathen, than the commaundement of Chriſt, whereby thou ſheweſt that thou doeſt contemne the voyce of Chriſt.<note place="margin">The meaning of the ſaying of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lending.</note> Wherefore Chriſt doth not here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde that thou ſhouldeſt not looke that that ſhoulde be reſtored which thou haſt lent, as ſome do vnwiſely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete this ſaying, for then it ſhoulde not be called lending, but almes rather: but he hath regarde to the perſons, to wit, that the godly doe helpe them by lending, of whome they loke for no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity or benefite agayne.

And for this cauſe vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is thought to be called of the Grecians <hi>Tocos,</hi> of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forth, as though there were a certaine birth of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that euen by the very name it may be infamous. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophanes</hi> calleth vſurie a beaſt, which in proceſſe of time
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4126:58"/>
doth bring forth mony in more abundant increaſe. <hi>Plato</hi> alſo doth caſt vſurie out of his common weale.

This prohibition of <hi>Plato</hi> is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a naturall principle, to wit, that that is in no caſe to be ſuffred in a citie, whatſoeuer it be, which is agaynſt the lawe of nature and mutuall charitie, and is the cauſe of the ruine of families and common weales, which nature biddeth to be preſerued and maintayned. <hi>Plutarch</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that vſurie is contrary to nature by this principle: Of nothing nothing is made. <hi>Cicero</hi> compareth vſurie to man ſlaughter.

Moreouer,<note place="margin">Other reaſons prouing vſury to be againſt nature.</note> inequalitie in bargaining is agaynſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the worke thereof is the deſtruction of nature. Gayne therfore that is giuen for the bounden dutie of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is agaynſt nature. For it doth manifeſtly bring ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie. Finally, ſeing that the ciuill ſocietie is eſpecially according to nature, trulye it muſt be that vſurie is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie to nature, inaſmuch as it doth appayre and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe humane ſocietie.</p>

Surely the auncients did ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by this ſentence, that they did iudge vſurers to be worſe and more hurtfull then common theeues. And for this cauſe they were not ſuffred to come to publike digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offices as men vnworthy of them.<note place="margin">The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our time is great.</note> But, alas, ſo great at this day is the corruption of chriſtian maners, that they which were infamous among the prophane nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and counted worſe then theeues, are iudged worthy of very hie honour, yea and that among Chriſtians.

For he is by no meanes thought truly to repent, which abſtaineth from ſin againſt his will.

But if they ſhall not be able, let them at the leaſt doe what they can, let them craue of God pardon of their fault, let them aſke them whom they haue hurt with their vſurie, forgiuenes of the iniurie that they haue done, and let them be reconciled to the Churche by publicke ſatiſfaction, leaſt that their portion be with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.

                  <p>AFter we haue now ſpoken of the prohibitions of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie and of the cauſes thereof, and alſo of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them, who deſpiſing the law both of God and of man doe practiſe Vſurie which is prohibited: the place requireth that we ſee whether there be any contract or bargaine like vnto Vſurie in part, yet not diſagreeing with the charitie toward our neighbour, and if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4126:66"/>
ſuch, how farre a godly man may vſe the ſame with a good conſcience and without offence to God. Firſt of all this is to be helde as moſt certayne that Vſurie condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the worde of God, is therfore vnlawfull, prohibited and condemned becauſe it is contrarie to the foundation which proceedeth from the lawe of charitie: that which thou wilt not haue done to thy ſelfe doe not thou to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But that this our foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vnmoueable we haue declared before, where we haue layde the foundations of contracts and bargaines.

Wherefore if any ſuch can be ſhewed, it ſhalbe without doubt accounted lawfull, although it ſhall appeare much like vnto Vſurie. For it is not iuſt and meete that we doe condemne al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable contractes and bargaines in a common weale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of Vſurie, becauſe of the likenes. And although many ſuch contracts are wiſely condemned of the lawyers, yet we will ſpeake of them of which the greateſt controuerſie is, eſpecially in this realme. But that we may iudge of theſe contracts without errour, and find out that which with a good conſcience and without offending God it is lawfull to follow: it ſhall be needeful to ſpeake of diuers ſortes of men, that it may be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to whom we are bound to lend, and to whom we are not, for there Vſurie is properly committed. Here the lawes of magiſtrates may determine of thoſe thinges, which they ſhall wiſely know to be good and profitable for their common weale.<note place="margin">A profitable rule concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bargains</note> For this is to be marked as a profitable rule in the ſocietie of man: that bargaynes allowed by the lawes and by the authoritie of the magiſtrate, that is, of a good and wiſe iudge or lawyer, are permitted to a chriſtian man. For it is lawfull for a chriſtian to vſe ciuil

In the firſt ſtate may be the poore and beggers, whiche being hindred with old age, or grieued with ſickneſſe, or otherwiſe with ſome great calamitie oppreſſed, are not able to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the almes of other,<note place="margin">The dutie of charity which we owe to the poore and impotent.</note> no nor to make any gaine.

                  <p>WHo ſoeuer hath determined to giue almes, let him giue his almes in this order. Firſt of all,<note place="margin">VVe muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the firſt almes vpon our ſelues.</note> let him be mercifull to himſelfe, that is, let him giue the firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to himſelfe, which then is done when a man lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his owne euill wayes, doth turne himſelfe vnto the Lorde by true repentance. For no mercy (for ſo the word almes doth ſignifie) can be ſhewed of him, which as yet is not vnder the mercie of God. Wherefore <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> doth well admoniſhe when he ſayth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 30. <hi>Haue mercie on thine owne ſoule pleaſing God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">VVherein the mercy conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth which we ought to shew firſt to our owne ſelues.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:4126:68"/>
ſhewe to our ſelues, to wit, in turning vnto God, and in fayth, without which it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God. After this ſort Abraham did begyn his almes, according to whoſe example all the reſt of the godly haue begun their almes at them ſelues. To this pertayneth that ſaying of <hi>Augustine:</hi> If thou wilt giue almes, begyn at thy ſelfe. For howe can he be mercifull to another which is cruell to himſelfe? He that hath begon his almes after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will forthwith turne himſelfe to his neighbour, and will ſhewe mercy vnto him.<note place="margin">The firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of almes.</note> Herevpon riſeth the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of almes, that there is one kynde of almes which euery one beſtoweth vpon himſelfe, which is by nature the former, another which euerye man giueth to other, which is by nature the latter.<note place="margin">Two kindes of almes which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon other.</note> Nowe this latter may alſo be made to be of two ſortes, one ſpirituall, another ciuill.

There is no almes more diuine than this, none more profitable, finally, none more neceſſarye. For as the ſoule doth excell the bodie, ſo almes whereby the ſoule is refreſhed, is by many degrees to be preferred before the almes with which the neceſſities of this frayle bodie are relieued, and as eternall good things are more to be eſteemed than all the commodities of this lyfe which continue but a ſhort time: ſo the almes which helpeth to the attayning of eternall life, is more to be eſteemed, than the almes that ſerueth for this frayle life. There is great commendation hereof in Iames the Apoſtle, who ſayth: <hi>Brethren,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; ſhal hyde a multitude of ſins.</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill almes doth belong to this preſent lyfe, to wit, when we being touched with pitie, doe ſuccour the neede of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4126:68"/>
poore. To eyther kynde of mercie Chriſt doth exhort vs by the example of his father, when he ſayth:<note place="margin">Luke. 6.36</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as your heauenly father alſo is mercifull.</hi> Let euerye one remember this precept, which acknowledgeth Chriſt for his maiſter.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes with which the godlye ought to be ſtirred vp to giue almes, are very many, among which theſe are the chiefe. The firſt cauſe is Chriſtianitie it ſelfe,<note place="margin">The firſt cauſe yea and that moſt weighty which ought to ſtirre vp all chriſtians to be diligent in giuing almes.</note> or the profeſſion of Chriſtian religion. For this doth require, that we abounde in euerye good worke, and that we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and cheriſhe one another as the members of one body, the head whereof is Chriſt. When this is done of faith in Chriſt, we doe, in the feare of God practize true chriſtianitie, that is, we do truly imitate the diuine nature. For ſeeing God, whom chriſtianitie biddeth vs follow, is rich in mercy, we by following his mercy are after a ſort ſayde to be followers of the diuine nature. But they that are not occupyed in this following, doe falſly attribute to themſelues a chriſtian name. Furthermore they are not counted the lawfull ſonnes of God but baſtardes rather. For God acknowledgeth none among his ſonnes, but whom he ſeeth at the leaſt to endeauour to imitate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vertues. To this pertayneth that ſaying of the Lord in the Prophet. <hi>If I be a father where is mine honour?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Malac. 1.6.</note> But the cheefeſt parte of honour, which children can doe to their parents, is to imitate their vertues. Whoſoeuer earneſtly looketh for the glorye of chriſtianitie, let him ſet before himſelfe this cauſe of ſhewing mercy to his neighbour, and let him not ſuffer himſelfe to be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with euil examples from this neceſſary and due wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is the commaundement of God,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe which ought to moue vs to the giuing of almes.</note> vnto which all creatures ought to obey. Of this cauſe <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> maketh mention. <hi>chap.</hi> 29: <hi>Helpe the poore for the commandements ſake, and turne him not away
<pb facs="tcp:4126:69"/>
becauſe of his pouertie.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Bestow thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure after the commaundement of the most high, and it ſhal bring thee more profite then Gold.</hi> Our treaſure that doth neuer fayle we muſt lay vp and keepe in heauen, but yet it is in this life beſtowed vpon the poore, vpon whom the benefites that be beſtowed the Lord ſo accepteth as if we had beſtowed them vpon himſelfe. All the teſtimonies of the Scripture which doe commend vnto vs the loue of our neighbour, doe require eſpecially liberalitie towarde the nedie. For this is the chiefe part of true loue. Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belongeth that ſaying of the Lorde, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thee, ſaying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He cannot rightly feare the Lorde which is not mercifull to the poore. 1. Iohn. 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>thou ſhalt open thine hand vnto thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is needy.</hi> He that contemneth this precept of the Lord, how can he loue God? how can he feare him? for thus ſayth <hi>Iohn: Whoſoeuer hath this worldes good, and ſeeth his brother haue neede, and shutteth vp his compaſsion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> 6. <hi>He that taketh away mercie from his neighbour, hath forſaken the feare of the Lord.</hi> Whoſoeuer therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth to loue God and to feare him from his heart, let him thinke that he doth owe obedience to God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding. Of which thing <hi>Micheas</hi> ſpeaketh after this ſort: <hi>I will shew thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee, ſurely to doe iustly, and to loue mercy and to humble thy ſelfe to walke with thy God.</hi>

Chriſt was made poore for vs, that he might enrich vs. What therefore do we agayne, owe to the members of Chriſt: eſpecially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he witneſſeth that that is done to himſelfe whatſoeuer we doe to the leaſt of his members. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. The holy fathers deſired nothing more than to relieue the poore Saints. Abraham doth reuerence ſtrangers, and biddeth them to eate with him, that he may ſhewe liberalitie vnto them.

whom he thought to be poore ſtraungers. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the courtier is written to haue giuen himſelfe to continuall prayer and almes, which the ſcripture witneſſeth to haue come vp into remembrance before God.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cauſe is the dignitie and eſtimation of almes godly beſtowed before God. <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 21.<note place="margin">The fourth cauſe which ought to ſtirre vs vp dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute our almes to the poore.</note>

It is preferred before ſacrifice: God is ſayd to be ſingularly moued and delighted therewith. This digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ought worthily to admoniſhe them which abounde in this worldes good, that they indeuour, according to the counſell of Paule, to be rich in good workes.</p>
                  <p>The fift cauſe is our neighbour himſelfe.<note place="margin">The fift cauſe of giuing almes.</note> But that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is neighbour one to another, the Parable of the Samaritane doth teach, although this neighbourhode is greater with ſome than with other ſome.<note place="margin">A triple bond wherwith all men are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoode one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> Euery man both godly and alſo vngodly is neighbour vnto me, and that firſt by reaſon of our creation.

Agayne, by the ſame ſpirit we are begotten agayne to be the ſonnes of God, whereby it commeth to paſſe that both we haue one father which is God, and alſo we are brethren among our ſelues. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we are members of the ſame myſticall bodye, the heade whereof is Chriſt. Finally, we haue the ſame hope
<pb facs="tcp:4126:70"/>
of the glorie to come, for we are heyres of eternall lyfe in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde. If we doe earneſtly thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this fift cauſe of mercie towarde our neighbour, there is none that doth not acknowledge howe neceſſarily libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie is to be ſhewed to them that be in neede.

He that ſhall contemne theſe, ſhall in ſhort time finde a iuſt iudge. Now we will ſpeake of affection, of what ſort we require it to be in him which hath purpoſed to giue almes, and of the due and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent maner of almes.<note place="margin">Two things diligently to be taken hede of in giuing almes.</note> Chriſt will haue two vices to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from almes <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. which are hypocriſie and vaine glorie.

Theſe things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning liberall and godly almes, I thought therfore to adde, that I might admoniſhe eſpecially them that are of the richer ſort, of their dutie, that they may vnderſtande that they are bounde by the law of God to beſtow part of their ſubſtance vpon the poore, and that freely for the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
<pb facs="tcp:4126:72"/>
ſake of God, and for many other cauſes which I haue rehearſed. Furthermore that, if they ſhall refuſe to obey the commaundement of God, they may know that they are giltie of diſobedience towarde God. Of theſe thinges that is playnly concluded which I propounded, to wit, that none may without great ſacrilege take gaine of this <note n="*" place="margin">That is, ſuch as eyther through po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, age, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe are not able to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> firſt kind of men. In the ſecond order or ſtate of men I place artificers, and thoſe which get their liuing with the labour of their handes. To theſe, according to the precept of Chriſt, we muſt lend, and looke for nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. For as the Apoſtle forbiddeth to giue vnto theſe freely when he ſayth: <hi>He that laboureth let him eate.</hi> As charitie dooth not require that we ſhoulde giue of our goods freely to them that are ſtrong and able to laboure:<note place="margin">How we muſt behaue our ſelues in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and labourers.</note> ſo if neceſſitie vrging them, they deſire to borowe anye thing of thee, obey the rule of Chriſt and lend without loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for a recompence in the like or in any other kind of dutye. The reaſon of the rule is, becauſe that they, which in the ſweate of their browes and in the laboure of their handes doe gette their liuing, are wont to gaine little more then their liuing and their clothing. If ſuch therfore ſhould be grieued with Vſurie, they ſhould be plainely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, not without the greate hurt of common weales and families, and ſo the foundation of the contractes and bargaines which we haue layd before, ſhould be vtterlye ouerthrowne. But I cannot with ſilence paſſe ouer what I iudge moſt iuſtly to be found fault with in this kind of men.<note place="margin">Three great faults in many artificers and labourers.</note> For beſide that many of this ſorte of men doe ſeeme to haue caſt aſide the feare of God, Iudge thre moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vices to be reſtrained in them, which are: more then barbarous drinking, exceſſe of apparrell altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete for this kind of men, and fraude and falſe dealing in their workmanſhip and labour.<note place="margin">The firſt fault founde in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers and workemen.</note> Many artificers &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whatſoeuer they gayne the whole weeke, this on the holy dayes they ſpend in drinking, hauing no regarde of

their ſilly wyues or of their poore children. Whereby it falleth out, that artificers and workemen doe more often want, and are more often conſtrayned to borow. If ſuch were reſtrayned by lawes and by puniſhment, it ſhould be better prouided not onely for them but alſo for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale.

They are not contented with common cloth, which was very much ſet by among our elders, but they imitating noble men and princes, doe ſeeke for garments of ſilke. And they whoſe abilitie doth not permit that doe gard the hemmes of their ſleeues and ſkirts of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with cleane ſilke, that as by a certayne ſigne or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken they may bewray the pride of their mind.

It is the dutie therfore of wiſe gouernoures, that they bring into order both the artificers them ſelues and alſo their ouerſeers or aſſiſtents. That which I haue ſayde of ſhoomakers and peltmongers, I will haue to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of all workemen and labourers whoſe occupation and practiſe is neceſſarye in the common weale.</p>
                  <p>In the third order or ſtate of men may huſbandmen be placed, who alſo doe get their liuing with the labours of their handes.

I ſpeake not of the vſurie of money, which is farre more vniuſt then the former. It behoueth the godly magiſtrate
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4126:73"/>
to correct this vniuſtice, and it is the dutie of godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours to prouoke the huſbandmen to doe pleaſures and good turnes one to another without all vſurie in the feare of the Lorde, and to paynt out that curſed vſurie in it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that they maye learne to eſchue it as a certayne plague or peſtilence. I woulde wiſhe alſo in this ſtate of men both exceſſe of apparell to be reſtrayned, and alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable expences at mariages, and at the birth of their children. For it is wont oftentimes to come to paſſe that they are deſtitute of things neceſſarie, which forgetting the maner of their ſtate, doe not keepe a meane.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth ſtate of men may be placed nice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate yong men, of whome <hi>Horace</hi> writeth in this maner:<note place="margin">Nice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate yong men.</note>

                  <p>To this order therefore I thought good to adde the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier yong men, which are not yet maried, whether they be noble, or the ſonnes of citizens, who being nowe ſet free from their tutors &amp; gouernours of their maners, are caried more freely according to the luſt of their minde.

Perhaps it will be an vnciuile thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to giue frely or to lend, neither the law of God, nor the rule of charitie doth compell thee.

I ſay that Vſurie is not here properly committed, bicauſe that this benefite was free, wherevnto thou waſt not bounde neyther by the lawe of God nor of nature. For Vſurie condemned by the worde of God is properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when for the lending which thou oweſt freely by the lawe of God and of nature, thou requireſt ſome thing more then the principall for the bounden dutie of lending.

                     <note place="margin">VVhen it is vſurie to take more than the principall, and when it is not vſurie.</note> Euery contract or bargayne, which by it owne kynde, or by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ought to be free, if a couenant of receyuing more than the principall, commeth betweene, it is named Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb facs="tcp:4126:78"/>
and properly ſuch only is named Vſurie. Of this rule of <hi>Gerſon</hi> it followeth, that it is not a bargaine of Vſurie, which by the circumſtances ought not to be free. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I take any thing according to the appointment and limitation of the lawes, for the benefite of lending which is not due, that there may be equalitie, I doe not commit Vſurie. I owe almes to the poore, I ought to lende to the needie. Wherefore? Bicauſe the ordinance of God and the lawe of nature doth require this. But to him that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not I ought of dutie by no lawe to lende. If therefore I deale or bargayne with him, a couenant being made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene vs concerning receyuing ſomewhat more than the principall, Vſurie is not properly committed, eſpecially if the equalitie be kept which the Magiſtrate hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherefore in this kynde of dealing I allow the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>D. Aepinus,</hi> who writing vpon the 15.

Of theſe three kindes of men <hi>Aepinus</hi> doth learnedly diſpute, and at length concludeth, that in the thirde kynde Vſurie is not committed, ſo that otherwiſe there be no departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> equalitie.<note place="margin">It is naturall equitie to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one good turne for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Now it is naturall equitie that for a benefite, which by right we doe not owe, a benefite be rendred, that there may be equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

It falleth out often with theſe, that they ſeeke to borowe mony, without which they cannot exerciſe their meane trade of marchandice. Here it is demaunded whether it be lawfull for the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to couenant for vſurie. I aunſwere plainly that it is not lawfull. For both by the lawe of God and of nature thou doſte owe to thy brother being in neede the dutie of lending. For when he doth in deede ſtande in neede, and thou art able without thy certayne hinderance to helpe him, thou doeſt offende if thou doe not helpe him, and thou doeſt alſo offende, if thou take any thing more than the principall for the bounden dutie of lending. But here are foure obſeruations to be marked. The firſt concerneth marchants that are not content with their meane. The ſeconde pertayneth vnto ſocietie. The thirde to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of wardes. The fourth is referred to the intereſt. Nowe as concerning the firſt obſeruation, we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that no man ought by the lawe of God and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to lende vnto a verye riche marchant, whoſe great welth and ſubſtance is well knowne. For that which is lent is due to neceſſitie, and ought not to ſerue vnſatiable couetouſneſſe. Wherfore we may deale with this kynde of men, according to the rule which we gaue when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of the fift ſort of men. The ſeconde obſeruation, which we ſayd to pertayne vnto ſocietie, is after this ſort: a marchant boroweth money of thee,<note place="margin">How we may lawfully co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant for part of the gayne of that which wee lende.</note> and thou dooſt agree with him for parte of the gaine vpon this condition, if he ſhall get any gaine by thy money. Here it is demaunded, whether it be lawfull for thee to couenant for parte of the gayne. I aunſwere, it is lawfull ſo that thou wilt take
<pb facs="tcp:4126:79"/>
part of the perill vpon thy ſelfe. For when this is done it doth not become vſurie. Thou maieſt therefore for a yeare require fiue of the hundred as part of the gaine, ſo that thou againe wilt ſuffer fiue of the hundred to be abated of the principall, if he ſuffer damage. For he that couenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth onely with condition of the gayne and wilbe free from the loſſe, doth in very deede commit Vſurie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is found giltie by the lawe of God and of nature. But as concerning wardes,<note place="margin">Howe Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may lende the mony of the wardes committed vnto them.</note> the Gardians of the wardes, that the inheritance wherewith they are put in truſt be not by little and little waſted, may lend the money of the wardes to them that deſire it eſpecially to them that are of the richer ſort, and for the benefit of lending and the vſe of the money require that which is reaſonable, that is, according to the limitation of the magiſtrate, fiue of the hundred euery yeare. This kind of dealing is not to be counted vſurie. For neyther Gardians are bound to lende of that which is another mans, neither they which borow, when as neyther diuine nor naturall bond or dette went before, can iuſtly refuſe to be thankfull for a benefite recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The obſeruation which pertayneth to the intereſt, doth alſo hinder the maner of vſurie. For if by deferring the payment of that which is borowed the creditour be endamaged,<note place="margin">Intereſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is ſayd to come.</note> equitie doth require that the dettour make a recompence for the damage. And this they cal the intereſt which they ſay doth ariſe, eyther becauſe of the loſſe that commeth or becauſe of the gaine that ceaſeth. For if the dettour ſhall not paye that which he borrowed, at the time appoynted for the payment, naturall equitie requireth, that the dettour make recompence for the loſſe that came to the creditour thereby. The like is to be ſayde of the gayne ceaſing. But here let the lender beware that he vſe not deceytfull ballances.<note place="margin">Charitie moſt neceſſarie in all kyndes of bargaynes.</note> Wherefore charitie is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which is the moſt iuſt rule of all contractes and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynes.

The confirmation of the fift reaſon taken from the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God toward them, which doe beare afflictions pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in fayth. Becauſe oftentimes mention is made in the Scripture of the mercy of God and that for moſt iuſt cauſe,<note place="margin">Howe God is mercifull and how he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercie.</note> and God is ſaide to be mercifull, and to ſhew mercy and compaſſion.

By thinking vpon this ſacrifice the holy fathers haue comforted themſelues in their ſacrifices. To this ſacrifice Dauid hath regard, as often as in the Pſalmes he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſireth the mercye of God, which pſalme 51. doth ſufficiently ſhew, where he maketh his prayer in theſe wordes: <hi>Haue mercy on me, O Lorde, according to thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindenes, according vnto the multitude of thy mercies wipe away my wickednes.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>wipe away,</hi> he hath reſpect vnto the bloud of the mediatour as he doth more plainly ſhewe in the ſeuenth verſe, where he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſatiſfaction for ſinne, for ſo he ſaith: <hi>Purge thou me with hyſop and I shall be cleane</hi> Fiftly,<note place="margin">The fift cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mercy of God</note> repentance or conuerſiion is here required, without which we are not made partakers of this vnſpeakable price, of the ſacrifiee of the ſonne of God.

Seuenthly,<note place="margin">The ſeuenth cogitation.</note> becauſe our weakenes is great, which is increaſed by thinking ſometime vpon
<pb facs="tcp:4126:89"/>
our particularitie, ſometime vpon our vnworthines, we muſt thinke that the mercy of God is not contayned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in narrow bounds,<note place="margin">The Lord is moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and rich in mercie.</note> neither that the greatnes of our ſinnes doe exceede it, but that it is extended to all the endes of the world, and doth by infinite meanes abound aboue ſinne.

For oyle is caried aboue other licours and ſwimmeth aboue them, ſo the mercy of God is aboue all his workes, and doth more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto men then the reſt. For mercy exceedeth iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and, his mercy is ouer all his workes. Moreouer, oyle doth mitigate the griefes of woundes, and doth heale ſwellings and ſores: but the mercy of God doth heale the ſores of our ſoules, and driueth away all faintnes of ſinne, as the Prophet ſayth:<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Who forgiueth all thy wickednes and healeth all thine infirmities, who ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things, and crowneth thee with mercy and louing kindnes.</hi> Finally they that ſhould come into the place of wraſtling or ſtriuing, did come forth into the middeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annoynted with oyle, whereby their bodyes might be more pliable and fitte for that kinde of exerciſe: ſo the Lord ſheweth vnto them his mercy which are about to ſtriue againſt the ayrie powers, with it he preuenteth vs and giueth vs ſtrength, whereby we being fortified in ſo harde a fight with his helpe, maye at the laſt goe awaye conquerers.<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.28.</note>

The firſt, the ſeconde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the ten commaundements, doth manifeſtly require the religion or right vſing of an othe. For when it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the abuſe of the name of God, it requireth the lawfull vſe thereof, to wit, inuocation of God, part whereof is a religious othe. The ſecond, the declaration of the <note n="*" place="margin">They diuide not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements after the ſame maner that we do, which neuertheles is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</note>ſecond precept <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. doth proue the ſame, for there Moſes ſayth: <hi>Thou shalt ſweare by his name,</hi> this ſaying doth both witnes that an othe is lawfull, and alſo doth ſhewe a maner of ſwearing. For God will not haue, that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites ſweare by the names of Deuils, after the maner of the Gentiles, but by his name. The thirde, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. The commaundement of the Lorde is this, when there is controuerſie concerning a thing committed to another to keepe, if the thing be taken awaye, God hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he to whom it was committed to keepe, do purge himſelfe with an oth. The fourth, the many examples of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4126:90"/>
ſaints and holy men, as of Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, and of many others, who in no caſe woulde haue eyther ſworn themſelues or required othes of other, except they had thought that it had bene lawfull to ſweare. But the othes of them doe make a rule of a lawfull othe, as I will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde declare. The fift, the example of Chriſt and of the Apoſtles in the newe teſtament. Howe often doth Chriſt vſe this maner of ſwearing? Verily, verily. &amp;c. Howe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth Paule ſweare, and alſo the other Apoſtles. Theſe things the Apoſtles had in no wiſe done, and much leſſe Chriſt, if euery othe had bene vnlawfull. The ſixt, the end of an oth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>And an oth,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>for confirmation is among men an ende of all strife.</hi> We haue firme reaſons, by which it is plainly ſhewed that euerye othe is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, as the Anabaptiſtes crie out: Nowe let vs go to that which we propounded in the ſeconde place.</p>

                  <p>IN an othe which is an affirming or denying of ſome thing, with a calling to witnes of the name of God,<note place="margin">VVhat an oth is.</note> or of ſome other thing, which ought to be vnto vs ſacred and vnuiolate, foure things are required,<note place="margin">Foure things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an oth.</note> which are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be conſidered in euery othe: as the partes of the othe, the cauſes, the affection of him that ſweareth, and the ende of ſwearing. The partes are two,<note place="margin">The firſt parte of an oth.</note> the one is the calling of God to witnes about the thing which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme or denie. For he that ſweareth, when he hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſes, appealeth to God, from whome nothing is hidde, and deſireth his teſtimonie, and confirmeth by an othe that that which he ſayth proceedeth from God as a witnes.

<pb facs="tcp:4126:91"/>
of God againſt him which ſweareth and deceyueth in ſwearing. For if he doth not eſcape puniſhment, which doth falſly alledge the teſtimonie of an earthly king, what ſhall be done to him which maketh God a lyer? This condition ought to call backe all men not onely from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,<note place="margin">Two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſes of an oth.</note> but alſo from lightnes of ſwearing. The cauſes of ſwearing are two, the former is the ignorance of the thing which is in hande, the latter the weyghtines thereof. For in trifling matters, and of none or ſmall importance, we muſt not flie to an othe. For the name of God ought to be more ſacred and holy vnto vs, than that we ſhould flie vnto it by ſwearing, except exceeding great neceſſitie doth vrge vs.<note place="margin">The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ought to be in him that ſweareth.</note> The affection of him that ſweareth ought to be double, for he ought to be moued thereunto both w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hatred of a lie, and with the loue of the truth. Whereſoeuer this affection is not, the name of God is taken in vayne. The ende of ſwearing is alſo double,<note place="margin">Two endes of ſwearing.</note> one, that the truth may be known, another, that God maye be honoured, by whome it is ſworne. Of theſe foure rightly conferred togither, it ſhall eaſily appeare, when it is lawful to ſweare, and when not. Certayne doe allowe this diſtinction, that a publike othe only, that is, required of the lawfull magiſtrate, is lawful, but not a priuate othe, that is, which one maketh of his owne accorde, eyther in his owne or in another mans cauſe.

It is not the purpoſe of the Lorde to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the lawe of his father, but to diſcloſe and reproue the errours of the interpreters of the lawe. The law of the father is: thou ſhalt ſweare by my name. This lawe the Lord doth not aboliſh, but doth rather mayntaine it, whiles that he reprehendeth the corrupting thereof. The
<pb facs="tcp:4126:92"/>
Phariſes of this lawe concluded after this ſort:<note place="margin">How the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lawe of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> God hath commaunded that we ſweare by his name, therefore we may ſweare for euery cauſe and after euery ſort. This erroneous conſequent the Lord reprehendeth when he ſaith: <hi>Thou shalt not forſweare thy ſelfe, but shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thine othes to the Lord.

Here therefore Chriſte prohibiteth his Diſciples and them that trulye feare the Lorde to ſweare raſhly for euerie cauſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euerie ſort. For he will haue the name of God to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenſed and worſhipped more religiouſly then that it be taken in vayne.

yea, yea: nay, nay.</hi> What meaneth the Lorde by theſe wordes? that in ſtede of a raſh oth they vſe conſtant &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed talke.
