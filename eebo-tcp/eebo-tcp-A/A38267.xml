            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Narrative, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe Commons have always deſired that a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
may be preſerved between the two
Houſes.</p>
            <p>There is now depending between your Lordſhips and
the Commons a matter of the greateſt weight, in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of which your Lordſhips ſeem to apprehend ſome
difficulty in the matters propoſed by the Commons.</p>
            <p>To clear this the Commons have deſired this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and by it they hope to manifeſt to your Lordſhips
that the Propoſitions of the Houſe of Commons made by
their Committee, in relation to the Trial of the Lords in
the Tower, have been only ſuch as are well warranted by
the Laws of Parliament and Conſtitutions of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in no ſort intrench upon the Judicature of the
Peers, but are moſt neceſſary to be inſiſted upon, that the
ancient Rights of Judicature in Parliament may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>The Commons readily acknowledge that the Crimes
charged upon the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> Lord <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> and Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> are of deep
guilt, and call for ſpeedy Juſtice, but withall they hold, that
any change in Judicature in Parliament, made without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in full Parliament, to be of pernitious conſequence, both
to his Majeſty, and his Subjects, and conceive themſelves
obliged to tranſmit to their Poſterity all the Rights which
of this kind they have received from their Anceſtors, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
your Lordſhips in mind of the progreſs that has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
been between the two Houſes, in relation to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
made by the Commons, and the reaſonableneſs of
the Propoſitions themſelves; they doubt not to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46757:3"/>
that their aim has been no other, than to avoid ſuch
conſequences, and preſerve that Right; and that there is no
delay of Juſtice on their part; and to that end, do offer
to your Lordſhips the enſuing Reaſons and Narrative: That
the Commons in bringing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to Juſtice, and
in diſcovery of that Execrable and Traiterous Conſpiracy
(of which the five Popiſh Lords now ſtand impeached, and
for which ſome of their wicked Accomplices have already
undergone the Sentence of the Law as Traytors and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers)
have laboured under many great difficulties, is not
unknown to your Lordſhips.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs known to your Lordſhips, That upon the
Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons againſt the Earl
of <hi>Danby</hi> for High Treaſon, and other High Crimes, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours,
and Offences, even the common Juſtice of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring
him from Parliament, and forthwith committing
him to ſafe Cuſtody was then required by the Commons,
and denied by the Houſe of Peers, though he then ſat in
their Houſe; of which your Lordſhips have been ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
That at a free Conference the tenth of <hi>April</hi> laſt, your
Lordſhips declared, That it was the Right of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and well warranted by Preſidents of former Ages;
That upon an Impeachment of the Commons, a Peer ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
ought of right to be ordered to withdraw, and
then to be committed; And had not that Juſtice been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to the Commons, a great part of this Seſſion of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
which hath been ſpent in framing and adjuſting a
Bill for cauſing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to appear and anſwer that
Juſtice from which he was fled, had been ſaved, and had
been imployed for the preſervation of his Majeſtie's Perſon,
and the Security of the Nation, and in proſecution of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
five Lords; neither had he had the opportunity for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
for himſelf that Illegal Pardon, which bears Date
the Firſt of <hi>March</hi> laſt paſt, and which he hath now plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Bar of his Impeachment: Nor of waſting ſo great a
proportion of the Treaſure of the Kingdom, as he hath
done, ſince the Commons exhibited their Articles of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46757:3"/>
After which time thus loſt by reaſon of the denyal of
that Juſtice which of right belonged to the Commons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Impeachment, the ſaid Bill being ready for the
Royal Aſſent, the ſaid Earle then rendred himſelf, and by
your Lordſhips Order of the ſixteenth of <hi>April</hi> laſt, was
committed to the Tower. After which he pleads the ſaid
Pardon, and being preſt, did at length declare, he would
rely upon and abide by that Plea, which Pardon pleaded
being illegal and void, and ſo ought not to barr, or
preclude the Commons from having Juſtice upon the
Impeachment. They did thereupon with their Speaker
on the fifth of <hi>May</hi> Inſtant, in the Name of themſelves,
and all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> demand Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſaid Earle, upon their Impeachment, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that your Lordſhips did intend in all your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
upon the Impeachment, to follow the uſual courſe
and method of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But the Commons were not a little ſurpriſed by the
Meſſage from your Lordſhips delivered them on the ſeventh
of <hi>May,</hi> thereby acquainting them, that as well the Lords
Spiritual as Temporal, had ordered that the tenth of <hi>May</hi>
inſtant ſhould be the Day for hearing the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi>
to make good his Plea of Pardon. And that on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>May,</hi> the other five Lords Impeached, ſhould
be brought to their Tryal, and that your Lordſhips had
addreſſed to his Majeſty for naming of a Lord high Steward,
as well in the Caſe of the Earle of <hi>Danby,</hi> as the other five
Lords.</p>
            <p>Upon Conſideration of this ſaid Meſſage, the Commons
found, that the admitting the Lords Spiritual to exerciſe
Juriſdiction in theſe caſes, was an alteration of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
in Parliament, and which extended as well to the
proceeding againſt the five Lords, as the Earle of <hi>Danby.</hi>
And that if a Lord high Steward ſhould be neceſſary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tryal, on Impeachment of the Commons; The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Judicature in Parliament, upon Impeachments might
be defeated by ſuſpending or denying a Commiſſion to
Conſtitute a Lord high Steward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:46757:4"/>
And that the ſaid Days of Tryal appointed by your
Lordſhips, were ſo near to the time of your ſaid Meſſage,
that theſe Matters, and the Method of proceeding upon
the Trial, could not be adjuſted by Conference betwixt
the two Houſes, before the Day ſo nominated. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the Commons could not then proceed to Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
unleſs the Zeal which they have for ſpeedy Judgment
againſt the Earle of <hi>Danby,</hi> (That ſo they might proceed
to the Tryal of the other five Lords) ſhould induce them
at this Juncture, both to admit the inlargement of your
Lordſhips Juriſdiction, and to ſit down under theſe or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hardſhips, (tho with the hazard of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Power of impeaching for time to come) rather then
the Tryal of the ſaid five Lords ſhould be deferred for
ſome ſhort time, whilſt theſe Matters might be agreed on
and ſetled.</p>
            <p>For reconciling Differences in theſe great and weighty
Matters, and for ſaving that time which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
have been ſpent in Debates and Conferences betwixt
the two Houſes, and for expediteing the Tryal, without
giving up the Power of Impeachment, or rendring them
ineffectual.</p>
            <p>The Commons thought fit to propoſe to your Lordſhips,
that a Commitee of both Houſes might be appointed for
this purpoſe. At which Committee (when agreed to by
your Lordſhips,) It was firſt propoſed that the time of
Tryal of the Lords in the Tower, ſhould be put off till
the other Matters were adjuſted, and it was then agreed,
that the Propoſition as to the time of the Tryal, ſhould
be the laſt thing conſidered. And the effect of this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtands reported upon your Lordſhips Books.</p>
            <p>After which the Commons communicated to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
by your Committee, a Vote of theirs, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that the
Committee of the Commons ſhould inſiſt upon their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Vote of their Houſe. That the Lords Spiritual ought
not to have any Vote in any proceedings againſt the
Lords in the Tower, and that when that Matter ſhould
be ſetled, and the Method of Proceedings adjuſted, the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46757:4"/>
Commons would then be ready to proceed upon the Trial
of the Pardon of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> againſt whom they had
before demanded Judgment, and afterwards to the Trial
of the other five Lords in the Tower, which Vote extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well to the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> as the other five Lords;
But the Commons as yet received nothing from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
towards an Anſwer of that Vote, ſave that your
Lordſhips have acquainted them, that the Biſhops have
asked leave of the Houſe of Peers, that they might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themſelves from the Tryal of the ſaid five Lords,
with Liberty of entring their uſual proteſtation.</p>
            <p>And though the Commons Committee have almoſt day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared to your Lordſhips Committee, that that was a
neceſſary point of Right, to be ſetled before the Tryal,
and offered to debate the ſame, your Committee always
anſwered that they had not any Power from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
either to confer upon or to give any Anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Matter.</p>
            <p>And yet your Lordſhips without having given the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
any ſatiſfactory Anſwer to the ſaid Vote, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any Conference or Debate thereupon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the ſaid Agreement, did on Thurſday the twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>May</hi> ſend a Meſſage to the Commons, Declaring that
the Lords Spiritual as well as Temporal, had ordered that
the twenty ſeventh of this Inſtant <hi>May</hi> be appointed for
the Tryal of the five Lords.</p>
            <p>So that the Commons cannot but apprehend that your
Lordſhips have not only departed from what was agreed
on, and in effect laid aſide that Committee, which was
conſtituted for preſerving a good Underſtanding betwixt
the two Houſes, and better diſpatch of the weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
now depending in Parliament, but muſt alſo needs
Conclude from the ſaid Meſſage, and the Votes of your
Lordſhips on the fourteenth of <hi>May;</hi> That the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
have a Right to ſtay and ſit in Court, till the Court
proceeds to the Vote of Guilty or not Guilty. And from
the Biſhops asking leave (as appears by your Lordſhips
Books two Days after your ſaid Vote) that they might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46757:5"/>
withdraw themſelves from the Trial of the ſaid Lords,
with Liberty of entring their uſual Proteſtation, and by
their perſiſting ſtill to go on and give their Votes in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
upon the Impeachment; That their deſire of
leave to withdraw at the ſaid Tryal, is only an Evaſive
Anſwer to the before mentioned Vote of the Commons,
and chiefly intended as an Argument for a Right of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in Proceedings upon Impeachment, and as a Reſerve
to Judge upon the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea of Pardon; And
upon theſe and other like Impeachments, although no ſuch
Power was ever claimed by their Predeceſſors, but is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
denied by the Commons: And the Commons are
the rather induced to believe it ſo intended, becauſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
asking leave to withdraw, ſeems to imply a Right to be
there, and that they cannot be abſent without it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe by this way they would have it in their
Power, whether or no for the future, either in the Earl of
<hi>Danby</hi>'s Caſe, or any other, they will ever ask leave to be
abſent; And the Temporal Lords a like Power of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leave, if that ſhould once be admitted neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Commons therefore are obliged not to proceed to
the Tryal of the Lords on the Twenty ſeventh of
this Instant <hi>May,</hi> but to adhere to their aforeſaid
Vote: And for their ſo doing, beſides what hath
been now and formerly by them ſaid to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
do offer you theſe Reaſons following.</hi>

againſt His Majeſty, tending to render His Perſon and
His Government odious to His People; againſt which it ought
to be the firſt and principal care of both Houſes to vindicate
His Majeſty, by doing Juſtice upon the ſaid Earl.</p>

                  <p>The ſetting up a Pardon to be a Bar of an Impeachment,
defeats the whole uſe and effect of Impeachments; and
ſhould this point be admitted, or ſtand doubted, it would
totally diſcourage the exhibiting any for the future; whereby
the chief Inſtitution for the preſervation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(and conſequently the Government it ſelf) would be
deſtroyed. And therefore the Caſe of the ſaid Earl, (which
in conſequence concerns all Impeachments whatſoever) ought
to be determined before that of the ſaid Five Lords, which is
but their particular Caſe.</p>

                     <hi>And without reſorting to many Authorities of greater An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
the Commons deſire your Lordſhips to take notice,
(with the ſame regard they do) of the Declaration which
that Excellent Prince, King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
made in this behalf, in his Anſwer to the Nineteen
Propoſitions of both Houſes of Parliament; wherein ſtating
the ſeveral parts of this regulated Monarchy, he ſays:</hi> The
King, the Houſe of Lords, and the Houſe of Commons have,
each, particular Priviledges: <hi>And among thoſe which belong
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46757:6"/>
to the King, he reckons</hi> power of Pardoning. <hi>After the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerating
of which, and other His Prerogatives, His ſaid
Majeſty adds thus:</hi> Again, That the Prince may not make uſe
of this High and perpetual Power, to the hurt of thoſe for
whoſe good he hath it, and make uſe of the name of publick ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
for the gain of his private Favorites and Followers, to
the detriment of his people; The Houſe of Commons, (an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Conſerver of Liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is ſolely intruſted with the firſt
Propoſitions concerning the Levies of Moneys, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
of thoſe, who, for their own ends, though countenanced
by any ſurreptitiouſly-gotten Command of the King, have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
that Law, which he is bound (when he knows it) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
and to the protection of which they were bound to adviſe
him, at leaſt not to ſerve him in the contrary. And the Lords

                     </gap>ing truſted with a Judicatory Power, are an excellent skreen
and bank between the Prince and People, to aſſiſt each againſt
any Incroachments of the other; and by juſt Judgments to
preſerve that Law, which ought to be the Rule of every one of
the three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the power legally placed in both Houſes,
is more than ſufficient to prevent and reſtrain the power of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
