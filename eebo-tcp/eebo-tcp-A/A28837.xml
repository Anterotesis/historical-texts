         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Anſwer to the Inſtructions, I had particularly given <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras,</hi>
gave abroad a Relation of the Conference, very different from this of mine. To
ſpeak freely, what I think, his Relation is neither for his Credit, nor min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>:
We hold in it round about long Diſcourſes, languiſhing, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipid, and inconſequent
enough. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Relation we often return back, to what we had left,
without perceiving how we get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> again: We did not act in that mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r,
<pb facs="tcp:62471:3"/>
and our Diſpute was conſequential and cloſe enough. In this ſort of Conteſts men
naturally grow hot, as in a kind of wreſtling: and ſo the ſequel is more animated,
than the Beginnings. Men try one another, and if I ſo ſpeak, in the firſt Blows,
that are given: when they have a little explain'd themſelves, when they think,
they have diſcover'd, where each Party places the Difficulty, and found, as I may
ſay, one anothers weak ſides, all, that follows, is more lively and preſſing. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all this be as natural in Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Diſcourſe, as in mine, the Reader
ſhall be Judge. As his is turn'd, many will ſcarce believe, but that it has been
adjuſted and trimm'd up on the peruſal of mine. But I will not ſtay upon theſe
Reflexions. 'Tis with Diſcourſes, as with Pictures, in which every one cannot
diſcern, what is Original, and, as I may ſay, from the firſt hand. Nor will I
here make uſe of the odious Reproach of Inſincerity. One does not always, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
remember either the things, that were ſaid, or the Order, in which they
were deliver'd: We often confound in our Minds our After-thoughts, with what
we indeed ſaid in the Diſpute; and one is frequently found to have chang'd the
Truth without any Deſign of lying. What I ſhall ſay of Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> the ſame
he may ſay of me. Our Converſation was in private, and neither of us can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
indifferent Witneſſes: thus every one will judge of the Truth of our Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
according as himſelf is prepoſſeſs'd. I pretend not to draw any Advantage
from the Succeſs of the Conference, which was follow'd by the Converſion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle
de Duras:</hi> 'tis a Work of <hi>GODs,</hi> for which we ought to give
him thanks: 'tis an Example for thoſe, that are well diſpos'd, but not an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Obſtinate. The <hi>Catholicks</hi> will look on this Change in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the Pretended Reformed in another. So that, ſhould Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> and
I ſet our ſelves, each of us to juſtify his Relation, the Reſult would be only a
Diſpute, with which the Publick has nothing to do. And what great matter is
it, will the Reader ſay, which the two had the better? The Cauſe reſides not in
theſe two men, who would appear extremely vain, and ſo of little Credit, if they

their Word. In theſe Altercations the beſt Courſe, a prudent Reader can
take, is to ſearch into the Bottom of the Matters, and without regarding the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Facts, to conſider the Doctrin, laid down by each Party.</p>
            <p>The Subject, treated of in all this Relation, is no leſs clear, than important.
'Tis the Authority of the Church. Our Adverſaries make little account of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
being always heard to ſay, that we muſt come to the Bottom, ſetting aſide as an
unneceſſary Formality, all the Arguments drawn from the Authority of the Church:
as if it were not an eſſential Part of the Bottom to examin, by what Authority
and what Means <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> would have <hi>Chriſtians</hi> reſolve
themſelves on the Diſputes, that ſhould ſpring up in his Church. <hi>Catholicks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that this Means is to hear the Church it ſelf. They pretend, that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb facs="tcp:62471:3"/>
Member ought not to reſolve but with the whole Body, and that be hazards all,
when he reſolves any other way. They pretend, that to know, in what Church we
ought to ſtay, we need only know, which it is, that was never accus'd of being
form'd by ſeparating it ſelf; that was extant before all Separations; from which
all others have ſeparated. Without going forth of our Houſe, our very
Parents will ſhew us this Church.<note place="margin">Deut. xxxii. v. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Ask thy Father, and he will
ſhew thee, thy Elders, and they will tell thee.</hi> According to this Rule
whoever can ſhew a whole Church, a whole Society of Paſtors, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of its Being, and a Time, whenſoever, during which it was not, has convinc'd
it of not being a Church truly <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> This is our Pretention, and we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not, that this Queſtion is about a ſimple Formality. We averr, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
a fundamental Article, contain'd in theſe words of the Creed, <hi>I believe the
holy Catholick Church:</hi> an Article beſides of ſuch importance, that it carries
with it the Deciſion of all the reſt. But as this Point is deciſive, ſo it is no leſs
clear, and it cannot be long ſpoken of, but one ſide or other will ſhew their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Let us ſay better: when a <hi>Catholick,</hi> never ſo little inſtructed, undertakes
a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> upon this Point, this <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> how able and ſubtil ſoever, will find
himſelf reduc'd, not always indeed to hold his Peace; but, what is no leſs ſtrong
than Silence, to ſay nothing, when he ſhall attempt to ſpeak, but viſible Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>This is, what here befell Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> thrô the ſole Defect of his Cauſe: for
'twill appear, that he defended it with all poſſible Skill, and ſo ſubtilly, that I
fear'd for thoſe who heard him: for I know, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes of ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.
But in fine we muſt boldly ſay: The Truth gain'd a manifeſt Victory.
What Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> avows, ruins his Cauſe: The Places, where he ſtood without
an Anſwer, are indeed ſuch, as ſuffer none.</p>
            <p>And to the end it may not be ſaid, I aſſert, what I pleaſe: or that I now
deſire, what I ere while diſclaim'd, to be believ'd on my own word: two things
will ſhew, whatever Opinion may be had of me, that in this Point I muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
he believ'd.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that relying on the force of Truth, and his Promiſe, who
ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. xxi. v. 15.</note> that <hi>he will give us a Mouth and Wiſdom, which our
Adverſaries ſhall not be able to reſiſt,</hi> where-ever Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
ſhall ſay, that he has not acknowledg'd, what I make him acknowledge in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
of the Conference, I engage my ſelf in a ſecond Conference to draw again
from him the ſame Acknowledgment; and where-ever he ſhall ſay, that he was
not without an Anſwer, I will force him without any other Argument, but thoſe,
he has already heard, to Anſwers ſo viſibly abſurd, that any men of good Senſe ſhall
acknowledge, he had far better have been ſilent, than have made uſe of them.</p>
            <p>And for fear it ſhould be ſaid; for in an Affair, that concerns the Converſion
of Souls, we muſt, as much as may be, prevent all Objection: for fear then once
<pb facs="tcp:62471:4"/>
again it ſhould be ſaid, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> engag'd himſelf in theſe Inconveniences
by ill management, I on the contrary affirm, that this Advantage is ſo inherent
to our Cauſe, that there is no Miniſter, no Doctor, no man living, but muſt in
the ſame manner ſink under the like Arguments.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who will make trial of it ſhall ſee, that this is no vain Promiſe. If any
one ſays, I preſume too much on my ſtrength; now that I examin my ſelf in the
preſence of <hi>GOD,</hi> if ſuch a Preſumption had made me ſpeak, I ſhould diſown
all, I had ſaid. Inſtead of promiſing my ſelf any Advantage, I ſhould eſteem my
ſelf already vanquiſht by truſting only to my own Arm, and my own Weapons:
and ſo far ſhould I be from defying the ſtrong, as <hi>David</hi> that,
I ſhould rank my ſelf among thoſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 63.</note> of whom the ſame <hi>David</hi> ſings,
that <hi>the Arrows of Children have pierc'd them, and their own Tongue,
too weak to defend them, is in fine turn'd againſt themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inſtruction, I offer in general to the Pretended Reformed, I particularly
offer thoſe of the Dioceſs of <hi>Meaux,</hi> whom I am above all the reſt oblig'd to
bear in my Bowels. Thoſe, that ſhall refuſe this <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Inſtruction, no leſs
peaceable, fraternal and paternal, than concluding and deciſive, I ſhall ſay to them
in the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> with ſorrow and groaning, there being no
comfort in the loſs of ones Children and Brethren,<note place="margin">Acts. xx. v. 26.</note> 
               <hi>I am pure from
the Blood of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt thing, which will ſhew, that I impute nothing to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
which might give me any Advantage. The ſecond is, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> himſelf
in the midſt of what he oppoſes againſt me, and amongſt all the Turns, he gives
our Diſpute, ſtill acknowledges at laſt, what was in conteſt between us, or elſe
ſhifts it off in ſuch a manner, as plainly ſhews, he cannot entirely diſown it. But
this will be better underſtood by thoſe, who, after the Inſtructions and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
ſhall read the Reflexions, I make on Mr. <hi>Claudes</hi> writing.</p>
            <p>Some Attention is requiſite, to comprehend the whole ſequel of theſe Instructions:
for whatever Eaſineſs it has pleas'd <hi>GOD</hi> to let us find in a matter, in which
he ſhews the moſt ignorant, as well as the moſt learned, the plain way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
yet would be not diſcharge any one of the Attention, he is capable of;
and ſince the following Diſcourſes had their Riſe from the XIX and XX Articles
of my <hi>Expoſition,</hi> the reading of theſe two Articles, which will take up but
half a quarter of an hour, will facilitate the Vnderſtanding of all this Work,
thô I moreover hope, that it is of it ſelf ſufficiently intelligible.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Reading of them will not be unuſeful to <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
too much neglect Books of Controverſy. Grounded on the Faith of the Church,
they are too careleſs in peruſing ſuch Works, by which their Faith might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
and in which they might find means to reduce the Erring. This was not
the Vſe in the firſt Ages of the Church: the Treatiſes of Controverſy, written by
<pb facs="tcp:62471:4"/>
the Fathers, were ſought after by all the Faithful, Converſation being one of the
Means, propos'd to us by the Holy Ghoſt for the gaining of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, every one
endeavour'd to render his profitable and edifying by ſuch Reading. The Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated
it ſelf by ſo ſweet a Means; and Converſation won thoſe, whom a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
Diſpute would perhaps but have made more averſe. But to the end the
Works, we make of Controverſy, may be read, as thoſe of the Fathers were, let
us endeavour, as the Fathers did, to fill them not only with exact and found Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but alſo with Piety and Charity; and let us, as much as we can, correct
the Dryneſs, not to ſay the Sourneſs, which is too often found in ſuch Books.</p>

Miniſter of CHARENTON,
Concerning the
AUTHORITY of the CHURCH.</head>
            <p>MADEMOISELLE <hi>de</hi> DURAS,<note place="margin">I. The Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and particular Inſtruction.</note> being in
ſome Doubt about her Religion, caus'd me to
be ask'd by ſeveral Perſons of Quality; Whether
I were willing to Confer with Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> in her
Preſence. I anſwer'd, I ſhould very readily do it, if I ſaw
that ſuch a Conference were neceſſary for her Salvation. She
afterwards, by the Duke of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> invited me to be at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the laſt of <hi>February</hi> 1678. and to enter into
Conference the next day with this Miniſter, on the Subject
ſhe would ſpeak to me about. This was to intimate to me,
that ſhe was willing to ſee me before the Conference. Being
with her on the Day appointed, ſhe acquainted me, That the
Point, ſhe deſir'd to have clear'd with her Miniſter, was that
of the Churches Authority, which ſeem'd to her to include the
whole Controverſy. She appear'd to me not likely to come
to a Reſolution without this Conference, ſo that I judg'd it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62471:6"/>
I told her, ſhe had indeed great Reaſon to lay her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and whole Streſs on this Article, which in effect compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ded
the Deciſion of all the reſt, as ſhe herſelf had well
obſerv'd; and endeavour'd to make her yet fuller underſtand
the Importance of this Article.</p>
            <p>'Tis a thing, ſaid I to her, ordinary enough with your
Miniſters to brag, That they cannot be deny'd to believe the
Fundamentals of the Faith. They ſay, that we believe all
they believe; but that they believe not all we believe. Their
Meaning by this is, That they have kept all the Fundamentals
of the Faith, and rejected only what we have added to them.
They draw thence a great Advantage, and pretend that
their Doctrine is ſecure and indiſputable. <hi>Mademoiſelle de
Duras</hi> remembred very well, ſhe had often heard them uſe
ſuch Diſcourſes. I will make, proceeded I, but one Remark
upon this; which is, that, inſtead of granting them to believe
all the Fundamentals of the Faith, we ſhew, that there is one
Article of the Creed, they believe not, which is that of the
Univerſal Church. 'Tis true, they ſay with the Mouth, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Catholic</hi> or Univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Arians, Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay with the Mouth, <hi>I believe in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST, and in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But as there is reaſon to
accuſe them of not believing theſe Articles, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them not, as they ought, nor according to their true
Senſe: ſo if we ſhew the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, as they ought, the Article of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi>
we may truly ſay, that in effect they reject ſo important <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an
Article of the Creed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> had read my Treatiſe of the <hi>Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and told me, ſhe remembred, that ſhe had ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it, like to what I now ſaid: but I anſwer'd, my
Intention in that Treatiſe was to mention things very briefly,
and that 'twas fit ſhe ſhould now ſee them a little more at
large.</p>
            <p>You muſt know then, ſaid I to her, what is meant by this
Expreſſion, The <hi>Catholic</hi> or Univerſal <hi>Church;</hi> and upon this I
began to lay for my Ground, that in the Creed, which was
only a bare Declaration of the Faith, this Term muſt be taken
in its moſt proper, and moſt natural Signification, and ſuch, as
is moſt uſed amongſt <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Now all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by the Name
of the Church underſtand a Society, making Profeſſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62471:6"/>
the Doctrine of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and govern it ſelf
by his Word. If this Society makes this Profeſſion, 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
viſible.</p>
            <p>That this was the proper, and genuine Signification of the
Word <hi>Church,</hi> ſuch as was known by every one, and us'd in
common Diſcourſe, I deſired no other Witneſſes, than the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformed</hi> themſelves.</p>
            <p>When they ſpeak of their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Prayers,</hi> of the <hi>Churches
Diſcipline,</hi> of the <hi>Churches Faith,</hi> of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> they mean not the Prayers of the Predeſtinate, nor
their Diſcipline, nor their Faith; but the Prayers, Faith, and
Diſcipline of all the Faithful, aſſembled in the exterior Society
of <hi>GOD</hi>s People.</p>
            <p>When they ſay, That a Man edifies the <hi>Church,</hi> or that he
ſcandalizes the <hi>Church;</hi> that they receive one into the <hi>Church,</hi> or
exclude one out of the <hi>Church,</hi> all this is undoubtedly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of the exterior Society of <hi>GOD</hi>s People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus they explain it in the form of Baptiſm, when they ſay,
that they are going to receive the</hi> Child into the Fellowſhip of the
Chriſtian Church; <hi>and when for this cauſe they oblige</hi> the Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Godmothers to inſtruct the little one in the Doctrin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by GOD's People, as it is, <hi>ſay they,</hi> ſummarily compris'd
in the Confeſſion of Faith, which we all have: <hi>And again, when
they ask of GOD in their Eccleſiaſtical Prayers,</hi> to deliver all
his Churches from the Throat of the ravening Wolves: <hi>And yet
more expreſly in the Confeſſion of Faith, Article XXV. when
they ſay, That</hi> the Order of the Church, which was eſtabliſhed by
JESVS CHRIST, muſt be ſacred; and therefore that the Church
cannot ſubſiſt, if there be not in it Paſtors, who may have the
charge to Teach: <hi>And in Article XXVI.</hi> That none ought to dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
aſide, but that all together ought to keep and maintain the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of
the Church, ſubmitting to the common Inſtruction: <hi>And in fine, in
Article XXVII.</hi> That we muſt carefully diſcern, which is the true
Church; and that it is the Company of the Faithful, which agree to
follow GODs Word, and the pure Religion, that depends on it.
<hi>Whence they conclude Article XXVIII.</hi> That where GODs Word
is not received, nor any Profeſſion made of ſubjecting themſelves to it,
and where there is no uſe of the Sacraments, one cannot, to ſpeak
properly, judge, that there is a Church.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident by all theſe Paſſages, and by the common
Practice of the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> that the proper, natural, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62471:7"/>
generally us'd Signification of the Word <hi>Church,</hi> is to take it
for the exterior Society of GODs People, amongſt whom
thô there be found ſome <hi>Hypocrites and Reprobates;</hi> their <hi>Malice,</hi>
ſay they, <hi>cannot efface the Title of the Church,</hi> Article XXVII.
That is, The Hypocrites, mix'd in the Exterior Society of
GODs People, cannot take from it the Title of the true
Church, provided it be always veſted with theſe exterior
Marks, the making Profeſſion of GODs Word, and the
Uſe of the Sacraments, as is ſaid in Article XXVIII.</p>
            <p>This is the Acceptation of the Word <hi>Church,</hi> when we ſpeak
ſimply, naturally, and properly, without Contention or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;
and if this be the ordinary manner of taking this Word,
we have reaſon to ſay, that 'twas in this Senſe, the Apoſtles
made uſe of it in their Creed, where they were to ſpeak in the
moſt ordinary and ſimple manner, as being to incloſe in few
Words the Confeſſion of the Fundamentals of the Faith.</p>
            <p>In effect, this Word <hi>Church</hi> has in the common Diſcourſe of
all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> been taken to ſignify this exterior Society of GODs
People. When by this Word <hi>Church</hi> is intended the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Predeſtinate, 'tis ſo expreſs'd, and they ſay <hi>the Church
of the Predeſtinate.</hi> When by this Word is meant <hi>the Aſſembly
and Church of the Firſt-born,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. xii. v. 23.</note> 
               <hi>which are written in Heaven,</hi> 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
nam'd, as we ſee in St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He takes here the Word
<hi>Church</hi> in a leſs uſed Signification, for <hi>the City of the Living
GOD, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, where is <hi>an innumerable company
of Angels, and Spirits of juſt Men made perfect;</hi> that is, for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where the holy Souls are gathered together. Wherefore
he adds a word to mark out this <hi>Church;</hi> that is, <hi>the Church of
the Firſt-born,</hi> who have preceded their Brethren in Glory.
But when we uſe the word <hi>Church</hi> ſimply without adding any
thing, the common Practice of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not excepting the
<hi>pretended Reformed</hi> themſelves, takes it for to ſignify the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
the Society, the Communion of thoſe, that confeſs the
true Doctrin of JESUS CHRIST. And whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
this Cuſtom of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?
where we ſee in effect the word <hi>Church</hi> commonly taken
in this Senſe; ſo that this cannot be deny'd to be the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and natural Signification of this Word.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> (which we render <hi>Church</hi>) originally ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
an Aſſembly, and was principally attributed to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
heretofore held by the People for the diſcuſſing of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62471:7"/>
publick Affairs. And this word is us'd in this Senſe in the
nineteenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when the People of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
were aſſembled in Fury againſt St. <hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. XIX. v. 32. v. 39. v. 40.</note> 
               <hi>the Aſſembly</hi> (Eccleſia)
<hi>was confus'd.</hi> And again: <hi>If ye enquire any thing concerning other
Matters, it ſhall be determin'd in a lawful Aſſembly</hi> (Eccleſia.)
And in fine. <hi>When he had thus ſpoken, he diſmiſs'd the Aſſembly</hi>
(Eccleſiam.)</p>
            <p>This was the uſe of the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> (<hi>Church</hi>) amongſt
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in Gentiliſm. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made uſe of it to ſignify the Aſſembly, the Society, the
Community of GODs People, which makes Profeſſion to
ſerve him. There is none, but knows that famous Verſion of
the Seventy, who tranſlated the old Teſtament into <hi>Greek</hi> ſome
Ages before the coming of JESUS CHRIST. Of above
fifty Paſſages, where this Word is found to be made uſe of
in their Tranſlation, there is not any one, in which it is not
taken for ſome viſible Aſſembly, and very few, in which it is
not taken for the exterior Society of GODs People. In this
ſenſe alſo St. <hi>Stephen</hi> makes uſe of it, when he ſays, that <hi>Moſes
was in the Church in the Wilderneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts VII. v. 38.</note> 
               <hi>with the Angel which ſpake to
him,</hi> calling by this name <hi>Church,</hi> according to the Uſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> the viſible Society of GODs Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> took this word from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and kept it in
the ſame Senſe, uſing it to ſignify the Aſſembly of thoſe, that
confeſs'd JESUS CHRIST, and made Profeſſion of his
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>This is, what is ſimply call'd the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> of
GOD and JESUS CHRIST: And of above an hundred
Paſſages, where this word is made uſe of in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there are ſcarce two or three, where this Signification is
conteſted by the Miniſters; and even in the Places, where they
conteſt it, 'tis manifeſt, they do it without reaſon.</p>
            <p>For Example, they will not have this place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where
he ſays,<note place="margin">Eph. V. v. 27.</note> that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST preſented to himſelf a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Church, not having Spot, or Wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that
it is holy, and without Blemiſh:</hi> This Place, I ſay, they will not
have it poſſible to be underſtood of the viſible Church, nor
yet of the Church on Earth, becauſe the Church, ſo conſider'd,
is ſo far from being without Blemiſh, that it ſtands in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
need of this Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our Sins.</hi> And I ſay on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62471:8"/>
contrary, that to affirm, this glorious and unſpotted Church is
not the viſible Church, is manifeſtly to contradict the Apoſtle.
For ſee,<note place="margin">v. 25, 26.</note> of what Church St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks: 'Tis of that, <hi>which
JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST loved, and gave himſelf for it: that he
might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water, by the
Word.</hi> This Church, waſht in Water, and purify'd by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
this Church, ſanctify'd by the word of Life, whether by
that of Preaching, or by that, which is made uſe of in the
Sacraments, this Church is without doubt the viſible Church.
The holy Society of the Predeſtinate is not excluded from it,
GOD forbid: They are the moſt noble part of it; but they
are compris'd in this whole. They are there inſtructed by
the Word, they are there purify'd by Baptiſm; and often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſome of the Reprobate are employ'd in theſe Miniſteries. They
muſt then be conſider'd in this Paſſage, not as making a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
apart; but as making the faireſt and moſt noble part of
this exterior Society. 'Tis this Society, which the Apoſtle calls
the <hi>Church.</hi> JESUS CHRIST without doubt loves it:
for he has given it Baptiſm; he has ſhed his Blood to aſſemble
it; there is not any one either call'd, juſtify'd, or baptiz'd in
this Church, who is not called, juſtify'd, and baptiz'd in the
Name, and by the Merits of JESUS CHRIST. This
Church is glorious, becauſe ſhe glorifies GOD, becauſe ſhe
declares to all the Earth the Glory of JESUS CHRISTs
Goſpel and Croſs. This Church is Holy, becauſe ſhe always,
conſtantly, and without varying, teaches the holy Doctrin,
which continually brings forth Saints in her Unity. This
Church has neither Spot nor Wrinkle, becauſe ſhe has neither
any Error, nor any evil Maxim; and moreover becauſe ſhe
inſtructs and contains in her Boſom the Elect of GOD, who,
thô Sinners on Earth, find in her Communion exterior Means
to purify themſelves, ſo that they ſhall one day come in a
moſt perfect Eſtate before JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>This perhaps is the only Place, in which it may with ſome
ſhew of Probability be ſaid, That the word <hi>Church,</hi> taken ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſignifies ſomething elſe than the exterior Society of GODs
People; and yet you ſee, how clear it is, that it ought to be
underſtood as all the others.</p>
            <p>But ſhould this Paſſage, and two or three more, have a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
either Doubtful, or even different from this, yet are
all the other conformable to it. For what is there more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62471:8"/>
than ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, That the Church muſt
be edify'd, that the Church has been perſecuted, that GOD
is praiſed in the midſt of the Church, that ſhe is ſaluted, that
ſhe is viſited, that there are Paſtors and Biſhops eſtabliſht to
govern her, and other like, the number of which is infinite?</p>
            <p>It cannot then be deny'd, that this is the ordinary Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word <hi>Church,</hi> and conſequently that, which is to be
follow'd in ſo plain a Confeſſion of Faith, as is the Apoſtles
Creed.</p>
            <p>In this Senſe was it taken by a whole great Council,<note place="margin">Conc. Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. poſt Symb.</note> the
firſt and holieſt of all the Univerſal Councils, when condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Arius,</hi> it pronounc'd in this manner: <hi>The holy Catholic and
Apoſtolic Church anathematizes all thoſe, who ſay, That the Son of
GOD was drawn out of nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis JESUS CHRIST himſelf, who taught us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Church in this Senſe. For to found this Church,
he came forth from the inviſible Boſom of his Father, and
rendred himſelf viſible to Men; he aſſembled about him a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Men, that acknowledg'd him for their Maſter: This
is, what he call'd his Church. To this Primitive Church the
Faithful, who afterwards believ'd, congregated themſelves, and
thence ſprung the <hi>Church,</hi> which the Creed terms <hi>Catholic</hi> or
Univerſal.</p>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST us'd the word <hi>Church</hi> to ſignify this
viſible Society, when he ſaid himſelf, that we muſt hear the
Church.<note place="margin">Mat. xviii. v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Tell it unto the Church:</hi> And again when he ſaid:
<hi>Thou art</hi> Peter,<note place="margin">Mat. xvi. v. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church: and
the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, ſaid I, Madam, why will not they of your Religion
underſtand here by the word <hi>Church,</hi> the Society of thoſe that
make Profeſſion to believe in JESUS CHRIST and the
Goſpel, ſince it is certain, that this Society is in effect the true
Church, againſt which Hell could never prevail, neither when
it made uſe of Tyrants to perſecute her, nor when it ſet falſe
Doctors on work to corrupt her?</p>
            <p>Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Predeſtinate; 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
For if it cannot prevail againſt this exterior Society,
with much greater Reaſon ſhall it not prevail againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of GOD, who are the pureſt and moſt ſpiritual part of
this Church. But by the ſame Reaſon, that it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt the Elect, it cannot prevail againſt the Church,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62471:9"/>
which teaches them, in which they confeſs the Goſpel, and
receive the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>'Tis this exterior Society, in which the Elect ſerve GOD,
that we ought to underſtand by the word <hi>Church,</hi> and at the
ſame time admire the invincible Force of JESUS CHRIST's
Promiſes, who has ſo ſupported the Society of his People, thô
weak in compariſon of the Infidels, which environ'd it without;
thô torn by Heretics, who divided it within, that there has
not been ſo much as one ſole Moment, in which this Church
has not been ſeen by the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> have not dar'd to retain this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Senſe of the Goſpel. For, that they might eſtabliſh
themſelves, they have been forc'd to ſay in their Confeſſion
of Faith, Article XXXI. <hi>That the State of the Church was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and that they were fain to raiſe it up again anew, becauſe
it was in Ruine and Deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In effect, when their Church was ſet up, it entred not into
Communion with any other Church, then extant on the Earth;
but was form'd by breaking with all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches,
which were in the World.</p>
            <p>They have not then the Conſolation, which the <hi>Catholics</hi>
have to ſee JESUS CHRIST's Promiſe viſibly accompliſht,
and maintain'd, during ſo many Ages. They cannot ſhew a
Church, which has ever been, ſince JESUS CHRIST came to
build it on the Rock; and to ſave his Word, they are oblig'd
to have recourſe to a Church of the Predeſtinate, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
themſelves, nor any elſe can ſhew.</p>
            <p>But JESUS CHRIST would ſhew ſomething illuſtrious and
clear, when he ſaid, that his Church, maugre the Oppoſition
of Hell, ſhould be always invincible: he would, I ſay, ſhew
ſomething clear and reſplendent, which might ſerve in all
Ages for a ſenſible and palpable Aſſurance of the immutable
Certainty of his Promiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in effect, let us conſider, when he ſpake this Word:</hi>
Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. xvi. v. 18.</note> and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the
Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. <hi>'Twas, when having
askt his Apoſtles,</hi> Whom ſay ye, that I am? Peter <hi>in the Name
of them all anſwer'd him,</hi> Thou art CHRIST the Son of the
living GOD.</p>
            <p>Upon this illuſtrious Confeſſion of Faith, which Fleſh and
Blood had not dictated, but the Heavenly Father had reveal'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62471:9"/>
to <hi>Peter;</hi> upon this illuſtrious Confeſſion of Faith, I ſay, is
founded both St. <hi>Peters</hi> Dignity, and the Churches immoveable
Firmneſs. This Church, which confeſſes JESUS CHRIST
to be the true Son of GOD, is that, againſt which Hell ſhall
never prevail, and which ſhall ſubſiſt without Interruption, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
all the Efforts and Artifices of the Devil.</p>
            <p>It appears then clearly, that the Church, of which JESUS
CHRIST ſpeaks in this place, is a confeſſing Church, a Church,
that publiſhes the Faith, and conſequently an exterior and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Church. See alſo what he adds: <hi>And I will give unto thee
the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. v. 19.</note> 
               <hi>And whatſoever thou ſhalt
bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven: And whatſoever thou ſhalt
looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever is to be underſtood by theſe Words, whether
Preaching, Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, or the Miniſtery of Prieſts
in the Sacrament of Penance, as <hi>Catholics</hi> underſtand them,
'tis ſtill certain, That here is an exterior Miniſtery given to this
Church: 'Tis then this Church, which confeſſes the Faith, and
confeſſes it principally by the Mouth of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> 'Tis this
Church, that uſes the Miniſtery of the Keys: 'Tis ſhe, that
ſhall always be on the Earth, without Hells ever being able to
prevail againſt her.</p>
            <p>And becauſe JESUS CHRIST would have her alwaies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſubſiſt, he has cloth'd her with ſenſible Marks, which
are always to continue. For ſee, how he ſends his Apoſtles,
and what he ſays to 'em at his aſcending into Heaven: <hi>Go
ye therefore and teach all Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. xxviii. v. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>baptizing them in the Name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to
obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: And lo, I am
with you alway, even unto the end of the World:</hi> Teaching with
you, baptizing with you, inſtructing with you my Faithful to
obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exerciſing with you in my Church an exterior Miniſtery:
'Tis with you; 'Tis with thoſe, who ſhall ſucceed you; 'Tis
with the Society, aſſembled under their Conduct, that I ſhall
be from this preſent even to the Conſummation of the World;
alway; without Interruption: For there ſhall not be any one
Moment, in which I will leave you, but thô abſent in Body, I
will be always preſent by my Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Conſequence of this Word, St.</hi> Paul <hi>alſo tells us, that the
Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery ſhall laſt without any Diſcontinuance,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62471:10"/>
till the general Reſurrection.</hi> He that deſcended, is the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that aſcended up far above all Heavens,<note place="margin">Eph. iv. v. 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> that he might fill all
things. And he gave ſome, Apoſtles: and ſome, Prophets: and
ſome, Evangeliſts: and ſome, Paſtors and Teachers; for the perfecting
of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of
the Body of CHRIST: Till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the
Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of GOD, unto a perfect
Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of CHRIST;
<hi>That is to ſay, till we have attain'd the Perfection of JESUS
CHRIST, glorify'd in Body and Soul: This is the Term,
which GOD has ſet to the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> will not have the viſible Church
to be that, which is call'd JESUS CHRISTs Body: Which
is then that Body, where GOD has eſtabliſh'd <hi>ſome Apoſtles:
ſome Prophets: and ſome Paſtors and Teachers?</hi> Which is that
Body, where GOD has plac'd ſeveral Members, and different
Graces,<note place="margin">Rom. xii. v. 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The Grace of Miniſtery, the Grace of Teaching, the Grace
of Exhortation and Conſolation, the Grace of Ruling?</hi> Which, I
ſay, is that Body, if it be not the viſible Church?</p>
            <p>But that, which makes the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> unwilling to
acknowledge, that the Body of JESUS CHRIST, ſo much
recommended in the Scripture, can be the viſible Church, is
their being conſtrain'd to ſay, that the viſible Church ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ceaſes to be upon the Earth; and they have an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
to ſay, that JESUS CHRISTs Body is not always, for fear
of putting JESUS CHRIST once again to death.</p>
            <p>'Tis then without Difficulty this Aſſembly of Paſtors and
People; 'tis this Church compos'd of ſo many divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
by whom ſo many Holy Miniſteries are exteriorly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd;
'tis this that is called JESUS CHRISTs Body; 'twas
to this Body, aſſembled under the Miniſtery of Paſtors, that
he ſaid at his aſcending into Heaven; <hi>Lo, I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
even unto the end of the World.</hi> He then, that deſcended,
is the ſame that aſcended, to the end he might fill all things,
Heaven by his Perſon and his viſible Preſence, Earth by his
Spirit and his inviſible Aſſiſtance, both the one and the other
by his Truth and his Word. And, 'twas for to continue (at
his aſcent into Heaven) this Aſſiſtance, promis'd to his Church,
that he plac'd ſome Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome
Paſtors and Teachers: A thing, which muſt laſt till ſuch time,
as the Work of GOD is entirely accompliſh'd, till we are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62471:10"/>
all perfect Men, and till the whole Body of the Church be
arriv'd at the Fulneſs and Perfection of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Thus JESUS CHRISTs Work is eternal on the Earth. The
Church, founded on the Confeſſion of the Faith, ſhall always
be, and always confeſs the Faith: Her Miniſtery ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal:
She ſhall bind and looſe even to the end of the World,
Hell never being able to hinder her: ſhe ſhall never diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the Teaching of Nations: The Sacraments, that is, the
exterior Liveries, with which ſhe is clad, ſhall laſt for ever.
<hi>Teach and baptize the Nations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. xi. v. 26.</note> 
               <hi>and I ſhall be alway with you. As
often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the
Lords Death till he come.</hi> With the Supper ſhall laſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Faith, the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery, and the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
and interior Communion of the Faithful with JESUS
CHRIST, and of the Faithful amongſt themſelves, till ſuch
time as JESUS CHRIST comes. The duration of the Church,
and of the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery has no other Limits.</p>
            <p>'Tis not then only the Society of the Predeſtinate, that
ſhall ſubſiſt for ever; 'tis the viſible Body, in which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate
are included, which preaches to them, which teaches
them, which regenerates them by Baptiſm, which nouriſhes
them by the Euchariſt, which adminiſters to them the Keys,
which governs them and keeps them united under Diſcipline,
which forms JESUS CHRIST in them: 'Tis this viſible Body,
that ſhall ſubſiſt for ever.</p>
            <p>And 'tis for this reaſon, that in the Apoſtles Creed, where
the Grounds of the Faith are propos'd to our Belief, we are
at the ſame time taught to believe in the Father, and in the
Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and to believe the Holy <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi>
Church, and the Communion of Saints: The interior
Communion by Charity, and in the Holy Ghoſt, who ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
us, I acknowledge it; but at the ſame time alſo the
exterior Communion in the Sacraments, in the Confeſſion of
Faith, and in all the exterior Miniſtery of the Church.</p>
            <p>And all, that we have now ſaid, is included in this Word, <hi>I
believe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church.</hi> We believe her at all times;
ſhe is then always: We believe her at all times; ſhe always
then teaches the Truth.</p>
            <p>Your Miniſters will have us believe, that 'tis one thing to
believe the Church, that is, to believe, that ſhe is; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to believe or give credit to the Church, that is, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62471:11"/>
believe all her Deciſions. But this is a frivolous Diſtinction.
He, who believes, that the Church always is, believes, that ſhe
is always confeſſing and teaching the Truth. 'Tis to this
Church, which confeſſes the Truth, that JESUS CHRIST
has promis'd, Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her. The Truth
then ſhall never fail to be confeſs'd in her; and conſequently
in believing, that ſhe is, we are aſſur'd, that ſhe is always
credible.</p>
            <p>In effect, the retaining ſome Points of JESUS CHRIST's
Doctrine is not ſufficient to preſerve the Name of Church:
For then the <hi>Arians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi>
and the <hi>Socinians</hi> would be of the Church. They are
not however: GOD forbid, that we ſhould call this Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by the Name of Church! The Church muſt not then
only keep ſome Truth: She muſt keep and teach all Truth;
elſe ſhe is not the Church.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to any purpoſe to diſtinguiſh the fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
from the others. For all, that GOD has reveal'd, muſt
be retain'd. He has reveal'd nothing to us, that is not very
important for our Salvation.<note place="margin">Iſai. xlviii. v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Lord, which teacheth thee
profitable things.</hi> In the Faith then, which the Church teaches,
muſt be found the fulneſs of the Truths, reveal'd by GOD:
Otherwiſe ſhe is no longer the Church, that JESUS
CHRIST founded.</p>
            <p>That particular Perſons may be ignorant of ſome Articles,
I eaſily confeſs; but the Church conceals nothing of what
JESUS CHRIST has reveal'd: And therefore the Faithful,
who are ignorant of certain Articles in particular, confeſs them
nevertheleſs all in general, when they ſay: <hi>I believe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, ſaid I, is the Church, which your Miniſters know
not. They teach you, that this viſible and exterior Church
may ceaſe to be upon the Earth; they teach you, that ſhe
may err in her Deciſions; they teach you, that to believe this
Church, is to believe Men: But 'tis not in this manner, that
the Church is propos'd to us in the Creed. 'Tis there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to us to believe her, as we believe in the Father, and
in the Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore the Faith
of the Church is joyn'd with the Faith of the three Divine
Perſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe things having been ſaid at ſeveral times, but almoſt in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62471:11"/>
this Order, I added, that our Doctrin on this Point was ſo
true, that the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> who deny'd it, could not
wholly reject it: That is, their Synods acted in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as ſhew'd, that they requir'd (as well as we) an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Submiſſion to the Authority and Decrees of the Church.</p>
            <p>Here I let <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> ſee the four Acts of the
Gentlemen of the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> Religion, which I have
taken notice of in the Expoſition, Article XX. She had read
them there; but I cauſed her to read them in the very Book
of the Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt is taken out of the</hi> Vth. <hi>Chapter, Title of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories,
Article XXXI. Where 'tis ſaid,</hi> That Diſputes about
Doctrine ſhould be determin'd by GODs Word, if it might be in
the Conſiſtory; if not, the matter ſhould be brought before the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy,
thence to the Provincial Synod, and in fine to the National,
where the full and final Reſolution ſhould be made by GODs Word,
to which if any one refus'd to ſubmit with an expreſs diſclaiming of
his Errors, he ſhould be cut off from the Church.</p>
            <p>'Tis not then, ſaid I, to GODs Word alone preciſely, as
ſuch, that the full and final Reſolution belongs, ſince after it
is propos'd, an Appeal is permitted; but to GODs Word, in
as much as explicated and interpreted by the Churches laſt
Judgment.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Act is taken out of the Synod of <hi>Vitré,</hi> related
in the Book of the Diſcipline. It contains the Letter of Miſſion,
which all the Churches make, when they ſend Deputies to the
National Synod: See the Terms of it. <hi>We promiſe before
GOD to ſubmit our ſelves, to whatſoever ſhall be reſolv'd in your
Holy Aſſembly, being perſwaded, that GOD will preſide in it, and
guide you by his Holy Spirit in all Truth and Equity, thrô the
Rule of his Word.</hi> This Perſwaſion, ſaid I, if it be grounded
only on an human Preſumption, cannot be the matter of ſo
ſolemn an Oath, by which they ſwear to ſubmit to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
they do not yet know: It cannot then be founded but
upon an expreſs Promiſe, That the Holy Ghoſt will preſide in
the laſt Judgment of the Church; and <hi>Catholics</hi> ſay no more.</p>
            <p>The third Act, which is found alſo in the ſame Book of
the Diſcipline, is the Condemnation of the <hi>Independents</hi> on their
ſaying, That every Church ought to govern it ſelf <hi>without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on any one in Eccleſiaſtical Matters.</hi> This Propoſition
was in the Synod of <hi>Charenton</hi> declar'd <hi>as prejudicial to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62471:12"/>
State, as to the Church.</hi> 'Twas there judg'd, <hi>That it open'd the
Door to all ſorts of Irregularities and Extravagances, took away all
Remedies, and made way for the forming as many Religions, as
Pariſhes.</hi> But, ſaid I, whatever Synods are held, if we do not
believe our ſelves oblig'd to ſubmit our Judgments to them,
we cannot avoid the Inconveniences of the Independents, and
the leaving a Door open for the ſetting up as many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I do not ſay as there are Pariſhes, but as there are
Heads. We muſt then come to this Obligation of ſubmitting
our Judgment to what the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> teaches.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Acts are taken out of the Book of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
printed at <hi>Charenton</hi> in the year 1667.</p>
            <p>The fourth is found in a Book of Mr. <hi>Blondeſ</hi>'s, Intitled
<hi>Actes Autentiques,</hi> printed at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> by <hi>Blaeu</hi> in the year
1655.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Reſolution of the National Synod of <hi>Sainte Foy</hi> 1578.
which names four Miniſters to meet at an Aſſembly, where
was to be treated a Re-union with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> by framing a
<hi>Formulary of Profeſſion of the common Faith.</hi> Power was given
to theſe Miniſters <hi>to decide all Points of Doctrin and others, that
ſhould be brought into Deliberation, and to conſent to this Confeſſion of
Faith, even without communicating any farther about it with the
Churches, if the Time permitted not to do it.</hi> From this Act I
concluded two things: One, That the whole Synod truſted
their Faith in the Hands of four private Perſons, a thing far
more extraordinary, than to ſee particulars ſubmit to the
whole Church: The other, That the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> Church
is yet but little aſſur'd of her Confeſſion of Faith, ſince ſhe
conſents to the changing it, and that in Points ſo important,
as are thoſe, that make the Diſpute with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> one of
which is the Reality. If the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> hop'd, that
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would return to them, there was no need of a
new Confeſſion of Faith. What was then intended, was,
That both the one and the other continuing in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
there ſhould be fram'd a Confeſſion of Faith, in which
both Parties might agree; which could not be done without
adding or ſuppreſſing ſomething eſſential in a Confeſſion of
Faith, which they give us, as teaching only the pure Word
of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> acknowledged to me, that having ſeen
in my Treatiſe theſe Acts and my Reflections, which are the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62471:12"/>
ſame with theſe I now made, ſhe knew not what to anſwer
to 'em; and that therefore ſhe deſir'd to hear what Anſwer
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> would make, as well upon theſe Acts, as upon the
other Difficulties, that regarded the Authority of the
Church.</p>
            <p>I told her, That thô thoſe of her Religion acted, as holding
the Churches Authority infallible and indiſputable; yet 'twas
true, That they deny'd this Infallibility: and I added, That
'twas a conſtant Maxim in her Religion, That every private
Perſon, how ignorant ſoever, was oblig'd to believe, That he
could underſtand the Holy Scripture better than all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and all the reſt of the Church together. She ſeem'd aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
at this Propoſition. But I added, That there was yet
believ'd in her Religion ſomething far more ſtrange; which
was, That there is a Point of Time, when a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to doubt, whether the Scripture was inſpir'd by GOD;
whether the Goſpel is a Truth or a Fable; whether
JESUS CHRIST was a Deceiver, or a Teacher of the
Truth. When ſhe appear'd yet more amaz'd at this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I aſſur'd her, that both this and the other, I juſt before
mention'd, were neceſſary Conſequences of the Doctrin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in their Religion, concerning the Churches Authority;
and that I doubted not, but I could force Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> to own
'em.</p>
            <p>I declar'd to her the Reaſons of my Aſſertion, and ſhew'd
her at the ſame time what a Mark of Falſity 'twas amongſt
them, to ſee, how on one ſide they deny'd, that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
without examining, what the Church decided; and that
on the other they were fain, for the eſtabliſhing of Order, to
attribute to the Church the Authority, they had deny'd her.</p>
            <p>She let me know, that ſhe underſtood this Diſcourſe; and
that ſhe remembred, ſhe had read it in my Book; but that,
thô ſhe ſaw not any way to anſwer it, ſhe could ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but that 'twas anſwer'd in her Religion.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs <hi>de Roye</hi> came to tell her, that Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
who had promis'd to meet me the next day, could not do it,
having receiv'd a Prohibition. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> teſtify'd
a very great Diſcontent at this Proceeding. I would have
retir'd and left her with her Siſter; but ſhe requeſted me to
repeat what I had juſt before repreſented to her. I did it in a
few words, and anſwer'd ſome Objections, that were made me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62471:13"/>
The next Morning <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> came to my Houſe
with a worthy Perſon of her Religion, whom I knew, nam'd
Mr. <hi>Coton.</hi> She had made uſe of him to engage Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> to
the Conference, and he brought her word, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
had accepted it. She deſir'd me to repeat, what I had ſaid the
day before. I did ſo, and Mr. <hi>Coton</hi> confeſs'd, he knew not
what to anſwer, and that he had a great Paſſion to hear
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> upon this Point. He and <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> made
me ſome Objections concerning the frequent Revolts of the
People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had ſo often forſaken GOD, the <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>all the People,</hi> as the Holy Scripture ſpeaks; during which,
the publick Worſhip was ſo extinct, that <hi>Elijah</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the only Servant of GOD, till he learnt from GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he had <hi>reſerv'd to himſelf ſeven thouſand men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. xix. <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>which
had not bow'd the Knee unto</hi> Baal.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer'd, That for what regarded <hi>Elijah,</hi> there
was no difficulty, ſince 'twas apparent from the very words,
that it concern'd only <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where <hi>Elijah</hi> prophecy'd, and that
the Divine Worſhip was ſo far from being at that time extinct
in <hi>Juda,</hi> that 'twas there under the Reign of <hi>Joſaphat</hi> in the
greateſt luſtre, it had been ſince <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time. The thing
paſs'd for manifeſt, and I obſerv'd only, how little Sincerity
there was in the Miniſters to produce ſtill this paſſage, after
the Cardinal <hi>du Perron</hi> had given it ſo deciſive an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>As to what hapned in <hi>Juda</hi> it ſelf, I would yet make the
Objection ſtronger than they had propos'd it, by conſidering
the State of GODs People under <hi>Ahaz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. xvi. 2 Chron. xxviij.</note> who ſhut up the
Temple, caus'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah</hi> the Prieſt of the Lord to ſacrifice to
Idols, and fill'd all <hi>JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SALEM</hi> with Abominations;
and afterwards under <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. xxi. 2 Chron. xxxiij.</note> whoſe Impieties tranſcended
thoſe of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> But to ſhew, that all this made nothing to
the queſtion, I deſir'd 'em only to obſerve, that <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who
liv'd during all the Reign of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> for all theſe Abominations
of the King, of the Prieſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah,</hi> and almoſt all the People,
never ſeparated from the Communion of <hi>Juda,</hi> no more than
did the reſt of the Prophets, who liv'd at the ſame time, and
in all the other: which ſhews, that there is always a People
of GOD, from whoſe Communion 'tis never lawful to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>'Tis written alſo,<note place="margin">2 Kin. xxi. <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note> that in the time of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> GOD ſpake
by the Mouth of all his Prophets, and threatned this impious
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62471:13"/>
and all the People. But theſe Prophets, who reprehended and
deteſted the Impieties of this People, ſeparated not from the
Communion.</p>
            <p>And to ſee into the bottom of the Matter, we muſt, ſaid I,
conſider the Conſtitution of the ancient People. It had this
peculiar to it ſelf, that it was multiply'd by carnal Generation,
by which as well the Succeſſion of the People, as of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
was kept up; that this People bore in their Fleſh the
Mark of the Covenant, to wit, <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which we do not
read to have been ever diſcontinu'd; and ſo, thô the Prieſts,
and almoſt all the People ſhould have prevaricated, the State
of GODs People ſubſiſted always in its exterior form, whether
they would or no. Nor could there fall out any interruption in
the Prieſthood, which GOD had ty'd to <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family. But
'tis not ſo with the new People, whoſe exterior Form conſiſts
in nothing, but the Profeſſion of JESUS CHRISTs Doctrine:
ſo that if the Confeſſion of the true Faith ſhould be extinct
for one only Moment, the Church, which has no Succeſſion but
by the continuance of this Profeſſion, would be wholly extinct
without any poſſibility of ever riſing again either in its People, or
Paſtors, but by a new Miſſion.</p>
            <p>I added beſides, that I would not ſay, the true Faith and
true Worſhip of GOD could be wholly aboliſht in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that GOD had no more any true Servants on
Earth. But I find on the contrary, firſt that 'tis clear, that,
maugre the Corruption, GOD ſtill reſerv'd to himſelf a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Number of Servants, who participated not in the Idolatry.
For if it were ſo in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was ſchiſmatical and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from GODs People, as GOD himſelf declar'd to <hi>Elijah,</hi>
it muſt with far greater reaſon have been ſo in <hi>Judah,</hi> which
GOD had reſerv'd to himſelf for the perpetuating his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Kingdom till the Time of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is written, that the King and all the People had forſaken
GOD<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Law,</hi> it muſt not be underſtood of all the People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, but of a great Part, and perhaps of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Part, which the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Miniſters did not deny. Secondly, 'Tis
not to be imagin'd, that GODs Servants and the true Faith
were preſerv'd only in ſecret; but that in all the ſucceſſion
of the ancient People, the true Doctrine always ſhone forth.
For there was a continual Succeſſion of Prophets, who inſtead
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62471:14"/>
of adhering to the Peoples Errors, or diſſembling them, ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
up againſt them with force; and this Succeſſion was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
that the Holy Ghoſt fears not to ſay,<note place="margin">2 Chron. xxxvi. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> That GOD <hi>roſe
up night and morning, and daily admoniſht the People by the Mouth
of his Prophets:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. xi. <hi>v.</hi> 7. xxv. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4.</note> the forcibleſt expreſſion, that can be imagin'd,
to ſhew, that the true Faith was never ſo much as one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without Publication, nor the People without advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And that 'twas ſo, we juſt now ſaw, how in all the
Reign of <hi>Ahaz, Iſaiah</hi> ceas'd not to propheſy: and under <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi>
when the Abomination ſeem'd to be mounted to the
higheſt, ſince neither the Penitence of that King, nor the
Holineſs of his Grandchild <hi>Joſiah</hi> could revoke the Sentence
given againſt this People, GOD always remembring the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations
of <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> in this time, I ſay, we have ſeen,
that GOD made his Prophets ſpeak; and that a great part of
the People publickly follow'd them, appears, in that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Prince fill'd <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>innocent Blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. xxi. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note> a certain ſign,
that he found a great reſiſtance to his Idolatries. 'Tis alſo held,
that he caus'd <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to be put to Death, as his Predeceſſors
had done the other Prophets, who reprehended them; and
this Hiſtory is conſerv'd in the ancient Tradition, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Word of our Lord, who upbraids the <hi>Jows</hi> with
having <hi>kill'd the Prophets,</hi> and to the Diſcourſe of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
who ſays,<note place="margin">Mat. xxiii. <hi>v.</hi> 31, 37. Act. vii. <hi>v.</hi> 52.</note> That <hi>there was not any Prophet but they perſecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Prophets made a part of GODs People; theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
kept a conſiderable part both of the Prieſts and People
in their Duty; theſe Prophets, who confirm'd their Miſſion
by viſible Miracles, hindred the Corruption from gaining all;
and whilſt a terrible Multitude, and perhaps the Groſs of the
Synagogue was drawn unto Idolatry, they kept the Tradition
of the Truth in the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who appear'd a little after, ſhews it, when he ſpeaks
of the <hi>Prieſts the Levites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. xliv. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>the Sons of</hi> Zadok, <hi>that kept the charge
of the Sanctuary, when the Children of Iſrael went aſtra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. They,</hi>

ſhall ſtand before me to offer unto me the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the Blood, ſaith
the Lord GOD.</hi> This Succeſſion, not only that of the Fleſh,
but alſo that of the Faith and the Miniſtery, was conſerv'd in
thoſe Prieſts and theſe <hi>Levites,</hi> whom GODs Grace and the
Prophet's Preaching had retain'd in the Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62471:14"/>
And 'tis to be obſerv'd, That GOD never made this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
of the Prophets more illuſtrious, than when Impiety
ſeem'd to have gain'd the upper hand; ſo that in the time
when the ordinary means of inſtructing the People was not
deſtroy'd, but obſcur'd, GOD prepar'd the extraordinary
and miraculous Means.</p>
            <p>To this may be added, That this extraordinary Means, to
wit, the Prophetical Miniſtery, was before the Captivity in a
manner ordinary with GODs People, where the Prophets
made as 'twere an Order always ſubſiſting, whence GOD
continually drew Divine Men, by whoſe Mouth he ſpake
loudly and publickly to all his People.</p>
            <p>From the Return of the Captivity to JESUS CHRIST,
there was no more any publick and laſting Idolatry. We
know what hapned under <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Illuſtrious; but we know
alſo the Zeal of <hi>Mattathias,</hi> and the great number of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
that joyn'd to his Houſe, with the famous Victories
of <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> and his Brethren; under them and their
Succeſſors the Profeſſion of the true Faith continu'd to JESUS
CHRIST. At laſt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> introduc'd into the Religion
and Worſhip many Superſtitions. As the Corruption was
about to prevail, JESUS CHRIST appear'd in the World.</p>
            <p>'Till his coming the Religion was preſerv'd, the Doctors
of the Law had many pernicious Maxims and Practices, which
crept in and got ground by little and little: they became
common, but they were not paſs'd into Doctrines of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.
Wherefore JESUS CHRIST alſo ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. xxiii. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Scribes and
the Phariſees ſit in Moſes Seat, All therefore whatſoever they bid
you obſerve, that obſerve and do; but do not ye after their Works.</hi>
He ceas'd not to honour the Miniſtery of the Prieſts: He ſent
the Lepers to 'em according to the Preſcript of the Law:
He frequented the Temple, and reprehending the Abuſes,
continud always joyn'd to the Communion of GODs People,
and the Order of the Publick Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>In fine, the time of the Fall and Reprobation of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
People, foretold by the Scriptures and Prophets, came,
when the Synagogue condemn'd <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> and
his Doctrine. But then <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> had appear'd,
he had begun in the Boſom of the Synagogue to aſſemble
his Church, which was to ſubſiſt for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62471:15"/>
'Tis then manifeſt, firſt, That there was always a viſible
Body of GODs People, continu'd by an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
from the Communion of whom 'twas never lawful to
ſeparate. Secondly, Always a Succeſſion of High Prieſts and
Prieſts deſcended from <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> iſſued from <hi>Levi;</hi>
ſo that there was never any need of GODs raiſing up People
in an extraordinary manner. Thirdly, 'Tis no leſs evident,
That the true Faith has always been publickly declar'd, and
that there cannot be any one moment aſſign'd, in which the
Profeſſion of it has not been as clear as the Light of the Sun:
a thing, which ſhews, how much they are deceiv'd, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that, for to keep up the exterior State of the Church, 'tis
ſufficient, that one can name from time to time pretended
Teachers of the Truth. For if there be any Time, that the
Profeſſion of Faith has ceas'd in the Church, her Condition is
ſo much worſe than that of the Synagogue, as ſhe loſes from
that moment the Succeſſion, as I erewhile ſaid.</p>
            <p>After I had ſpoken theſe things, there was ſome time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in paſſing them over again: and in the mean time the
Counteſs <hi>de Roye</hi> came to tell us, That Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> conſented
to the Conference, which, if I lik'd it, ſhould be at her Houſe
about Three a Clock.</p>
            <p>I Was at the Rendez-vous,<note place="margin">II. <hi>The</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> where I met Mr. <hi>Claude.</hi> We
began by mutual Civilities, and he on his part teſtify'd a great
Reſpect. After this, I entred into the Matter, by demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Explication of the four Acts, tranſcrib'd in my
Book, and mention'd here before.</p>
            <p>After I had in few words explain'd the Difficulty, as it is
propos'd in the <hi>Expoſition,</hi> and repeated, what I had ſaid to
<hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras,</hi> I added, That Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ought to be
ſo much the more ready to anſwer it, in that what I ſaid, was
not at all new to him, ſince in all appearance the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of
the <hi>Expoſition</hi> had faln into his hands; and that 'twas a great
ſatisfaction, in an Entertainment of the Nature of this, to be
aſſur'd, there would be no Surpriſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> took up the Diſcourſe, and having reiterated all
his former Civilities in terms yet more obliging, he declar'd at
firſt, that all I had objected from their Diſcipline and Synods
in my Treatiſe, and alſo at preſent, was very ſincerely rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62471:15"/>
without any alteration of the Words: But for the Senſe
he deſired Leave to tell me, That, thô there were, as I had
obſerved, divers Degrees eſtabliſht in the Juriſdiction, the force
of the Deciſion ought wholly to be refer'd to GODs Word
alone. As to what I objected, That GODs Word had been
propos'd in the Conſiſtory, from which one might appeal,
whence it follow'd, as I inferr'd, that the laſt Deciſion, from
which there was no more appealing, belong'd to GODs
Word, not taken in it ſelf, but inaſmuch as declar'd by the
Churches laſt Judgment: This was not their Intent; for they
held, That the Deciſion wholly appertain'd to GODs Word
alone, which the Church in her Aſſemblies both firſt and laſt
did but ſhew and point to: But that theſe divers Degrees had
been eſtabliſht to give thoſe, who err'd, leiſure to bethink
themſelves. Wherefore they proceeded not at firſt by Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
the Conſiſtory hoping, that a greater Aſſembly,
ſuch as the Colloquy might be, and afterwards the Provincial
Synod, compos'd of a greater number of Perſons, perhaps
more reſpected, or at leaſt leſs ſuſpected by the Gain-ſayer,
would diſpoſe him to hear the Truth. That the Colloquy
and the Provincial Synod us'd like Moderation thrô the ſame
Reaſon of Charity; but after the National Synod had ſpoken,
as 'twas the laſt human Remedy, there was no longer any
thing to be hop'd, and that they proceeded alſo to the laſt
Sentence, by making uſe of Excommunication, as the laſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the Eccleſiaſtical Power. That 'twas not thence to be
concluded, that the National Synod held it ſelf any more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
than the precedent Aſſemblies; but only, that, after
all had been try'd, they came to the laſt Remedy.</p>
            <p>That for the Promiſe made before the National Synod, 'twas
founded only on the Hopes they had, that the Aſſembly
would follow GODs Word, and that the Holy Ghoſt would
preſide in it, which ſignify'd not, that there was an entire Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty;
and beſides that the Word, <hi>being perſuaded,</hi> was an
honeſt manner of expreſſing a Condition without weakning the
Reverence of ſo great an Aſſembly, or the favorable Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
that ought to be had for their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>As to the Condemnation of the <hi>Independents,</hi> he pray'd me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
obſerve, that touching the Authority of the Church and
her Aſſemblies, there was ſomething, in which thoſe of his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62471:16"/>
Religion agreed with us, and ſomething, in which they agreed
with the <hi>Independents:</hi> With us, That Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies
are neceſſary and uſeful, and that ſome Subordination muſt be
eſtabliſht: With the <hi>Independents,</hi> That theſe Aſſemblies, how
numerous ſoever, are not therefore Infallible. This being ſo,
they were oblig'd to condemn the <hi>Independents,</hi> who deny'd not
only the Infallibility, but alſo the Utility and Neceſſity of theſe
Aſſemblies, and this Subordination. 'Tis in this, ſaid he, that
<hi>Independency</hi> conſiſts. He added, That to maintain it, was in
effect to overthrow Order, and make way for as many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
as there were Pariſhes, becauſe all means of Agreeing
were taken away by it. Whence he concluded, That thô
they agreed Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies not to be Infallible Means,
yet 'twas ſufficient for the maintaining of them, and condemning
the <hi>Independents,</hi> that they were uſeful ones.</p>
            <p>For the Synod of <hi>Sainte Foy,</hi> the Matter there agitated was
either to render the <hi>Lutherans</hi> more tractable by making them,
ſaid he, approach to us; or however to eſtabliſh a mutual
Toleration; which oblig'd us not to ſuppreſs any thing in,
or add any thing to the Confeſſion of Faith, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
held for unalterable. And that beſides, thô full Power
was given to four Miniſters, yet I well knew, that ſuch Acts
were always ſubject to Ratification, in caſe the Proxies went
beyond their Inſtructions: Witneſs the Ratifications neceſſary
in the Treaties, agreed by the Plenipotentiaries of Princes,
and other like Examples, in which there is always a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to obtain the Princes Ratification, a Condition, which,
without being expreſt, is naturally fixt to ſuch Procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>After he had ſaid theſe things in a Diſcourſe of ſufficient
length, very clear, and well compos'd, he added, That he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
me ſo equitable, as to acknowledge willingly, that, as
in things, in which I ſhould be to explain to him our Sentiments
and our Councels, 'twould be fit, he ſhould acquieſce in what
I ſhould tell him of them, ſo 'twas no leſs juſt, I ſhould reſt
ſatisfy'd with his Explication of the Articles of their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and Sentiments of their Religion, it being certain, that
there was no other amongſt 'em, but what he had now decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62471:16"/>
I reply'd to this Expreſſion, that, what he ſaid, would be
true, if it concern'd only the Explication of their Rites, if this
Word might be us'd, and the manner of their Adminiſtring
the Word or Sacraments, or holding of Synods; that in this I
ſhould believe him, as better Inſtructed; but that here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
it had hapned to them, as it does to all thoſe, who are
in Error; that is, to fall into Contradiction, and be forc'd to
ſet up, what they had deny'd. That I knew, they deny'd any
Obligation of ſubmittingto the Churches Judgment without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
it; but that at the ſame time I pretended this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Church to be ſo neceſſary, that even thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
it in Speculation, could not forbear eſtabliſhing it in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
if they would keep any Order amongſt them. Beſides that, if
the Queſtion were here about ſhewing any Contradiction in the
Sentiments of the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church, I ſhould not pretend to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to receive the Explication, I ſhould give him of her
Sentiments and her Councels, but that it ſhould then be free
for him to draw from their Words ſuch Inference, as he
pleas'd; and I thought, he would not refuſe me as much, to
which he conſented without Difficulty.</p>
            <p>I had no Deſign to inſiſt much on the Synod of <hi>Sainte Foy,</hi>
which would, I thought, caſt me too far from the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
the Acknowledgment of which I aim'd to draw from
him. I only therefore anſwer'd, That I yielded to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he alledg'd concerning the neceſſity of a Ratification, thô
in matters of Faith ſuch Powers and Truſts were alittle Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
and beſides, I was willing to believe, that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
had no Deſign, the Deputies ſhould overturn all. But that,
which toucht me, and which he ſeem'd not to have anſwer'd,
was. That the Synod had doubted of their Confeſſion of Faith,
ſince they permitted the making of another; and I ſaw not, how
this agreed, with what they farther told us, That this Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
contain'd nothing but the pure Word of GOD, in which
every one knows, that there is nothing to be chang'd. As to
what he ſaid, That their Aim was only to reduce the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
to more equitable Sentiments, or however to eſtabliſh a
mutual Toleration, two things gainſay'd it. 1. That there
was mention of a Power to decide all Points of Doctrin:
Which manifeſtly concern'd the Reality, whence the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
would never recede. 2. That to ſettle a mutual Toleration
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62471:17"/>
there was no need of framing a Confeſſion of common Faith,
but only of Eſtabliſhing this Toleration by a Synodal Decree, as
had been done at <hi>Charenton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> anſwer'd, that the Point of Doctrin to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
was, Whether a mutual Toleration might be eſtabliſht,
and that the Confeſſion of common Faith would have done
nothing elſe, but declar'd this Toleration: Which he deny'd
not but it might be done in a Synod, as I muſt grant, that it
might alſo be done in a Confeſſion of Faith, where there
ſhould have been an expreſs Article to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer'd him, That this could never be call'd a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of common Faith; and askt him, Whether he thought
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or they, ſhould have retrench'd any thing of
what the one ſaid for the Reality, and the other againſt it. He
anſwer'd me, No. And then, ſaid I, each party would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
in the Terms of their own Confeſſion of Faith, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
common but the Article of Toleration. There were, ſaid
he, many other Points, in which we agreed. 'Tis granted, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
I; but 'twas not about theſe Points, the Accord
was to be made: the Queſtion was about the Reality, and
ſome others, on which there could not be made a Confeſſion
of common Faith, except one of the Parties chang'd, or both
agreed upon ambiguous Expreſſions, which each might draw
to their own Opinions; a thing, that had been oft attempted,
as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> himſelf could not but owne. He granted it, and
related alſo the Aſſembly of <hi>Marbourg,</hi> and ſome others, held
for that purpoſe. I concluded then, That I had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the Synod of <hi>Sainte Foy</hi> had a like Deſign, and that
'twould have been to mock the World to call that a Confeſſion
of common Faith, which ſhould have made appear ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
oppoſitions on ſo important Points of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.
To which I farther added, 'twas ſo much the more
certain, That a Confeſſion of Faith was, as I ſaid, really in
agitation, in that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> having already ſeveral times
declar'd againſt a Toleration, there was nothing to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them, but by the Means, of which I ſpake. The
Matter reſted there; and I only ſaid, That every one need
but conſider, what he ought to think in his Conſcience of
a Confeſſion of Faith, which a whole National Synod had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to change.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62471:17"/>
When Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> was ſaying, That the Oath of ſubmitting
to the National Synod included a Condition, I had interrupted
him by putting in a word. Yes, ſaid I, they hop'd well of the
Synod, yet without certainty; and expecting the Event, they
forbare not to ſwear, they would ſubmit. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> telling
me here, That I interrupted him, and praying me to let him
ſay all, I held my peace. But after the Affair of <hi>Sainte Foy</hi>
was diſcuſs'd, I ſaid to him, That I thought it neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we paſs'd any farther, I ſhould tell him in a few words, what
I had conceiv'd of his Doctrin, to the end we might not ſpeak
in the air. I ſaid then to him; You ſay, Sir, That theſe
Words, <hi>Being perſuaded, that GOD will preſide in it, and guide
you by his Holy Spirit in all Truth and Equity, thrô the Rule of his
Word,</hi> are only an honeſt manner of propoſing a Condition.
He agreed it. Let us then, ſaid I, reduce the Propoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a conditional one, and we ſhall ſee, what will be the ſenſe
of it. I ſwear to ſubmit to all you ſhall decide, on this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
or Condition, That, what you ſhall decide, be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to GODs Word. Such an Oath is nothing elſe but a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Illuſion, as ſignifying nothing, and being but what I might
make to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> or he to me. But in this there would
not be any thing ſerious; and 'tis to be obſerv'd, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more particular muſt be aim'd at, ſince this Oath is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made to the Synod, which gives the final determination;
thô in Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Senſe there were as much Reaſon to make
it to the Conſiſtory, to which they ought to ſubmit, as well
as to the Synod, ſuppoſing, it has the Word of GOD for its
Guide.</p>
            <p>In this place I held my peace a little, and ſeeing, that there
was not a word ſaid, I went on thus. But in fine then, Sir, if
I well underſtand your Doctrin, you believe, That a private
perſon may doubt of the Churches Judgment, even when ſhe
gives her final Determination. No, Sir, anſwer'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> 'tis
not to be ſaid, That one may doubt, there being all the
Likelihood in the World, that the Church will judge well.
He, that ſays Likelihood, Sir, reply'd I immediatly, ſays a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Doubt. But, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> There is more: for JESUS
CHRIST having promis'd, that thoſe who would ſeek, ſhould
find; ſince 'tis to be preſum'd, they will ſeek well, 'tis to be
alſo believ'd, they will judge well, and in this aſſurance there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62471:18"/>
is ſomething indubitable. But when there ſhall be ſeen in
Councels Cabals, Factions, different Intereſts, it may with
reaſon be doubted, Whether in ſuch an Aſſembly there will
not be mixt ſomething human and doubtful. Pray, Sir, ſaid I,
let us ſet aſide what is good for nothing but to throw duſt in
ones Eyes. All, you ſay of Cabals, Factions, Intereſts, is
abſolutely to no purpoſe, and conſequently ſerves only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex.
There is nothing, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> more to the purpoſe.
And I affirm, anſwer'd I, That your ſelf will grant, there's
nothing leſs to the purpoſe. For I ask you, Sir, Suppoſing
there ſhould appear in the Councel neither Factions nor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals;
ſuppoſing alſo one were aſſur'd, that there were not any,
and that all paſs'd in Order, muſt one receive the Deciſion
without examining it? He was fain to anſwer, No. Whence
I immediatly concluded: I had then reaſon to ſay, That all,
you alledg'd, as very conſiderable, concerning Factions and
Cabals, was in the bottom only an Amuſement; and in fine,
that a private perſon, a Woman, any ignorant Fellow, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is, may believe, and ought to believe, that he may
happen to underſtand GODs Word better than a whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
thô aſſembled from the four quarters of the World; and
than all the reſt of the Church. Yes, ſaid he, 'tis ſo. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
twice or thrice the Propoſition, he had granted, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſtill ſome ſtronger Circumſtance; but evidently contain'd,
in what was accorded. What, ſaid I, better than all the reſt
of the Church together, and than all her Aſſemblies, thô
compos'd of the holieſt and moſt illuminated perſons in the
Univerſe? For all theſe are ſtill but men, after whom, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your Doctrin, every one ought ſtill to examin. A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon ſhall believe, that he may have more Grace, more
Light; in fine, more of the Holy Ghoſt than all the
reſt of the Church! All this muſt paſs; and I might have
added, more than all the Fathers, more than all the paſt Ages,
reckoning immediatly from the Apoſtles times. But, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I, if it be ſo, how do you avoid the Inconveniences of the
<hi>Independents;</hi> and what Means has the Church left to hinder the
being of as many Religions, I do not ſay, as there are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
but as there are Heads? We have, ſaid he, Synods,
which are Means to hinder ſo great Evils, Means not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
but nevertheleſs profitable, as I have ſaid. For thô a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62471:18"/>
Paſtor, that preaches, is not infallible, his Miniſtery ceaſes not
to be profitable, becauſe he declares the Truth. But a great
Aſſembly, compos'd of more perſons, and thoſe of greater
Learning, will yet better make this Declaration. Methinks,
Sir, reply'd I, That you refer all to Inſtruction: but this is
not preciſely either the Intention or Inſtitution of Synods; for
oftentimes one underſtanding private Perſon will give more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
than a whole Synod together. What muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a Synod, is not ſo much Inſtruction, as a Deciſion
by Authority, to which there is a neceſſity of yielding: for
this is, what both the ignorant, who doubt, and the proud,
who contradict, ſtand in need of. An ignorant private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if you leave him to himſelf, will confeſs to you, that he
knows not, on what to reſolve; and far from abating Pride in
a Synod, you carry it to its higheſt Point, ſince you oblige a
private perſon to believe, that he can underſtand the Scripture
better than the Synod, and all the reſt of the Church: and
the Synod it ſelf, thô aſſembled from the whole Church, being
askt by him, whoſe Faith it examins, whether he is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to examin after the Synod, and whether it may not ſo
fall out, that he, thô a private perſon, may underſtand the
Scripture, better than all the Paſtors aſſembled, the Synod, thô
univerſal, muſt, according to your Doctrin, declare, That
without doubt he may. Preſumption, Sir, cannot go higher.
And obſerve, if you pleaſe, that theſe Aſſemblies, which you
propoſe as profitable Means, are no longer ſo, when every
one may believe, that he has a better, and the only one, that
can ſecure him, to wit, that of examining by himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
only his own Judgment. This, Sir, is perfect <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;</hi>
for the <hi>Independents</hi> neither refuſe to hold Synods for
their mutual Inſtruction, nor to receive theſe Synods, when
they find, that theſe Synods ſay well. You know, they have
held ſome. He acknowledg'd, they had held one, to frame
their Confeſſion of Faith. I matter not, reply'd I, whether
one, or more; they do not then abſolutely reject them, and
they reject in them preciſely no more, than you do, which is
the obligation of ſubmitting to them without examining. And
upon this, to reduce my ſelf in few words, ſee, what was my
Argument. The <hi>Independents</hi> are very willing to have Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Aſſemblies for Inſtruction; all, they will not have, is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62471:19"/>
the authoritative Deciſion, which you will no more have than
they: you are then wholly conformable, and you ought not to
have condemn'd them. You ſee not then, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
That we deny not, but there is an Authority in Synods, ſuch
an one as the Paternal Authority, ſuch an one as the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Magiſtrates, ſuch an one as the Authority, a Maſter
has over his Scholar, and a Paſtor ovr his Flock; all theſe
Authorities have their uſe, and are not to be rejected under
pretence, That the Fathers, Magiſtrates and Maſters may be
deceiv'd: 'tis the ſame then with the Authority of the Church.
But, Sir, anſwer'd I, the <hi>Independents</hi> deny not the Authority
of Magiſtrates, nor the Authority of Maſters over their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
nor that of Paſtors over their Flocks. They have Paſtors,
Sir, for whom they require no leſs than you, that there ſhould
be ſome Deference had; and much more will they not deny,
but it ought to be had for a whole Synod. If then you accuſe
them of denying the Authority of Synods, you muſt add
ſomething to what they believe, and there is nothing to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but what we believe, which is, That we muſt ſubmit to
them without examining.</p>
            <p>After this, for a little time we did nothing on both ſides but
repeat the ſame things. Which having caus'd Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
I ſaid to him, In fine, Sir, we ſhould diſpute without end;
every one has nothing more to do, but to examin in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and before GOD, whether he thinks himſelf capable
to underſtand the Scripture better than all Councels, and
all the reſt of the Church, and how ſuch an Opinion can
agree with the Docility and Humility of GODs Children. I
inculcated in few words, what a Pride it was for one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he could underſtand GODs Word better than all the
reſt of the Church, and how after this, nothing hindred the
being of as many Religions, as there are Heads.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> here told me, he wonder'd, this Propoſition ſhould
appear ſo ſtrange to me, That a private perſon might believe,
he might happen to underſtand the Holy Scripture better than
the whole Church aſſembled; That the Caſe had hapned, and
he could give me many Examples of it: The firſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> where the Word <hi>Conſubſtantial</hi> was rejected,
and <hi>Arianiſm</hi> ſet up. I interrupted him, ſaying: Whither do
you carry us, Sir? From the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> you will
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62471:19"/>
bring us to the falſe Councel of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to the Councel of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> to that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> to that of <hi>Trent:</hi> When ſhall we
have done, if we muſt here paſs over all theſe Councels? I
declare to you, that I will not engage my ſelf in this Diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſince our Queſtion may be determin'd by ſomething more
preciſe. But becauſe you have mention'd the Councel of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi>
tell me, Sir, I beſeech you, whether the Fathers of that
Councel continu'd long in this erroneous Deciſion?<note place="margin">I ought to have ſaid <hi>equivocal</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> rather than <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</hi>
               </note> I believe
indeed, Sir, ſaid he,, That they quickly return'd. Say, ſay,
Sir, anſwer'd I, that, aſſoon as the Emperor <hi>Conſtantius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
Protector of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and Perſecutor of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
had permitted them to retire, theſe Biſhops complain'd
aloud of the Violence and Surpriſe, that had been put upon
'em. Oblige me not, Sir, to relate this Story, which you
know as well as I, and acknowledge, That 'tis unjuſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a Councel, manifeſtly pack'd, with Aſſemblies held cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically,
and according to Order. Ha, Sir, reply'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
do not we ſay, That the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was neither free nor
canonical? You ſay it, Sir, and we deny it; and that is not
the Queſtion of this Diſpute. The preſent Queſtion is, to
know, whether you can avoid <hi>Independency;</hi> and whether there
be in your Doctrin any Remedy againſt this inſupportable
Preſumption of a private perſon, who muſt believe, according
to your Principles, that he can underſtand the Scripture better
than the beſt aſſembled and beſt held univerſal Councels, and
than all the reſt of the Church together. Let us leave then,
if you will, the Council of <hi>Ariminum;</hi> ſee here another indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Example: 'Tis the Judgment of the Synagogue, when
it condemn'd JESUS CHRIST, and conſequently declar'd,
that he was not the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> promis'd by the Prophets. Tell
me, Sir, would not a private perſon, who ſhould then have
believ'd our Lord to be the true CHRIST, have judg'd better,
than all the reſt of the Synagogue together? See then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable
Caſe, in which one may without Preſumption do,
what you think ſo preſumptuous. In effect, proceeded he,
'tis no Preſumption, not to give to the Church, what belongs
only to GOD alone. We cannot give him any thing greater,
than to believe him blind-fold, as you would have us believe the
Church. But you know, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at leaſt as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd
as the Church, forbears not to declare to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62471:20"/>
That he <hi>will not have Dominion over their Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. i. 23.</note> The Church
ought yet leſs to do it than he. We muſt not then believe
her ſimply on her Word; we muſt examin after her, and
make uſe of our Reaſon, as thoſe of <hi>Beraea</hi> did, who examin'd
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Acts xvii. v. 11.</note> to ſee, whether the things were there, as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> had preacht them.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> held his Peace, Here, ſaid I, are many
things: But we muſt firſt take in hand this indiſputable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
you have propos'd to us. Upon this I remonſtrated to
him, That the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church had great Priviledges above
the Synagogue, even conſidering the Synagogue in the time
of its greateſt Glory: But not to mention this, 'twas a ſtrange
thing to compare the Synagogue falling, at the very Moment,
when its Hardning and Reprobation was clearly markt by the
Prophets, with the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, which was never to fall.
But in fine, Sir, reply'd he, one might have then made to this
private Perſon the ſame Argument, you make to us. To al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Prophets was to no purpoſe, for 'twas concerning
the Application of theſe Prophecies to JESUS CHRIST,
that the Synagogue doubted. Thus a private Perſon could
no more believe in JESUS CHRIST, without believing
at the ſame time, that he underſtood the Scripture better than
all the Synagogue; and this is the Argument, you make to
us.</p>
            <p>There were but few People at the Conference, and they
were all <hi>Hugonots,</hi> except the Mareſchalleſs <hi>De Lorge.</hi> I ſaw
two of theſe Gentlemen look on one another at this place with
Complacence. I was toucht, that a Reaſoning, ſo viſibly ill,
ſhould make ſuch an Impreſſion on theſe Spirits; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
GOD to grant me the Grace, that I might by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that ſhould be clear, deſtroy the odious Compariſon,
which was made of his always well-beloved Church with the
faithleſs Synagogue at that very Moment, he had aſſign'd for
her Divorce.</p>
            <p>You ſay then, Sir, ſaid I to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> that the Argument
I make, may authoriſe the Error of thoſe private Perſons, who
condemn'd JESUS CHRIST on the Faith of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
and on the contrary condemn thoſe of Preſumption,
who believ'd JESUS CHRIST alone before the whole Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.
Yes, Sir, ſaid he, the thing is ſo, repeating his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62471:20"/>
afreſh. Let us ſee then, ſaid I, whether my Argument
has this unhappy Conſequence. It conſiſts, Sir, in ſaying, That,
the Churches Authority being deny'd, there is no longer any
exterior Means, which GOD can make uſe of to diſſipate the
Doubts of the Ignorant, and inſpire neceſſary Humility into
the Faithful. To the end ſuch an Argument may be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the time, when JESUS CHRIST was condemn'd, it
muſt be ſaid, that there was not then any exterior Means, any
certain Authority, to which one ought neceſſarily to ſubmit.
Now, Sir, who can ſay this, ſince JESUS CHRIST was upon
the Earth, that is, the Truth it ſelf, which appear'd viſibly in
the midſt of Men, the Eternal Son of GOD, to whom a
Voice from on high bare Witneſs before all the People,<note place="margin">Matt. iii. v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>This
is my well-beloved Son, hear ye him;</hi> who, to confirm his Miſſion,
rais'd the Dead, heal'd thoſe that were born blind, and wrought
ſo many Miracles, that the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves confeſs'd, never any
Man had done the like? There was then, Sir, an exterior
Means, a viſible Authority. But 'twas conteſted: 'Tis true,
but 'twas infallible. I do not pretend, Sir, that the Churches
Authority ſhould never be conteſted; I hear you, you, Sir, who
conteſt it: But I ſay, it ought not to be ſo by <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> I
ſay, That ſhe is Infallible; I ſay, That there never was any
time, when there was not on the Earth a viſible and ſpeaking
Authority, to which Men were oblig'd to ſubmit. Before
JESUS CHRIST we had the Synagogue; when the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
was to fail, JESUS CHRIST himſelf appear'd, when
JESUS CHRIST retir'd, he left his Church, to which he ſent
his Holy Spirit. Bring again JESUS CHRIST teaching,
preaching, working Miracles, I have no longer need of the
Church; but alſo take from me the Church, I muſt have
JESUS CHRIST in Perſon, ſpeaking, preaching, deciding
with Miracles, and an infallible Authority. But you have his
Word. Yes we have without doubt a Word Holy and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but ſuch an one, as ſuffers it ſelf to be explicated and
manag'd, how one will, and makes no Reply to thoſe, that
miſunderſtand it. I ſay, we muſt have an exterior Means of
reſolving Doubts, and this Means muſt be certain. And not
to go over again the Reaſons, already alledg'd, now there is
nothing elſe requir'd but to anſwer your Objection concerning
the Error of the Synagogue, I aver, you are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62471:21"/>
able to ſay, That there was not then a certain exterior
Means, or ſpeaking Authority, to which Men were oblig'd
to ſubmit their Judgments, that you muſt avow, there was one,
the higheſt, and moſt infallible, that ever was, which is that
of JESUS CHRIST; and ſo that there was never any time,
when the Argument, I uſe againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> could leſs be
made, which is, That they want an exterior infallible Means
to determine Doubts about the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>After I had ſaid this, I perceiv'd, there was no Reply to be
made me. In effect, There was not a Word ſaid to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, thô I held my Peace, to hear what Anſwer would be
made.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſtood ſilent, 'tis an Effect not
much to be expected in Conferences of this nature. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
ſomething of what he had already ſaid, and inſiſted
afreſh on what the Apoſtle himſelf had declar'd, That he had
not Dominion over the Conſciences.</p>
            <p>I was glad, that he return'd to this Paſſage, which I had
an intent of Explicating at firſt; but was fain to go to what
was moſt preſſing, which was the Example of the Synagogue.
This being done, I only askt Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> whether the Apoſtles
Meaning, when he ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians, We have not Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over your Faith,</hi> was, that they muſt examin after him.
He ſaw well, that it was not, and confeſt it. I concluded,
Nor does the Church, Sir, pretend to have Dominion over
the Faith, when ſhe requires us to believe it in her Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
becauſe ſhe gives not this Authority to her ſelf, no more
than St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, but to the Holy Ghoſt, who inſpires her.
You equal then, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Author of the
Revelation, the Church, which is but the bare Interpreter.
No, Sir, reply'd I, I equal not the Church to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but
I ſay, that to pretend, one ought to be Believ'd without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining,
when one thinks to act only as an Inſtrument, of
which the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe, is not to have Dominion
over the Conſcience, as the Example of St. <hi>Paul</hi> demonſtrates.
Beſides, I pretend not to equal the Churches Authority to the
Apoſtolical. The Apoſtles were Authors of the Revelation,
as you have very well ſaid; that is, they firſt receiv'd the
Truths, which it pleas'd GOD to reveal: The Church is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Interpreter and Depoſitary. But ſaving this eſſential
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62471:21"/>
Difference between the Apoſtles and the Church, I ſay, That
the Church is as much inſpir'd to Interpret, as the Apoſtles were
to Eſtabliſh; and that holding the Grace of Interpretation from
the ſame Spirit, which gave the firſt Revelation to the Apoſtles,
ſhe no more exerciſes Dominion over the Conſciences in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting,
than the Apoſtles did in Eſtabliſhing: But that both
the one and the other cauſe the Holy Ghoſt to have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over them, according to the Meaſure, which is given
to every one. It muſt be prov'd, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> that the
Church has receiv'd a like Grace. There's no need of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
anſwer'd I immediately; 'tis ſufficient to ſhew, that
the Paſſage, you alledge, is not concluding.</p>
            <p>To this there was nothing ſaid. But, if I remember well,
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> exaggerated a little, how ſtrange it was, that we
would oblige Men to believe the Church, like GOD himſelf,
upon her bare Word, without making uſe, for the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Scripture, of the Reaſon, GOD has given us; that
thoſe of <hi>Beraea</hi> did not ſo; and that the Apoſtle, according to
our Opinion, was much to blame for letting them examin his
Preachings.</p>
            <p>I anſwer'd, That there was a very great Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Faithful, already Children of the Church, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to her Authority, and thoſe, that ſtill doubted, whether
they ſhould enter into her Boſom: That thoſe of <hi>Beraea</hi> were
in this laſt Condition, and the Apoſtle would not by any means
propoſe to 'em the Churches Authority, of which they doubted:
But that the Faithful were not inſtructed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
after the Councel of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There the Apoſtles deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Authority of the Holy Ghoſt:<note place="margin">Act. XV. v. 28. Act. XVI. v. 4.</note> 
               <hi>It has ſeemed good,</hi>
ſay they, <hi>to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us.</hi> What do <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
Carriers of the Councels Letter after this? <hi>They went
through the Cities,</hi> as 'tis in the <hi>Acts:</hi> What, to cauſe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Decree to be there examin'd? 'Twould have
been to examin after the Holy Ghoſt himſelf. What then?
<hi>They went through the Cities, delivering them the Decrees for to
keep, that were ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders which were at</hi>
Jeruſalem. See the Order: The Examen in the Councel;
the Obedience without examining after the Deciſion; the
Examen in thoſe of <hi>Beraea,</hi> that is, in thoſe, who, not being
in the Church, have yet no Authority to regulate them: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62471:22"/>
without examining in thoſe, who, being already in
the Church, are only to hear her Decrees. 'Tis their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to be in a Body, which, guided by the Holy Ghoſt,
can never be deceiv'd, and by that means be deliver'd from
the Danger of an Examen, the end of which would perhaps
be Error.</p>
            <p>The Conference had already laſted four Hours. I already
had from Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Acknowledgment one of the Propoſitions,
I would make him confeſs, to wit, That every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ought to believe, he may underſtand the Holy Scripture
better than the Univerſal Councels, and all the reſt of the
Church. He muſt yet own the other Propoſition, no leſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant;
and ſee how GOD brought him to it.</p>
            <p>As he had ſpoken much of this Dominion of the Church o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Conſciences, repeating three or four times, That we
gave her the Reſpect, which was due to none but GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
when we believ'd her without Examining, I told him,
he need not make ſo ſtrange of a thing, which they did, as
well as we; and upon that I askt him, Whether a Believer at
his firſt Receiving the Holy Scripture from the Church were
oblig'd firſt to doubt, and after to examin, whether the Book,
ſhe put into his Hand, were truly inſpir'd by GOD or no.
If this Believer examins and doubts, he renounces the Faith,
and begins the reading of the Goſpel by an Act of Infidelity;
and if he doubts not, he then receives, without examining, the
Authority of the Church, which preſents him the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To this ſee Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Anſwer. The Believer, you ſuppoſe,
who has not read the Holy Scripture, and into whoſe Hands
'tis put, to ſpeak properly, doubts not, he is ignorant: He
knows not, what this Scripture is, which, he is told, is inſpir'd
by GOD. He has heard his Father, and thoſe, who inſtructed
him, ſay, That 'twas divinely inſpir'd: He yet knows no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authority but theirs; and as for what concerns the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
he knows not, what it is. Thus he cannot be ſaid to be
Unbelieving or Incredulous. And pray, Sir, ſaid he, let me
make you the ſame Argument upon the Church, as you make
me upon the Scripture. The Believer, to whom the Churches
Authority is propos'd, either believes it without examining, or
doubts: If he doubts, he is an Infidel: If he doubts not, by
what Authority is he aſſur'd? Is the Churches Authority a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62471:22"/>
thing evident of it ſelf, and muſt be not find it by ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen?
This is your Difficulty, which you have to ſolve as
well as I: either let us quit 'em both, or reſolve 'em both
together. I declare to you, that I will anſwer for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
what you ſhall anſwer me for the Church.</p>
            <p>I underſtand you, anſwer'd I, but before I explain to you,
how the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> believes the Church, let us firſt ſettle the
Matter, that is in queſtion. Is it not evident, Sir, amongſt you
as well as amongſt us, That, when the Holy Scripture is ſhewn
to Children educated in the Church, 'tis ſhewn them, as a Book
inſpir'd by GOD; and I ask, whether they cannot, when they
are caus'd to read ſomething in it, make this Act of Faith:
<hi>I certainly believe, that, what I am going to read, is GODs
Word? Mr. Claude</hi> anſwer'd here, That thoſe, of whom I ſpake
to him, had yet no divine Faith concerning the Authority of
the Scripture, but a bare human Perſwaſion, grounded on the
Deference, they had for their Parents, and that they were but
<hi>Catechumens. Catechumens,</hi> Sir? ſaid I. You muſt not, if you pleaſe,
ſpeak ſo. They are <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> they are baptiz'd; they have
in them the Holy Ghoſt, and Faith infus'd; they are in the
Covenant, according to you; they have receiv'd Baptiſm, as a
Seal of the Covenant, to which they are admitted; and as the
Covenant is ſeal'd in them by the exterior Seal of Baptiſm,
the Holy Ghoſt ſeals it interiorly in their Hearts. Know your
own Doctrin. Upon this, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> you know, that
one might diſpute; but I own, what you ſay. And well then,
anſwer'd I, if it be ſo, they are by the Grace of the Holy
Ghoſt, and Faith infus'd, in condition to make an Act of Faith,
when the Faith ſhall be preacht to them; and I ask, when
the Scripture, acknowledg'd by the whole Church for a Word
inſpir'd by GOD, is ſhewn them, Whether they are not in
condition to make with the whole Church this Act of Faith:
<hi>I believe, that this Scripture is GODs Word, as I believe, that GOD
is.</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> would never acknowledge this, but always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
That they had yet only an human Perſwaſion about the
Scripture, and that Divine Faith came not to them, till they
had read it. If they have, ſaid I, but an human Perſwaſion,
they have but a doubtful Perſwaſion; and conſequently doubt
of that, which is, according to you, the whole Foundation of
the Faith: In one word, they are Infidels. No, ſaid he, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62471:23"/>
are barely ignorant; and you muſt alſo ſay as much of the
Faith, one has in the Church: For 'tis not a matter of ſmall
difficulty, to diſcern, which is the true Church; and before
one is in a condition to know it of ones ſelf, one is ignorant of
it; or one has at moſt but a bare human Perſwaſion on the
Faith of ones Parents. Thus once again, what you ſhall ſay
upon the Church, I will ſay to you upon the Scripture. Let us
ſee, Sir, anſwer'd I, whether you will ſay it, or whether you
will have reaſon to ſay it. You acknowledge then, That a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who has neither read the holy Scripture, nor
heard it read, is not in condition to make this Act of Faith:
<hi>I believe, that this Scripture is GODs Word, as I believe, that GOD
is.</hi> Behold a terrible Inconvenience, that a Believer cannot
make ſo eſſential an Act of Faith. 'Tis not ſo amongſt us:
For the Believer, who receives the Holy Scripture from the
Hands of the Church, makes with the whole Church this Act
of Faith: <hi>As I believe, that GOD is, ſo I believe, that this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is the Word of him, in whom I believe.</hi> And I ſay, that he
cannot make this Act of Faith but by the Faith, he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in the Authority of the Church, which preſents him the
Scripture. I muſt here, proceeded I, throughly explicate, but
ſimply nevertheleſs, in what Order <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are inſtructed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Truth of the Scripture. I ſpeak not of Infidels, I
ſpeak of baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and I deſire you to obſerve well
this Diſtinction. There are two things here to be conſider'd.
The one is; who it is, that inſpires us with the Act of Faith,
by which we believe the Holy Scripture as GODs Word;
and we ſay, that 'tis the Holy Ghoſt: On this we are agreed.
The other thing to be conſider'd, is, what exterior Means the
Holy Ghoſt uſes to make us believe the Holy Scripture; and
I ſay, That 'tis the Church. That it is ſo, we need only ſee
the Apoſtles Creed, that is, the firſt Inſtruction, which a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
receives: He has not read the Holy Scripture, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
he believes in GOD, and in JESUS CHRIST, and in
the Holy Ghoſt, and the Univerſal Church. There is no
mention made to him of the Scripture; but the believing the
Univerſal Church is propos'd to him, as ſoon as the believing in
the Holy Ghoſt. Theſe two Articles enter together into his
Heart, the Holy Ghoſt and the Church; becauſe he, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in the Holy Ghoſt, neceſſarily alſo believes the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62471:23"/>
Church, which the Holy Ghoſt directs. I ſay then, that
the firſt Act of Faith, which the Holy Ghoſt puts in the
Hearts of Baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is to believe with the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the Univerſal Church; and that this is
the exterior Means, by which the Holy Ghoſt inſinuates into
Hearts the Belief of the Holy Scripture. If this Means is not
certain, the Faith in the Scripture will conſequently be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
But as the <hi>Catholic</hi> has always found this Means certain,
there is not any Moment, in which he cannot ſay: <hi>As I believe,
that GOD is, I believe, that GOD has ſpoken to men, and that this
Scripture is his Word.</hi> And the Reaſon, for which he can at
firſt make this Act of Faith, is, becauſe he never doubted of
the Churches Authority, and becauſe this is the firſt thing,
which the Holy Ghoſt put in his Heart with the Faith in GOD
and in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>As to what you ask me, how he believes the Church, that
is not preciſely our Queſtion: 'Tis ſufficient, that we ſee, he
always believes it, ſince 'tis the firſt thing, the Holy Ghoſt
puts in his Heart, and the exterior Means, by which he makes
him believe the Holy Scripture, The Scripture, of which he
never offers to doubt, ſince he never doubted of the Church,
which preſents it to him. This, Sir, is our Doctrin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis not yours, you neceſſarily fall into the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I have noted: Becauſe you believe not the Churches
Authority, as a thing, which cannot fail, we ſhew you a Point
of time, in which you cannot make an Act of Faith upon the
Scripture, and conſequently in which you ceaſe to be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> told me here, That the Child, who recited the
Creed, ſpake like a Parrot, without Underſtanding, what he
ſaid; and ſo we ought not to inſiſt much upon that: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that I affirm'd <hi>gratis,</hi> That to believe the Univerſal
Church was the firſt Act of Faith, which the Holy Ghoſt put
into the Heart of the Baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to inſinuate to him
by that means Faith in the Holy Scripture: In fine, That I
anſwer'd not, what he askt me concerning the Church, nor
how we began to believe her; for, ſaid he, The Holy Ghoſt is
the Principle, and not the Motive of Believing: That 'twas
requiſite therefore, I ſhould explicate, how we believ'd the
Church, and by what Motive; and that from my manner
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62471:24"/>
of ſpeaking it ſeem'd, as if we believ'd her by Enthuſiaſm,
and without any Motive inducing us ſo to do.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwered, I pretended not, That the Church
was believ'd by Enthuſiaſm; That for the acknowledging
her there were divers Motives of Credibility, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt ſuggeſted to his Faithful, as he pleas'd; That he was
not ignorant of them, but they were not now in Queſtion. Our
Buſineſs now is, ſaid I, to know, whether the exterior Means,
which the Holy Ghoſt uſes to make us believe the Holy
Scripture, is not the Churches Authority. I ſpeak not <hi>gratis,</hi>
when I ſay, That this is the firſt thing, which the Holy Ghoſt
puts in the Hearts of baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> for in the Creed there
is mention'd to them the Univerſal Church, and ſhe is propos'd
to their Belief, without ſpeaking to them of the Scripture. 'Tis
to no purpoſe to ſay, That Children repeat at firſt, like Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots,
both the Creed, and the Name of the Univerſal Church.
Let us leave, ſaid I, the Parrot, that ſpeaks only by Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Let us come to the time, when the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> has the uſe
of Reaſon, and when he can make an Act of Faith. By what
ſhall he begin, but by what he began to be inſtructed? He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
then the Univerſal Church, before he believes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
In effect, make, I do not ſay a Child, but any Man
whoſoever, read the Canticle of Canticles, in which there is
not the leaſt mention of GOD, either good or bad: In good
earneſt, He believes this Book inſpir'd by GOD, only becauſe
of the Tradition; Firſt, of the Synagogue, and Secondly, of
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, that is in one word, through the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Univerſal Church. But let us keep to our Point.
Let us conſider the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in the Moment, when the Holy
Scripture is propos'd to him as the Word of GOD. 'Tis the
Holy Ghoſt, which makes him believe it; we are agreed on
that Point: But we diſpute about the exterior Means, of
which the Holy Ghoſt makes uſe. I ſay, That 'tis the Church,
ſince 'tis ſhe in effect, which propoſes to him the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
ſince he believ'd the Church, before he heard of the
Scripture; ſince at his opening the Scripture, he is in Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſay: <hi>I believe this Scripture, as I believe, that GOD is.</hi>
You ſay, That he cannot make this Act of Faith: He is then
no Believer, and his Baptiſm is of no uſe to him. We muſt
inſtruct him as an Infidel, ſaying to him: <hi>Here is the Scripture,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62471:24"/>
which I believe inſpir'd by GOD; read it Child, examin it, ſee,
whether it be the very Truth or a Fable. The Church believes it
inſpir'd by GOD; but the Church may be deceiv'd, and thou art
not in condition to make with her this Act of Faith: As I believe,
that GOD is, ſo I believe, that he himſelf inſpir'd this Scripture.</hi>
If this manner of Inſtructing ſtrikes an Horror into <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
and leads manifeſtly to Impiety, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> muſt be able at
firſt to make an Act of Faith upon the Scripture, propos'd
to him by the Church; he muſt conſequently believe, That
the Church is not deceiv'd in giving him this Scripture. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he receives from her the Scripture, he receives from her the
Interpretation of it; and ſhe no more exerciſes Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Conſciences in obliging her Children to believe her
Interpretations without examining, than ſhe does in obliging us
to believe, without examining, the Scripture it ſelf.</p>
            <p>By this Argument, Sir, reply'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> you would make
every one conclude in Favor of his Church. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> the
<hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> we our ſelves, whom you believe to
be in error; we are nevertheleſs Baptiz'd; we have by Baptiſm
both the Holy Ghoſt and this Faith infus'd, of which you
have been ſpeaking. Every one of us has receiv'd the Holy
Scripture from the Church, in which he was baptiz'd; every
one believes his to be the true Church declar'd in the Creed;
and at the firſt he even knows not any other. Now if, as
we have receiv'd, without examining, the Holy Scripture from
the Hand of that Church, in which we are, we muſt alſo, as
you ſay, receive blindfold all its Interpretations; 'tis an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to conclude, That every one ought to continue, as he is,
and that every Religion is good.</p>
            <p>This was in truth the ſtrongeſt Objection, that could be
made; and thô the Solution of this Doubt appear'd clear to me,
I was in pain, how I might render it clear to thoſe, who
heard me. I ſpake with trembling, ſeeing it concern'd the
Salvation of a Soul; and I beſought GOD, who made me ſee
the Truth ſo clearly, That he would give me Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
it fully and plainly: For I had to do with a Man, who
heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> patiently, ſpake clearly and ſtrongly, and in fine puſht the
Difficulties to the utmoſt points.</p>
            <p>I told him, I muſt firſt diſtinguiſh their Caſe from that of
the <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> and others, he had nam'd, who indeed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62471:25"/>
err in taking a falſe Church for the true; but believe at leaſt,
as indubitable, That the true Church, whereſoever ſhe is,
muſt be believ'd, and that ſhe never deceives her Children.
You are, ſaid I to him, much farther off; for I can lay to your
Charge, That you do not only, like the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi>
take a falſe Church for a true; but, what is undeniable, and
what you your ſelf confeſs, That you will not have us even
believe the true. After this Diſtinction, which ſeem'd neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to me, let us come to your Difficulty. Let us diſtinguiſh in
the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and other falſe Churches, what there
is of Truth, what they have in common with the true Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Church; in a word, what comes from GOD, from that,
which comes from human Prejudice. GOD by his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
puts in the Heart of thoſe, who are baptiz'd in theſe
Churches, That there is a GOD, and a JESUS CHRIST, and
an Holy Ghoſt. Hitherto there is no Error; all this is from
GOD: Is it not true? He agreed it. They believe alſo, That
there is an Univerſal Church: Are they not right in this, and
is it not a Truth, reveal'd by GOD, that there is one indeed?
I expected his Acknowledgment, and after he had given it, I
added, That the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> were diſpos'd to believe
without examining, whatever the true Church propos'd to 'em.
This is, what you approve not, Sir; in this you are ſeparated
from all other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who unanimouſly believe, That there
is a true Church, which never deceives her Children. I, who
believe this with them, reckon this Belief amongſt the things,
which come from GOD: But ſee, where the human Prejudices
begin. This Baptiz'd, being ſeduc'd by his Parents and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
believes the Church, in which he is, to be the true, and
attributes in particular to this falſe Church all, that GOD
makes him believe in general of the true. 'Tis not the Holy
Ghoſt, that puts this in his Heart: Is it not true? 'Tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt true. In this place he begins to believe amiſs. Here
Error begins; here the Divine Faith, infus'd by the Holy
Ghoſt, begins to be loſt. Happy are thoſe, in whom the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Prejudices are joyn'd with the true Belief, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt puts in their Heart. They are exempt from a great
Temptation, and the terrible Pain, there is to diſtinguiſh that,
which is from GOD in the Faith of their Church, from that,
which is from Men. But whatever Difficulty Men have to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62471:25"/>
diſtinguiſh theſe things, GOD knows them, and diſtinguiſhes
them; and there will be an eternal Difference between that,
which his Holy Spirit puts in the Heart of the Baptiz'd, when
he interiorly diſpoſes them to believe the true Church, and that,
which human Prejudices have added to it by fixing their Spirit
to a falſe one. How theſe Baptiz'd may afterwards diſentangle
theſe things, and by what means they may get out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion,
that has made them confound the Idea of the falſe
Church, in which they are, with the Faith of the true Church,
which the Holy Ghoſt has put in their Hearts with the Creed,
is not now in debate; and 'tis ſufficient, that we have ſeen in
all the Baptiz'd a Belief of the Church, which comes to them
from GOD, diſtinguiſht from the Thought, which comes to
them from Men. This being ſo, I affirm, That to this Belief
of the Church, which the Holy Ghoſt puts in our Hearts
with the Creed, is fixt a firm Faith, That we muſt believe
this Church as certainly, as the Holy Ghoſt, to whom the
Creed it ſelf immediately joins her; and that this Faith in the
Church is the Cauſe, the Believer never doubts of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>I ſtopt a moment, to ask, whether I were underſtood. Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi> anſwer'd, That he underſtood me perfectly. And if
it be ſo, ſaid I to him, you ought to ſee the Inconvenience, into
which your Belief caſts you; and you ought alſo to ſee, That
I am not in the ſame by mine. You not only ſay, That we
muſt not believe a falſe Church, but that we muſt not even
believe the true one without examining what ſhe ſays; and in
this you ſpeak againſt all other <hi>Chriſtians. Mademoiſelle de Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
interpos'd, ſaying: in this place: This is, what muſt be
anſwer'd by, Ay or No. I ſaid it indeed, anſwer'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
and I did not ſtick to ſay it at firſt. So much the better, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
I. We ſhall ſoon ſee, which of us two has Reaſon, and
in the clear State, things have been put in by our reciprocal
Diſcourſes, the Truth will ſoon appear on one ſide or other.
From the time, you lay it down for certain, That the Church,
even the true one may deceive us, the Faithful cannot believe
on the Churches ſole Faith, That the Scripture is the Word of
GOD. He may believe it with an human Faith, anſwer'd
Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> but not with a divine Faith. But human Faith,
reply'd I, is always defective, and doubting: He doubts then,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62471:26"/>
whether the Scripture be inſpir'd by GOD, or no. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
here pray'd me to remember, what he had already ſaid, That
he was not in Doubt, but in Ignorance. As a Man, ſaid he,
not skill'd in Diamonds, being ſhewn one, and askt, whether
he believes it to be good or bad; knows nothing of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he in Doubt, but in Ignorance. In like manner, when
a Maſter teaches ſome Opinion in Philoſophy, the Scholar, who
underſtands not yet, what he means, has no formal Doubt,
but is in a bare Ignorance. So is it with thoſe, to whom the
Holy Scripture is the firſt time given. And I, ſaid I, affirm,
That he doubts, and that he, who is not skill'd in Diamonds,
doubts, whether that, which is preſented to him, be good or
bad, and that the Scholar with Reaſon doubts of all, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in Philoſophy tells him, till he ſees it clear, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
not his Maſter Infallible; and by the ſame Reaſon, he,
who believes not the Church Infallible, doubts of the Truth of
GODs Word, which ſhe propoſes to him. This is call'd
Ignorance, and not Doubt, ſtill ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude:</hi> And I made
this Argument. To doubt is not to know, whether a thing be
or not. The <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> of whom we ſpeak, knows not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Scripture be true or no: He is then in Doubt. Tell
me, what is it to doubt, but not to know, whether a thing be
or no? To this there was no Anſwer, but that this <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
did not in any manner doubt of the Scripture, but was only
ignorant of it. But, ſaid I, he is not like an Infidel, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
never heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any mention of it. He knows, That the
Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are read in the
Church as GODs Word, and that none of the Faithful doubt
it. Can he believe with them as certainly, as he believes
GOD is, That this Word is inſpir'd by GOD? You have ſaid,
That he cannot make this Act of Faith: He, that cannot make
an Act of Faith on an Article, propos'd to him, makes at leaſt,
as I may ſo ſay, an Act of Doubt. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſtill anſwer'd,
That he was in a pure Ignorance. And well, let us leave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
about Words: He does not Doubt, if you pleaſe; but
he knows not, whether this Scripture be a Truth, or a Fable;
he knows not, whether the Goſpel be an Hiſtory inſpir'd by
GOD, or a Tale invented by Men. He cannot then make an
Act of Divine Faith upon this Point, nor ſay, <hi>I believe, as GOD
is; that the Goſpel is alſo from GOD.</hi> Do you not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62471:26"/>
That he cannot make this Act, and that he has nothing
but an human Faith? He again freely confeſs'd, That he knew
nothing elſe. Well, Sir, 'tis enough. In fine then there is
a Point of Time, when every Baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtian</hi> knows not,
whether the Goſpel be not a Fable: This is given him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin:
See, to what we muſt come, when we are ſet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
after the Church. We might diſcourſe without end:
But we have ſaid all, that can be ſaid on both ſides, and we
ſhould do nothing but begin again. 'Tis for every one to
examin in his Conſcience, how he can maintain, That a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> ought to have been a Moment without knowing,
whether the Goſpel be a Truth or a Fable, and that amongſt
other Queſtions, which one may make in ones Life, this alſo
muſt be given him to examin. It appear'd to me, by the
Countenance of <hi>Mademoiſelle de Dwas,</hi> that ſhe underſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> roſe with us, and coming to us, ſaid:
I could wiſh, That, before you broke up, ſomething might be
ſaid concerning the Separation. The thing is done, anſwer'd
I. As ſoon as 'tis certain, That one cannot examin after the
Church without falling into an inſupportable Pride, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.

of the Goſpel, and alſo, whether he finds himſelf capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

the World, and than all the reſt of the Univerſal Church.
But ſince <hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> deſires ſome particular Inſtruction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Separation, I beſeech you, Sir, give me a Moment
more. I ſhall propoſe to you eſſential Facts, on which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f I
be not deceiv'd, you muſt ſoon agree. I ask you, Sir, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Arians</hi> ſeparated from the Church, and whether their
Sect, when it appear'd, was not new? They did not, ſaid he,
ſeparate from the Church; they corrupted it. He ſet himſelf
to repreſent with a great deal of Exaggeration, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow they
drew with them the whole Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis not ſo, Sir, ſaid I, You
know, That St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and
many other Holy Biſhops held for the Truth, and that a great
Body of People follow'd them. You know, That all the <hi>Weſt,</hi>
and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, notwithſtanding the Fall of <hi>Liberius,</hi> was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox.
But let us leave all this, ſaid I to him; in what Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62471:27"/>
ſoever they ſeparated, there was a Church before them,
from which they brake, and againſt which they ſet up another
Church. No, ſaid he, They corrupted it. Ha, Sir, reply'd I:
What Difficulty is this? Never any Hereticks ſeparated but by
corrupting ſome of the Churches Children, and ſeparating with
them from the Church, in which they had all been baptiz'd.
But in fine, tell me, Sir, Was not the Sect of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and
that Church, which is nam'd the <hi>Arian,</hi> new? If you mean,
Sir, anſwered he, That <hi>Arius</hi> was the firſt, who ſpake againſt
the Divinity of the Son of GOD, 'tis not true. <hi>Origen</hi> before
him, and <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid the ſame thing. Ha, Sir, ſaid I:
That a Martyr deny'd the Divinity of GGDs Son, is, what I
ſhall never believe. As to <hi>Origen,</hi> you know, that he is alledg'd
both for and againſt it: He is an ambiguous and ſuſpected
Author. But, Sir, let us leave uncertain Facts: And let us
endeavour to find one, about which both you and I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
That Sect, which after the Condemnation pronounc'd
againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> join'd with this excommunicated Prieſt, and form'd
a Church againſt the Church, was it not new? He could not
but grant it. To prove its Newneſs, continu'd I, was there any
need of aſcending up to the Apoſtles, and could not one ſay
to it: <hi>Church, ſeparated from that other Church, in which</hi> Arius <hi>was
born, and in which he receiv'd Baptiſm, you were neither yeſterday,
nor the day before?</hi> One might, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude.</hi> May one not
ſay as much of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Church, which deny'd the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of the Holy Ghoſt; of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who divided
JESUS CHRISTs Perſon; of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> that confounded
his two Natures; and of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who deny'd Original
Sin, and the Grace of JESUS CHRIST? Might one not
ſay to them without aſcending up to the Apoſtles: <hi>When you
came into the World, you found the Church baptizing Children unto
Remiſſion of Sins, and praying for the Converſion of Sinners and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels?</hi>
What then all theſe Hereticks, and all the reſt, whom
you and we know, oppugned, was believ'd not only from the
Apoſtles time, but yeſterday and the day before, and at the
time, when theſe Hereſiarchs came, and they found the Church
in this Belief. But, anſwer'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> There are two ways
of eſtabliſhing Error; the one open, and the other ſecret and
inſenſible. Stay, Sir, ſaid I to him, we ought to propoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Facts, which both Parties agree. I do not agree this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62471:27"/>
inſenſible way of eſtabliſhing Error. Ha, Sir, ſaid he, will you
ſay, That you ſhall find praying to Saints, and Purgatory, in
the Apoſtles times? No, Sir, anſwer'd I, I will ſay nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, for you will not agree it; and I will ſay ſuch things,
as you may agree. Deal in the ſame manner with me. He,
that ſhall draw moſt ſolid Advantages from Facts, granted by
his Adverſary, will have a great Argument, that the Truth is
for him: For 'tis the Property of Truth to keep it ſelf upon
all ſides, and to condemn Error by Facts, which Error it ſelf
acknowledges. And ſince you mention Prayer to Saints, you
are ſincere: is it not true, that Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> grants us thirteen
hundred Years Antiquity? Thirteen hundred Years, Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
he, is not the whole time of the Church. I agree it,
ſaid I to him; but in fine, my Adverſary grants me already
thirteen hundred Years; he gives me St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> St.
<hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> All
theſe, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> are but Men. Let them be Men, as
much as you pleaſe: But in fine, we have from our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Confeſſion, thirteen hundred Years for Invocation of Saints,
and Veneration of Relicks; for theſe two things were joyn'd
together, as you know, Mr. <hi>Daillé</hi> aſſerts. And how much
does Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> grant for Prayer for the Dead? 'Tis true,
ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> That this is the antienteſt Error of the Church.
Fourteen hundred Years Antiquity, ſaid I to him, is what Mr.
<hi>Blondel</hi> yields us. I ſay not this, to create a Prejudice for the
Truth of our Doctrin; that is not the matter in hand: But
I ſay it, to ſhew, That we are not without Defence upon theſe
Examples of Errors inſenſibly ſpread, ſince we already have
by your Conſent thirteen hundred, and fourteen hundred
Years. Let us come then to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> evident Facts, on which I may
agree. For as for you, you agree, That the <hi>Arians, Neſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Pelagians,</hi> and in one word, all Hereticks were eſtabliſht, as
I have ſaid. They found not any Church, to which they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
themſelves. They erected one, which was ſeparated from
all the other Churches, that then were. This is certain: Is it
not manifeſt? I expected: Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> contradicted it not; I
thought not my ſelf oblig'd to preſs him any farther upon a
thing evident, and already own'd. Now, ſaid I to him, how
were the Orthodox Churches eſtabliſht? When particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and People, for Example the <hi>Indians,</hi> were converted,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62471:28"/>
found they not a Church already eſtabliſht, to which they united
themſelves? He acknowledg'd it. Did you, went I on, find one in
the whole World, to which you join'd your ſelves? Did you
embrace the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> or the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Church,
when you forſook the <hi>Roman?</hi> Can we not mark you the
preciſe Date of your Churches, and ſay to all that Church, to
all that exterior Society, in which you are Miniſter, <hi>you were
not yeſterday?</hi> But, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> here, were we not of this
Church? We went not out, we were driven out of it. We
were Excommunicated in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Thus we went
forth: But we carried the Church with us. What Diſcourſe
is this, Sir, ſaid I to him? If you had not been driven out,
would you have ſtaid in it? To what purpoſe then is that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſo often repeated amongſt you, <hi>Go forth of</hi> Babylon, <hi>my
People?</hi> Tell me ſincerely, Would you have ſtaid in the Church,
if ſhe had not driven ye out? No ſure, Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude.</hi>
To what purpoſe then, anſwer'd I, do you ſay here, That you
were driven out? Becauſe, ſaid he, it is true. And well, Sir,
proceeded I, it is true: This is common to you (be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
at what I am going to ſay) this is common to you
with all Hereticks. The Church, in which they receiv'd Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
caſt them forth, Excommunicated them. They would
perhaps have willingly ſtay'd in it to corrupt and ſeduce; but
the Church cut them off. And as to what you ſay, That
you were in this Church, which caſt you out, and that you
carry'd the Church with you, what Heretick may not ſay as
much? 'Twas not of Heathens, that the Ancient Hereticks
compos'd their Churches; 'twas of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> bred in the
Church. You alſo have not form'd yours by amaſſing <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans;</hi>
I agree it: But in this you do not outgo the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the ancient Hereticks, and they were all able to ſay
as well as you, That they were condemn'd by their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
For they were not made to ſit amongſt the Judges, when
their Novelty was condemn'd. But, Sir, reply'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
we agree not this Novelty. What is in the Scripture, is not
new. Patience, Sir, I beſeech you, ſaid I to him: None of
the Ancient Hereticks agreed the Novelty of their Doctrin;
they all alledg'd the Holy Scripture for themſelves: But there
was one Novelty, which they could not deny; to wit, That
the Body of their Church was not yeſterday, and you granted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62471:28"/>
it. And well, in fine, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> if the <hi>Arians,</hi> if the
<hi>Neſtorians,</hi> if the <hi>Pelagians</hi> had been right at the Bottom, they
would not have been to blame in their Proceeding. To blame
or not, ſaid I to him, is not, Sir, the Bottom of the Queſtion:
But it ſtill continues evident, That you have the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
with them, the ſame Conduct, the ſame Defences; in
a word, That in forming your Church you have done, as all
the Hereticks did, and we do, what all the Orthodox have
done. Every one may judg in his Conſcience, which he had
rather reſemble, and I have no more to ſay.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> was not ſilent on this occaſion, but told me, That
this Argument was excellent in Favor of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi>
and that they might maintain their Cauſe by the Reaſon, I
made uſe of. Let us ſee, ſaid I to him, Sir, and remember,
that you promiſe us the ſame Argument. The ſame, anſwer'd
he, without doubt: The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> upbraided the <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi>
with their newneſs; you know it: The Writings of <hi>Celſus,</hi>
and ſo many others, are Proofs of it. I agree it, ſaid I to him,
and is this all? And 'twas true, proceeded he, That <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
was new, if we regard it in the State immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
What, ſaid I to him, when JESUS CHRIST began
to preach, could they ſay to him, as I do to you, That in the
Church, he was born in, there was yeſterday no mention of
him non his Coming? What then was St. <hi>John Baptiſt, Anna</hi>
the Propheteſs, <hi>Simeon,</hi> the Wiſe Men, and the Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
by <hi>Herod,</hi> when they anſwer'd him, That the Place of
his Birth was <hi>Bethlehem?</hi> Was there any one Moment, when
CHRIST was not expected in the Church, where he was
born; and ſo well expected, that the <hi>Jews</hi> expect him ſtill?
'Tis very true, Sir, That there was a Neceſſity, this Novelty
ſhould once be ſeen to happen, and this Change by CHRIST,
expected at CHRISTs Coming. But JESUS CHRIST is not
therefore new.<note place="margin">Heb. xiii. v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>He is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi>
'Tis true; anſwer'd Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> but the Synagogue agreed not,
That JESUS was the CHRIST. But, reply'd I, The Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
condemn'd not St. <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> but the Synagogue
heard, without contradicting them, the Wiſe Men, <hi>Simeon,</hi>
and <hi>Anna.</hi> JESUS CHRIST gather'd in the Synagogue,
the then true Church, the Children of GOD, which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
The Synagogue at laſt condemn'd him. But
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62471:29"/>
JESUS CHRIST had already founded his Church. He gave
it its laſt Form preſently after his Death, and the new People
follow'd the old without any Interruption: Theſe are undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Truths. And for what concerns Paganiſm, 'tis true the
<hi>Pagans</hi> upbraided the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with their Newneſs. But what
did the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> anſwer? Did they not ſhew, That the <hi>Jews</hi>
always believ'd the ſame GOD, which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ador'd, and
expected the ſame CHRIST? That the <hi>Jews</hi> believ'd all this
yeſterday, and the day before, and always without Interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
But, Sir, once again, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> The <hi>Gentils</hi> agreed
not all this. What, anſwer'd I, was there amongſt them any
one ſo unreaſonable, as to ſay, That there never were any
<hi>Jews,</hi> or that this People expected not a CHRIST, and ador'd
not one ſole GOD, Creator of Heaven and Earth? Did not
they ſhew the <hi>Pagans</hi> the manifeſt Beginning of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the Date, I do not ſay of the Authors of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
but of their Gods themſelves, and this by their own
Hiſtories, by their own Authors, and by their own Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy?
Do you believe, That a <hi>Pagan</hi> could have made a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
confeſs, That the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion was new, or that there
never was any Society, which had the ſame Belief, the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
then had, as I make you own, That all the Hereticks, which
you and I acknowledg for ſuch, came in this manner, and that
you have done, as they did? See, Sir, how you prove, That
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> might maintain their Cauſe by the ſame
Argument, I uſe: None can ever do it, nor can ever any one
deny the evident Fact, vvhich I affirm, That vve do, as all
the Orthodox, and you, as all the Hereticks have done.</p>
            <p>Here the Converſation ended. It had laſted five Hours
with a great Attention of the whole Aſſembly. We heard
one another peaceably: We ſpake on both ſides cloſe enough;
and except the beginning, vvhere Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> a little enlarg'd
his Diſcourſe, in all the reſt he came to the Matter, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelf to the Difficulty vvithout Recoiling. 'Tis true,
he aim'd rather to entangle me in the Inconveniences, in vvhich
I engag'd him, than to ſhevv, hovv he could himſelf get out:
But in fine, all this proceeded from the Cauſe; and he aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid all, that his could furniſh him vvith upon the Point,
to vvhich vve had confin'd our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62471:29"/>
For my part I car'd not to go from it, ſince 'twas that which
<hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> deſir'd to have clear'd. She appear'd to
me toucht: I nevertheleſs retir'd, trembling, and fearing, leſt
my weakneſs might have put her Soul in danger, and the Truth
in doubt.</p>
            <p>I Viſited her the next day.<note place="margin">III. The Sequel of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> I was glad to ſee, ſhe perfectly
underſtood all, I had ſaid. This is, what I had promis'd
her. I had repreſented to her, That amidſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Difficulties, which the Spirit of Cavilling, and the
Depth of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrin,</hi> had caus'd to ſpring up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt
men, GOD would have his Children provided of an
eaſy Means to reſolve themſelves in what concern'd their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
that this Means was the Churches Authority; that
this means was eaſy to be eſtabliſht, eaſy to be underſtood,
eaſy to be follow'd; ſo eaſy, ſaid I, and ſo clear, that, if you
ſhall not underſtand, what I ſhall ſay upon it, I am contented
you believe me to be in the wrong. This in effect muſt be ſo,
when the matter is well handled: But I durſt not promiſe my
ſelf, that I had treated it, as I ought. I knew with joy and
thankſgiving, that GOD had turn'd all to good. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that ought to affect, affected her. She could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
how an ignorant private Perſon could without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
pride believe, he might happen to underſtand the
Scripture better than all the Univerſal Councels, and all the reſt
of the Church. She ſaw as well as I, how weak the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Synagogue was, when it condemn'd JESUS CHRIST,
and how little reaſon there was to ſay, That the particular
perſons, who believ'd well, wanted an Exterior Authority to
reſolve them, when they had in the Perſon of JESUS CHRIST,
the greateſt and moſt viſible Authority, that can be imagin'd.
I paſs'd again over the Doubt, in which one muſt be touching
the Scripture, if one doubted of the Churches Authority. She
ſaid, ſhe never ſo much as thought, that a <hi>Christian</hi> might
doubt one moment of the Scripture; and beſides ſhe perfectly
underſtood, that Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> rejecting the Name of Doubt,
acknowledg'd the Thing in other terms: Which ſerv'd only
to make appear, how hard this Matter was both to think and
ſay, ſince being forc't to own it, he thought not fit to do it
in ſimple Terms. For in fine not to know, whether a thing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62471:30"/>
be or no, if it be not to Doubt, is nothing. It appear'd then
clearly, That the two Propoſitions, which were in debate,
were eſtabliſht: And I ſhew'd <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> in few
words, That her Church, by believing two ſuch ſtrange
Things, had chang'd the whole Order of inſtructing GODs
Children, practis'd at all times in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe I needed only repeat to her, what ſhe had
heard me ſay, and what ſhe had heard Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> grant.
GOD nevertheleſs put in my heart ſomething more expreſs,
and I ſaid to her, as follows.</p>
            <p>The Order of inſtructing GODs Children, is to teach them,
before all things, the Apoſtles Creed: <hi>I believe in GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in JESVS CHRIST, and in the Holy Ghoſt, the
holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the Remiſſion of
Sins,</hi> and the reſt. As much as the Faithful believes in GOD
the Father, and in his Son JESUS CHRIST, and in the Holy
Ghoſt, ſo much does he believe the Univerſal Church, where
the Father, where the Son, where the Holy Ghoſt is ador'd.
As much, I ſay, as he believes the Father, ſo much does he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Church, which makes Profeſſion to believe, that
GOD, the Father of JESUS CHRIST, has adopted Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whom he has united to his Son. As much as he believes
in the Son, ſo much does he believe the Church, which he has
aſſembled by his Blood, which he has eſtabliſht by his Doctrin,
which he has founded on the Rock, and againſt which, he has
promis'd, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail. As much as
he believes in the Holy Ghoſt, ſo much does he believe that
Church, to which the Holy Ghoſt was given for a Teacher.
And he, that ſays, <hi>I believe in GOD, and in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,
and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. X. v. 10.</note> when he ſays, <hi>I believe,</hi> confeſſes: <hi>With the
heart he believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the mouth Confeſſion
is made unto Salvation,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, and he knows, that the
Faith, he has, is not a private Sentiment. There is a Church,
a Society of Men, which believes, as he does: 'Tis the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Church, which is neither here, nor there, neither at
this time, nor at another. She is not confin'd to one only
Country, like the ancient <hi>Judaical</hi> Church; nor is ſhe to end,
as that was;<note place="margin">Dan. II. v. 44. C. 7. v. 14.</note> and <hi>her Kingdom ſhall not paſs to other People,</hi> as 'tis
written in <hi>Daniel.</hi> She is at all times, and in all places, and ſo
diſpers'd, that whoever will come to her, may. She has no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62471:30"/>
Interruption in her Succeſſion, for there is not any time,
when one cannot ſay, <hi>I believe the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church:</hi> As there
is not any time, but one may ſay, <hi>I believe in GOD the
Father, and in his Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This Church is
Holy, becauſe all, ſhe teaches, is holy; becauſe ſhe teaches all
the Doctrin, which makes Saints, that is, all the Doctrin of
JESUS CHRIST; becauſe ſhe encloſes all the Saints in
her Unity. And theſe Saints muſt not only be united in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
They are exteriorly united in the Communion of this
Church; and this is meant by <hi>the Communion of Saints.</hi> In this
Univerſal Church, in this Communion of Saints, is the Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Sins. There is Baptiſm, by which Sins are remitted;
there is the Miniſtery of the Keys, by which <hi>whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
or retained on Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. xvi. v. 19. John xx. v. 23.</note> 
               <hi>is remitted or retained in Heaven.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
then in this Church an exterior Miniſtery, which laſts as
long as the Church, that is to ſay, always, ſince this Church
is believ'd at all times, not as a thing, which has been, or
muſt be, but as a thing, which actually is. See then, to what
this Church is joyn'd, and what is joyn'd to this Church. She
is joyn'd immediatly to the Holy Ghoſt, which governs her:
<hi>I believe in the Holy Ghoſt, the holy Catholic Church.</hi> To this
Church is joyn'd the Communion of Saints, the Remiſſion of
Sins, the Reſurrection of the Fleſh, eternal Life. Out of this
Church there is neither Communion of Saints, nor Remiſſion
of Sins, nor Reſurrection to eternal Life. Behold the Faith
of the Church eſtabliſht in the Creed. It makes no mention of
the Scripture. Is it, becauſe it deſpiſes it? GOD forbid. You
ſhall receive the Scripture from the Hands of the Church;
and becauſe you never doubted of the Church, you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doubt of the Scripture, which the Church has receiv'd
from GOD, from JESUS CHRIST, and from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;
which ſhe always keeps, as coming from that Source,
which ſhe puts into the Hands of all the Faithful.</p>
            <p>Methought, this Doctrin, truly Holy and Apoſtolical,
wrought the Effect, it ought to work: But there is, ſaid I, one
Word more. 'Tis what I ſaid to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and I reduce it
now to this moſt plain Argument, which every one may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
underſtand, I mean, the Learned as the Ignorant, and
the private Perſon as the Paſtor: The baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reads the holy Scripture, can either make this Act of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62471:31"/>
Faith, <hi>I believe, that this Word is inſpir'd by GOD, as I believe
that GOD is,</hi> or he cannot. If he cannot, he then doubts of
it; he is reduc'd to examin, whether the Goſpel is not a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But if he can make it, by what means ſhall he do it?
The Holy Ghoſt ſhall put it in his Heart. This is no Anſwer;
for it is agreed, That Faith in the Scripture comes from the
Holy Ghoſt. The Queſtion is concerning the exterior Means,
which the Holy Ghoſt uſes, and there can be no other but
the Churches Authority. Thus every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> receives from
the Church, without examining, this Scripture; as a Writing
inſpir'd by GOD.</p>
            <p>Let us go a little farther. Does the Church only give us
the Holy Scripture in Paper, the Bark of the Word, the Body
of the Letter? No, without doubt, ſhe gives us the Spirit, that
is, the Senſe of the Scripture: For to give us the Scripture
without the Senſe, is to give us a Body without a Soul, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which kills. The Scripture without its lawful Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Scripture deſtitute of its natural Senſe, is a Knife to
cut our Throats. The <hi>Arian</hi> cut his Throat by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
miſunderſtood; ſo did the <hi>Neſtorian;</hi> ſo did the <hi>Pelagian.</hi>
GOD forbid then, That the Church ſhould give us only the
Scripture, without giving us the Senſe of it. She receiv'd
them both together. When ſhe receiv'd the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the reſt, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
them: This Senſe, which ſhe receiv'd with the Scripture,
ſhe has kept with the Scripture; and the ſame exterior Means,
which the Holy Ghoſt uſes, to make us receive the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
he uſes alſo to give us its true Senſe. All this comes from
the ſame Principle; all this is the Sequel of the ſame Deſign.
As then there is nothing to examin after the Church, when
ſhe gives us the Holy Scripture; ſo there is nothing to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,
when ſhe interprets it, and propoſes its true Senſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſee, that after the Councel of <hi>Jeruſalem, Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi>
ſaid not, <hi>Examin this Decree;</hi> but they taught the Church to
obſerve, what the Apoſtles had judg'd.</p>
            <p>In this manner has the Church always proceeded. <hi>I would
not believe the Goſpel,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin, were I not mov'd by the
Authority of the Catholic Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 5. Cont. Manich.</note> And a little after: <hi>Thoſe, whom
I believ'd, when they ſaid to me, Believe the Goſpel, ſhall I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
when they bid me not believe</hi> Manicheus. This Society of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62471:31"/>
Paſtors, eſtabliſht by JESUS CHRIST, and continu'd until
now, giving me the Goſpel, has alſo told me, That I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Hereticks and evil Doctrins; I believe both together, and
by the ſame Authority.</p>
            <p>After this manner were <hi>Chriſtians</hi> inſtructed in the primitive
Times,<note place="margin">Tertull. praeſcrip. adv. haeret. 18. 37.</note> in which Hereticks were told, That they were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
to diſpute of the Scripture, <hi>becauſe without Scripture they
could be ſhewn, that Scripture is not for them;</hi> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
common between them and Scripture.</p>
            <p>And obſerve, if you pleaſe, That all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Societies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Churches newly reform'd, have kept this manner of
Inſtructing, Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> and I ſaid, That the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and others, were deceiv'd indeed
in believing themſelves the true Church; but all at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That there is nothing to examin after the true Church.</p>
            <p>There is no other manner of teaching the Faithful. If we
tell them, That they may underſtand the Holy Scripture bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than all the reſt of the Church together, we nouriſh Pride,
we take away Docility. None ſays it, but the Churches, which
call themſelves Reformed. Every where elſe they ſay, as we
do, That there is a true Church, which muſt be believ'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examining after her. This is believ'd not only in the
true Church, but alſo in thoſe, which imitate the true
Church.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> is the only Church, which ſays
it not. If the true Church, which ſoever ſhe is, ſays it; the
<hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> is not then the true Church, becauſe ſhe
ſays it not.</p>
            <p>Let them not tell us: The <hi>Ethiopian</hi> ſays it, the <hi>Greek</hi> ſays
it, the <hi>Armenian</hi> ſays it, the <hi>Roman</hi> ſays it; which ſhall I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
            <p>If your Doubt conſiſted in chooſing between the <hi>Roman</hi> and
the <hi>Greek,</hi> 'twould be neceſſary to enter into this Examen.
But now 'tis agreed in your Religion, That the <hi>Greek</hi> Church,
the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Church, and the reſt, are in the wrong againſt
the <hi>Roman;</hi> and if they were true Churches, you ought, in
leaving the <hi>Roman,</hi> which, as you ſay, was not, to have ſought
Communion with them.</p>
            <p>They are not then the true Church. No more are you:
For the true Church believes, That we muſt believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62471:32"/>
examining, what the true Church teaches. You teach the
contrary. You call your ſelves the true Church, and you ſay
at the ſame time, That one muſt examin after you: Which is
to ſay, That one may be damn'd in believing you. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
then from that time the Advantage of the true Church.
You are not the true Church: You muſt be left: 'Tis here the
Beginning muſt be. If any one in leaving you be tempted
to unite himſelf to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, he ſhall be anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> having heard theſe things, nothing
ſeem'd to me capable to trouble her, but the Habit contracted
from her Infancy, and the fear of afflicting her Mother, for
whom, I knew, ſhe had all the Tenderneſs, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
that ſuch a Mother deſerves. I alſo ſaw, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for the Reproaches, that were made her, of having hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Deſigns, and eſpecially of having delay'd the doubting of
her Religion, till after a Donation, made her by her Mother.
Your own Conſcience, ſaid I to her, beſt knows, in what
Condition you were, when this Donation was made you; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you had any Doubt, and ſuppreſt it in proſpect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
your ſelf this Advantage. I did not ſo much as think
of it, anſwer'd ſhe. You know well then, ſaid I to her, That
this Motive has not any part, in what you do. Continue
therefore in Peace; provide for your Salvation, and let Men
talk: For this Apprehenſion of having human Reſpects impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to you, is it ſelf a ſort of human Reſpect, and that of the
moſt delicate and moſt to be fear'd.</p>
            <p>She requeſted me to repeat in Mr. <hi>Coton</hi>'s Preſence, what had
been ſaid, through a Deſire, ſhe had, that he ſhould be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
with her. He was ſent for; we agreed on the Facts.
Mr. <hi>Coton</hi> with an extream Sweetneſs made me ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about the Doctrin, I had explicated. I anſwer'd them.
He told me, he was not exercis'd in Diſpute, nor vers'd in theſe
Matters. He ſaid true; he refer'd himſelf to Mr. <hi>Claude.</hi> I
pray'd GOD to enlighten him, and departed to return to my
Duty.</p>
            <p>After another Conference, which <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> and I
had at St. <hi>Germain</hi> in the Dutches of <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s Apartment,
ſhe told me, That ſhe believ'd her ſelf in condition to take her
Reſolution within a little while, and that there was nothing
more to do, But to pray GOD to conduct her well. The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62471:32"/>
was ſuch, as we wiſht. On the 22. of <hi>March</hi> I return'd
to <hi>Paris</hi> to receive her Abjuration. She made it in the Church
of the Reverend Fathers of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrin. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
I made her, tended only to repreſent to her, That
ſhe was returning into the Church, which her Fathers had
forſaken; That ſhe would not henceforth believe her ſelf more
capable than the Church, more illuminated than the Church,
and fuller of the Holy Ghoſt than the Church; That ſhe
would receive from the Church, without examining, the true
Senſe of the Scripture, as ſhe receiv'd from her the Scripture
it ſelf; That ſhe was henceforth going to build upon the Rock;
and that her Faith muſt fructify in good Works. She felt
the Conſolation of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Aſſiſtance was
edify'd by her good Example.</p>

            <p>YOU have ſeen in the Advertiſement, which is at

had read my Recital, he made an Anſwer to the

            </p>
            <p>I receiv'd from ſeveral Places, and even from the remoteſt
Provinces, this Writing of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s with his Relation:
but the perfecteſt and moſt correct Copy, I have ſeen, was
communicated to me by the Duke of <hi>Cheoreuſe,</hi> who had it
from a Lady of Quality of the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> Religion. I
have ſeen alſo in the ſame Duke's hands a Declaration, ſign'd
by Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> in which he owns all the Writing; ſo that it
cannot be doubted, but 'tis his.</p>
            <p>I find many things in this Writing, which manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all, that is read in mine. I pretend not to repeat here all
theſe things, nor anſwer to thoſe, in which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> appears to
me, through the weakneſs of his Cauſe, as little to agree with

be in the Hands of all People, ſo that every one may ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <head type="sub">On M. Claude's Anſwer to the Acts extracted from
the Diſcipline of the Pretended Reformed.</head>
               <p>MY Firſt Reflexion is upon the Anſwer, made by Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
to the Acts, extracted out of the Diſcipline of his Churches.
I made uſe of theſe Acts to ſhew, That 'twas ſo neceſſary for
all private perſons to ſubmit in Matters of Faith to the Churches
infallible Authority; That the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> who reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in ſpeculation, were at the ſame time forc't to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it in Practice. What is moſt preſſing in theſe Acts, is,
That to the National Synod alone, excluding Conſiſtories,
Colloquies, and Provincial Synods, is attributed <hi>the laſt and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reſolution by GODS Word.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſcip. ch. 5. Art. 31. vid. ſup. p. 13. Diſcip. ch. 9. Art, 3. Obſerv. p. 144. vid. ſup. p. 13.</note> But becauſe this is <hi>the laſt and
final Reſolution,</hi> the Churches and Provinces, ſending Deputies to
this Synod, ſwear ſolemnly <hi>to ſubmit to whatever ſhall be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in that Aſſembly, being perſwaded, that GOD will preſide in it
by his holy Spirit and his Word.</hi> Thus becauſe they believe an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Submiſſion, due to this ſupreme Sentence, when it ſhall
be pronounc'd, they ſwear to it, even before 'tis given; 'tis to
act conſequentially. But if after a Promiſe, confirm'd by ſo
ſolemn an Oath, they pretend, a Liberty is ſtill left them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin,
I confeſs, I know not, what Words ſignifie, and there
never was any mental Evaſion, ſo full of Illuſion and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>It may well be believ'd without my telling it, That the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
find themſelves preſt by ſo clear an Argument: In ſuch
Occaſions, where the Truth is diſcover'd with ſo much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the more one perceives the Difficulty, the more alſo
one finds himſelf embarraſs'd. So there is nothing more viſible
than the Perplexity, which appears in Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Anſwer; I
ſay even in his Anſwer, ſuch, as himſelf ſets it down in his
own Relation.</p>
               <p>He is reduc'd to ſay, That they make this Oath, becauſe
one ought to preſume well of ſuch an Aſſembly; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62471:35"/>
That theſe Words, <hi>We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

all,<note place="margin">1 Repl. p. 344. Chap. 35. p. 192. Nog. 2. p. ch. 23. p. 447. p. 298. Preſerv. art. 15. p. 286.</note> that can be anſwer'd. The <hi>Anonymus,</hi> who dedicated his
Book to Mr. <hi>Conrare,</hi> firſt made me this Anſwer. Another
<hi>Anonymus,</hi> whoſe Book is Entitled The <hi>Diſguiſement unmaske,</hi>
made it after him. Mr. <hi>Noguier</hi> and Mr. <hi>de Bruyes,</hi> other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
that anſwer'd the <hi>Expoſition,</hi> had only this to ſay. Mr.
<hi>Jurieux</hi> ſtuck to this Anſwer in his <hi>Preſervative,</hi> only explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
more plainly than the reſt, That all this Perſwaſion, which
ſerves for a Ground to the Oath, is a <hi>Clauſe of Civility, the
Terms whereof muſt not be abus'd.</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> had no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and this is the only one, which ſtill appears in his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Thus this ſo ſerious and ſolemn an Oath of all our <hi>Reformed</hi> and
their Churches in a Body to their National Synod is reduc'd to
this Propoſition, which would be in the bottom but an inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
Complement: <hi>We ſwear before GOD to ſubmit to all, that
you ſhall decide, if you decide by his Word, as we hope and preſume,
you will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why then is not this great Oath pronounc'd in theſe
Terms, but that they well ſaw, to reduce it to theſe Terms,
would be to ſay nothing, and they would ſay, or at leaſt ſeem
to ſay ſomething?</p>
               <p>For my part, the more I conſider, what is ſaid in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of <hi>the Pretended Reformed</hi> concerning this Oath of the
Churches, the farther I find it from the ſenſe, they would
give it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I find firſt, as I have obſerv'd in the Conference, That this
Oath is made only for the National Synod, that is, for the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
in which</hi> the laſt and final Reſolution is to be made by GODs
Word; <hi>and the National Synod of</hi> Caſtres <hi>has declar'd,</hi> That
there ſhould not be us'd in the Letters of Miſſion,<note place="margin">Diſc. ch. 9. Art. 3. Obſ. p. 144.</note> brought by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties

the reſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I effect, when I ſought in what this Difference conſiſted,
I found another ſort of Submiſſion for the Colloquies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62471:36"/>
Synods. 'Tis, that thoſe, who are accus'd to alter the
ſound Doctrin,<note place="margin">Diſc. ch. 8. Art. 3.</note> are <hi>antecedently</hi> oblig'd <hi>to make an expreſs Promiſe
not to ſeminate any of their Opinions before the meeting of the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy
or the Provincial Synod.</hi> 'Tis a Rule of Diſcipline and Policy.
But when they come to the Synod, in which <hi>this laſt and final
Reſolution is to be made,</hi> the particular perſons indeed reiterate
the ſame Promiſe; but they ſtop not there, the Churches in
Body add this great Oath of ſubmitting entirely to the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
being perſwaded, that GOD himſelf will be the Author
of it.</p>
               <p>A bare <hi>human Preſumption,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> calls it, a <hi>Clauſe of
Civility,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jurieux</hi> ſtiles it, cannot be the matter and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of an Oath: we alſo ſee, That not only private perſons,
but alſo Conſiſtories and whole Provinces, perceiv'd in this Oath
ſomething ſtronger, than they will at preſent let us underſtand
in it, inſomuch that they made a great Reſiſtance againſt it,
which could not be vanquiſht but by a long time, and the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
Decrees of National Synods.</p>
               <p>I ſee this Reſiſtance continue till the year 1631. In this
year and before I find almoſt continually in the National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
whole Provinces cenſur'd, becauſe their Deputation, or,
as they term it, their <hi>Envoy</hi> had not this Clauſe of Submiſſion.
The Churches were difficultly brought to make an Oath, ſo
little agreeable to the Doctrin, they were inſpir'd with, and
to ſwear, againſt the Principles of the new Reformation,
ſuch a Submiſſion to an Aſſembly, which after all, whatever
Name might be given it, was but an Aſſembly of Men, ſtill
(according to their Principles) liable to miſtake: but they
muſt paſs through it. They ſaid, they did nothing, if they
did not at laſt oblige men to an abſolute Submiſſion; and that
to leave them liberty to examin after the laſt and final Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was to nouriſh Pride, Diſſention, and Schiſm.</p>
               <p>Thus, againſt the Principles of the new Reformation, were
they fain to give other Idea's, and 'twas reſolv'd to ſtick unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably
to the Submiſſion and Oath in the Terms, we have
obſerv'd.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon, us'd by the Synod of <hi>Rochel</hi> to oblige the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
to <hi>this Clauſe of Submiſſion to ſuch things, as ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
in the National Synod,</hi> is, That <hi>'twas neceſſary to the Validity
of the Aſſemblies Concluſions.</hi> In the general to render the Acts
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62471:36"/>
of an Aſſembly valid, 'twould be ſufficient for thoſe, of whom
it ſhould be compos'd, to have a Power of bringing to it the
Suffrages of thoſe, that ſend them; and the Deputies as well
of the Colloquies, as of the Provincial Synods came always
furniſht with ſuch Powers. But there was ſomething more
ſtrong requir'd for the National Synod; and ſince <hi>the laſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
was to be made, to render ſuch an Act valid, and give
it all its force, 'twas thought neceſſary it ſhould be preceded by
a Submiſſion as abſolute, as the Reſolution ought to appear ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable.</p>
               <p>To this Deciſion of the Synod of <hi>Rochel</hi> that of <hi>Tonneins</hi>
added,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That <hi>the Submiſſion ſhould be promis'd in proper terms to all,
that ſhould be concluded, and decreed WITHO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T CONDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION
AND MODIFICATION.</hi> Now, this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a <hi>Clauſe of Civility,</hi> and a conditional Promiſe, that
might be made, if they would, not only to the Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
to the Colloquy, and Conſiſtory, but alſo to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Miniſter. Nevertheleſs they neither make it to theſe
particular Miniſters, nor to this Conſiſtory, nor to theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies,
nor to theſe Provincial Synods: why ſo, but to reſerve
ſomething peculiar and proper to the Aſſembly, where <hi>the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reſolution</hi> is to be made, after which there remains nothing
but to obey? But if all, that is here particular and proper,
be at the bottom only Words, was this worth employing the
Churches of the new Reformation, and five or ſix of their
National Synods?</p>
               <p>This is, what they ought to explicate, if they would ſay
any thing: yet they ſpeak not one word of it, thô this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
flies, as one may ſay, in their faces, and that I have
ſtarted it expreſly.</p>
               <p>In fine, To reduce my Argument in few words, every Oath
ought to be founded on a certain and known Truth. Now
this Promiſe made to the National Synod, and confirm'd by
the ſolemn Oath of all the <hi>Pretended Reformed Churches, We
ſwear and promiſe to follow your Deciſions, being perſwaded, that you
will judge well;</hi> this Promiſe, I ſay, which way ſoever it be
turn'd, has no Certainty, but in one of theſe two Senſes. The
firſt; <hi>We ſwear and promiſe to follow your Deciſions, if we find,
you judge well:</hi> a thing indeed very certain, but at the ſame
time illuſory, ſince there is no perſon on the earth, to whom
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62471:37"/>
one may not ſay as much; and as I obſerv'd in the Conference,
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> may ſay it to me, as well as I to him. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>We are ſo perſwaded, you will judge well, that we ſwear and
promiſe to follow your Deciſions;</hi> in which Caſe the Oath is falſe,
if we are not throughly aſſur'd, that the Aſſembly, 'tis made
to, cannot judge amiſs.</p>
               <p>All, the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> have now to do, is to chooſe,
which they will of theſe two Senſes, one of which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Illuſion, and the other, which ſeems alſo the only natural
Senſe, clearly ſuppoſes the Churches Infallibility.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt they anſwer here, That this Submiſſion reſpects
only publick Order and Diſcipline; for in matter of Faith a
Deciſion obliges to nothing leſs, than what the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſays,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>To believe with the Heart, and confeſs with the Mouth.</hi> And
our <hi>Reformed</hi> themſelves underſtand it ſo, when they declare in
their Diſcipline, That the Effect of this their National Synods
laſt and final Deciſion is,<note place="margin">Vid. ſup. p. 13.</note> That it <hi>may be acquieſc'd in from
point to point with an expreſs diſowning of the contrary Doctrin.</hi>
He then, who ſwears to ſubmit to a Deciſion, that ſhall be
made in an Aſſembly, ſwears to believe with his Heart, and
confeſs with his Mouth the Doctrin which ſhall be there
decided.</p>
               <p>But for the making this Promiſe, and confirming it with
an Oath, 'tis requiſite, the Aſſembly, 'tis made to, ſhould
have a Divine Promiſe of being aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt,
which is, That it ſhould be infallible.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> inſinuated in the Conference, That there was in
effect a Divine Promiſe, That <hi>thoſe, who ſought, ſhould find;</hi>
and that the Oath of his Churches might have its foundation
in this Aſſurance. But he will never by this Anſwer get out
of the Difficulty, he is in. For to render the Oath conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Promiſe, it muſt be conditional, as the Promiſe is:
and as JESUS CHRIST ſaid, <hi>If you ſearch well, you ſhall find,</hi>
the ſenſe of the Oath ſhould alſo be, <hi>If you do your Duty, we
will believe you;</hi> which would be to fall again into the pitiful
Illuſion, we have rejected.</p>
               <p>To the end then the Oath, we treat of, may be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
raſhneſs, it muſt be founded on an abſolute Promiſe from
GOD, on a Promiſe, which ſecures us even againſt the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delities
of men, ſuch as JESUS CHRIST makes his Church,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62471:37"/>
when he indefinitly and abſolutely aſſures her,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note> That <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As long as our <hi>Reformed</hi> ſhall perſiſt in denying, That the
Authority of the Churches Deciſions is founded on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
their Oath will be always an Illuſion, or a manifeſt
Raſhneſs; and they will find themſelves forc't either to defer
more, than they are willing, to the Churches Authority, or to
acknowledge, That they have by magnificent words impos'd
on the Peoples Credulity: ſince that after having diſtinguiſht
the Churches laſt Deciſion from all the reſt by ſo remarkable
a Character, and ſo particular a Proteſtation of Submiſſion,
'twill be found in the bottom, That this Submiſſion, confirm'd
by ſo ſingular an Oath, is of no other Nature or Kind, than
what is naturally due to all Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies, and every
lawful Paſtor; that is, one may always proceed from it to new
Doubts, and ſtill examin, <hi>after the laſt Reſolution,</hi> as after all the
reſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis thus indeed according to the Principles of the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
but the Principles of the new Reformation have
not been able to change the neceſſary Condition of Humani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

requires a final Deciſion, independent of all new Examination,
either General or Particular.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church is not exempt from this Law; and
the more regular ſhe is, the more her Conſtitution depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

even to the moſt ignorant women, ought to believe, that they
can underſtand the holy Scripture better than an Aſſembly,
compos'd of whatever is greateſt in that whole Church, which
he acknowledges to be the only one, where GOD is purely
ſerv'd; and not only better than this Aſſembly, but than all
the reſt of the Church, and than all, that he knows in the
whole Univerſe. This is, what Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> has acknowledg'd
to me; This is in Subſtance, what he ſtill ſays in his own
Relation; and this is, what every Miniſter, whether he will
or no, ſhall own in a Conference in the preſence of any one,
that ſhall deſire it, unleſs he obſtinately reſolves not to anſwer
poſitively: In which caſe he will be ſeen to ſhuffle, and this
Tergiverſation will be ſtronger than an Acknowledgment,
ſince 'twill not only ſhew, that the Acknowledgment is ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable,
but 'twill alſo make appear, that he is ſenſible of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Conſequences.</p>
               <p>And what I ſay of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> and every
other Miniſter will be forc'd to ſay of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
of the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of that of
<hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the reſt, which they and we receive with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
accord: And when they ſhall ſay it, they will ſay nothing
new, or unuſual in their Religion. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid it in formal
terms, when ſpeaking in general of all the Councils of the
precedent Ages,<note place="margin">4. Inſtit. c. 9.</note> he writ theſe words: <hi>I pretend not in this place,
that all the Councils muſt be condemn'd, and all their Decrees vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Nevertheleſs,</hi> proceeded he, <hi>you will object to me, that I ſo
order them, as to permit every one indifferently to receive or reject,
what the Councils ſhould have eſtabliſht; by no means, that's none of
my Intent.</hi> You would ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he were very far from it. The
Majeſty of Councils, and the Authority of ſo great a Name,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62471:39"/>
moves him at firſt; but the Conſequence of his Doctrin makes
him ſoon forget, what he ſeem'd willing to ſay to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
For ſee, how he concludes. <hi>When,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Authority
of a Council is alledg'd, I deſire firſt, it be conſider'd, in what time,
and for what cauſe it was aſſembled, and what Perſons aſſiſted at it;
afterwards, that the principal Point be examin'd according to the
Rule of the Scripture, ſo that the Councils Definition have its weight,
and be as a Prejudice, but that it hinder not the Examination.</hi>
This is, what all this careful Enquiry after Time, Matter, and
Perſons, in fine terminates in, to wit, That at what Time
ſoever a Council is held, what Matter ſoever is there treated,
and or what Perſons ſoever 'tis compos'd, <hi>every one indifferently,</hi>
for that was the Queſtion, ſhould examin the principal Point
by GODs Word, and believe, he can underſtand that Divine
Word better than all the Councils.</p>

of this Authors, ſince there is plac'd in the Front of his

Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> is one, to the end he may not ſay, I charge him

of hearing nothing, but the pure Words of the Apoſtles, See,
whither the Miniſters and the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> are forc'd by their Belief to carry the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Examen.</p>
               <p>There was nothing left, but to ſay, we muſt yet examin
after JESVS CHRIST, and that with all his Miracles, and
all the Authority, given him by his Father, he had not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to oblige men to follow him on his Word, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
examining: Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid it in our Conference, and ſays
it again in his Relation.</p>
               <p>I deſire the prudent Reader to believe, that in a Matter of
this importance, I will neither impoſe upon him, nor exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
Let him follow me only with attention, and he ſhall ſee
the Truth plainly appear.</p>
               <p>You have ſeen, how I objected in the Conference, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
there were acknowledg'd a living and ſpeaking Authority,
to which every particular Perſon is oblig'd to ſubmit without
examining, private Perſons would be brought to the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of believing, they could underſtand the Holy Scripture
better than all the Councils together, and than all the reſt of
the Church.</p>
               <p>To prove, that in this there was not any thing ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
or abſurd, Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> anſwer'd me, that in the time
when JESUS CHRIST was upon the Earth, the Caſe had
hapned, when a private Perſon ought to raiſe his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
above that of the Synagogue aſſembled, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62471:40"/>
JESUS CHRIST: That this was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sentiment of Pride, that 'twas the Act of a perfect
Faith.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer, I confeſs, ſtruck an Horror in me: For, to
make it good, one muſt ſay, That in the time, when the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue
judg'd JESUS CHRIST, and he himſelf was on the
Earth, there was not upon Earth any living and ſpeaking Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to which Men were oblig'd to ſubmit without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining:
So that one ought to examin after JESUS CHRIST,
it not being permitted to believe him on his Word. I made
this Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and ſhew'd him, That they were
then ſo far from a neceſſity of every ones determining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by a particular Examen, and ſetting himſelf above every
living and ſpeaking. Authority, that there was at that time
one, the greateſt, which ever was or could be, to wit, That
of JESUS CHRIST, and of the Truth it ſelf; to whom the
Father publickly bare Witneſs by a Voice from Heaven, by
the greateſt and moſt viſible Miracles, that were ever wrought,
and in fine, by the moſt reſplendent, as well as the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Means, the Divine Omnipotence could make uſe of.</p>
               <p>If I obſerve in the Conference, there was no Anſwer to this
Argument, 'tis very apparent, that in effect there ought to
be none. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> nevertheleſs in his Relation ſays, he
anſwer'd me, That JESUS CHRISTs Miracles made one of
the Matters in Queſtion; That there were falſe Miracles,
which <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> advis'd the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to take heed
of; That the Synagogue had judg'd JESUS CHRISTs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to be done in the Name of <hi>Beelze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ub;</hi> That <hi>in fine an
Authority decides nothing, till it be firſt receiv'd, and that JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST's was not ſo as yet, ſince 'twas in diſpute, whether they
ſhould receive it, or reject it.</hi> I am oblig'd to obſerve, That aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
I heard nothing of all this in the Conference; and you
will ſoon ſee, that it were indeed better to be ſilent, than to
ſay ſuch things. But ſince Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> will have ſaid them, he muſt
then alſo ſay, that, becauſe JESUS CHRISTs Miracles were
rejected as deceitful Signs by the Envious, by the Obſtinate, in
one word by the declar'd Enemies of the Truth, Theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were not convincing enough to oblige Men to believe
JESUS CHRIST on his Word without examining farther;
and that, for Example, after he had rais'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> in expreſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62471:41"/>
Teſtimony,<note place="margin">John xi. v. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>That GOD had ſent him,</hi> thoſe, who beheld, with
their Eyes ſo great a Miracle, were, I do not ſay permitted, but
expreſly oblig'd to examin, whether <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> was
ſent by GOD. He muſt, I ſay, carry the neceſſity of the
Examen to this exceſs: Otherwiſe 'twill be true, as I have
ſaid, That there was then a viſible and palpable Authority, to
which every one ought to ſubmit without examining; ſo that
there was never any time, when Men were leſs expos'd to the
Temptation of Pride by elevating themſelves above all living
and ſpeaking Authority, ſince <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> the moſt
living and moſt ſpeaking, as well as the greateſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
that ever was, was then on the Earth, and that they
preferr'd not themſelves before the Synagogue but by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> whoſe Miracles, as himſelf ſaid,
<hi>took away all Excuſe</hi> from thoſe,<note place="margin">John. xv. v. 22, 23, 24.</note> that believ'd not in him:
Which the Aſſembly, that condemn'd him, knew ſo well, that
they found no other Anſwer to his Miracles, nor any other
Means to reſiſt him, but to make him away, and with him
<hi>Lazarus</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">John xi. v. 47. &amp; xii. v. 10.</note> to ſtifle, if they could, at once with the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
they had ſeen, the Memory of him, that wrought them.</p>
               <p>They muſt not then here think to dazle People with frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Anſwers, and make the Readers loſe the Conſequence of
an Argument by bringing in unprofitable Queſtions. I mean,
That 'tis to no Purpoſe to ſtart up here the Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
deceitful Signs, nor to anſwer, That the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
doubted of the Truth of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
The Queſtion is only to know, whether this Doubt
was not the Effect of an evident Malice, and in fine, whether it
be not certain amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> That there was in <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST's</hi> Miracles ſo full a Demonſtration of the Divine
Power, and ſo clear a Confirmation of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST's</hi>
Miſſion, that every reaſonable Spirit was oblig'd to yield with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther Examination, ſo that there was then a living
and ſpeaking Authority, to which there was nothing to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
but a groſs Ignorance, and a manifeſt Obſtinacy. This
is the matter in Debate, and if after this Explication of the
Queſtion, they think ſtill to eſcape by ſaying with Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
That JESUS CHRIST's <hi>Authority was not receiv'd,</hi> they muſt
go farther,<note place="margin">John viii. v. 13.</note> and ſay to JESUS CHRIST himſelf with the <hi>Jews:
Thou beareſt Record of thy ſelf, thy Record is not true.</hi> Then we
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62471:41"/>
will anſwer with JESUS CHRIST:<note place="margin">John viii. v. 13, 14, 16, 18. John v. v. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Thô I bear Record of
my ſelf, yet my Record is true.</hi> And again: <hi>I am not alone, but
my Father, that ſent me, bears alſo Witneſs of me.</hi> And again:
<hi>The Works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame
Works that I do, bear Witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi>
And in fine:<note place="margin">C. xv. v. 22, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>They have no Cloak for their Sin: If I had not done
among them the Works which none other Man did, they had not had
Sin: but now they have both ſeen, and hated both me and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
The meaning of this is, That the Miracles are clear,
the Authority is inconteſtable, and the Reſiſtance can have no
other Ground but a blind Hatred.</p>
               <p>I expect, they will yet anſwer me, That JESUS CHRIST
added after all this:<note place="margin">John v. v. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Search the Scriptures, they are they which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
of me;</hi> and that they will dare to conclude from thence,
how one might and ought to examine after JESUS CHRIST,
ſo that the Word, he pronounc'd, ſhews us not a ſuperabundance
of Conviction in the Scripture, but an inſufficiency of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Perſon of JESUS CHRIST. If they make yet
this Objection, we have nothing to do, but to hold our Peace,
and leave JESUS CHRIST to defend his own Cauſe.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we will conclude, That 'tis JESUS
CHRISTs Authority, which we revere in his Church. If we
ſay, the Church muſt be believ'd without examining, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
JESUS CHRIST, who teaches and guides her, is above
all Examen. We will not forbear to ſay alſo in imitation of
JESUS CHRIST, <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> We ſhall confound
them by this Scripture, which they ſay, they believe, and we
ſhall ſee them alſo faint under this Examination, but it ſhall
be, after we have forc'd them to acknowledge, that we muſt
ſubmit, without examining, to the Churches Authority, in
which that Spirit, whom JESUS CHRIST has ſent to keep
his place, always ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>There is then nothing leſs to the Purpoſe than the Example
of the Synagogue, and our <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> depriv'd of this
Example, which was their chiefeſt Strength, continue alone
to believe themſelves, every one in particular, capable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the holy Scripture better than whatſoever in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
has Authority to interpret it, and to judge of Doctrin,
and than all the Faithful, that appear to them in the Worl'd:
Which is the Error of the Independents, or ſomething worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62471:42"/>
They will ſay, That this private Perſon, who examins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Church, ſhall always be well aſſur'd not to be alone
in his Sentiment, ſince there will always remain ſome ſecret
elected one, who will think, as he does: As if, without refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Viſion, it were not a Pride deteſtable enough to ſet
himſelf alone above all, that is ſeen and heard to ſpeak in the
whole Church beſides. They will ſay again: 'Tis no Pride
to believe ones ſelf enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt. But on the
contrary, 'tis the height of Pride, That particular Perſons
ſhould dare to believe, the Holy Ghoſt will inſtruct them,
and leave in Error all the Faithful, that appear in the reſt of
the Church. Nor is it to any purpoſe to anſwer, as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
does in his Relation,<note place="margin">John iii. v. 8.</note> in his Relation, That <hi>the Spirit bloweth, where he will:</hi> For
they muſt ſhew, that this Spirit which repoſes on the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ceaſes not to breath on thoſe, who believe themſelves
alone more capable to underſtand the Scripture, than all the
reſt of the Church, ſince they examin after her; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to breath upon them, but himſelf alſo to inſpire into them
this proud Thought. But in fine, however it is, and without
diſputing any farther, ſince this is no place for it, we have
ſhewn, that 'tis a Doctrin acknowledg'd in the new Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That every particular Perſon ought to examin after the
Church, and conſequently ought to believe, That he may
happen to underſtand the Scripture better than ſhe and all
her Aſſemblies. Thoſe, that abhor this Preſumption, or that
upon Examination find not in themſelves this falſe Capacity,
have no more to do, but to ſeek their Salvation in another
Church than that, in which ſo prodigious a Doctrin is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd.</p>

               <p>THE ſecond Abſurdity, I promis'd to make Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
and every good <hi>Proteſtant</hi> avow, is, That unleſs there
be acknowledg'd in the Church an Authority, after which
there muſt be no more examining nor doubting, there is a
Neceſſity of ſetting a Point of time, in which the Believer at
the Age of Reaſon cannot make an Act of Faith upon the
Scripture, and in which conſequently he muſt doubt, whether
it be true or falſe. I aſſign'd for this Point of Doubt all the
time, in which a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> for what cauſe ſoever, has not read
the Holy Scripture. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> here cries out againſt ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
a Propoſition; and I perſiſt to ſay, That he not only
own'd it in the Conference, but alſo that, in what manner
ſoever he here endeavours to turn things, he has not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do it ſo well, but that he ſtill confeſſes it in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In truth, this is one of the Places, in which I leaſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
our exact Words. But there is ſtill enough to convince
him, ſince if this Relation becomes publick, every one will ſee,
he here acknowledges in formal Terms,</hi> That he, who has not yet
read the Holy Scripture, believes it to be GODs Word with human
Faith, becauſe his Father told him ſo, which is the State of a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen;</hi>
and when he has himſelf read this Book, and felt the
Efficacy of it, he believes it to be GODs Word, no longer with an
human Faith, becauſe his Father told him ſo, but with a divine
Faith, becauſe he has himſelf immediatly felt its Divinity, and this
is the State of a Believer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:62471:43"/>
'Tis then true, that he has acknowledg'd the Time, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to ſhew, when a Baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is not in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to make an Act of Supernatural and Divine Faith upon
the Holy Scripture, ſince he believes it to be GODs Word
only by an human Faith, and divine Faith cannot come till
after the reading of it.</p>
               <p>In what manner ſoever he turns this human Faith, 'tis an
horrible thing, that a Baptiz'd <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> at the Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
cannot make upon the Scripture an Act of that Faith,
by which we are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For thence it follows, That a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> at his firſt going to read the holy Scripture, ought
neither to be inclin'd of himſelf, or induc'd by any other, to
ſay at opening it. <hi>I believe, as I believe that GOD is, that the
Scripture, I am going to read, is his Word.</hi> On the contrary
they muſt make him ſay: <hi>I am going to examin, whether hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
during the reſt of my life, I ought to read this Scripture
with ſuch a Faith.</hi> 'Tis to overthrow the whole Order of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
'tis to loſe the Fruit of Baptiſm; 'tis to reduce Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to inſtruct their Children, as if they were not
ſo, and that they were yet to deliberate, of what Religion
they ſhould be.</p>
               <p>And what Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſays concerning the Scripture, the
ſame he muſt ſay on the Faith of the Trinity, on that of the
Incarnation, on that of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRISTs</hi> Miſſion, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Mankind. For that, which forces Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> and
every <hi>Proteſtant</hi> to ſay, That the Believer, who has not read
the holy Scripture, can believe it only with an human Faith to
be inſpir'd by GOD, is, That otherwiſe they muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
an Act of Divine Faith on the Churches ſole Authority:
Which would be to own this Authority as infallible, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the very Foundations of all the new Reformation. But the
ſame Argument returns upon all the Articles of our Faith; and
if the Faithful can believe with a divine Faith, both the Trinity
and the Incarnation and Miſſion of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> on the
ſole Authority of the Church, and before he has read the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, I ſhall always conclude with equal Certainty,
That the Churches Authority will be infallible. By the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
then of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s and all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Principle,
we muſt in reducing the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who go to read the holy
Scripture, to a bare human Faith concerning this Scripture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62471:43"/>
them at the ſame time to the like on the moſt Eſſential
Articles of our belief.</p>
               <p>This was not the Method of our Forefathers; they did
not thus teach <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to inſtruct their Children. When they
baptiz'd them in their Infancy, they ſaid in that young Age
<hi>Credo, I believe.</hi> No matter, thô our Reformers have chang'd
this Form; 'twas us'd in the very firſt Ages, and will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
holy and venerable, maugre all they can do. But this
Form, us'd towards Children, ſhews us, that when they ſhall
have the uſe of Reaſon, they muſt be immediatly taught to
make an Act of Faith, and time muſt not be loſt in exciting
them to it. They will then be capable of it: they may ſay
the ſame Creed, they ſhould have ſaid, if they had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
at the Age of Underſtanding; and to reduce them to
a Faith barely human, is to take from them the Grace of their
Baptiſm, and juſtify the Practice, as well as the Doctrin of the
<hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I conjure the Gentlemen of the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
not to believe, that I alledge here the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> by
way of exaggeration, or to render them odious: theſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are not beſeeming <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> I am ready to make good,
that the Doctrin, taught here by Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and which all
Proteſtants muſt teach with him, introduces <hi>Anabaptiſm.</hi> For
if the Acts of divine Faith muſt be held in ſuſpenſe, till ſuch
time as one has read the holy Scripture, and be inſtructed by
himſelf; if all the Acts, that precede this Inſtruction, are not
Acts of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> ſince they have for their foundation only an
human Faith: for the ſame reaſon Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <head type="sub">On Mr. Claude's objecting the ſame Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to us about the Church, as we do to him
about the Scripture.</head>
               <p>'TIS in vain for Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> to anſwer us, That he will make
us the ſame Argument for the Church, as we make him
for the Scripture: for, to do this, as we ſhew him a point of
time, which even at the uſe of Reaſon neceſſarily precedes the
Reading of the Scripture, he muſt alſo be able to ſhew us
one, that precedes the Churches Inſtructions: but this he will
never find. Whatever he does, we ſhall always mark him a
a Point of time, before the reading of the Scripture, which is
that, when the Church puts it into our hand: but before the
Church there is nothing; ſhe prevents all our Doubts by her
Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>'Tis an Error to imagin, that we muſt always examin, before
we believe. The Happineſs of thoſe, who are born, as I
may ſay, in the Boſom of the true Church, is, That GOD has
given her ſuch an Authority, that we believe at firſt what ſhe
propoſes, and that Faith precedes, or rather excludes Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>To ask now, by what Motives GOD makes us ſenſible of
his Churches Authority, is to depart viſibly from the Queſtion.
He wants not Motives to faſten his Children to his Church,
to which he has given ſo particular and ſo reſplendent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.
This very thing, that of all the Societies in the
world ſhe is the ſole, to whom none can ſhew her beginning,
or any interruption of her viſible and exterior State by any
averr'd Fact, whilſt ſhe ſhews all other Societies, that envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
her, theirs by Facts, which themſelves cannot deny; this
very thing is a ſenſible Character, that gives an inviolable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to the true Church. GOD wants not Motives to make
his Children perceive this ſo particular Character of his Church.
But whatever theſe Motives are, not to foreſtall them here,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62471:44"/>
this being no place for it, 'tis certain, that there are ſome;
ſince that in fine we muſt be able to believe on the Churches
word, before we have read the holy Scripture, and that in the
firſt Inſtruction, we receive, without ſpeaking of the Scripture,
we are taught to ſay, as a fundamental Act of our Faith, <hi>I believe
the Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> tells us, that to authorize the Method, by which
we pretend to lay the Churches Faith as the Foundation of all
the reſt, the Creed ſhould have begun with ſaying, I believe
the Church; whereas it is begun with ſaying, <hi>I believe in GOD
the Father, and in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, and in the Holy

which teaches us the whole Creed; that 'tis on her word we
ſay, <hi>I believe in GOD the Father, and in JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST
his only Son,</hi> and the reſt; which we cannot ſay with a firm Faith,
unleſs GOD at the ſame time puts in our Hearts, that the
Church, which teaches us, deceives us not. After then we have
on her word ſaid, <hi>I believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in
the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and begun our Profeſſion of Faith by the Divine
Perſons, whom their Majeſty places above all, we add an holy
Reflection on the Church, which propoſes to us this Belief,

               <head type="sub">On Mr. Claude's alledging here the Practice of
the Greek Church, and the like: which is only
to embroil the matter, and not to reſolve the
Difficulty.</head>
               <p>'TIS to ſhew a deſire of embroling matters, to alledge here
with Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the
<hi>Egyptian,</hi> or <hi>Aethiopick,</hi> and that of the <hi>Cophti,</hi> and ſo many
others, which brag no leſs of being the true Church, than the
<hi>Roman</hi> does. Thoſe, ſay they, who are bred up in theſe
Churches, revere their Authority, every one of theſe Churches
has Followers, as zealous, as ours: True and pure zeal has
no ſenſible Mark: every one attributes his, as we do, to the
Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, and reſting on the Authority of the
Church, in which he is, ſays, That the Holy Ghoſt makes
uſe of this Authority to guide him to the Belief of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and all the Verities of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in a manner Mr. <hi>Claude's</hi> Objection; and thus ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
when Men cannot free themſelves, they endeavour to
caſt others into the like Perplexity as theirs. But he will gain
nothing by this Addreſs: for in fine what cauſe does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to combat for? is it for indifferency of Religions? Will
he ſay with the wicked, that there is not a true Church, in
which men indeed act by divine Motions? And under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that the Devil, or, if he pleaſes, Nature can imitate,
or, to ſay better, counterfeit theſe Motions, will he maintain,
that they are every where imaginary? GOD forbid: we will
both of us avoid this Rock. He will avow then with me,
that there is a true Church, which ſoever it is, where the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt acts, thô by looking only on the exterior, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
always ſo eaſily diſcern, who thoſe are, in whom he
dwells. Hitherto we are agreed; let us ſee now, how far
we can go together. We agree that there is one true
Church, in which the Holy Ghoſt acts; we agree, that he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62471:45"/>
makes uſe of exterior Means, to put the Truth in our Hearts;
we agree, that he makes uſe of the Church, and of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Our queſtion is to know by which he begins, whether
by the Scripture or by the Church; whether, I ſay, he makes
us believe the Church by the Scripture, or rather makes us
believe the Scripture by the Church. I ſay, that the Holy
Ghoſt begins by the Church; and it muſt be ſo, ſince 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
the Church, that puts the Scripture in our hands.
Nevertheleſs Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> leaves me here, and begins to walk
alone; but he falls at the very firſt ſtep into a Precipice.
For his Fear of acknowledging an infallible Authority in the
true Church, and of believing, that on her word we may make
an Act of divine and ſuper-natural Faith concerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
obliges him to ſay, that 'tis not poſſible to begin the
reading of the Holy Scripture by ſuch an Act of Faith; and
that every Act of Faith, which precedes this Reading, is an
Act of human Faith. See the deporable Condition, in which
he puts a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> at his firſt going to read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> cannot get forth of this Abyſs without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the place, where he began to leave me, and ſaying
afterwards with me, that there is a true Church, whereſoever
ſhe is, the veneration of which the Holy Ghoſt firſt inſpires
into true Believers; that by this Veneration, which he at firſt
puts in their Hearts, he fixes them to the Scripture, which this
Church preſents them; that this Church requires alſo of all
thoſe, ſhe can inſtruct, that they adore upon her word the
infallible Truth of this Scripture, and acknowledges not for
her Children thoſe, which have only an human Faith for it.</p>
               <p>But, ſay they, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not the ſole, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to her ſelf this Authority: the <hi>Greek,</hi> and other
Churches will have one believe them on their word, and teach,
that this is the Means to read the Holy Scripture with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of a divine Faith. And well, if it be ſo, it remains
only to chooſe between theſe Churches. But then the
<hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Church is gone at the very firſt bruſh; ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades
her ſelf, as I may ſay, from the Title of the Church,
ſince ſhe finds not in her ſelf Authority enough to cauſe all
thoſe, whom ſhe begins to inſtruct, to make an Act of a
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and an Act of divine Faith, not even on the Truth
of the Scripture, whence 'tis ſuppos'd, ſhe ought to learn all
the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:62471:46"/>
But Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> asks, how one ſhall chooſe between theſe
Churches. Shall it be by Enthuſiaſm? It would be by Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,
as I have obſerv'd in the Conference, if the true Church
had not her particular Characters, that diſtinguiſh her from
others. She has, without going any farther, or ſearching any
deeper, her Succeſſion, in which none can ſhew her by any
poſitive Fact Interruption, Innovation, or Change. This is,
what no falſe Church can ſo clearly glory of, as the true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by glorying of it ſhe would viſibly condemn her ſelf.
There will be then always in the Inſtruction, which the
true Church ſhall give her Children concerning her Condition,
ſomething, that no other Sect can, or dare ſay. 'Tis by this,
we would convince, if it were in queſtion, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians,</hi>
the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and other Sects, which ſeem in this
reſpect more deceiving becauſe of the apparence of Succeſſion,
that they ſhew; which alſo makes them way to attribute to
themſelves with a little more ground the Authority of the
Church. But as for the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Church, there is an end of her,
becauſe ſhe has not ſo much as an apparent and tolerable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and that ſhe dares not, as we have now ſhewn by Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi>'s acknowledgment, attribute to her ſelf this Authority,
without which there can neither be any certain Inſtruction, nor
any aſſur'd Foundation of Divine Faith, nor in fine any
Church.</p>
               <p>'Twould be then in vain for us to loſe time here in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> the Succeſſion, they brag of.
'Twould be no great Labor to ſhew them the exact Moment
of their Innovation. The <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> know it as well
as we, and can themſelves ſhew it them, when they pleaſe:
So when they proſs us to do it, 'tis not that they think to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
us in a thing impoſſible, or even obſcure and difficult:
but 'tis in a word, that in ſo bad a cauſe there is always ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
got by digreſſing, and making the conſequence of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
be loſt.</p>
               <p>Thus I had reaſon to tell <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> in one of the
Inſtructions of this Book, that, if any one, diſguſted with the
<hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Church, was tempted to embrace the Religion of the
<hi>Cophti,</hi> or of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 'twould be then time to ſhew them in
theſe Churches that inevitable Moment of their Novelty, which
they can no more de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, than can the other Sects: but ſince the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62471:46"/>
                  <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> with whom we have to do, agree it, and that none
thinks of leaving them, but to come to us, when we oblige any
one to leave them, by ſhewing from their Miniſters own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
the enormous Abſurdities of their Doctrin, the work is
perfected, and all the reſt on that occaſion would be to no
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And to the end the Method of the Conference, and the State
of the Queſtion, which is there treated, may be throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
it did not aim directly to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
but only to ſhew, that there is ſome-where or other a true
Church, to which we muſt ſubmit without examining; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that this cannot be the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Church, ſince ſhe
will her ſelf have one examin after her; which makes her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Abſurdities, we have remark't, and by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
loſe the Title of the Church.</p>
               <p>This done, there's no more queſtion to preach the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, that is, that Body of the Church, of which <hi>Rome</hi> is
the Head; ſince to him, that will chooſe between two Churches,
the excluding of the one is the eſtabliſhing of the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any need of diſputing farther for this purpoſe. Beſides
that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſo evidently beare theſe Characters of
the true Church, that there is ſcarce any man of good Senſe,
even amongſt our <hi>Reformed,</hi> but agrees, that, if there be in the
world an Authority, to which we muſt ſubmit, 'tis that of this
Church.</p>
               <p>But however, when one ſees the Abſurdities, one is forc'd to
own in <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> for want of having acknowledg'd in the
Churches Authority the true Principles of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Inſtruction,
one ſoon retires from a Church, whoſe Method and Inſtruction
is ſo manifeſtly defective; and one is ſufficiently ſollicited by
the Remains of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which one feels within himſelf, to
return to the Church, from whence he departed.</p>

               <head type="sub">On Mr. Claude's reducing, as much as he can,
this Diſpute to the Inſtruction of Children.</head>
               <p>VVE ſee in Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Diſcourſes, that preſs'd by this
want of Authority, which ruins all Inſtruction in
his Church, he affects to reduce our Diſpute to the Inſtruction
of Children, and thinks he has found an Advantage by making
this Inſtruction depend on Parents and Nurſes, who are better
known at that Age than the Church and her Miniſters. By
this means he thinks to conceal from us the Churches Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the firſt Exerciſes and firſt Acts of Faith, we make; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have read the Holy Scripture. But he ought firſt to
conſider, that the Argument, I made him, regarded not only
Children: Children are not the only <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that have not
read the Scripture. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> is not ignorant, that there were
in the beginning of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> not only particular men, but
alſo whole Nation, which, according to the Report of St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
had not the Holy Scripture, and without reading it ceas'd
not to be true <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Debate then between us is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
concerning all thoſe, that have not read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of what Age ſoever they may be, and what way ſoever
they may have hapned not to have read it. For 'tis of thoſe,
and if they will, 'tis of thoſe, whom St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> mentions, or of
their like, that I enquire concerning the Faith, with which they
believe the Scripture, and prepare to read it, as being inſpir'd
by GOD. If they have but an human Faith, as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
ſays, they are not <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and if they have a Divine Faith,
as muſt be acknowledg'd, unleſs we will fall into an horrible
Abſurdity, 'tis then true, that Divine Faith, without ones ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read the Scripture, immediatly follows the Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
and eſtabliſhes her infallible Authority. 'Tis on this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who takes the Scripture in hand,
begins by believing with a firm Faith, that all, he is going
to read, is Divine: and he ſtays not his believing the truth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62471:47"/>
of this Scripture, till he has read it all; he believes the firſt
Chapter, before he has read the ſecond, and he believes all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he has read the firſt Letter, or ſo much as open'd the
Book. He forms not then his Faith by the reading of the
Scripture: this Reading finds his Faith already form'd: this
Reading does but confirm to a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> all he already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
and all, he had already found in the Churches Belief.
He believ'd then before all things, that the Church deceiv'd
him not; and by this he began to make the Acts of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
Children are not inſtructed in any other manner. When they
hear their Parents, 'tis the Church, they hear, for our Parents
are our Teachers, only as they are Children of the Church.
'Tis for this reaſon the Holy Ghoſt ſends us to them: <hi>Ask thy
Father and he will ſhew thee; thy Elders and they will tell thee.</hi>
St. <hi>Baſil,</hi>

                  <hi>which dwelt firſt in his Grandmother</hi> Lois, <hi>and his
Mother</hi> Eunice. The meaning is that true Doctrin ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to deſcend from hand to hand, and that there ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be a true Church, to which none can ever ſhew her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
nor find in her State thoſe Marks of Interruption and
Novelty, which all other Sects bear on their Front. <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Parents, joyn'd to this Church, joyn their Children to her,
and put them at the feet of her Miniſters to be there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be imagin'd, that Children, in whom Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to appear, becauſe they know not how to rank their
Diſcourſes, are incapable of reſenting the Impreſſions of Truth.
They are ſeen learn to ſpeak in an Age, yet more infirm: in
what manner they learn, by what they make the Diſtinction
between the Noun and the Verb, the Subſtantive and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,
neither themſelves know, nor can we, who have learnt
by this Method, well explicate, ſo deep and hidden it is. We
learn almoſt in the ſame manner the Churches Language. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Light guides us in both theſe States: in the one 'tis Reaſon,
in the other Faith. Reaſon diſcovers it ſelf by little and little,
and ſo does Faith infus'd by Baptiſm. We muſt have Motives
to fix us to the Churches Authority, GOD knows them, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62471:48"/>
we know them in general: in what manner he ranks them,
how he makes theſe innocent Souls perceive them, is the Secret
of his Holy Spirit. However 'tis certain, that this is done, and
by this he begins. As this is the firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Act, we make,
and as on this Foundation all is built, ſo it ſubſiſts for ever.
The time will come, when we ſhall know more diſtinctly, why
we believe; and the Churches Authority will from day to day
become ſtronger in our minds. The Scripture it ſelf will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
the Chains, which bind us to her: but we muſt always
have Recourſe to the Original, that is, to believe on the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Authority. What Age ſoever we are at, 'tis by this we
begin to believe the Scripture; we continue alſo on the ſame
Foundation; and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was already perfect in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Science,<note place="margin">Cont. Ep. Fudam. 5.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>He would not believe the Goſpel,
if the Authority of the Catholick Church did not oblige him to it.</hi> I
could, were it in diſpute, ſhew the ſame Opinion in the other
Fathers. We muſt always re-aſcend to the firſt Principle, and
this is the firſt Principle, that fixes us to the Church. Let them
not reproach to us this Vicious Circle: The Church makes us
believe the Scripture, the Scripture makes us believe the Church.
This on both ſides is true in different Reſpects. The Church
and the Scripture are ſo made for one another, and do ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
ſuit with one another, that they ſupport each other, like
Stones in an Arch, which mutually keep up the Building. All
Nature is full of ſuch Examples. I bear the Staff on which I
lean: the Fleſh binds and covers the Bones, which ſuſtain it:
and all things in the whole Univerſe mutually aid one another.
So it is with the Church and the Scripture. There was but
one Church, ſuch as <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> founded, to which
ſuch a Scripture, as we have, could be addreſs'd; that is, ſuch
an one, as durſt promiſe the Church, in which this Scripture
was made, an eternal continuance. If any one receives the
Scripture, by the Scripture I will prove to him the Church;
if he acknowledges the Church, by the Church I will prove
to him the Scripture: but ſince we muſt begin on one ſide, I
have clearly enough ſhewn by Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Confeſſion, that, if
we begin not by the Church, the Divinity of the Scripture, and
the Faith, we ought to have in it, is in Danger. Wherefore the
Holy Ghoſt begins our Inſtruction by fixing us to the Church;
<hi>I believe the Catholick Church.</hi> Amongſt our Adverſaries one muſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62471:48"/>
examin, before he believes; and he muſt before all things exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
the Scripture, by which he examins all the reſt. 'Tis not
enough to have read ſome particular Verſes, ſome Chapters,
ſome Books: till ſuch time as one has read all, conferr'd all,
examin'd all, Faith continues in ſuſpenſe, ſince 'tis by this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that 'tis form'd. Amongſt the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> one believes

Increaſe: ſo is may Faith increas'd—and this is not a Change, in which
one paſſes from worſe to better, but an Accompliſhment of a Work
already begun, and the Confirmation of Faith by knowledge:</hi> In this
manner we paſs not, as amongſt our <hi>Reformed,</hi> from a State of
doubt to a State of Certainty; or, as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> loves better to
ſpeak, from an human Faith to a divine. Divine Faith is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
at firſt by the Churches firſt Inſtructions; and this could
never be, did not her infallible Authority prevent all our Doubts,
and all Examination.</p>
               <p>'Tis thus,<note place="margin">Cont. ep. Man. 4.</note> as ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> 'tis thus, I ſay, That <hi>thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
who not being able to arrive at Vnderſtanding, ſecure their
Salvation by the ſimplicity of their Faith.</hi> If we muſt always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
before we believe, we muſt begin by examining, whether
there is a GOD, and hearkning for ſome time, with a kind of
Suſpenſion of Mind, to the Arguments of the Wicked: That
is, we muſt paſs to the Belief of the Divinity through Atheiſm,
ſince Examination and Doubt is a Spice of it. But 'tis not
ſo: GOD has plac'd his Mark in the World, which is the
Work of his Hands, and by this divine Mark he imprints in
Souls, before all Doubts, the Sentiment of his Divinity. In
like manner he has plac'd his Mark in his Church, the moſt
perfect work of his Wiſdom. By this Mark the Holy Ghoſt
makes the true Church known to the Children of GOD, and
this ſo particular Character, which diſtinguiſhes her from all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62471:49"/>
other Aſſemblies, gives her ſo great an Authority, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heſitating we admit before all Opinions, not only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Children of the true Church inſtructed; thoſe, that are edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in a ſtrange Church, as ſoon as they perceive her waver
in any part whatever of her Inſtruction, ought to ſtretch forth
their Arms to the Church, which has reaſon never to waver,
becauſe ſhe has never vary'd nor waver'd; and they find, they
ought to return into it, becauſe none ſhould ever have gone

               <p>THere is a Part of the Conference, which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> paſſes
over in four Words. 'Tis that, where I ſhew him the
horrible State of his Church, which ſet it ſelf up, after the
Example of all falſe Churches, by ſeparating from all the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, that were in the World, and without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Church, which thought, as ſhe did, at the time of
her Eſtabliſhment: So that ſhe was not joyn'd by any Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
either to the time, that went before, or to any Church,
which appear'd then in the World. This Fact paſs'd for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident;
and how ſhort ſoever Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> has been in the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of this Part, he ſays enough to ſhew, That in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this important Fact, he has only endeavour'd to cover the
Shame of ſuch a Condition by the Example of the Apoſtles,
when they ſeparated from the Synagogue.</p>
               <p>I will not repeat, what I ſaid on this Subject: You have
ſeen it in the Conference, and Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> who relates but one
Word of it, does not oblige me to any new Exaplanation. I ſhall
only ſay, That he gives a very falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of this part of the
Diſpute. <hi>The Company,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was riſen, and the Converſation,
which continu'd yet ſome time, became much more confus'd, and we
diſcours'd of divers things.</hi> I know not; why Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> will have
our Converſation to have been confus'd; it was not ſo in any
part; and 'twas leſs ſo, if it were poſſible, in this, than in the
reſt. 'Tis true, we were riſen, and Part of the Company was
withdrawn; but Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> and I ſtood firm before each other.
<hi>Mademoiſello de Duras</hi> ſeem'd to have redoubled her Attention,
and after ſo many Principles declar'd, the Diſpute became more
quick, and more concluding than ever. If we ſpake of divers
Matters, it was not ramblingly, and all tended to the ſame End.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62471:50"/>
It may be ſeen by reading it; and if Credit will not be given
to me in this behalf, when Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſhall publiſh his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'twill appear, that the little, he ſays, naturally requires
all, that I recite. So it is, that the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> were
averr'd, in eſtabliſhing their Church, to have done contrary, to
what the Orthodox ever did, and preciſely, what all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

have done; and Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> preſs'd upon this matter, cannot
in all the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſhew one only Church, truly
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> founded, as the Churches of the new Reformation.</p>
               <p>It may now be judg'd, what likelihood there is, that what
all Hereticks have done contrary to the Practice of all the
Orthodox, can ever be authoriz'd by the Example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
when they ſeparated from the Synagogue. But ſince
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> places the ſtrength of his Defence in this Example,
I deſire him to add to the evident Facts, I alledg'd to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

could keep either its exterior Form, or even any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of its ancient State: that GOD, who would in fine

in this ungrateful People, by a manifeſt Reprobation,
with the Sacrifice and Prieſthood, all the Marks of the Church,
ſo that 'tis apparent, the Synagogue with its Temple fell to
ruin, before the Children of GOD departed from it: that he
was then ſo far from leaving any hope to this People, as he
had done in the ancient Tranſmigration and Ruin of the firſt
Temple, that he had on the contrary given all the Marks of an
implacable Anger: that to the end ſuch a Fall of his heretofore

Fall and Divorce to be foretold by all his Prophets, as a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Example of his wrath: and had at the ſame time prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
that no ſuch thing ſhould ever befal that Church, with
which he made an eternal Covenant; that beſides all this, and
thô the Reprobation of the Synagogue was clearly explicated
in the Scripture, and thô the Apoſtles, without making any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
in the Doctrin, did but follow him, who had til their
time been always without any Interruption expected, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
becauſe there was in this Action ſome Rupture with the

it, there was no leſs requir'd, than <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>

this Diviſion. He divides alſo his Anſwer into two parts: the
firſt is ſubdivided into four queſtions. In the firſt he treats of
the Univerſal Church, which the Creed ſpeaks of, and blames
me for not having comprehended in it with all the Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
the Saints, which ſhall be born even to the end of the
World. In the ſecond he examins, whether the Church can
be defin'd by her exterior Communion, as he ſuppoſes, I have
done. He ſpeaks in the third of the Churches perpetual Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility;
and ſeeks in the fourth, to what Church <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRISTs</hi> Promiſes belong, whether to that, I have ſetled,

from the Doctrin, he has explicated; and paſſes
to the ſecond Part, the Objections, taken from the Book of the
Kings. This is the <hi>Idea</hi> of his work.</p>
               <p>'Tis in theſe four Queſtions, and theſe eleven Conſequences,

               <p>He will find there,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that 'tis of the Eſſence of the Church,
becauſe ſhe is holy, <hi>to teach always, conſtantly, and without vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an holy Doctrin;</hi> but he will find, that this holy Doctrin,
<hi>which ſhe inceſſantly teaches, continually brings forth Saints in her

the Elect of GOD.</hi> Do they call this a bare Profeſſion of
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRISTs</hi> Doctrin without reality, and a meet

               <p>He will find,<note place="margin">Sup. p. 7. &amp; ſeq.</note> that Hell cannot prevail againſt the viſible and
exterior Society of the Church: but he will find alſo, that 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>it cannot prevail againſt the Elect, who are the pureſt and moſt
ſpiritual part of this Church.</hi> 'Tis, I ſay, <hi>becauſe it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt the Elect, that it cannot prevail againſt the Church,
which teaches them, in which they confeſs the Goſpel, and receive the
Sacraments.</hi> Thus inſtead of believing, that this Church, which
ſubſiſts eternally, can according to our Principles ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Elect: 'tis on the contrary ſeen, that we conſider the
Elect, as making the moſt eſſential Part and Strength of this
Church.</p>
               <p>He will find, that 'tis of the Eſſence of the Church till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Reſurrection,<note place="margin">Sup. p. 9, 10.</note> to have the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery, which
renders her viſible: but he will find; alſo that the effect of
this Miniſtery is to bring the Children of <hi>GOD</hi> to the perfect
Stature of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> that is, to Perfection, which,
after it has rendred them holy, will render them glorious both
in Body and Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine he will find there</hi> the exterior and interior Communion
of the Faithful with <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sup. p. 11.</note> and of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
amongſt themſelves: the interior Communion by Charity, and in
the Holy Ghoſt, who animates us; but at the ſame time the exterior
Communion in the Sacraments, in the Confeſſion of Faith, and in all
the exterior Miniſtery of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whence I concluded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that 'tis not only the Society of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate,
which ſhall ſubſiſt for ever: but that 'tis the viſible Body,
in which the Predeſtinate are included, which preaches to them, which
teaches them, which regenerates them by Baptiſm, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
them by the Euchariſt, which adminiſters to them the Keys, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62471:53"/>
governs them, and keeps them united under Diſcipline, which forms
<hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> in them: 'Tis this viſible Body, that
ſhall ſubſiſt for ever.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſeen by this, that inſtead of making a Church, whoſe
Communion is of its own nature meerly exterior, <hi>and interior
only by Accident,</hi> the Foundation of the Church is on the contrary
the interior Communion, of which the exterior Communion is the
Mark, and that the Effect of this Mark is to ſhew, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>GOD</hi> are kept and inclos'd under this Seal. 'Tis ſeen alſo,
that the Elect are the laſt End, for which all is done in the
Church, and thoſe, whom all her Miniſtery ought principally
to ſerve; ſo that they make the moſt eſſential Part, and, as I
may ſay, the very Ground of the Church.</p>
               <p>If then I have ſpoken more of the exterior Communion,
than of the interior Communion of the Church, 'tis plainly
ſeen, that this can be only for the Reaſon, I have mention'd;
to wit, that the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> being agreed with us, that
the Foundation, as I may ſay, of the Church is her interior U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I needed only eſtabliſh the exterior, the neceſſity of which
theſe Gentlemen conteſt.</p>
               <p>Thus, when I ſaid at firſt in my Inſtruction, that the Church
was the Society, which confeſs'd the true Faith, Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
ought to have underſtood, that this Confeſſion of the Mouth
excluded not the Belief of the Heart, but rather ſuppos'd it in
the Living and eſſential part of the Church, of which I ſpake
not then, becauſe it was not the Queſtion, I had to propoſe
and reſolve. To conclude from this Silence, that I admitted no
other Union eſſential to the Body of the Church, but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Union, is the ſame, as if one, that ſhould have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to explain only thoſe exterior Ligaments, which keep
human Bodies united on the outſide, and include, as I may ſay,
in one and the ſame Continent, with the living Members,
the Nails, the Hair, the peccant Humors, and even the dead
Members, not yet cut off from the Body, ſhould be therefore
made believe, that he acknowledges no other Principle of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and under this Pretence it ſhould be ſaid of him, that,
according to this mans Principles, there might be an human
Body, which ſhould be only Hair, Nails, rotten Members, and
peccant Humors, without having any thing living in effect:
This is, what Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> does, when he concludes from my
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62471:53"/>
Diſcourſe, that the Church of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> may
be only an Amaſs of wicked perſons and Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>But this will appear farther, in what follows, by Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

own Principles; 'tis ſufficient for me in this place to ſhew him,
that this Church meerly exterior, which he call the Church of
the Cardinals <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>du Perron,</hi> and of <hi>M. de Candom,</hi> is a
Church, that ſubſiſts only in his imagination; and one may
believe by his manner of judging my Sentiments that he no
better underſtood thoſe of theſe illuſtrious Cardinals.</p>

that the word <hi>Church</hi> ſignify'd ſo naturally the viſible Church,
that the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> Authors of the Chimera of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
Church, in all their Confeſſion of Faith never us'd the
Word Church in this Senſe; but only to expreſs the viſible
Church, cloath'd with the Sacraments, with the word, and with
all the publick Miniſtery. See the Paſſages of the Confeſſion of
Faith, I have related, with the Conſequences, I have drawn from
them.</p>
               <p>I was not the firſt, who made this Remark; 'twas a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Synod of the <hi>Pretended Reformed.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen, who
had ſo much preacht the inviſible Church, and who, being

had not ſpoken one ſingle word of it in their Confeſſion of Faith,
where on the contrary the word <hi>Church</hi> is always taken for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

but ſo little conformable to the Principles of their Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they made this Decree in the Year 1603.<note place="margin">Syn. de Gap, ſur la Conf. de Foy art. 3.</note> in the Synod of <hi>Gap,</hi>
in the Chapter, which has for its Title, <hi>On the Confeſſion of Faith.</hi>

in the Synods: <hi>The Confeſſion of Faith of the Reformed Churches,
review'd and corrected in the National Synod.</hi> But let us come to
the Decree of <hi>Gap,</hi> of which theſe are the words. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
ſhall be exhorted to conſider in the Provincial Synods, in what
Terms the XXV. Article of the Confeſſion of Faith ought to be coucht:
forasmuch as being to expreſs, what we believe touching the Catholick
Church, of which mention is made in the Creed, there is nothing in
the ſaid Confeſſion, that can be taken but for the militant and viſible
Church; as alſo in the XXIX Article they ſhall ſee, whether it be
fit to adde the Word</hi> Pure <hi>to the Word</hi> the Church, <hi>which is in the
ſaid Article: and in general all ſhall come prepar'd on the matters of
the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have related the Subſtance of this XXV Article. You
may in the ſame place ſee the XXVI,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. p. 3.</note> XXVII and XXVIII Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
And for the XXIX Article, it ſays, that <hi>the true Church
ought to be govern'd according to the Policy, which our Lord</hi> JESUS
CHRIST <hi>has eſtabliſht; that is, that there be Paſtors, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,
and Deacons, to the end the pure Doctrin may have its Courſe,
and the Aſſemblies be kept in the Name of</hi> GOD.</p>
               <p>The Addition of the word <hi>pure Church,</hi> which they delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to add to that of <hi>true,</hi> is founded on a Doctrin of the
<hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> which ſays, that a true Church may not be
<hi>pure,</hi> becauſe with the eſſential Truths it may have Errors
mixt, I ſay even groſs and conſiderable Errors againſt the
Faith. And this is one of the Myſteries of the new Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> will explain to us by and by: but
'tis not here in queſtion. What there is important, is, that
theſe People, who ſay, they are ſent of <hi>GOD</hi> to raiſe again
the pure Doctrin of the Goſpel, being to explicate, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
declare in their Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>the Church, of which
mention is made in the Creed,</hi> ſpake nevertheleſs only <hi>of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62471:54"/>
and viſible Church.</hi> I could eaſily tell you the Reaſon: 'tis,
that this <hi>Church, of which mention is made in the Creed,</hi> is indeed
the viſible Church; 'tis, that the word <hi>Church</hi> naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
this Viſibility, and the word <hi>Catholick is</hi> ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating
from it, that it ſuppoſes it; 'tis, that in a Confeſſion of
Faith one often happens to ſpeak rather according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Ideas,</hi> the words bear with them, than according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements
and Interpretations, one has invented to free himſelf
out of ſome Difficulty. Thus the inviſible Church preſented
not it ſelf at all to our <hi>Reformed,</hi> when they fram'd their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith; the ſenſe of the viſible Church appear'd only
in it; there was nothing ſeen in this but natural till the Year
1603. In 1603 they awoke; they began to find it ſtrange,
that a Church, which founded her Succeſſion in the <hi>Idea</hi> of an
inviſible Church, and of a Church of the Predeſtinate, ſhould
not have ſaid one word of it in her Confeſſion of Faith, but
have left it for evident, that the Natural Signification of the
word <hi>Church</hi> always imported a viſible Society; ſo that to ſpeak
truly, the Succeſſion of the Church would no longer be ſhewn
without ſhewing the Succeſſion of her Viſibility: a thing utterly
impoſſible for the new Reformation. 'Twas this, inclin'd the whole
Synod to deſire the going again over this Article, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
the Provinces to come <hi>ready prepar'd upon the matters of the
Church,</hi> which had never been well underſtood amongſt the
new <hi>Reformed,</hi> which are not yet underſtood, and which will
make all thoſe <hi>Catholicks,</hi> that can throughly underſtand them.</p>
               <p>But the going over this Article again was a very nice Affair.
'Twas to awaken all underſtandings; 'twas too viſibly to mark
the Defect, and give the Printers more occaſion than ever to
entitle it, <hi>The Confeſſion review'd and corrected.</hi> Thus in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of <hi>Rochel,</hi> held in 1607, <hi>'twas reſolved not to add or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
any thing in the XXV and XXIX Articles, nor to meddle afreſh
with the matter of the Church.</hi> By the deciſion of this Synod the
viſible Church alone appears in the <hi>Pretended Reformeds</hi> Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith: the inviſible Church has no part in it, and one
draws from it Conſequences, as one can.</p>
               <p>That,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. p. 4.</note> which I draw, pinches them: for if the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
only as viſible in the <hi>Pretended Reformeds</hi> Confeſſion of
Faith, and if beſides they aſſert this Confeſſion of Faith,
as conformable in all points to the Scripture, they muſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62471:55"/>
tell us, that this manner of explicating the Church comes from
the Scripture, and that from the Scripture it has paſs'd naturally
into the ordinary Language of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> into the Confeſſions
of Faith, and conſequently into the Creed, which is not only
the beſt authoriz'd of all Confeſſions of Faith, but alſo the moſt
ſimple.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> anſwers us,<note place="margin">Man. Anf. q. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Cuſtom changes; and that by
Proceſs of time Words often depart from their firſt and natural Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and that beſides,</hi> thô it ſhould be true, as I have ſaid,
that the word <hi>Church, taken ſimply,</hi> ſhould ſignify the viſible
Church, the word <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> would change this Signification.
But he ſhall not eſcape us by this Subterfuge: for we have
ſtill an Argument left to overturn the whole pretended <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
See it taken from the very Principles, laid by themſelves.
The word <hi>Church</hi> ought to be taken in the <hi>Pretended Reformeds</hi>
Confeſſion of Faith, as it is naturally taken in a Fundamental
Article of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> elſe this Confeſſion of Faith
would not be conformable, as it pretends, to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Now in this Confeſſion of Faith the word <hi>Church</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a viſible Society: this Propoſition is acknowledg'd in
the Synod of <hi>Gap,</hi> as we juſt now ſaw. 'Tis thus then, that the
word <hi>Church</hi> is naturally taken in Holy Scripture, and in the Creed
for a viſible Church, and the Term <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> put in
the Creed,<note place="margin">Man. Anſ. q. 1.</note> as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> confeſſes, to diſtinguiſh the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Church truly <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſpread over the whole Earth,
<hi>from all falſe Churches, and all particular Churches,</hi> inſtead of
rendring the Church inviſible, makes her ſo much the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
as it more viſibly ſeparates her from all falſe Churches,
and puts in her Boſom all the particular Churches, ſo viſible,
and ſo remarkable by their common Profeſſion of Faith, and
their common Government.</p>

Mixture hinders indeed the juſt Diſcernment of Perſons; but it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not the Diſcernment or Diſtinction of the Orders of Perſons, even
with certainty. We know not certainly, who are in particular true
Believers, nor who are Hypocrites: but we know certainly, that there
are true Believers, as there are Hypocrites; which is ſufficient to
make the Viſibility of the true Church. <hi>I hear this with joy: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
we ſhall advance. Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>gives it us already for</hi>
manifeſt, <hi>that there ſhall be always a viſible Body, of which
one may ſay,</hi> There are the true Believers.</p>
               <p>I continue to read his Anſwer, and I find, that he blames me
for imputing to the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> that they believe not
the Body, in which <hi>GOD</hi> has plac'd, according to St. <hi>Paul,
ſome Apoſtles, ſome Teachers, ſome Paſtors,</hi> and the reſt, to be the
Church of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST.</hi> How glad am I to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
provided we advance! It is then manifeſt, that the
Body of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> which is his Church, ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be compos'd of Paſtors, of Teachers, of Preachers, and
alſo of People: it is then conſequently always very viſible,
and the Succeſſion of the Paſtors, as well as that of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ought to be manifeſt in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> confirms here his Diſcourſe by a paſſage of Mr.

                  </hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> enters at firſt into my
Sentiment. He ſays, that in this paſſage we muſt underſtand
indeed <hi>the Church, which is already in Heaven, but alſo the viſible
Church, whichis on the earth,</hi> as making together <hi>but one and the

Doctrin; and if any of our <hi>Reformed,</hi> be it Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
ever objects to me, that I muſt not ſo much rely on the
Churches Viſibility, ſince there is at leaſt a Part of this Church,
which is inviſible, that is to ſay, that, which is in Heaven, I
will anſwer, that this ought not to trouble us, ſince that in fine
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62471:56"/>
by this Doctrin of Mr. <hi>Meſtreſat</hi> and Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> being in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the viſible Part of the Church, I am ſure to be
ſo alſo with the inviſible Part, which is already in Heaven with
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST:</hi> ſo that 'tis very certain, that all is
reduc'd in fine to the Viſibility.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> paſſes thence to the Objections, that may be made,
and he decides at firſt, that <hi>the Viſibility of the Church is a Viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Miniſtery.</hi> He muſt then at laſt, as he acknowledges in
the Church a perpetual Viſibility, come to ſhew us a Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Miniſtery, and in one word a Train of lawful
Paſtors.</p>
               <p>He objects to himſelf, that <hi>the Miniſtery is common to the Good
and the Bad,</hi> whence it ſeems, one might conclude againſt his
Doctrin, that Good and Bad compoſe the Church. And he
Anſwers, that <hi>if the uſe the Miniſtery is common to Good and
Bad, this is only by accident, and thrô the Fraud of the Enemy; that
of right it belongs only to the true Believers; and that the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Deſtination is only for them.</hi> All this is clear, except this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>the Miniſtery of right belongs only to the true Believers.</hi> For,
as one might underſtand by this, that none but true Believers
are lawfull Paſtors, one might fall into the Inconvenience of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to examin every one in particular, whether the Paſtors are
indeed true Believers, and to believe, that they ceaſe to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
when they ceaſe to be good People, thô without Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal:
this is the pernicious Doctrin of <hi>Wicleff,</hi> which would put
all the Church in Confuſion! Excepting this ill Senſe, which
cannot be Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s, I grant him all; he ſays; for without
doubt 'tis <hi>not JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRISTs</hi> firſt Intent, that there
ſhould be Miniſters, that are Deceivers: this happens only thrô
the Malice of the Enemy. The Deſtinction of the Miniſtery
is for true Believers; <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> did not eſtabliſh
it to call into the Church Deceivers and Hypocrites: who
doubts it? But nevertheleſs theſe Deceivers and theſe Hypocrites
may be ſufficiently of the Church, to be lawful Paſtors in it:
and the true Believers being to live to the end of the World
under the Authority of this mixt Miniſtery, he muſt then,
without examining, whether the Miniſters are good or evil,
ſhew us a Succeſſion of them always manifeſt, under which
<hi>GOD</hi> has conſerv'd his People.</p>

The more I continue my Reading, the more I find this
Truth evidently declar'd. For entring into the fourth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
I take good notice, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> pretends there to
ſhew, that the Paſſages, where <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
the Church to keep her always on the earth, regard only
the Society of true Believers: but he forbears not always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
to own, that this Church never ceaſes to be viſible, and
that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> has ſo promis'd.</p>
               <p>I pretended to ſhew the viſible Church in theſe words:<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. 7, 8. &amp; ſeq. <hi>Mat. xvi. v.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou
art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church: and the Gates
of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> The Reaſons, I made uſe of
to prove it, may be ſeen. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> receives this Doctrin with
its Proofs. And he acknowledges, that <hi>the Church, which is
ſpoken of in this Paſſage, is in effect a confeſſing Church, a Church,
which publiſhes the Faith, a Church, to which</hi> JESUS CHRIST
<hi>has given an exterior Miniſtery, a Church, which uſes the Miniſtery
of the Keys, and which binds and looſes, and which conſequently has
an Outſide and a Viſibility.</hi> 'Tis ſuch a Church, that JESUS
CHRIST has promis'd to keep always on the earth; Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi> cannot ſuffer one to tell him, that ſhe ceaſes to be and
thus ſhe is always with all that Miniſtery, which is eſſential to her:
which makes Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> conclude with me,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. p. 9, 10. &amp;c.</note> that <hi>the Eccleſiaſtical
Miniſtery ſhall laſt without diſcontinuance till the General Reſurrection;</hi>

Promiſes reſpect none but true Believers. Let us add according
to Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Principles, that, if theſe Promiſes reſpect only
true Believers, they reſpect them at leaſt in this Miniſtery, and
in this exterior Profeſſion, and the Objection will be at the
ſame time reſolv'd. For in fine if the true Believers ought to
be always ſhewn, and always viſible, according to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
in this exterior Profeſſion, in which the Good are mixt with
the Bad; it follows, that this Compoſition, by what Name
ſoever it is call'd, ſhall always appear on the earth. Now none
can be aſſur'd of a Societies ſubſiſting always, and always in a viſible
State, unleſs <hi>GOD</hi> has promis'd it. His Promiſes regard then
even this Mixture; and not only the true Believers, but with
them all the Society, in which they ought, according to his
Decrees, always to appear. By Conſequence we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
theſe Promiſes of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> otherwiſe, than
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> teaches. The Promiſes of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>
reſpect not the Wicked alone, nor were made for their ſake;
if he ſaid only this, he would have Reaſon: but theſe Promiſes,

which <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> made to his Faithful, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

by his Prophets promis'd the ancient People to give then plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Harveſh, with the Corn he promis'd alſo the Chaff; and
to preſerve the Harveſt is to preſerve the Chaff with the Corn.
So to promiſe the Church and her eternal Duration, into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
with the Elect, the Wicked, in the midſt of whom <hi>GOD</hi>
encloſes them. The wicked alſo in the Church are for the Juſt,

all this Compoſition ſhall ſubſiſt in vertue of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

In the mean time <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> ſhall be always

               <p>A ſecond Objection of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s will fall by the ſame
Principle.</p>
               <p>He objects to me,<note place="margin">Man. Anſ. 1. q.</note> that in defining the Catholick Church,
mention'd in the Creed, I ſpeak only of the Church, which is
actually on earth, inſtead of comprehending in it all the Elect,
which have been, are, and ſhall be, and in fine with the holy
Angels all the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I have already anſwer'd
him, that I neither would, nor was oblig'd to define the Church
but in relation to our Subject, and her Viſibility. But I add,
that in ſaying this, according to Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s own Principles I
ſaid all: for, according to him, <hi>in the exterior Profeſſion,</hi> that is,
in what renders the Church viſible, may be markt the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
with whom all the Saints, in what time and place ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they may be, not excepting the holy Angels, are united.
<hi>The Church, which is on the Earth,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Claude, is one with
that, which is already gather'd in Heaven, and with that, which</hi>
GOD <hi>will cauſe to ſpring up even to the end of the Generations,
all which three together make but one, which is call'd the Vniverſal
Church. GOD</hi> be prais'd: when I ſhall have found the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62471:59"/>
Profeſſion, which renders the Church viſible, Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
has already told us, that I ſhall have found the true Believers,
that is according to him, the true Church actually preſent on
earth: and he now tells us, that with this Church I ſhall by
the ſame means have found both that, which is already in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and that, which <hi>GOD</hi> will cauſe to grow up in all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Ages. We need then only enquire after the Church,
which is on the earth, and the exterior Profeſſion, which ſhews
her to us, being aſſur'd to have found there, without enquiring
any farther, the Perfect Communion of Saints, and the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all the Elect.</p>
               <p>Beſides when under the Name of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the Church, which is upon the Earth, I ſpake with
all the Fathers. They ordinarily joyn to the Title of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church</hi> that of <hi>ſpread over all the earth, toto orbe diffuſa.</hi> To
this Title of <hi>Catholick</hi> they joyn alſo the Title of <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi>
and thus is it put in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, where is ſeen the moſt
authentical, as well as the moſt perfect Interpretation of the
Apoſtles Creed. This Title of <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> makes part of the
Churches Catholicity, and ſhews us among other things, that
ſhe is deſcended from the Apoſtles by the perpetual Succeſſion
of her Paſtors, and by the Epiſcopal Chairs, eſtabliſht over all the
earth. All the Saints, whoſe bleſſed Souls are with <hi>GOD,</hi> were
conceiv'd in this Church; all thoſe, that are to come, ſhall
likewiſe be regenerated in it: ſo that there ſhall never be any
one, who has not made an eſſential Part of this Body, of which
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> is the Head. For the Angels, if we
reſpect only the direct Signification of the Words, they never
made Part of this Church, founded by the Apoſtles, and ſpread
over all the earth, where ſhe ought to make her Pilgrimage;
and thô <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> is their Head, he is in a
more particular manner that of the Faithful, waſht in his Blood,
and renew'd by his Word. But the Angels, thô united to
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> in another manner, are our Brethren,
and are not Strangers to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, of which on the
contrary they are eſtabliſht after their manner Co-opperators
and Miniſters. 'Tis an evident Truth, but with which I had
nothing to do in this place: 'tis ſufficient to remark in the
Creed, what our Fathers found there expreſly and immediately
ſignify'd by the word <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by adding to it the Title
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62471:59"/>
                  <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> ſo natural to her Catholicity, and the <hi>Elegium</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Church, is to know the Doctrin of all the Elect. There is

Secrets of the Divine Wiſdom, reſpect her Beller. Thus all

               <p>We have ſeen that,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. XI. Ref. p. 99. &amp;. ſeq.</note> to verify the Promiſes of the Goſpel,
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> is oblig'd to acknowledge a Church always viſible,
ſince the Church, which is not viſible, is no Church, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Definition,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. p. 103.</note> he has given us, <hi>the Church is the true
Faithful, who make Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Truth under a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
which furniſhes her with the Aliments, neceſſary for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Life.</hi> Theſe Faithful then are not a Body in the Any ſince
they <hi>make</hi> PROFESSION OF THE TRUTH <hi>under an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62471:60"/>
Miniſtery</hi> always ſubſiſting; and that, as we have ſeen,
there muſt be without any Interruption an exterior Profeſſion,
of which it may be ſaid, <hi>There are the true Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus 'tis not ſufficient to alledge at random to us conceal'd
Believers, they are oblig'd to ſhew us without Interruption, firſt
a viſible Society, of which may be ſaid, <hi>They are there;</hi> 'tis
there, they ſerve <hi>GOD</hi> in Spirit and Truth; 'tis there, they
confeſs the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be enough to ſhew us theſe Believers diſpers'd:
they muſt ſecondly ſhew us them gather'd together under the
Authority of an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery, with preaching of the
Word, with the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, with the
uſe of the Keys, and all the Eccleſiaſtical Government.</p>
               <p>By conſequence they muſt ſhew us a Society of Paſtors and
People: whence it follows in the third place, that they muſt be
able to name us theſe Paſtors, ſince the Succeſſion of them is
manifeſt.</p>
               <p>To ſeek all this in the <hi>Pretended Reformed</hi> Church, as it is
now ſeparated from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that is, from that Body
of the Church, which acknowledges the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the
Pope for its Head; is what Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> does not ſo much as dream
of: 'tis enough for him, that to the time of the <hi>Pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>'s
Separation he finds all this in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church it ſelf.
The true Believers were there, as long as thoſe, that compos'd
the <hi>Pretended Reformation,</hi> were there, when they went forth,
or were driven forth,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. p. 46.</note> they carry'd the Church with them, as
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid in the Conference.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe, more like a Raillery than a ſerious Diſcourſe,
is nevertheleſs that, which is ſeriouſly held in the new Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Till the Separation of theſe new <hi>Reformed,</hi> the Succeſſion
of the true Believers, that is according to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> of the
true viſible Church,<note place="margin">Man. Anſ. q. 4. ſeq.</note> was perpetuated in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and
'tis ſince their Separation, that ſhe ceaſes to contain them. Such
is the Succeſſion of the viſible Church, which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes
in his Manuſcript Anſwer: till the Separation the true
Faithful, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church contain'd; after the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> which came forth of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>But whence came their Paſtors? Were they alſo detacht
with theſe pretended Believers from the Body of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62471:60"/>
Church, to perpetuate in the Church thus Reform'd the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Miniſtery?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> In no wiſe: Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> does not underſtand
it ſo. The Faithful, detacht from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, all on a
ſudden depos'd all the Paſtors, which were before; that is to
ſay, that before the <hi>Catholick</hi> Biſhops and Prieſts with the Pope
at their Head were the Paſtors, eſtabliſht by <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST;</hi> for there muſt be ſuch <hi>for the true Believers,</hi> which
they contain'd in their Unity: in the Moment, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
appear'd, they were all on a ſudden depos'd, and the
Miniſtery taken out of their Hands.</p>
               <p>But what right had private perſons thus all on a ſudden and
in one moment to diſpoſſeſs all their Paſtors? 'Tis, becauſe
they are <hi>the true Believers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Man. Anſ. q. 4. &amp; ſeq.</note> to whom <hi>the Miniſtery appertains of
right,</hi> who might conſequently diſpoſe of it, take it from ſome,
and give it to others.<note place="margin">Man. Anſ. 4. q. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end.</note> We muſt not, ſays Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> imagine
the Succeſſion of Paſtors <hi>in this ordinary tranſmiſſion, which the
Miniſters make from one to another, and which is call'd the exterior
and perſonal Succeſſion: the Queſtion is, whether it may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen, that the Church,</hi> that is the true Believers, <hi>ſhall take
her Miniſtery out of the hand of thoſe, who have too viſibly abus'd it,
and give it to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Queſtion in general,<note place="margin">Conſ. 8, 9, 10.</note> as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> propoſes it;
and the Application, he makes of it in particular, is, That <hi>the</hi>
Latin <hi>Prelates, who enjoy'd the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery in the time of
our Fathers, and who were aſſembled in the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>having
made Deciſions of Faith incompatible with Salvation, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd</hi>
Anathemaes <hi>againſt theſe, who ſubmitted not to them,</hi> the
Pretended Reformed <hi>had Reaſon to regard theſe Prelates, as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who had ſtript themſelves of the Miniſtery, and to give it to
other Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſhould then at leaſt, according to theſe Principles,
have expected the Deciſions of <hi>Trent;</hi> and ſince before theſe
Deciſions ſo many Churches, ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
given themſelves Paſtors, the Reformation will have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
by a manifeſt Uſurpation. But let us not ſo much preſs.
Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and without inſiſting rigorouſly on the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> let us deſire him only to mark us ſome day a little near
the Time, in which he will permit the true Believers to have
continu'd under the Miniſtery of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And in
the mean time let us content our ſelves to obſerve this new
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62471:61"/>
Doctrin: that it may happen, that all the Paſtors of the
Church, diſpoſſeſt all on a ſudden, may become in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
private men; and that, without their eſtabliſhing any
other Paſtors to ſucceed them, <hi>the true Believers,</hi> in no wiſe
Paſtors, but private perſons, ſeparated from every Church actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
exiſting, may of their ſole Authority confer the Miniſtery
on others, eſtabliſh them, ordain them, inſtal them. This is,
what Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> afterwards farther explicates by theſe words;
that theſe Paſtors, before alone in Function, <hi>are of right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd,
and the Miniſtery return'd of right to that part of the Society,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conſ. 10.</note>
                  <hi>in which are found the true Believers,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Pretended
Reformed,</hi> ſeparated from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and from every
Church, then ſubſiſting in the world. What an Authority and
Privilege does the Separation give!</p>
               <p>Such is Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Doctrin: if I change, if I exaggerate,
if I diminiſh, let him without delay publiſh his writing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
me. But if this be his Doctrin, I conjure our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to conſider, what Prodigies of Doctrin muſt be taught to
defend their Reformation,</p>
               <p>For firſt, where do they read, in what Goſpel, in what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
in what Writing of the Old or New Teſtament, that
all the Paſtors of the Church ſhould in a moment fall from
their Chair, and become private perſons, whom one might and
ought freely diſobey.</p>
               <p>Has <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> hidden this great Myſtery from
us? and would he not have precaution'd us againſt this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Temptation of his Church? But this is not all: after he
has ſhewn us in the Scripture this univerſal Fall of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
he muſt alſo find there this <hi>Miniſtery return'd of right</hi> to
the private Perſons, that were never veſted with it. And what
is Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s <hi>Meaning?</hi> Is it, that theſe private Perſons <hi>become
of right</hi> Miniſters, without any Bodies having ordain'd them;
or that, without being Miniſters, they have Right of their
ſole Authority to ſet up Miniſters in the Church? Let them
ſhew me it in the Scripture, or let them for ever renounce the
Pretence of having the Scripture alone for Guide.</p>
               <p>I find in the Scripture, that <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> ſaid to
his Apoſtles: <hi>As my Father ſent me, I alſo ſend you.</hi> I find in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
that the Apoſtles thus ſend others, and conſecrate themſelves
Succeſſors. But that, all their Succeſſors being on a ſudden faln,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62471:61"/>
and depriv'd of the right of their Miniſtery, this Miniſtery ſhould
<hi>of right return</hi> to the Faithful, to whom none had ever given it,
to diſpoſe of at their Pleaſure: neither has the Scripture ſaid,
nor following Ages imagin'd: 'Tis then a Monſter, the Birth
of which was reſerv'd for the time of the new Reformation.</p>
               <p>The Miniſtery, ſay they, belongs of right to the Church.
It does without doubt belong to the Church, as the Eyes do to
the Body. The Miniſtery is not for it ſelf, no more are the
Eyes: The Miniſtery is eſtabliſht to be the Light of the Church,
as the Eyes are the Light, or, as <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>
calls them, the Torch of the Body. Does it follow, that, when
the Body has loſt its Eyes, it can remake them of it ſelf? No
without doubt; it will have need of the Hand, which made
them at firſt, and there will never be any thing but a new
Creation, which can repair the Work, that the firſt Creation
had form'd. In this manner, if the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church could, as
they would imagin in the new Reformation, loſe all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
all its Miniſters, without their having given themſelves
Succeſſors according to the Order of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,
JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> muſt come again on Earth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh
this ſacred Order by a new Creation.</p>
               <p>They will indeed find in the Boſom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
theſe true Believers, of which the <hi>Reformed</hi> Church was at firſt
compos'd; why will they not in the ſame manner detach the
Paſtors of this <hi>Reformed</hi> Church from the Paſtors, which were
in Office in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? The Miniſtery is to be mixt
as the People, and is to have always good Paſtors amongſt the
Bad, as there are always <hi>true Believers</hi> amongſt the falſe <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
Why then were they fain to ſay in the new Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in the XXXI Article of their Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>that
the State of the Church was interrupted?</hi> Why were they fain to
have recourſe <hi>to theſe People, extraordinarily rais'd to build anew the
Church, which was in ruin and deſolation?</hi> 'Tis, that they were
fain to ſpeak, not according to what ought to be done in the
Order, eſtabliſht by <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> but according
to what was done againſt all Order. 'Tis, that the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was made of Paſtors, who in effect held nothing
from the Paſtors, that were before, and therefore they were
neceſſitated, even againſt their Wills, to attribute to them, thô
without proof, an extraordinary Vocation. But in truth, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62471:62"/>
requir'd ſomething elſe: and why then did they not ſpeak
according to Reaſon, except it were once again, that they were
fain to accommodate, not what was done to the Rule, but the
Rule to what was done?</p>
               <p>But, will they ſay, if any Church, for example the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church, ſhews us the Succeſſion of her Paſtors, will you hold
it for a true Church? By no means, if I can ſhew in it Marks
of Innovation, which it cannot deny; as I ſhould do without
much trouble; if it were in queſtion. But with our <hi>Reformed</hi>
the Proof is made, ſince themſelves confeſs the Interruption, we
charge them with.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> palliates, as well as he can, <hi>this interrupted State of
the Church,</hi> ſo punctually acknowledg'd in her Confeſſion of Faith.
<hi>We diſtinguiſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">After the 4. q. 7. Conſeq.</note> ſays he, <hi>the Church from her State. The Church
are the true Believers, who make Profeſſion of the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Truth, of
Piety, and of a real Sanctity, under a Miniſtery, which furniſhes
them with the Aliments, neceſſary for the Spiritual Life, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
them of any one. Her natural and legitimate State is to be
diſcharg'd, as much as the Condition of militant can permit, from
the impure mixture of prophano Perſons and Worldings, not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
and as it were bury'd by this Chaff, and theſe Tares, whence
a thouſand Evils come upon her, as to have a Miniſtery, free from
Errors, from falſe Worſhips, from ſuperſtitious Practices, a Miniſtery
poſſeſs'd by good People, who keep at by good ways, and ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for good example. 'Tis this State of the Church, which we ſay
was interrupted.</hi> Why does he load himſelf with ſo many Words,
and, becauſe they are pompous, not obſerve, that they are vain,
not to ſay deceitful, and manifeſtly contrary to the Goſpel?
For can one more clearly impoſe on People, than by exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as is here done, this <hi>Miniſtery poſſeſt by good people, who
keep it by good ways, and ſerve themſelves for good Example?</hi> Is it,
that the Authority of the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery dupends on the
Diſcuſſion of the Life and good Example of thoſe, who are
veſted with it? and that, thô they ſhould be as ſcandalous and
perverſe, as the Scribes and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> we muſt not ſtill ſay, not
with <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, they ſit in Moſes Chair,</hi> but what is
much more auguſt,<note place="margin">Matt. 23. v. 2.</note> they are in the Chair of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi>
and his Apoſtles? Let us leave nevertheleſs theſe things, and
come to this <hi>interrupted State</hi> of the XXXI Article, which Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi> undertakes here to explicate to us. This interrupted State
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62471:62"/>
of the Church is alledg'd here, to found the neceſſity of an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Vocation in the Pretended Reformers:</hi> for let us hear,
how this Article ſpeaks. <hi>It has been ſometimes neceſſary, and
namely in our days, in which the State of the Church was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that</hi> GOD <hi>ſhould raiſe up people after an extraordinary manner
to ſet up the Church anew. You ſee Gentlemen, this interrupted State
of the Church</hi> is alledg'd only to found the <hi>extraordinary Vocation</hi>
of your <hi>Pretended Reformers.</hi> But to found the Neceſſity of an
extraordinary Vocation, 'tis not ſufficient, that the Miniſtery
is impure; it muſt have ceaſed. When you came, Gentlemen,
had this Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery ceas'd? By no means, will
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> anſwer you, for then the Church would have ceas'd,
ſince the Church, according to him, as you juſt now heard, is
nothing elſe, but the <hi>true Believers, who make Profeſſion of the Truth</hi>
UNDER A MINISTERY, <hi>which furniſhes her with neceſſary
Aliments.</hi> And he has already told us, that the Church is never
without the Miniſtery. Wherefore in this place, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to give an Account of this <hi>interrupted State,</hi> after he has
by ſo many fine Words ſet forth the Impurity, which he imagins
in the Miniſtery before the Reformation; <hi>The Church,</hi> adds he,
<hi>ceas'd not, She did not entirely loſe her Viſibility or her Miniſtery.</hi>
GOD <hi>forbid.</hi> See, how he cries out againſt this Abomination,
to ſay, that the Miniſtery can be loſt in the Church. There
is never then any Neceſſity of an extraordinary Vocation in
the Miniſters, ſince to tranſmit the Miniſtery after the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner, 'tis not requiſite for the Miniſtery to be pure; 'tis
ſufficient, that it is. And thô for the tranſmitting of it there
ſhould be requir'd, as Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſpeaks, not only Miniſters of
good Doctrin, but alſo of <hi>good Life and good Example,</hi> 'tis as
ſure, that there will be always ſuch in the Society of <hi>GOD's</hi>
People, as 'tis, that there will be always true. Believers, ſince that
all, the Miniſtery as well as the People, muſt be there mixt of
Good and Bad, till the final Separation at the laſt Judgment.
Thus the extraordinary Vocation is on all ſides excluded from
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRISTs</hi> Church, and can be only a weak Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for a deplor'd Cauſe.</p>
               <p>And to ſee, what an Overthrow to <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRISTs</hi>
Order Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> here introduces, we need only conſider the
Promiſes of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and ſee, in what it has
pleas'd him principally to eſtabliſh the Strength of his Church.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62471:63"/>
She is ſtrong, ſhe is invincible, becauſe JESUS CHRIST
has ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. xvi. v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>that Hell ſhould not prevail againſt her.</hi> But he did not
ſay, that <hi>Hell ſhould not prevail againſt her,</hi> till after he had ſaid,
<hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> adding
preſently after, <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> 'Tis then in the Miniſtery, confeſſing and declaring
JESUS CHRIST, and uſing the Authority of the Keys,
that JESUS CHRIST has principally eſtabliſht the
Strength of his Church. And to whom did he ſay, <hi>I am with

who knows it not? But JESUS CHRIST would
ſhew the Truth of this Doctrin,<note place="margin">Ep. 69. ad Flor. Pap.</note> ſo well explicated by St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:
The Church forſakes not</hi> JESUS CHRIST; <hi>and this
is the Church, the People united with their Biſhop, and the Flock
joyn'd to their Paſtor:</hi> where 'tis clear, that we muſt underſtand,
as he ſays elſewhere,<note place="margin">Ep. 45. ad Corin. 4. &amp; Tr. de vnit. Ecc. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>this Paſtor united with all his Collegues,</hi> and
with the whole Unity of the Epiſcopacy, ſo often eſtabliſht in
his Writings. 'Tis then with reaſon, that JESUS CHRIST
would ſhew the Succeſſion of his Church by that of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
and 'tis manifeſtly ſeen, that 'tis to thoſe, who teach,
he would ſay. <hi>I am always with you.</hi> And what is here more
admirable, is, that theſe Promiſes are ſo evident, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
(againſt the Prepoſſeſſions of his Religion) was forc't to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
them ſuch, as I have now explicated them. For we
have heard him tell us, that 'tis in effect of a confeſſing Church,
of a Church, which publiſhes the Faith, of a Church, which
uſes the Miniſtery, that JESUS CHRIST has pronounc'd,
that <hi>Hell ſhould not prevail againſt her.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. ſup. xi. Ref. p. 99. ſeq.</note> And becauſe JESUS
CHRIST, after he had ſaid, <hi>Teach and baptize,</hi> adds, <hi>I am
with you;</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> concludes, as we do, that JESUS
CHRIST in effect deſigns a Church, that he affirms <hi>he
will be with her, baptize with her, and teach with her even unto the
end of the world.</hi> 'Tis then the Succeſſion and Perpetuity of
the Miniſtery, which is principally comprehended in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
'tis principally in this, that JESUS CHRIST eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes
the Strength and eternal Duration of his Church. In
the mean time, againſt all this Order we are ſhewn the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
ſo weak, and ſo forſaken by JESUS CHRIST,
that it falls all together in one moment, and on the contrary
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62471:63"/>
particular Believers ſo ſtrong, that they alone eſtabliſh all the
Miniſtery <hi>extraordinarily rais'd,</hi> without having regard to the
Succeſſion or Authority of all the precedent Adminiſtration.
Who does not then ſee, that all is overturn'd in the new <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?</hi>
and that to ſay with them, that GOD would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
true Believers in his Church, to depoſe by their means
all the Paſtors, and afterward ſet up others extraordinarily in their
place; whilſt he would not preſerve good Paſtors to tranſmit
the Miniſtery by the common ways, eſtabliſht in his word, and
always obſerv'd in his Church: is to ſay, that he would ſet up
a Church in a manner, contrary to that, he has reveal'd, and has
always caus'd to be follow'd by his Church? Or rather 'tis to
ſay, that he would have this Church, form'd after a manner ſo
new amongſt <hi>Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <p>But let us come to theſe <hi>true Believers,</hi> of whom Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
brags to us. I am not contented to diſpute with them the Power,
he has given them to depoſe all their Paſtors, and make others:
I ſay, that theſe true Believers never were. There muſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
according to this Miniſter, have been true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
even in the Boſom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: for ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Doctrin, there muſt be acknowledg'd, without
any Interruption, an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery, and an exterior
Profeſſion, of which might have been ſaid, <hi>There are the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
they were true Believers under that Miniſtery, and in
that Profeſſion, whence they went forth. I ask, did they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
in the Sacrifice, where Saints are invocated, where
their Relicks and Images are honour'd, where the Pope is nam'd
as the Head of the Orthodox, where JESUS CHRIST
is ador'd, as preſent in Body and Soul, where he is offer'd,
where the Holy Sacrament is receiv'd under one Kind? Not
to communicate in this Sacrifice, and to refuſe the receiving of
the Euchariſt there, were manifeſtly to ſeparate, and they are
ſuppos'd not to have done that yet: but if they communicated
there, continuing true Believers, in what an Error are now all
our Reformed, who believe not themſelves to have been true.
Believers, till ſince they left communicating there?</p>
               <p>Thus theſe true Believers are People in the Air:<note place="margin">1 Kin. xix. v. 18.</note> theſe <hi>ſeven

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62471:64"/>
ſince before the Separation there was not any one, who
communicated not in the Sacrifice and Hoſt, which our <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
look on as <hi>Baal,</hi> before whom one muſt not bow the
Knee.</p>
               <p>They ſay, that theſe <hi>true Believers,</hi> who by their actual ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
compos'd the <hi>Reformation,</hi> were before ſeparated in heart
from the publick Idolatry. But firſt, this is not ſufficient: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
'tis not ſo.</p>
               <p>This is not ſufficient according to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> ſince he will
have a Church always viſible; ſince he has juſt now defin'd the
Church to be <hi>the true Believers, who make Profeſſion of the Truth,
of Piety, of real Sanctity.</hi> Where then the Profeſſion is wanting,
there are neither <hi>true Believers,</hi> nor a true Church.</p>
               <p>But moreover, this is viſibly not ſo; elſe, when <hi>Luther</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> innovated, their Diſciples muſt have made
this Declaration: This is, what we always believ'd; we always
had our Heart averſe from the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, and from the Pope,
and from Biſhops, and from the Real Preſence, and from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and from Communion under one Kind, and from Relicks,
and from Images, and from Prayer to Saints, and from the Merit
of Works. Where are thoſe, who ſpake in this manner? Can Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi> name us any one of them? On the contrary, are not all theſe
<hi>Reformed</hi> ſeen in all the Pages of their Books to ſpeak, as newly
retir'd out of the Darkneſs of the Papacy, and does not <hi>Luther</hi>
glory at their head, that he was the firſt, who declar'd the Goſpel?
All the <hi>Reformed</hi> grant it, except <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> who diſputes this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
with him. He in the mean time acknowledges, that he was
the ſincereſt Monk, the Prieſt moſt intent upon his Sacrifice, and
in a word the <hi>zealouſeſt of all the</hi> Papiſts. Do not the others
uſe the ſame Language? Where are then theſe <hi>true Believers</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Claudes,</hi> who not only durſt not declare their Faith,
whilſt they were in the Boſom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were gone out of it, durſt not ſay, they had always
held in their heart the ſame Faith?</p>
               <p>But ſee here the entire Ruin of the new <hi>Reformation.</hi> In the
Definition, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> juſt now gave us of the true
Church, he ſays, <hi>'Tis the true Believers, who make Profeſſion of the</hi>
Chriſtian <hi>Truth under a Miniſtery, which furniſhes her with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

there was no ſuch Church, the true Church againſt Mr.

                  <hi>Claude</hi>'s Suppoſition no longer was; and if there were ſuch a
Church, where <hi>Profeſſion was made of the Truth, and which by her
Miniſtery gave neceſſary Aliments to the Children of</hi> GOD <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
depriving them of any one,</hi> what need was there of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformeds</hi> Separation?</p>
               <p>Is it perhaps, that they bethought themſelves all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to ſay Maſs, and teach all the Doctrins, which our <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
have alledg'd for the Cauſe of their Rupture? To think
it only, would be the greateſt of Abſurdities. But it may be, in
teaching all theſe Doctrins they had not yet thought of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
thoſe, that oppos'd them. Whence then come ſo

thoſe, who before the pretended <hi>Reformation</hi> made <hi>Profeſſion of

Doctrin, yet found the Invention of making a Schiſm,
and was all the World agreed to ſuffer them? But ſhould all
this be true, the Affairs of the Reformation would not be a jot
the better: ſince ſtill, before it had any Exiſtence, there muſt
be acknowledg'd a Miniſtery, where without teaching, either
that the Sinner is juſtify'd by Faith alone and the ſole Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of JESUS CHRIST's Juſtice, or that GOD in
the new Teſtament abhors Sacrifices celebrated in a ſenſible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or that he alone would be invocated to the Excluſion of

or in fine without any of thoſe Articles, which diſtinguiſh our

What has the <hi>Reformation</hi> wrought, if all theſe things are not
neceſſary Aliments; if even the Sacred Cup, and conſequently
the Supper, which, according to our <hi>Pretended Reformed,</hi> cannot
ſubſiſt without the Cup, is none of theſe Aliments, neceſſary
to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Faith? How they have tormented themſelves
in vain, and how unadviſedly they have caus'd ſo many Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and ſhed ſo much Blood, if theſe things are not neceſſary!</p>
               <p>Perhaps theſe neceſſary Aliments muſt be reduc'd to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
Creed, or in general to the Scripture. But the <hi>Socinian</hi>
Church remins this Creed, and this Scripture: ſo that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62471:65"/>
of a <hi>Socinian</hi> Church would, according to this Rule,
<hi>have furniſht the Children of</hi> GOD <hi>with all neceſſary Aliments,
without depriving them of any one.</hi> What then at laſt will theſe
neceſſary Aliments be; and if they are furniſht, without the
Subſtraction of any one, only by propoſing the Creed and the
Scripture, in what Hereſy have they been wanting?</p>
               <p>The more Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> endeavours here to diſengage himſelf,<note place="margin">Man. Anſ. 4. q.</note>
the more he is intangled. For after he has eſtabliſht as a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Truth, that GOD <hi>always preſervos in the Miniſtery all,
that is neceſſary to nouriſh there the true Believers, and bring them to
Salvation,</hi> he ſays, it does not thence follow, <hi>that the Miniſtery
is exempt from all Error, even in its Deciſions;</hi> but that, whether <hi>they
concern not ſenſibly the Conſcience,</hi> or even <hi>concern Salvation, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is made uſe of to reject the Evil, and preſerve Purity.</hi> Thus
all would be reduc'd to Liberty of Conſcience; and what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
ſoever is taught in the Miniſtery, provided they force none
to follow their Deciſions, and ſuffer all contrary Doctrin good
or bad, 'tis enough to make Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſay, <hi>that the Miniſtery
furniſhes the Children of</hi> GOD with all <hi>neceſſary Aliments without
depriving them of any one.</hi> But according to this Pretention, there
would be no Society, whoſe Miniſtery ſhould more furniſh all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Aliments, than a Society of <hi>Socinians,</hi> who brag, that they
will not damn any one. If it be ſaid amongſt our <hi>Reformed,</hi> that
a <hi>Socinian</hi> Church overthrows the Foundation by denying the
Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, 'tis alſo ſaid there, that
'twas no leſs overthrown before their Reformation by the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
which, as they ſay, reign'd every where. And if they
will in fine imagin, that 'tis more dangerous to deſtroy the
Foundation by Subſtraction with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> than with the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church by theſe pretended Additions, which they call
Idolatry, beſides all the Subſtractions, we have juſt now ſhewn
there according to the Principles of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their <hi>Reformation;</hi> it were an unheard of Extravagance to
believe, that it would be more eaſy for theſe <hi>true Believers,</hi> who
ought to make the Diſtinction of Doctrins under a Miniſtery
full of Errors, to cut off, what is ſuperfluous, than to ſupply,
what is defective; or that the Foundation of the Faith is more
certainly overthrown by diminiſhing, than by adding, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the Work, and given Glory to GOD even to the end. Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi> was not far from the Kingdom of GOD, when he
ſaid, that GOD would render himſelf ſuperior enough over
human Infirmity, to preſerve always, manger the Efforts of Hell,
a Church, which ſhould confeſs the Truth, and an exterior Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
which ſhould furniſh true Believers with the Aliments,
neceſſary to Salvation. He ought then to proceed to the end,
and believe, that the ſame Hand, which would hinder Hell
from prevailing ſo far againſt the Miniſtery, as to deprive it
of theſe neceſſary Aliments, would hinder it alſo from prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſo far, as to make any Error have dominion in it; and that
ſo much the rather, as what he believ'd, manifeſtly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62471:66"/>
what is left to believe. For if he believ'd on the Faith
of the Divine Promiſe, that there ſhould be always a Church,
with which JESUS CHRIST would not ceaſe to teach
that is without difficulty, that he would not ceaſe to teach with
the Doctors of this Church? he ought by the ſame means to
believe, that he would teach there all Truth, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi>
not being come,<note place="margin">Joh. xvi. v. 13.</note> nor having ſent his Holy Spirit to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to teach them ſome Truths, but to teach them <hi>all Truth,</hi>
as himſelf declares in his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Nor would it be to any purpoſe to ſay, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
Promiſes in the Miniſtery only ſufficient Aliments; which can
comprehend no more than the Fundamentals of the Faith, as our
<hi>Reformed</hi> find them amongſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> For <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S

agreeably to this Word, <hi>I am the Lord, which teacheth thee
profitable things;</hi> if we find not in the Miniſtery <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRISTs</hi> Doctrin entire, we ſhall never find <hi>that Degree</hi>
requir'd by Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> nor <hi>that Eſtate ſufficient to bring all the
Elect</hi> to the Perfection, <hi>of which St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twould be then ſomething, to believe, that by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
GOD would always keep without interruption in the
Miniſtery all eſſential Truths: for 'twould be to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Church, with which JESUS CHRIST
teaches, a beginning of infallible Authority, by acknowledging
this Authority at leaſt in reſpect of the firſt Truths of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
But to finiſh the Work, and not to believe by halves, we muſt
alſo believe, that JESUS CHRIST, in teaching, teaches
all, and confeſs in his Church an abſolute Infallibility.</p>
               <p>Thus we muſt not ſay with the Miniſters and their incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Flock: This Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery is of men ſubject
to fall: one may doubt after them: for this would be to yield
to the Temptation, and no longer to believe the Promiſe. We
muſt ſay, 'tis of men, with whom JESUS CHRIST
promiſes to be, and teach always: then manger human weakneſs,
and all the Endeavours of Hell,<note place="margin">Rom. iv. v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt hope</hi> we believe <hi>in hope,</hi>
that we ſhall find eternally in their common Preaching, not
ſome Truths, or only the principal Truths, but the entire Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Truths. Whatever they ſay, 'tis not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

How inſupportable then is the Doctrin of Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> who,
after he has acknowledg'd ſo many magnificent Promiſes of
JESUS CHRIST's in favour of this ſacred Miniſtery:
plunging again all of a ſudden into the Darkneſs of his Sect,
whence he was beginning to get out, ſhews us the Miniſtery
ſo abandon'd by JESUS CHRIST, that there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for its Errors, but by depoſing all at once all thoſe,
which are in the Chair. What agreement have theſe Promiſes,
ſo well acknowledg'd, with ſo univerſal a Corruption?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> then needs only hearken a little to himſelf, for to
come unto us: after having acknowledg'd, in vertue of the
divine Promiſes, the Eternity of the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery in
this Eſtate, he repreſents to us; to find there always all <hi>Truth,</hi>
he needs only conſider, that this imperfect Aſſiſtance, and, as one

               <p>'Tis now eaſy to ſee, that all Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Subtilties ſerve
only to confound him. What avails it him, that, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Churches Viſibility, he endeavour'd to elude the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of this Doctrin, by reducing the Church to the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?
I am contented: where-ever he finds <hi>Church,</hi> let him
underſtand the true Believers; let him even explicate if he will,
theſe Words,<note place="margin">Mat. xviii. v. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Tell it unto the Church,</hi> Tell it to the true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
ſingle them out amongſt the Troop, and judge before
the Lord: or becauſe, as himſelf acknowledges, here is too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
meant <hi>the Church repreſented by her Paſtors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Manſ. Anſ. 4. q.</note> let him ſay,
that theſe Paſtors repreſent the true Believers, which are not
known, and act in their Name. What will theſe Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62471:67"/>
after all advantage him, ſince that in fine, according to his
own Doctrin, this true Church ſhall always be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> viſible, and
theſe true Believers always under a publick Miniſtery from which
JESUS CHRIST ſo little permits his Church to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
that even after theſe Words, <hi>Tell it unto the Church, but
if he neglect to hear the Church, let him he unto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man,</hi> to ſhew how redoubtable the Churches Judgment is, he
immediatly expreſſes the efficacy of the Miniſtery by theſe
Words:<note place="margin">Matt. xviii v. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
and the reſt, which every one knows. Thus I conclude
always equally, that the Church, which we muſt ſhew without
interruption, whether it be only the true Believers, or if they
will, only the Elect, or whether it be in a certain Senſe the
wicked mixt with them,<note place="margin">Matt. xiii. v. 21.</note> and thoſe, that believe <hi>for a while,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the expreſſion of the Goſpel, is a Church always
gather'd under a viſible Miniſtery, and a Body always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of People with their Paſtors, where the Truth is preacht,
not in ſecret,<note place="margin">Matt. x. v. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>but upon the houſe tops.</hi> Let them turn, as much as
they will, 'tis a Church of this Nature and this Conſtitution,
we muſt at all times ſhew, by Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Confeſſion. To make
her diſappear for one ſole Moment, is utterly to annihilate her,
and to overthrow the Promiſes of the Goſpel, in what they
have moſt ſenſible, and moſt apparent: to make her appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
is invindibly to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Thus what
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> explicates to us with ſo much care, beſides that it
is falſe, leaves the Difficulty entire, and his Cauſe in as had a
Condition, as it was before his Defence. But to the end they
may not ſay, we are contented with refuting him, let us tell
him the Truth in few words.</p>
               <p>The Foundation of the Church is the true Believers, and
thoſe principally, <hi>who perſevering to the end,</hi> abide eternally in
<hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> and <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST</hi> in
them, that is to ſay, the Elect. The Wicked, which envinron
them, are after their manner comprehended under the Name
of the Church, as the Nails, as the Hair, as an Eye put out,
and a wither'd Arm, which perhaps receives no more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
is comprehended under the Name of the Body. All
is for theſe true Believers. The Miniſtery, under which they
live, is theirs in the Senſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. iii. v. 22.</note> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid: <hi>All is yours, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas. Not that the Power of their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62471:68"/>
Paſtors comes from them, or that they alone can ſet them up,
and depoſe them. GOD forbid: This Paſtoral and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Power comes from him,<note place="margin">Joh. xx. v. 21.</note> who ſaid: <hi>As my Father hath ſent
me, I alſo ſend you.</hi> This is, what makes St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay in the ſame
place,<note place="margin">1 Cor. iii. v. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is then</hi> Apollos? <hi>and who is</hi> Paul? <hi>The Miniſters of him,
whom you have believ'd, and to every one, as our Lord hath given;</hi>
to you to be Believers, and to us to be Paſtors. Wherefore he
adds farther:<note place="margin">v. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>We are</hi> GODs <hi>Laborers,</hi> or to ſay better, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operators.</hi>
Theſe Miniſters and theſe Workers, eſtabliſht by
GOD are alſo the Miniſters of the Faithful, and in this Senſe
are theirs, becauſe they are <hi>their Servants by JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST,</hi> eſtabliſht in the Chair, not for themſelves, for
as to their own part it would ſuffice them to be ſimple Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,<note place="margin">2 Cor. iv. v. 5.</note>
but for to edify the Saints. He that deſires to be in the
Communion of theſe Saints, need not torment himſelf to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
them from others: for, thô they are not known and
perfectly diſcern'd but by GOD alone, we are ſure to find
them under the publick Miniſtery, and in the exterior Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Catholick Church. We need then only ſtay there,
for to be aſſur'd to find the Saints; becauſe this Profeſſion, and
the ever fruitful Word of the Preachers, which never fails to
engender ſome, keeps them always inſeparably united to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Society, where they receiv'd it. Wherefore when <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S
CHRIST</hi> promiſes to teach always with his Church, he
comprehends all in this Word, and rendring by virtue of this
Promiſe the Church infallible exteriorly in the manifeſtation of
the Truth, renders her interiorly always fruitful. If the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Truth are by their corrupt Life unworthy of
their Miniſtery, GOD ceaſes not to make uſe of them for
to ſanctify his Faithful, for he is able to vivify, even by the
Dead; and a putrify'd Arm may become active in his hands.
Beſides, theſe true Believers, known to GOD alone, animate
all the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtery: a ſmall Number of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
Saints often ſuffices to render the Prayers of a whole Church
efficacious; the Converſion of Sinners will be often aſſoon the
Effect of their ſecret Groans, as the Fruit of the moſt illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Preachings. Wherefore St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> attributes the wholſom
Effects of the Miniſtery to theſe good Souls, for whom and by
whom the Holy Ghoſt is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly in the Church. But that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Power depends on them, is what neither St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:62471:68"/>
nor any of the Orthodox Doctors ever taught; and Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
who cites them, underſtands them not. I will be fully ſeen,
when he ſhall publiſh his writing; 'tis ſufficient for us in the
mean time, to have ſhewn, that he is of thoſe and GOD grant
he be not ſo to the end,<note place="margin">Tit. iii. v. 2.</note> that he is, I ſay, of thoſe, of whom St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>that condemn themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis in effect according to this Apoſtle, the true Character of
all Hereſies; and never any Society more viſibly bore this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

               <p>She condemns her ſelf,<note place="margin">Vid. Sup. 1. Ref. p. 58.</note> when not daring to affirm, that ſhe is

               <p>She condemns her ſelf,<note place="margin">2. Ref. p. 64.</note> when ſhe raiſes all the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſhe teaches, above her own Judgment; and forcing them,
how ignorant ſoever they find themſelves, to examin after her,
without rendring them capable, ſhe renders them indocil and
preſumptuous.</p>
               <p>She condemns her ſelf,<note place="margin">3, 4, 5, 6. &amp; 7. Ref. p. 73. &amp; ſeq.</note> ſince Vaunting of the Scripturus, ſhe
finds not in her ſelf Authority enough to make them be receiv'd
by her Followers on her Word, but leaves her own Children,
to whom ſhe preſents them to be read, in the Uncertainties of
an human Faith.</p>
               <p>She condemns her ſelf,<note place="margin">8. Ref. p. 88.</note> when forc'd to own, that ſhe was not
eſtabliſht but by breaking with all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, which
were in the World, ſhe gives her ſelf the proper Character of
all falſe Churches.</p>
               <p>In fine ſhe condemns her ſelf,<note place="margin">9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Ref. p. 91. &amp; ſeq.</note> when forc'd to acknowledge the
perpetual Viſibility of the Church in the Indefectibility of the

authorizing private perſons againſt all the Succeſſion of the
Apoſtolick Order.</p>
               <p>Now if ſhe condemns her ſelf in ſo many manners, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
would it be for her to condemn her ſelf in fine, by retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into the Boſom of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, which never
ceaſes to recal her to her Unity.</p>
               <p>Let theſe Gentlemen no longer ſpeak to us of the Abuſes,
which make us groan. The Evils of the Church are badly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy'd
by adding that of Schiſm. Are they ſo happy, or, to
