            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hilarion</hi> the Monke, and <hi>S. Malchus,</hi> who was also a most holy man. They were written by that great famous Doctour <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and now here you haue them in our English tongue. I thinke I need not say (for they who will haue the wit to vnderstand me, do already know) that if it were not for the seruice of God, and for that duty which a man owes his friends, he would take no great pleasure in translating the workes of such persons, as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and eminent, both in knowledge, and in the expression thereof. For when the conceptions are choice, &amp; the power of speech is great in any authour,

his translatour is likely enough to find his hands full of worke. <hi>S.

As for any aduise which you may expect, you shall haue but this from me. If when you read these Epistles and Liues, you obserue any particulars which may eyther be beyond your beliefe in regard of the miracls which are recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or else besids your beliefe in respect that you haue been taught some doctrines otherwise; do but cast your mind vpon considering, that it is no lesse then S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> who is speaking to you. Who liuing in the Primitiue Church, within foure hundred years after Christ our Lord, and hauing flourished with vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled fame throughout the whole world, for incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable sanctity and wisedome, and for learning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in all sciences, as well diuine, as humane; it is fit that you should deferre much to him, both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of these miraculous thinges, and in the admitta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce also of these doctrins, which are so expresly insinuated by him to haue beene practised by the Catholicke Church of his tyme.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOVGH I knew before by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of holy Writ, that God bestowes more then is desired at his handes, yea &amp; that he graunts such thinges, <hi>as neyther the eye hath seene, nor the eare hath heard, nor haue ascended into the hart of Man:</hi> yet now, most deare <hi>Russinus,</hi> I haue found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in myne owne person, that this is true. For I, who thought that my greatest ambition was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to be satisfyed, if we might counterfeit a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to one an other, by meanes of letters; do now vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that you are entring deep into the most secret parts of Egypt, and that you are visiting the Quires of Monkes and making a kind of progresse, to see that heauenly family which liues on earth. O that our Lord Iesus, would now suddenly grant me such a kind of transport of my selfe, as <hi>Philippe</hi> made to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, or of <hi>Abacuke</hi> to <hi>Daniel!</hi> How would I euen clasp in your necke with straight imbracements! How would I euen print a kisse vpon that mouth of yours, which either erred or was in the right, togeather with me: But because I lesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to go so to you, then you do to come to me and that this poore body of myne (which when it was at the best, is but weake) hath beene lately euen broken in pieces with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

sicknesse; I haue sent this messenger of my mind to meet you, which tying you vp fast in a knot of loue, may bring you hither to my selfe. The felicity of this vnexpected ioy, was brought me first by our brother <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> I belieued not that to be certaine, which I desired it might be so; both because he had it but by the relation of another, and especially because the strangenes of the thing depriued me of power to giue it credit. But then (whilest my mind was in suspence through the vncertainty whether I should haue my wish or no) a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Monke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who had beene sent long before, through the pious deuotion of that people, to those Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who already in their desire were Martyrs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined me greatly to belieue it. Yet I confesse I was still in a kind of wauering: though he being ignorant both of your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and of your name, did euen thereby make the matter more probable; for that in other circumstances he affirmed the selfe same thinges, which already had beene sayd by an other. At length the truth broke out with a downe waight. For the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent multitude of trauailers related to vs, both that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had been at <hi>Nitria,</hi> and was passed on to the Blessed <hi>Macharius:</hi> and then I gaue full way to my beliefe, and then indeed I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily grieued to see my selfe a sicke man. And vnles my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes had beene such, that after a sort it tyed me vp in chaines; neither had the heat of the hotest part of Summer, nor the Sea which is neuer certaine to such as saile, beene able to hinder me from going towards you, with a holy kind of hast. Belieue me Brother, that the Sea-faring man, who is tossed with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, doth not so earnestly looke towardes his Port; nor do the thirsty fieldes so desire showers of rayne; nor doth the passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mother sitting on the shoare, so expect the arriuall of her sonne, as I doe to imbrace you. When that sudden tempest snatched me away from your side; when that wicked separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion distracted me, who was cleauing to you with the fast knot of Charity; then did the gloomy storme hang ouer me; then did the sky and sea rage bitterly.</p>

                  <hi>Caelicians</hi> had euen consumed me with that scorching heat; the land of <hi>Syria</hi> occured to me, as a most safe and faythfull hauen after shipwrack. Where yet (hauing felt as many diseases in my person as can be conceiued) of my two eyes I lost one. For the sudden fury of a burning feauer snatched away <hi>Innocentius,</hi> whom I accounted a part of my very hart. And now I only enioy <hi>Euagrius,</hi> who is the one and only eye which I haue left; to whose labours otherwise, my continuall infirmity may be accounted to ad a new heap of care. There was also with vs <hi>Hylas</hi> the seruant of holy <hi>Melanius,</hi> who by the purity of his conuersation, hath washed away the spot of slauery to which he had been subiect; and his death did agayne open the wound which scarce was skined before. But because we are forbidden by the Apostles commandement to be afflicted for such as are departed; and to the end that the excessiue force of sorrow may be tempered by the arriuall of a ioyfull newes, I also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to you, to the end that, if you know it not, you may know it, and that if you know it already, we may reioyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at it.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Bonosus,</hi> or rather myne, or (that I may say more truly) <hi>Bonosus</hi> who belongs to vs both, is now climing vp that ladder, which <hi>Iacob</hi> saw in his sleepe. He carryes his Crosse, and neither is troubled with that which may succed, nor with that which is past. He sowes in teares, that he may reape in ioy; and according to the mistery of <hi>Moyses, He hangs vp the serpent in the Desert.</hi> Let all those false <hi>Miracles,</hi> which are founded in lyes, whether they be written either in the Greek or Latin tongue, giue place to this truth. For behould this young man, who was brought vp with me in the liberall arts of this world, who had plenty of estat &amp; honour, amongst the men of his owne ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke; hauing contemned the delight and comfort of his mother, his sisters, and his brother, who was most dear to him, doth now inhabit a certaine Iland which is hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by nothing but ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, and a sea roareing loud about it; (where the craggy rockes, and bare stones, and euen silence it selfe giues terrour) as if he were some new kind of Inhabitant of Paradice.

There doth he all alone, (or rather not alone, but now accompanyed with Christ) behould the glory of God, which euen the Apostls could not see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the Desert. He lookes not indeed, vpon the towring Cittyes of this world; but, he hath giuen vp his name in the numbring of the new Citty: his body is growne horrid with deformed sackcloath; but he will so, be the better able to meet Christ our Lord in the cloudes. It is true that he enioyes no delitious gardens there; but yet he drinkes of the very water of life, from the side of our Lord. Place him before your eyes, most dear friend, and let your whole mind, and cogitation, procure to make him present to you. Then may you celebrat his victory, when you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the labour of his combat.</p>
               <p>The mad Sea is roaring round about the whole Iland, and doth euen rebel againe, in regard it is broken backe, by those mountaines of wreathed rockes. The ground is not there adorned with grasse; and there are no fresh fields ouershadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with delightfull groaues. These abrupt rude hills con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue the place into a kind of hideous prison; where he, all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (as being without any feare, and armed by the Apostle from head to foot) is now hearkening to God, when he reades spirituall things, and then speaking to God when he is praying to him; and perhaps also he hath some vision after the example of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whilest he is dwelling in the Iland. What plots can you thinke the Diuell to be deuising now? What snares can you conceaue that he will be laying? Will he perhaps (being mindfull of his ancient fraude) giue him a temptation by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? But already he hath his answere, <hi>Man liues not by bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi> Will he perhaps offer wealth or glory? But then he shall be tould, <hi>That such as desire to be rich, fall into temptations and traps.</hi> And; <hi>All my glory is in Christ.</hi> Will he take aduantage of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is weakned by fasting, and which may be assalted by some disease; but he shall be beaten backe by this saying of the Apostle: <hi>When I am weake, then am I strong;</hi> and <hi>strength is perfected in weaknes.</hi> Will he threaten death? but he shall heare <hi>Bonosus</hi> say: <hi>I desire to be dissolued and to be with Christ</hi> Will he cast fyery, darts at him? <hi>Bonosus</hi> will receiue them vpon <hi>the target of</hi>

               <p>Thankes be to the, O Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> that I haue one in thy presence, who may pray to the for me. Thou knowest (for to the all our thoughtes are knowne, who searchest the secret of our harts, and who sawest thy Prophet shut vp in the sea, euen in the belly of that huge beast) how <hi>Bonosus</hi> and I, grew vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from our tender infancy, till we were in the flourishing prime of youth; and how the same bosome of our nurses, &amp; the same imbracements of our foster-fathers did carry vs vp and downe the house. And how, after we had studyed, neer to those half barbarours bankes of the Rhine, we liued vpon the same food, and passed our time in the same house; and how I was the first of the two, who had a good desire to serue thee. Remember I beseech thee, how this great warryer of thyne, was once but a green souldier in my company. I haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of thy Maiesty, <hi>He who shall teach others, and not do thereafter, shall be accounted the least in the kingdome of heauen; but he who shall both teach, and do, shall be called the greatest in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Let him enioy the crowne of his vertue, and let him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the lambe in his long whit robe, for the daily martyrdome which he vndergoes. <hi>There are many mansions in the Fathers house;</hi> and <hi>one starre differs in clarity from another.</hi> Impart thou to me, that I may lift vp my head amongst the feet of thy Saints; that when I may haue had a good desire, and he may haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the good worke, thou mayest pardon me because I was not able to fulfill it, and thou mayest giue the reward to him, which he deserues. Perhaps I haue produced my speech into a greater length, then the breuity of an Epistle would permit; and this is euer wont to happen, when I am to say any thing in praise of our <hi>Bonosus.</hi> But (to the end I may returne to that, from which I had digressed) I beseech you, that together with your sight, your mind may not consent to loose a friend; who is long sought, rarely found, &amp; hardly kept. Let any man shine neuer so brightly in gold, and let his glittering plate be mustered out in as great pompe as pleaseth him; charity cannot be bought, nor can there be any price set vpon loue. That frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which can euer fayle, was neuer true. Farewell in Christ.</p>

               <p>IF I would imagine my selfe able to giue you such thankes as you deserue, I should be deceiued. God is able to repay that to your holy soule, which you haue merited at my hands; but I, vnworthy man could neuer conceiue, or euen desire that you should impart so great affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to me in Christ. And though some hold me to be wicked, and euen ouerwhelmed with crimes (and considering my sinnes towards God, euen these crosses are too light;) yet you do wel, in that, measuring others by you selfe, you esteem euen such to be good, as indeed are wicked. For a dangerous thing it is, to pronounce iudgment vpon the seruant of another: and it is not easily pardoned, if a man speake ill of good men. The day will come, when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my selfe, you will lament to see, that so many are tormented in fire. I must be a slaunderous person, I false and lasciuious, I a lyer, and a deceiuer by diabolicall art. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it safer to haue deuised such things as these of innocent persons, or not so much as to haue belieued them, of such as are guilty? They were dayly kissing my hands; &amp; yet, with teeth of vipers, were detracting from me: with their tongues they wery sory; but in their harts they reioyced. Our Lord saw it and scorned them for it, and reserued mee his poore miserable seruant, to be hereafter iudged together with them. One man calumniated my gat and laughter; another detracted from me by occasion of my countenance; another suspected some what by my playnenes. I remayned with them vpon the point of three years; I was often euen enuironed by a whole troupe of virgins; I expounded holy Scriptures to many, the best I could. This exercise bred frequence of conuersation, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation familiarity, and familiarity confidence. But yet, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say what other thing they euer found in me, then might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Christian? did I euer take any of their moneyes? did I not despise al Presents, whether they were great, or smal? Was any of their mettall euer found to gingle in my hand? Was my speech indirect, or myne eye wanton? No other thing is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8131:7"/>
to me but my Sexe, &amp; euen not so much as this was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer obiected, but onely when <hi>Paula</hi> and <hi>Melania</hi> tooke their Iourney to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These men belieue the slaunderer, when he tels the lye; but why do they not belieue him, when he denyes it? He is the selfe same man, he was. He now auowes me to be innocent, whom formerly he made guilty; and surely torments do rather exact the confession of a truth, then good fellowship, &amp; sport; sauing that men vse more easily to belieue that, which being fayned, is gladly heard, or rather which is procured to be fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Before I was acquainted with the house of holy <hi>Paula,</hi> the affections of the whole Citty fell vpon me, and I was almost generally esteemed worthy of the highest place of Priesthood. <hi>Damasus</hi> of Blessed memory spake of no body but me. I was sayd to be holy, I was sayd to be humble, and eloquent. Did I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the house of any one who was counted immodest? Did gay cloathes, or bright gemmes, or paynted faces, or the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious desire of gold, carry me away? Was there no other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron in all <hi>Rome,</hi> who could tame this vnruly mind of myne, but one who was all lamenting, and fasting, and neglecting her selfe euen to extremity, and who was almost blind with teares, and who imploring the mercy of God all night long, was often taken in the manner by the next dayes sunne? Whose songes were the psalmes, whose discourse was of the Ghospel, whose delights were Chastity, and whose life was a continuall Fast? Could no other creature please me, but she whom I did neuer so much as see at meat. But as soon as I began to esteem, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to reuerence her, for the merit of her chastity, I was instantly depriued of all vertue. O enuy which first doest euer feed vpon thy selfe! O craft of Satan, which euer is persecuting holy things! There were no other which made talke to the whole Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Paula,</hi> and <hi>Melania;</hi> who contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their fortunes, and forsaking all that which might chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge loue at their hands, did exalt the Crosse of our Lord, as the ensigne of piety.</p>
               <p>If they had frequented the Bathes, if they had made vse of oyntments, if they had wedded riches and widowhood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the matter both of lasciuiousnes &amp; liberty, they might
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8131:8"/>
still haue bene called great Ladies, and Saints; but now, they being in sackloath and ashes, will needs haue the reputation of beauty, and descend into hel fyer, with fasting and vtter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of themselues; belike, because it was not lawfull for them to perish in company, with applause of the people.</p>
               <p>If they were Pagans who carped at this kind of life, or yet if they were Iewes, we should haue some comfort in not pleasing them, who are displeased with <hi>Christ.</hi> But now (O infamous crime!) some who carry the name of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, laying aside all care of their owne houses, and neglecting the beame in their owne eyes, looke for motes in the eyes of others. With their teeth they teare the holy vowe of chastity; and esteeme it to be a remedy for their owne fault, if there be not a Saint in the world, if all men be subiect to their detraction, if there be a multitude of such as sinne, and a troupe of such as perish.</p>
               <p>Thou takest pleasure to bathe daily; another houlds such kind of cleanlines to be meer filth. Thou feedest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pheasants, till thou doest euen regorge againe, &amp; thinkest thy selfe a great man, when thou hast eaten vp some dainty foule; but I stuffe my body with beanes. Thou art delighted in great companies of people, who laugh loud; and I take gust in <hi>Paula,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lania</hi> mourning. Thou couetest the goods of others; these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their owne. Thou art pleased with drinking wine dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with honey; &amp; they find more sauour in cold water. Thou accountest thy selfe to loose whatsoeuer thou possessest not, thou eatest not, thou deuourest not, for the present; but they desire future things, and belieue that to be true which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Say they do it foolishly &amp; idly, as belieuing the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bodies; what hast thou to do with that? for to vs, on the other side is thy life despleasant. Much good may it do thee with thy fatnes; but I had rather be leane and pale. Thou hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest such people to be miserable; and we esteem thee to be so much more. We are euen with one another, and either of vs thinkes his fellow mad.</p>
               <p>These words my Lady <hi>Asella,</hi> did I write to you in great hast, both with greif &amp; teares, euen when I was taking ship; and I giue thankes to my God, for being thought worthy by him, that the world should hate me. But do you pray, that I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8131:8"/>
may retorne to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> may not gouerne me, but <hi>Iesus</hi> the some of <hi>Iosedech.</hi> Let <hi>Esdras</hi> come, and carry me back into my country. Foole that I was, who would needs be singing the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticle of our Lord, in a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g land; and forsaking Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> would needs craue succour of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But I remembred not the Ghospell: because he who went out of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> fell instantly into the hand of theeues, and was stripped and wounded, and almost slayne. But though the Priest, and Leuite despised him; yet that Samaritan is mercifull. To whom when it was sayd, <hi>That he was a Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and that he had a deuill,</hi> he denyed not himselfe to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan: because looke what a Guardian or keeper is with vs, that is a <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the Hebrew tongue. Some there are who basely giue me out to be a Witch. I who am no better them a seruant, am content to weare this badge of my fayth; for the Iewes cald my Lord, Magitian. The Apostle was also sayd to be a seducer. Let no temptation light on me other then humane How small a part of afliction haue I endured, who yet serue vnder the ensigne of the Crosse?

Some three dayes since, I said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Lea</hi> of blessed memory, and straight I found my selfe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8131:9"/>
moued, and my mind gaue me, that I was not to be silent, of a Virgin; since I had spoken of one, who was but in the second degree of chastity. I will therefore briefly declare the life of <hi>Aseliae,</hi> to whom yet I will pray you not to reade this Epistle; for she is troubled with hearing her owne praises; but rather vouchsafe to reade it to some others of the younger sort, that so addressing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues according to her exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, they may know they haue a conuersation to imitat, which carryes in it the very rule of a perfect life. I omit to say, that before she was borne, she had a blessing in her mothers wombe; and that the virgin was shewed to her father, as he was taking his rest, in a violl of cristall, and more pure then any looking glasse: That being, yet, as it were in the cradle of her infancy, and scarce excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tenth yeare of her age, she was consecrated to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her future happines. But let all this be ascribed to grace, which did preced any labour of hers: though God, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowes future things, did both sanctify <hi>Ieremy</hi> in the womb, and made <hi>Iohn</hi> exult in his mothers bowels, and seperated <hi>Paul</hi> for the Ghospell of his sonne, before the creation of the world. But I come to those things, which after the twelfth year of her age she chose, she apprehended, she held fast, she begane, &amp; she perfected by her owne great labour.</p>
               <p>Being shut vp within the straightes of one little Cell, she enioyed the large liberty of a paradice. The same spot of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was the place both of her prayer, and of her sleepe. Fasting was but a sport with her, and hunger was her food. And when not the desire of feeding, but the necessity of nature would draw her to eat, she would, by the taking of bread and salt and cold water, rather stirre vp-hunger, then take it downe. And I had almost forgotten that which I should haue said before; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she first resolued to enter vpon this kind of life, she tooke that ornament of gold which is vsually called a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ampry (because the mettal being wrought into certaine wyers a chaine is made in such a wreathing forme) and sould it, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her parents. And hauing so procured and bought a courser coat, then she was able to obtayne of her mother, she did suddenly, by that pious and fortunate begining of her spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall negotiation, consecrat her selfe to our Lord, in such sort,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8131:9"/>
that al her kinred might quickly know, that no change of mind could be exorted from her, who by her cloathes had already renounced the world. But as I was begining to say, she euer carryed her selfe with such reseruation, and so contained she her selfe within the priuate limits of her owne lodging, as that she would neuer put her selfe in publicke, nor know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the conuersation of any man. And, which yet is more to be admired, she did more willingly loue then see euen her owne sister, though she were also a virgin. Somewhat she would worke with her owne handes, as knowing that it is written; <hi>They who will not labour, let them not eat.</hi> She would euer be speaking to her <hi>Spouse,</hi> either in the way of praying or singing. To the <hi>Shrines of Martyrs,</hi> she would make such hast, that she would scarce be seen. And as she would be euer glad, for that she had vndertaken this course of life, so would she more vehemently exult in that she was vnknowne to all the world. Throughout the whole yeare, she would be fed with a continuall kind of fast, eating nothing till after two or three dayes But then in Lent, she would hoise vp the sayles of her ship, and with a cheerfull countenaunce, would knit one weeke to another, by one onely meale. And (which perhaps will seeme impossible to be belieued, though by the fauour of God it be possible) she is now arriued in such sort to the fiftieth yeare of her age, as that she hath no payne in her stomacke, &amp; no torment in her bowels. Her lying vpon the ground, hath not wasted any of her limmes; her skinne growne rugged with her sackcloath, hath contracted no ill condition, or offensiue smell; but being healthfull in body, and yet more healthfull in mind, she holdes her retirednes to be deliciousnes, and in a swelling and tempestuous towne, she finds a wildernes of Moncks. But these things you know better then I, from whom I haue learned some particulars, &amp; whose eyes, haue seen, that the knees of her holy body haue the hardnes of a camels skinne, through her frequent vse of prayer. As for me, I declare that which I haue bene able to know. There is nothing more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing then her seuerity; nothing more sad then her sweetnes; nor more sweet, then her sadnes. So is palenes in her face, as that it discouers her abstinence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet yeeldes no ayre of ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8131:10"/>
Her speech is silent, and her silence full of speech. Her pace is nether suift, nor slow. He countenance is still the same. A careles cleanlynes, and an incurious cloathing; and her dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is, to be without being dressed. And by the onely temper of her life, she hath deserued, that in a Citty full of pompe, of lasciuiousnes, and of delicacy, wherein humility is a misery, both they who are good proclaime her, and the wicked dare not detract from her. Let widowes and virgins imitate her, let marryed woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuerence her, let such as are faulty feare her, and let Priests looke with much respect vpon her.</p>

                  <hi>ABRAHAM</hi> was tempted concerning his sonne, and was found so much the more faithfull: <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sould into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he might feed his Father and his brethren: <hi>Ezechias</hi> was frighted by the sight of death at hand, that so pouring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe forth in teares, his life might be prolonged for fifteen years: The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> was shaken in the Passion of our Lord, that weeping bitterly he might heare those wordes, <hi>Feed my sheepe: Paul,</hi> that rauening wolfe. and who withall grew to be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Beniamin,</hi> was blinded in an extasis, that so he might se afterwards; &amp; being compassed in by a sudden horrour of dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes, he called vpon God, whom he had persecuted long as man.

Her knees are bent vpon the bare ground, and that face which formerly had beene defiled and daub'd with painting, is now often washed with teares. After prayers they rattle out the Psalmes, and her very necke, her weake hammes, and her eyes pointing towardes sleep, can hardly yet (through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue ardour of her mind) obtaine leaue that they may take rest.

done by speech,) I beseech you saith he, reproue them by your letters, and draw them backe to good agreement, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may acknowledge the daughter, &amp; the daughter the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swered him thus; you put me indeed to a faire taske; that I being a stranger should reconcile them, when a sonne and a brother could not do it. As if I sat in some Episcopall chaire, and were not shut vp in a little Cell; and being farre remote from troups of men, do not either lament my sins past, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to auoid such as are at hand: besides the ill fauourednes of it for a man to he hid in body, and to wander ouer the whole world, with his tongue. Then sayd he, you are to fearfull. And where is now that courage, wherewith you haue so wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily touched the whole world, for you haue bene a kind of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius.</hi> This, said I, is that which puts me of, and suffers me not so much as to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my mouth. For since by reprouing the faults of others, my selfe am growne faulty, and according to the vulgar saying, <hi>VVhen euery man doth so wrangle, and contradict me, me thinkes I do neither heare nor touch,</hi> and euen the very wals beat reproaches backe vpon me, &amp; drinkers of wine make songes of me, I being constrayned by sad experience, haue learned to hold my peace, esteeming it better <hi>to place a guard before my mouth, &amp; a strong doore before my lippes, then that my hart should decline towards the wordes of malice</hi> for feare least whilest I taxe vice in others my selfe should fall into the vice of detraction. When I had said thus much, he answered me after this manner. To say truth, is not to detract; nor doth a priuate reprehension amount to make a generall doctrine; since they are few, or none who fal within the compasse of that fault. I besech you therefore not to permit me to be come in vayne, who haue bene vexed by so long a iourney. For our Lord knowes, that next after my visiting these holy places, my chief occasion was, that by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your letters, I might cure both my Sister and my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Well then said I, I am content to do as you bid me; for both my letters serue for the other side of the Sea, &amp; that speech which is dictated vpon so particular an occasion as this, will hardly find any other whom it may offend. But as for you, I beseech you that the matter may be carryed with great secret, that when you shall haue taken it with you by way of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

Rotten flesh must be cured with a burning iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the poyson of serpents, driuen away with an Antidot. And that which giueth much payne, must be expelled by a greater. In the last place this I say, that although the conscience may haue no wound in it of any crime, yet fame suffers ignominy thereby. Mother and daughter are names of a Religious kind of tendernes, they are wordes of obseruance, they are bondes of nature, and they are of the highest leagues vnder God. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues no prayse if you loue; but it is extreme wickednes, if you hate one another. Our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was subiect to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, he carryed veneration to his Mother, whose very Father he was. He was obseruant of his foster-father, whom yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had nourished; and he remembred that he had beene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the wombe of the one, and in the armes of the other. Whereupon, when he was hanging on the Crosse, he comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Mother to his Disciple, and he neuer forsooke that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till his death.</p>
               <p>But you O daughter (for now I forbeare to speake to the mother, whome perhaps either age, or weaknes, or desire of solitude may make excusable) you, I say, O Daughter, can you hold her house too straight. You liued ten monethes shut vp in her wombe, &amp; can you not endure to liue one day with her in one chamber? Are you not able to like, that she should haue an eye vpon you? and doe you fly from such a domesticall witnesse as she is, who knowes euery motion of your hart; as she who bare you, who brought you vp, and lead you on to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8131:15"/>
of this age. If you be a Virgin, why mislike you to be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept? If you be defiled, why doe you not marry in the sight of the world? This is the second planche, or table, after ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>racke; let that which you haue ill begun, at least be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this remedy. But yet neither do I say thus much, to the end that after sinne I may take away the vse of Pennance, or that she who hath begun ill, may perseuer to do ill; but because I despaire of any separation, after such coniunction. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if you go to your mother, after you shall haue beene subiect to that ruine, you may in her presence, more easily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your selfe for that which you lost by being absent from her. If yet you be entire, and haue not lost it, take care to keep it. To what purpose are you now in that house, where it will be necessary for you, either to perish, or to fight continually, that you may ouercome? What creature did euer sleep securely neere a Viper, who though she do not bite, yet she will keep him awake? It is a point of more safety not to be in danger of perishing, then being in danger not to perish. In the one there is tranquility, in the other there must be labour and skill: in the former we ioy; and in the later we do but escape. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will answere: <hi>My mother is of a harsh condition, she desirs worldly thinges, she loues riches, she knowes not what belonges to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, she paintes her eyebrowes blacke, she takes care to be curiously dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and hinders my purpose of chastity, and I cannot liue with such an one.</hi> But first, if she were such as you pretend, you should haue the greater merit, if you forsook not such an one as she. She carryed you long in her wombe, she nursed you long, &amp; with a tender kind of sweetnes did endure the vntowardnes of your infancy. She washed your fowle cloutes, and was often defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with your silth. She sate by you when your were sicke; and did not only endure her owne incommodities, but yours also. She brought you to this age, and she taught you how to loue Christ our Lord. Let nor her conuersation displease you, who first did consecrate you, as a Virgin, to your spouse.</p>
               <p>But yet, if you cannot endure her, but will needs fly away from her delicacies, and if (as we vse to say) she be a kind of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mother; in that case you may haue other Virgins, you will not want some holy quier, where chastity is kept. Why,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8131:15"/>
forsaking your Mother, haue you taken a liking to one, who perhaps hath also forsaken his Mother, and his Sister? She is of a hard condition: but this man forsooth, is sweet &amp; kind. She is a chider, but he is therefore easily appeased. I aske whether you followed this man at the first; or whether you found him afterward? For if you followed him at the first; the reason is plaine, why you forsooke your mother. If you found him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward; you shew plainly what it was, which you could not find in your Mothers house.</p>
               <p>This is a sharp kind of griefe for me, which woundes me with myne owne sword. He who walkes simply or plainly, walkes bouldly. I would faine hold my peace, if myne owne conscience did not giue remorce; and if now I did not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend myne owne fault, in the person of another, and if by the beame of myne owne eye, I saw not the more which is in an others. Bu now, since I am farre off among my brethren, and whilest, e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioying their society, I live honestly vnder witnesses of my conuersation, and I see, and am seene very seldome, it is a most impudent thing, if you will not follow his modesty, whose example you haue followed otherwise. Now if you say: <hi>Myne owne conscience is sufficient for me, I haue God for my iudge, who is the witnesse of my life; I care not for the talke of men.</hi> Heare what the Apostle writes: <hi>Prouiding to do good thinges not only before God, but also before all men.</hi> If any man will detract from you, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that you are a Christian, or that you are a Virgin, let it not trouble you, though you haue forsaken your Mother, to the end that you may liue in some Monastery with Virgins. Such detraction will be a praise to you, as when seuerenes, and not too much loosenes is reproued in the Virgin of God. Such kind of cruelty is piety: for you preferre him before your Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whome you are commanded to preferre before your life it self; and whome if she will also preferre, she wil acknowledge you both to be her daughter, and her sister.</p>
               <p>But what, is it such a crime to liue in society with a Holy man? You make a wry necke, and now you draw me into a kind of quarell: and so, as that either I must allow the thing which I like not; or vndergo the enuy of many. A holy man doth neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8131:16"/>
them both, he carryes veneration to them both. Though the daughter be holy; yet if the Mother be a widow, she giues a good testimony of chastity. If that man of whome you know, be of equall age to your selfe, let him honour your Mother as his owne. If he be elder then you, let him loue you as his daughter, and make you subiect to the discipline o a Father. It becomes not the same of either of you, that he should loue you better then your mother; least it may seem, that he chooses not so much to loue you for other respects, as because you are younge. And all this I would say, if you had not a brother o your owne, who is a Monke, or if you wanted other domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call helpes. But now (O excessiue cause of griefe!) betweene a Mother, and a brother, a mother who is a widow, and a brother who is a Monke, how comes it to pasle, that a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger interposes himselfe? It were good for you, that you knew your selfe both to be a daughter, and a sister: but if you cannot do both, at least let your brother please you; and if your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ill conditioned, she will be gentler, who bare you. Why do you waxe pale? Why are you so much troubled? Why do you now grow to blush; and by your trembling lippes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the impatience of your hart? There is no loue, but only that of a wife, which outstrips the loue of a mother, and of a brother. I heare besides that you are walking vp and downe by houses in the country, &amp; such other places of delight, with your Allies and kindred, and such kind of people as that; nor do I doubt, but that it is some Cosen or Sister, for whose solace you are lead about like a Page after this new cut. For God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that I should suspect you to affect the conuersation of men, howsoeur they may be neer you, either in Neighbourhood, or blood.</p>
               <p>I beseech you therefore, O Virgin, to answere me. Do you walke in this company of your friendes, either with your louer or without him? Without faile, how impudent soeuer you may be, you dare not produce him, before the eyes of secular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. For if you should doe thus, all the neighbours would make songes both of him, &amp; you; nay the world would poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

presence, as if they held him for a Saint; when they shall find themselues out of your sight, will scoffe at such a prodigious kind of husband. But now if you go alone (which I rather thinke) amongst that younger sort of seruants, among woemen who either are marryed, or to be marryed, among those wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton maides, and those spruse and well apparelled young men; if I say, you goe like a maid in meane apparell, euery young beardles fellow, will be reaching forth his hand towards you, and will be supporting you when you are weary, &amp; then strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his fingers, he will either tempt you, or be tempted by you. You shall be at some banquet among men, and matrons; you shall see them kisse, and tast their meat, to one another; &amp; not without danger to your selfe, you shall admire the silke, &amp; cloath of gold which others were. In the banquet, you shall also be compelled as it were, against your will, to eat flesh. To the end that you may be drawne to drinke wine, they will be praysing it, as a creature of God. That you may be induced to frequent bathes, they wil speake against being vncleanly. And whensoeuer you shall do any of those things, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you to, with any kind of vnwillingnes, they will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish you with a full mouth to be pure, and simple, a great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and an ingenuous creature. The while, some man shalbe singing to you, when you are at table, and whilest he is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer his ditty with sweet diuision, he wil be often casting an eye towards you who haue no guardian, not daring to look vpon mens wiues. He will speake to you by gesture, and that which he dares not expresse by wordes, he will by signes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many shrewd incitements to pleasure, euen mindes as hard as iron are made soft towards lust; which moues with greater appetite in Virgins, who thinke that to be sweetest, which they know not. The fables of Heathen Poets relate, that Mariners are driuen headlong vpon rockes by the singing of <hi>Syrens;</hi> and that trees and beasts were inchanted, and euen hard flintes made to yeeld, vpon the hearing of <hi>Orphe us</hi> harpe. Virginity is hardly kept, at feasting tables. A smooth skinne, shewes a sordid mind. We haue read whilest we were boyes at Schoole, &amp; we haue seene the story grauen in brasse, so wel that it seemed euen to breath with life, of one who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8131:17"/>
vpon him but skine and bone, and yet being fired with vnlawfull loue, that plague did no sooner leaue him, then his life. And what then will become of you, O mayd, who are healthfull, delicate, fat, high complexioned, boyling vp in meate, in wine, in bathes, amongst marryed woemen, and young men? who though you should not doe that which will be desired of you, may yet hold it to be an vgly kind of eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against your selfe, euen that you are desired. A lustfull mind doth very eagerly hunt after dishonest thinges, and for the very reason of being vnlawfull, it is suspected to be the more delightfull. Euen a poore and blacke vest, if it be drawne close, and haue no wrinkles in it, is an argument of a consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting will; and if it be worne so long, as to be drawne after vp on the ground, that she may seeme the taller; and if the coat be left vnstitched of purpose, that somewhat may appeare, and if any thing which is ill fauoured must be concealed, and that which is handsome be disclosed. The buskin also of her that walkes, if it be daintily shining and blacke, serues for a call to young men, by the noise thereof. The little brests are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with strippes, and the wast is straitned with a wretched girdle.

The teares of your Brother, &amp; those intolerable deep sighes, which euery minute he was sending forth, haue declared thus much. And I wish he had rather fayned it, &amp; had spoken more out of feare, then know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But belieue me, a man lyes not, when he weepes. He grieues that a yong man is preferred by you before himselfe, yea and he, no delicate creature, nor one who treates himselfe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He is the steward, and the Lord; and yet he preuents the inferiour ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in their Offices: at whome the whole house rayles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming against him as detayning all that, which the Lady doth not allow &amp; giue. These seruants are a complaining kind of people, and how much soeuer you affoard, it is still too little with them. For they consider not out of what meanes, but how much is giuen them, and they comfort themselues the best they they can, in all their griefe, by deeraction only. One cals him a Parasite, another an Impostour, a third an Vnderminer of the estate, and a fourth will find some new name for him. They say he sits at her beds side, that he fetches midwiues, when she is sicke, that he reaches her the bason, warmes her cloathes, and foulds her swathing bandes. Men are apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the worst, and whatsoeuer is deuised at home, turnes a broad into common fame. Nor must you wonder, if your maids and men giue out these thinges of you; when euen your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and your Brother make the same complaint. Do therefore this, which I aduise and euen begge of you: be first reconciled to your Mother; and if that be not possible, to your Brother at least; or if yet you will needes implacably detest these names of so great dearnes, at least deuide your selfe from him, whome you are sayd to haue preferred before them. If you cannot doe euen thus much, yet respect the honour of your friends, and if you cannot forsake your companion, yet make more honest vse of him. Keep seuerall houses, and doe not eat at the same table, least men of ill tongues prooue to slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der you with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you lye both in one bed, when they see that you liue both in a house. You may, for your necessary occasions, take what kind of solace you will, and yet want some part of this publicke infamy.

               <p>You haue lost your owne names, and now you are called by the names of one another; for you are said to be his, and he yours.

Be you with your Mother, and let him be with your Brother. More safely may you loue the companion of your Brother, &amp; more honestly may your Mother loue the friend of her sonne then of her daughter?</p>
               <p>But if you will come to no reason, if you will needes contemne my counsell with a frowning brow, this letter shal proclaime these thinges to you with a loud voice. Why doe you thus besiege the seruantes of another? Why make you him, who is the seruant of Christ, to be a houshould-seruant of yours? Looke vpon the people, and behould the faces of euery one. He reads in the Church, and all men cast their eyes on you; fauing that you do euen glory in your infamy, as if you had the priuiledge of marryed people. Nor are you any longer now content with secret infamy. You call saucy bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by the name of liberty; you are growne to haue the face of an Harlot, and you know not how to blush. Againe you will be calling me maligne, againe suspitious, and a listner and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisher of tales. Am I suspitious? am I malitiously disposed? who as I tould you in the beginning of this Epistle, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore write, because I did not suspect. But it is you who are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, dissolute, and who despise counselle, and who being fiue and twenty yeares ould, haue taken a young fellow with little haire vpon his face; and you haue wrapt him vp in your armes, as if it were in netts. A rare instructer indeed, who may admonish and fright you, euen with the seuerity of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And though in no age one be safe from lust, yet when the head is gray, a body is defended from publicke infamy. The day will come, it will come (for tyme slides away whilest

you thinke not of it) when this dapper deare man of yours (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause woemen grow quickly old, and especially such as liue in company with men) will find either a richer, or a younger then you. Then will you repent your selfe of this course, and you will be weary of your obstinacy; when you shall haue lost both your goods, and fame; and when that which was ill ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, shall be well deuided. Vnles perhaps you be secure, that your loue getting the growth of so long tyme, you shall need to feare no separation.</p>
               <p>And you also, O Mother, who by reason of your age wil be afrayd of no malediction, yet be not you so hould as to sin. Let your daughter rather be separated from you, then you be seuered from her. You haue a sonne, and a daughter, and a sonne in law, yea and also a companion in house for your daughter. Why do you go in quest after sorraine comforts, and stirre vp that fire which now lyes vnder ashes? At least it is more handsome for you to beare with the fault of your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to seeke any occasion through committing faults your selfe. Let your sonne, who is a Monke be with you, as the stay of your widowhood, and the entertainement of your tender loue. Why doe you seeke out a stranger, especially to be in that house, which is not able to hold your sonne, and daughter in it? You are now of such age, as that you may haue grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by your daughter. Inuite them both to you, and let her returne to you in company of her man, who went out alone. I sayd her man, not her husband. Let no man slaunder me, I meant but to expresse the sexe; not the state of mariage. Or if she blush, and shrinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conceaue that the house wherein she was borne, is growne too little for her house; go you to her house, though it be strait, it will more easily be able to receaue a Mother and a Brother, then a stranger, whith whome she cannot certainly remaine chast in one house, vnlesse she haue another chamber.

The witnesses being called, did testify in his behalfe, who had done the wrong. The other would weep against that lye, but no man was found who would belieue the truth; only the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would subtilly come in to his defence, that so the brother might not be swallowed vp by too excessiue griefe. What shal I say more? There passed a yeare after this manner. Vpon the ending whereof, the young man being interrogated about his former thoughts, whether yet they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When you come to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mans estate, if your life be answearable, and either the people, or the Bishop of the Citty make choice of you, into the clergy, doe you those thinges, which belong to a Priest, and let the best Priests be your patterne.

               <p>But who, O you mad headed man. Did euer adore the Martyrs? Who thought that a man was God? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when they were thought by the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> to be <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>

and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and had a mind to offer them sacrifice, teare their garments, and declare that they were but men? Not but that they were better then <hi>Iupiter</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> who were dead long before; but because, vnder the errour of Paganisme, the honour which was due to God, was deferred to them. This we also read of <hi>Peter,</hi> who when <hi>Cornelius</hi> desired to adore him, raysed him vp by the hand, &amp; sayd; <hi>Rise vp, for I am also a man.</hi> And dare you say, <hi>That same, I know not what, which you worship in that little violl to be carryed vp and downe?</hi> What is that thing which you call by the name of <hi>I know not what?</hi> I would faine vnderstand what you meane by it.

               </p>
               <p>He is grieued that the Relikes of Martyrs are preciously couered, and wrapped vp, and that they are not foulded in cloutes, or course haire clouths, or cast in fine into some dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, that so <hi>Vigilantius</hi> alone, being drunke a sleep, might be adored.

But read the Ghospel. <hi>The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Iacob, is not the God of the dead but of the liuing.</hi> If therefore they be aliue, they are shut vp, belike according to your opinion, in some honest pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

               </p>
               <p>But will you prescribe a law for God? Will you tye vp the Apostles in chaines, in such sorte as that they shall be kept in prison, till the day of iudgment, and not be with their Lord; they of whome it is written, <hi>They follow the Lambe wheresoeuer he goes?</hi> If therefore the Lambe be euery where, they also who are with the Lambe, are to be belieued to be euery where.

               <p>You say further in your booke, <hi>that whilest we liue, we may pray mutually for one another; but after we shall be dead the prayer of noe one is to be heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Concerning <hi>Vigils,</hi> and sitting vp at night, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be celebrated in Martyrs Churches, I haue giuen a briefe answere in another Epistle, which I wrote almost two yeares since, to <hi>Riparius</hi> the holy Priest If therefore you thinke that they are to reiected, least otherwise we may seem to celebrate many seuerall Easters; and that we keep not solemne <hi>Vigils</hi> at the end of euery yeare: by the same reason no sacrifices should be offered to Christ vpon the Sundaies, least we should seeme to celebrate the Easter of the Resurrection of our Lord often; &amp; so we should not haue one Easter, but many. Now that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8131:33"/>
and fault, which is many tymes committed in the night, betweene young men, and the basest sorte of woemen, is not to be imputed to deuout persons; because some such thing is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes found to be committed, euen in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Vigil</hi> the Easter; but now the fault of few, must not preiudice this Act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; For euen without <hi>Vigils,</hi> men may commit that sinne, either in their owne or others houses. The treason of <hi>Iudas,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed not the fayth of the Apostles, and so the ill <hi>Vigills</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, must not destroy our <hi>Vigils;</hi> but rather let them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to watch to chastity, who sleep to lust. For that which was good being done once, cannot be euill, if it be done often. And if it be culpable through any fault, it is not culpable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was done often, but because it was done at all. Let vs not therfore, belike, watch at Easter, least the long entertained desire of some adulterer, may chaunce to be fullfilled then, least the wife find occasion of committing sinne; least she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt her selfe, from being shut vp by her husbandes keye.

               <p>I cannot runne ouer all those particulers, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the letters of those holy Priests; but some I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce out of his owne bookes.

Our Lord wrought <hi>Miracles</hi> for such as were yet incredulous; and yet the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our Lord are not be taxed, because they were for Infidels, but they were to be admired so much the more, because they were of so great power, as to tame euen the stifest mindes, and oblige them to imbrace the fayth.

I doe all so tremble both in body and minde. Perhaps you will scoffe at me for this, as if it were the dotage of some old woman.

Go you belching on, with the men who lead a worldy life. I will fast with those woemen, yea and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with those Religious men, who carry chastity euen in their countenance; and hauing their faces pale, through continuall abstinence, declare the modesty of Christ.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes you also seem to be troubled at another thing and that is; least if chastity, sobriety, and fasting should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to take deep footing in <hi>France,</hi> your Tauernes would make little gayne; and so you should not be able to continue those <hi>Vigills</hi> of the Diuel, &amp; those drunken feasts, all night lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.</p>
               <p>It is related to me besides, in the same letters, that you forbid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men to be at any charge, for the vse and comfort of those holy men, who liue at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> against the authority of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> yea and of <hi>Peter</hi> also, and of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who gaue handes to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> in <hi>testimony of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with them, and required them to be mindefull of the poore.</hi> But now if I should answere these thinges, you would presently barke out and say, that I am pleading myne owne cause; you who haue been so liberall to all the world, as that if you had not come to <hi>Iesuralem,</hi> &amp; had not powred forth your own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or that of your Patrons, we should all forsooth haue bene in danger to starue. For my part, I will but say that which the blessed Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> deliuers almost in all his Epistles, and enioyneth the Churches, which had bene conuerted among the Gentiles, namely that vpon the first day after the Sabboth, (that is to say, vpon the Sunday) men were all to conferre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that alms, which should be sent to <hi>Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> either by their disciples, or by others, whome they should appoint; and that if it proued to be of moment, himself might either carry or send it. In the Acts of the Apostles, speaking to <hi>Foel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But yet he desired to impart the almes to the poore of those holy places, who leauing their fortunes for Christ, had deuoted themselues wholly to the seruice of our Lord. It were a long businesse, if I would reflect vpon all the testimonies which might be brought out of euery one of those Epistles, wherein the Apostle endeauours, and with his whole affection makes hast to ordaine, that money should be addressed to the faythfull at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and to the holy places; not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy couetousnes, but for their necessary comfort; not for the gathering together of riches, but for the vphoulding of their weake bodies, and for the auoyding of hunger and cold; this custome continuing in Iury euen to this day, not only among vs Christians, but among the Iewes also, that they who medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon the lawes of our Lords day and night, and who haue no Father vpon earth, but only God, should be cherished by the charities of the Synagogues of the whole world, with a fit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality; not that some should be at ease, and some in misery, but that the aboundance of some might serue to supply the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of others: But you will answere, that euery man may do this in his owne country, and that poore people will not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be mainteyned vpon the charity of the Church. And so also neither doe we deny, but that almes is to be giuen to all kind of poore people, yea though they be euen Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and Iewes, if there be enough for all.

               <p>Being inflamed by the vertues of these men, she deuised, from one minute to another, how to forsake her country.

               <p>The sailes were by that time spread, and by stretching of the Oares, the ship was drawne into the deepe.

From the death of her husband to the time of her owne death, she did neuer eat with any man, how holy soeuer he were; no not although he were placed in Episcopall dignity. She went not to any bathes, in but cases of danger of her life. Euen when she was opprest with the most sharp feauers she lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no soft beds; but she rested vpon the hard ground being only ouerspred with certeyn little poore cloathes of haire, if that indeed may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>It is vsuall with many of our Matrons, to bestow their gifts at the sound of the trumpet, and carrying a profuse hand towardes some few, to withdraw their bounty from the rest; from which vice she was wholy free. For so did she deuid her Charity among them all, as was necessary for euery one, not towardes excesse, but for necessity. No poore man could goe empty from her, which yet she was not able to compasse by the greatnes of her estate, but by her prudence in dispensing; and this she would euer be repeating, <hi>Blessed be the mercifull; for they shall obtaine mercy.</hi> And; <hi>As water quenches fire, so doth almes extinguish sinne.</hi> And againe; <hi>Make your selues friendes of the vniust Mammon, that they may receaue you into eternall Fabernacles.</hi> And: <hi>Giue almes, and behold all thinges are cleane to you.</hi> And the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of <hi>Daniel</hi> admonishing <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> the King, <hi>that he was to redeeme his sinnes with almes.</hi> She would not cast away her money vpon these stones, which are to passe away with this world, but vpon those liuing stones which rowle vp &amp; down the earth; and wherof, in the <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>By these and the like testimonies of Scripture (as if it had beene with some armour of God) did she defend her selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all ill opposition; but especially against cruell enuy; &amp; by suffering iniuries, she would mitigate the fury of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged minds. In a word, her patience did appeare in al things euen to the day of her death: and so did the enuy of others, which euer gnawes vpon the harbourer thereof; and whilest it striues to hurt the contrary party it growes mad and most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

               <p>I will now speake of the order of her Monastery, &amp; how she conuerted the pouerty of the Saints, into her owne gaine; <hi>Shee sowed carnall thinges, that she might reap spirituall.</hi> She gaue earthly things, that she might obtaine heauenly; she gaue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thinges, that she might exchange them for eternall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a Monastery of men, which she assigned to be gouerned by men, she gathered many Virgins together out of diuers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces; such as were very noble, such as were of midle ranke; and such as were of the meanest condition; and these, she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into three troupes of Monasteries; but yet so, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing separated in their worke, and in their food, yet in their Psalmes and prayers they were ioyned. As soone as the <hi>Alleluia</hi> was sung, which was the signe whereby they were called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was lawfull for none to forbeare coming. But <hi>Paula</hi> being either the very first, or at least one of the first, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the arriuall of the rest; prouoking them so by her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be diligent; and working vpon them, rather by the way of shame, then terrour. In the morning early, at the third houre, at the sixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the nynth, and at midnight, they sung the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in order. Neither was it lawful for any of the Sisters, to be ignorant of the Psalmes, and not to learne somewhat daily of the holy Scriptures. vpon the Sundaies only, they went forth to Church, at the side whereof they dwelt. And euery troupe followed their peculiar Mother, and from thence returning together, they attended to the worke which was appoynted, and made cloathes either for themselues, or others. Such a one as were of the nobler fort, was not permitted to haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of her owne family, least being mindefull of former thinges they might refresh the auntient errours of their idle youthe, and renew them by often speech.</p>
               <p>They went all in one habit or attire. They vsed no linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all, but onely for the wiping of their hands. They were so perfectly seperated from men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that she seuered them euen from Eunuches also, least otherwise occasion might haue bene giuen to ill tongued men, who are apt to carpe at Saints, for their owne greater priuiledge to sinne.

I confesse that in this poynt, she was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too peremptory; for she would not spare her selfe, nor hearken to any admonition. I will tell you what I know by experience. In <hi>Iuly,</hi> when the heates were at the highest, she fell into a burning feauer, and when by the mercy of God she was recouering, after she had bene despaired of; and the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were perswading her, that for the getting of some stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, she would vse a little wine, which was very small, least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to drinke water, she might grow hydropicke; &amp; when I had priuately desired the blessed Pope <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to aduise, or rather to compell her to drinke wine, she as she was discret, &amp; of a quicke piercing wit, did presently find that she was as it were betrayed; and smiling, declared that that was my doing, which was his saying. To be short, when the blessed Bishop, after hauing vsed much perswasion, was gone forth, &amp; I was asking her, what he had done, she answered, <hi>I haue gone so farre as that almost I haue perswaded the old man, that I might drinke no wine.</hi> I haue related this particular, not that I allow of those burdens which are vndertaken inconsideratly, &amp; aboue ones strength; for the scripture fayth, <hi>Take not a burdem vpon thee;</hi> but only to the end that I may proue euen hereby, the ardour of her mind, and the desires of her faithfull soule. And she said, <hi>My soule thirst towards thee; and how plentifully doth my flesh also thirst</hi> A hard thing it is, to keep the meane in all things. And indeed, according to that sentence of the Philosopher, <hi>vertue is in the meane,</hi> and excesse is reputed vitious; which we expresse by one short little sentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>She, who was so peremptory, and strict in the contempt of food; was tender in the occasions of her greif; and was euen defeated by the death of her friends, and especially of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren For in the death both of her husband, &amp; of her daugters, she was euer in danger of her owne life. And though she would <hi>Signe</hi> both her mouth, and her brest, and procure to mollify a mothers grief by the impression of the Crosse, yet she was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by her affection; and those bowels of a mother did euen astonish her tender hart: and though she were a conquerour in

It what age shall we be when we are to rise from the dead? If in the age when we dye some of vs will need nurses after the resurrection: If otherwise, it will not be a resurrection of the dead, but a transformation of them, into others. Besides, there will either be a diuersity of the Sexes of man and woman, or there will be none. If there be, it will follow that there will be marriage, and carnall knowledge, yea and generation. If there be not, then, taking away the difference of Sex, they will not be the same bodies, which rise againe: for an earthly habitation doth aggrauate and oppresse the vnderstanding, which hath many thinges to thinke of; but they shall be spirituall, and subtill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apostle, The body is sowed carnall, and it shall rise spiritual.</hi> By all which he desired to proue that reasonable soules, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vices &amp; auntient sinnes, were slipped downe into bodies, and according to the diuersity, and demerit of the same sinnes were to be subiect to such, or such a condition; so that either he should enioy health of body, or riches, and nobility of parents, or els should fall into sicke flesh; or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When he had said the same; I asked him, whether in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8131:51"/>
the selfe same sexe, or in another? Vpon which question hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his peace (and tossing his head too &amp; fro, like some snake least he should be hurt) because said I, you hold your peace, I will answere my selfe for you, and inferre the consequences. If a woman shall not rise as a woman, nor a man as a man, there will be no resurrection of the dead. For the sex implyes distinct parts, and the parts make vp a whole body; but if there be no sex, and parts; what will become of the resurrection of bodies, which consist not without parts, and sex? And then, if there be no resurrection of bodies, there can be no resurrection of the dead. But as for that also, which you obiect towching marriage, <hi>If they shall be the same parts, it must follow that there will be marriage,</hi> it is answered by our Sauiour saying, <hi>You erre, not knowing the Scripture, not the vertue of God. For in the Resurrection of the dead, they shall neither marry, nor be marryed but shall be like the Angels of God.</hi> In that he saith, they shall neither marry nor be marryed, the diuersity of sex is shewed; for no man saith of wood, or stone, that they shall neither marry, nor be marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which are not capable of marriage; but of them who may marry, &amp; yet for beare to do it by the power &amp; grace of Christ. If you reply and aske, <hi>How then shall we be like to Angells, since among the Angells there is no difference of male and female?</hi> I will answere you in few words. Our Lord doth not repromise to vs the substance, but the conuersation and felicity of Angells. As <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> euen before he was beheaded, was called an <hi>Angell;</hi> and all the Saints and Virgins of God, do expresse in themselues, the life of Angells, euen in this world. For when it is sayd: <hi>You shall be like to Angels,</hi> a resemblance is promised, but the nature is not changed.

                  <hi>That Peter saw our Lord, standing vpon the shoare, and eating part of a broyled fish and a hony combe?</hi> Certainly, he who stood, had feet; he who shewed a wounded side, had doubtles a belly, &amp; brest, without which he could not haue sides, which must be contiguous to them both.

makes a vocall sound. He whose handes were felt, must by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had been dead foure dayes, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to haue fed with him at the same table, least his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be thought to be but a conceit. But if because he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in while the dores were shut, you would therefore striue to proue, that his body was but aeriall and spirituall; by the same reason it must also haue beene but spiritual, before he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, because he walked then vpon the Sea, which is contrary to the nature of waighty bodyes. And the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> who also walked vpon the waters with a wauering pace, must be belieued to haue had but a spirituall body, whereas the strength &amp; power of God, is shewed more, when any thing is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature. And to the end that you may know, that by the greatnes of wonders, not the change of nature, but the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of God is shewed; he who walked by fayth, began by in fidelity to sinke downe, vnles the hand of our Lord had kept him vp, when he sayd: <hi>VVhy dost thou doubt, O thou of little fayth?</hi> But I marueile that you will haue so obstinate a mind when our Lord himselfe did say: <hi>Bring in thy finger hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and touch my handes; and reach forth thy hand, and put it into my side, and be not incredulous, but belieue.</hi> And els where: <hi>See my handes and my feet, for it is I.

And from that time <hi>Paula</hi> did so beginne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the man, and all them, who were of his doctrine, that she proclamed them with a loud voice, to be the enemyes of our Lord Now these thinges I haue mentioned, not that I would briefly confute the heresy, which is to be answered in many volumes, but to the end I might shew the faith of so great a woman, as she was, who chose rather to vndergo the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall emnities of men, then to prouoke the wrath of God, by entertayning such friendships as were faulty.</p>
               <p>I will therefore say as I began, there was nothing more docile then her wit. She was slow to speake, &amp; swift to heare, as being mindefull of this precept, <hi>Hearken, O Israel, and hold thy peace.</hi> She had the holy Scriptures without booke. And though she loued the historicall part thereof, and said <hi>that it was the foundation, and the ground of truth;</hi> yet she did much more affect the spirituall meaning of it and by that high sence she se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her soule. In fine she compelled me, that together with her daughter, she might read ouer both the old Testament, and the new, whilest I expounded it. Which I denying at the first for modesties sake, yet at last, in regard of her frequent desires, I was content to teach that, which I had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8131:52"/>
learnt of my selfe; that is to say I learnt it not of presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the worst Master of all others, but of the most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men of the Church. If at any time I were at a stand, &amp; did ingenuously confesse myne owne ignorance, she would neuer leaue me in peace, but by a perpetuall kind of demaund, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel me to declare, out of many various opinions which seemed the most probable to me.</p>
               <p>I will also speake of another particular which in the eye of enuious persons will seem to haue somewhat of the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She had a mind to learne the <hi>Hebrew tongue,</hi> which I had gotten in some measure with much labour and sweat, from my very youth; and euen yet I do not forsake the study, with a kind of indefatigable meditation thereof, least I should grow to be forsaken by it. And she also hath so obtayned this tongue, as that she can read the psalmes in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and pronounce the language, without any accent of the <hi>Latin tongue,</hi> which we also see euen to this day in her holy daughter <hi>Eustochium,</hi> who euer so adhered to her mother, and so liued vnder her coma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that she neuer lodged, nor fed, nor went without her, nor had one penny in her power, but did reioyce to see that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fortune which was left of her Fathers and Mothers patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to be bestowed by her Mother, vpon poore folkes; and she esteemed the duty she ought her parent, to be her greatest inheritance and riches.</p>
               <p>I must not passe ouer in silence with how great ioy she did eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exult, when she heard that her gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dchild the young <hi>Paula,</hi> who was begotten and borne of <hi>Leta,</hi> and <hi>Toxotius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yea &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with a desire, and promise from them both, of future chastity, did sing forth <hi>Allelluia</hi> with her stammering tongue, in her cradle, in the middest of other childish toyes; &amp; did breake forth the names of her grandmother, and her aunt, by halfe words. In this alone, she had still a desire concerning her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to know that her sonne, her daughter in law, &amp; her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, had renounced the world, and serued Christ our Lord: which in part she hath obtayned; for her grand-child is reserued to weare the vayle of Christ. Her daughter in law, deliuered her selfe ouer to eternall chastity; her sonne in law followes on in faith, almes, and other good workes; and endeauoureth to

Already the booke is growne big, whilest we feare to come to this last cast; as if whilest we conceale it, &amp; employ our selues vpon her praises, we were able to put off her death. Hitherto we haue sayled with a fore-wind, &amp; our sliding ship hath plowed vp the crisping waues of the Sea at ease. But now my discourse is falling vpon rockes, and I am in such dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of present ship wracke, as makes me say, <hi>Saue vs, Master, for we perish;</hi> And againe, <hi>Rise vp O Lord, why doest thou sleep.</hi> For who can with dry eyes speake of <hi>Paula</hi> dying? She fel into extreame indispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or rather she found what she sought in leauing vs, and in being more fully ioyned to our Lord. In which sicknesse, the approued dear affection of the daughter <hi>Eustochium</hi> to her mother, was more confirmed in the eyes of al She would be sitting vpon the beds side, she would hold the fanne, to moue the ayre; she would beare vp her head, apply the pillow, rubbe her feet, cherish her stomacke with her hand, compose her bed, warme water for her, bring the bason, and preuent all the maydes in those seruices; and whatsoeuer any other had done, to hold that she her selfe had lost so much of her own reward. With what kind of prayers, with what kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But O frayle and caduke nature of mortall men! for vnlesse the faith of Christ raised vp to heauen, and that the eternity of the soule were promised, our bodies would be subiect to as meane condition, as beasts, &amp; they of the basest kind. The same death seises vpon the iust, and wicked man; vpon the good and bad; the cleane and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; him who sacrifices, and him who sacrifices not: as the good man, so him who sins; as him who sweares, so him who feares to sweare an oath.

for fruitfullnes; and you haue now changed your said fruitfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for hopefull children. I speake it confidently, you shall haue more children, you who haue payd the first borne to God. These are those first borne, which were offered in the law. So was <hi>Samuel</hi> borne, and so was <hi>Sampson;</hi> and so did <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> reioyce and exult, vpon the arriuall of <hi>Mary.</hi> For he heard the words of our Lord thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering in his eares, by the mouth of the virgin, and he stroue to breake forth of his Mothers wombe, that he might haue met him. So that she who was borne by repromission, must obtaine such instruction from her parentes, as may be worthy of her birth. <hi>Samuel</hi> was brought vp in the Temple. <hi>Iohn</hi> was prepared in the desert. The former was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable by his sacred haire, and druncke neither wine, nor any other thing which could inebriate; and whilest he was yet but a little one, he had conuersation with our Lord. The later flyes from Citties, he was bound in by a girdle of haire, he was fed with locusts and wild hony; and (in type of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which he was to preach) he was apparelled with the spoile, or skine, of the <hi>Camel,</hi> that most crooked beast. So must that soule be instructed, which is to become the Temple of God. Let her learne to heare, and speake nothing, but that which belongs to the feare of God. Let her not vnderstand a fowle word, and let her be ignorant of the songes which the world is wont to sing. Let her tongue be enured to sweet Psalmes, whilest it is young.</p>
               <p>Away with the vsuall wantonnes of children, and let the girles, and waiting maides be remoued from secular conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, least what they haue learned ill, they teach worse. Let some Alphabet of letters be made for her, either of Boxe or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory; &amp; let them be called by their names. Let her play with them, that so her very playing, may be learning; and let her not only learne the order of the letters, that the memory of names may passe into the tune of some songe; but let euen that very order he inuerted, and let the last letters be mingled with them of the middest, and they of the middest with the foremost that she may not only know them by roat, but by vse. But when she beginnes with a weake shaking hand, to draw her stile vpon waxe, let either the tender ioyntes of her fingers be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8131:63"/>
ruled by the casting of some hand ouer hers, or els let the letters be grauen vpon some little table; that the lines may be drawne &amp; still shut vp in margens by the same hollowes, &amp; so they may not wander abroad. Let some reward be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to her, when she beginnes to ioyne the sillables; and let her be animated, by such kind of Presents, as are wont to take the most flattering hold, vpon that tender age, Let her also haue companious in learning, whom she may enuy, and by whose prayses she may be stung. If she be at all slowe of wit, let her not be chidden; but you must raise it with comendation of her, that she may be glad when she hath conquered, and be sorry when she is ouercome. You must chiefly take care, that she be not brought to mislike learning, and that the bitter way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her, in her infancy, may not be remembred by her, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she shall haue passed beyond those tender yeares. Those names whereby she shall accustome her selfe by little and little to knit words together, must not be casuall, but appointed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously compiled; namely of the Prophets, &amp; the Apostles; &amp; let the whole series of the Patriarkes from <hi>Adam,</hi> be brought downe, as it is deliuered in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi> That so whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest she is about this other businesse, a preparation of matter may be made for her memory, to be layd vp thereby for after tymes. Some Master must be chosen of fit yeares for her, and of good life &amp; knowledge. And I hope a learned man will not thinke much, to do that in the behalfe of a noble virgin, which <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> did for the sonne of <hi>Phillip,</hi> who tooke the office of clarckes or booke wrighters away, by teaching him first to reade. Those thinges are not to be contemned as little, without which great thinges cannot stand. The very ayre or manner of the letters, and the first teaching of Rules, doth sound after one fashion out of a learned mouth, and after another, if the man be ignorant and rude. And therefore you must prouide, that through the foolish dandlings of woemen, your daughter get not a custome of pronouncing certaine halfe wordes. Nor to play with gold, or gay cloathes, though it be but in iest; for the former of these two things hurts the tongue, &amp; the latter hurts the mind; and she may chance learne that, when she is young, which afterward she must be fayne to vnlearne.

his speech was gotten by him in his fathers armes. That is hardly scraped out, which young vnfashioned mindes haue drunke in. Who shall be able to reduce purple wooll, to the former whitenes? A new vessell long retaynes both that odour and taste, whereof it receiued the first impression. The <hi>Grecian</hi> history relates, how <hi>Alexander,</hi> that most powerfull King and conquerour of the world, had not power to want the defect of his Tutour <hi>Leonides,</hi> both in his gate, and behauiour other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, wherewith he was infected being a little one. For it is a matter of much ease, to grow like an other in any thing which is ill; and you may readily imitate their vices, to whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues you cannot ariue. Let not euen her nurse be giuen to wine, nor be wanton or tatling. Let her be carryed by some modest creature, &amp; let the man who ouerlookes her, be a graue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. When she sees her grandfather, make her skippe into his bosome, and hang about his necke; and sing <hi>Alleluia</hi> to him, whether he will or no. Let her grand mother snatch her to her selfe, and acknowledge that she smyles like her father. Let her be amiable to all, and let the whole kinred reioyce, that such a rose is sprung from thence. Let her quickly be told, what her other grand mother, and aunt she hath; and for the seruice of what Emperour, and for what Army she is brought vp, though yet she be but a green souldier. Let her desire to be with them; and let her threaten you, that she will be gone to them from you.</p>
               <p>Her very habite, and cloathing, must tell her to whom she is promised. Take heed you bore not through her eares, &amp; that you paynt not that face, which is consecrated to Christ, either with white or red, nor oppresse her necke with gold, &amp; pearle, nor load her head with gemmes; nor make her haire yellow, and bespeake not by that meanes, a part of hell-fyer for her. Let her haue an other kind of pearles, by the selling whereof afterward, she may purchace that one great Pearle, which is the most pretious of all. A certaine noble woman of the highest rancke, vpon the comaundment of <hi>Hymetius</hi> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who was vncle to the virgin <hi>Eustochium</hi> did once change the manner of her habit, and dressing; and knit vp her negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted haire after a secular fashion, desiring thereby to ouercome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8131:64"/>
both the purpose of the virgin her selfe, and the desire of her mother. But behould the very selfe same night, she sees (when she was at rest) that an angell was already come towards her, threating punishment with a terrible voice, and storming out these words, <hi>Hast thou presumed to preferre the comaundment of thy husband, before Christ?

               <p>I haue related this particular, not that I would insult vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the calamities of vnfortunat creatures, but that I may admonish you, with how great feare and caution you must preserue that which you haue promised to God. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But on the other side, it is written of woman, that she shall be saued by the bringing forth of children; if they remayne in faith, and charity, and sanctification, with chastity. But now if a sonne of perfect age, and who hath discretion to guide himselfe be put vpon the account of his parents when he doth il; how much more shall it be so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the case of sucking and weake children; who, according to the iudgment of our Lord, <hi>know not their right hand from the left;</hi> that is to say, the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between good &amp; ill. If you will prouide with extraordinary care that you daughter be not bitten by a viper; why will you not prouide with the like care, that she may not be stroken by that beetle, which beates vpon the whole earth; that she may not drinke of the golden cup of <hi>Babylon;</hi> that she go not forth with <hi>Dina,</hi> to se the daughter of a straung nation; that she dance not, and weare not curious cloathes? Poyson is not offered, vnles it be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spred with hony; and vice deceiues not, but vnder the shadow and shew of vertue. But how, will you say; The sinnes of

And here I speake not only of flesh, vpon which the vessell of election pronounces this sentence; <hi>It is good for a man not to drinke wine, nor to eate flesh;</hi> but also euen in <hi>Pulse,</hi> to auoyd all those things, which are windy, and heauy; and know you that nothing is so good for Christians, as the feeding vpon kitchin herbes.

good &amp; fayre state of body which (euen besides the priuiledge of Gods grace) appeared in them, by theyr feeding vpon such meates, is not esteemed; but the strength of the soule is sought by vs; which is so much the stronger, by how much the flesh is weaker. From hence it is, that many who desire to lead a chast life, fall groueling downe in the midest of their iourney, whilest they attend only to abstayne from flesh; and load the stomacke with pulse, which being taken moderately and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, is not hurtfull. But if I shall say what I thinke, there is nothing which doth so much inflame a body, and prouoke the partes of generation, as meate when it is not wel digested, but makes a kind of conuulsion in the body through windynes.</p>
               <p>I had rather O daughter, speake a little too plainly, then that the matter we speake of, should be in danger. You must thinke all that to be poyson, which makes a seminary of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

Rate your self to a certaine number of verses of holy Scripture, and performe this taske to our Lord; and allow not your body to take rest, till you shall haue filled the basket of your breast with that kind of worke.

Being inflamed by lust, she forgets the children of her owne wombe; and, in the middest of her little ones, who are not capable yet to vnderstand their misery, she, who heereafter will lament it, is now tricking her selfe vp, like a new bride. Why doe you pretend the care of your patrimony? Why the vnruly pride of your seruants? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your filthines. No woman marryes a husband, to the end that she may not lye with a man. Or yet if it be true, that you are not vrged by lust, what kind of madnes is it, that you should prostitute your chastity, after the manner of harlots, to the end of augmenting your estate; and that for the obtayning of a base and transitory end, your chastity which is precious, and eternall, should be defiled.</p>

               <p>It deserues no comendation to haue liued at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but to haue liued there wel. <hi>That Citty is to be desired, that to be praised, not which kils the Prophets, and which hath spilt the blood of Christ; but which the impetuousnes of the riuer doth make glad; which placed vpon the hill, cannot be concealed;</hi> which the Apostle cals <hi>the mother of Saints; of which Citty he reioyces, that he is made a free-denison.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet by saying this, do I taxe my selfe of inconstancy, or condemne that, which I do; that so I should in vayne seem to haue left my friends, and country, after the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> but I dare not circumscribe the omnipotency of God to so narrow as compasse; and to confine him to a small place of the earth, whom heauen is not able to contayne. The faithfull are not waighed by the diuersity of places, but by the merit of their faith. And they who are true adorers, adore not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or in <hi>Mount Gasarim:</hi> for God is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they <hi>must do it in spirit, and truth. The spirit breaths where it will. The earth &amp; the fulnes therof, is our Lords.</hi> Since the whole world was bathed with that celestial dew, the fleece of <hi>Iury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry, <hi>and many coming from the East and VVest, haue reposed in the bosome of Abraham, God hath giuen ouer to be only knowne in Iury, and to haue his name great in Israell; but the sound of the Apostles, is now gone ouer the whole earth, and their wordes euen to the ends of the world.</hi> Our Sauiour speaking to his Disciples when he was in the Temple, sayd thus; <hi>Ryse vp, let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs goe hence.</hi> And to the Iews; <hi>Tour house shall be left desert to you.</hi> If heauen &amp; earth shall passe, certainly all thinges which are earthly, shall passe: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the places of the Crosse, and Resurrection, shall profit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who carry their Crosse; who ryse daily with Christ, and who make themselues worthy of such an excellent habitation.

Blessed <hi>Hilarion,</hi> who was of <hi>Palestine,</hi> and liued there, did neuer spend but one day in the seeing of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to the end, that being so neere hand, he might neither seeme to contemne those holy places, nor yet on the other side, might seeme to shut vp our Lord in any one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. From the tymes of <hi>Adrian,</hi> to the empire of <hi>Constantine</hi> (which imported about the tyme of a hundred and foure score yeares) in the place of the Resurrection, there was an Idoll of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> In the rocke of the Crosse, there was placed a marble statue of <hi>Venus</hi> to be worshipped. The persecutours who were authours therof, conceiuing that they might abolish our Fayth of the Resurrection, and of the Crosse, when they had pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the holy places by their Idols. That wood which is called <hi>Thamus,</hi> that is to say, of <hi>Adonis,</hi> did ouershaddow the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall place of the whole world, namely this <hi>Bethleem</hi> of ours, whereof the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayth: <hi>Truth is sprung out of the earth,</hi> and in that hollow place where Christ being an Infant did once cry, the paramour of <hi>Venus</hi> was lamented. But you will aske me to what end I am so large in this particular? To the end that you may not thinke, that any thing is wanting to your fayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you haue not beene at <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and that you may not esteeme vs to be the better men, because we enioy this habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But whether you liue here or there, you shall obtaine of our Lord, a reward which shall be equall to your workes.</p>
               <p>But yet that I may plainely confesse what the pulse of my hart is in this businesse, considering both your purpose, &amp; that ardour of mind wherewith you haue disclaimed the world, I do really belieue, that you will then find difference in places, if forsaking Cittyes &amp; the concourse of people which is found therein, you will dwell in some little retyred corner, &amp; feeke Christ in the desert, and pray alone in the mountaine with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8131:77"/>
Iesus, &amp; enioy the neighbour-hood of these holy places. That is to say, that both you may estrange your selfe from the Citty, and not loose the purpose of being a Monke. I speake not this for Bishops, or Priests, who haue other imployments; but I speake of it for a Monke, and such a one as formerly was noble in the world, who layd the price of his possessions at the feet of the Apostles; thereby teaching, that money was to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be troden vnder foot, that so liuing in humility and secrecy, he might continue to despise that, which he had once despised. If the places of the Crosse, and of the Resurrection were not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly frequented in this Citty, where there is a Court, where there is a guarde of souldiers, where there are lasciuious people iesters, mimickes, and all other things which were wont to be in other Citties; or if it were only frequented by troopes of Monkes; all Monkes indeed might well desire such an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this. But now it is extreme folly, for a man to renounce the world, to forgoe his country, to forsake his Cittyes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Monasticall life; and then to liue in greater concourse of men abroad, then he was to haue liued in his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Men flocke hither from all the partes of the world; the Citty is full of all kind of people, and there is such a crowding here of folkes of both sexes, that here you are to endure that whole incouenience, whereof you auoyded but a part, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from any other place.</p>
               <p>Since therefore you doe so confidently aske me by what way you are to goe. I will vnmaske my selfe, and tell you clearely what I thinke. If you will exercise the office of a Priest, if you be delighted in the imployment of Episcopal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, liue in Citties and Townes; and procure that the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others soules may be profitable to yours. But if you desire to be that which now you are called, that is to say, a Monke, which signifyes to be a solitary person; what make you in Citties, which are not the habitations of seuerall single persons, but of many who liue togeather? Euery profession hath his chiefes. Let Captaines of Roman armyes, imitate the <hi>Camillo's,</hi> the <hi>Fabricio's,</hi> the <hi>Regulo's,</hi> and the <hi>Scipio's.</hi> Let Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers propound to themselues <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.</hi> Let Poets imitate <hi>Homer, Virgil, Menander,</hi> and <hi>Terence.</hi>

I beseech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because that holy Sister of yours hath a kind of tye vpon you, and for that you passe not on as yet, with a pace which is wholly free, yet whether you be here or there, fly from complements, and visits, and feasts, as from certaine chaines which will tye you to pleasure. Let your food be meane, as herbes, and pulse; and take it not till night; and little fishes sometimes, which you must hold for a great delicacy. He who desires Christ, and feeds vpon that bread, must not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly care of how pretious meates his excrement be made: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer delicate thing you eat is all one with bread and pulse, when once it is passed downe below the throat.

You must often pray with your knees bent, &amp; your mind must be raised vp to our Lord. You must watch often, and often sleepe with an empty stomacke. These carryers o tales and these prety little vanities, and smoothing flatterers, you must fly like so many enemyes. Dispence your almes with your owne hand, for the ease of the charge of poore and vertuous people. Honesty is growne rare amongst men. Doe you not belieue what I say? Thinke of <hi>Iudas</hi> his purse.</p>

Take heed that you, who haue formerly bene a faithfull &amp; excellent dispencer of your owne goods, take not vpon you to distribute the money of other folkes. You conceaue well what I say: for our Lord hath giuen you a very vniuersall vnderstanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Carry the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a doue, that you procure not to deceiue any man; and the subtility of a serpent, that you be not supplanted by the sleights of others. It is not much lesse vitious for a Christian, to be deceiued then to deceaue. Whom you shal find to be euer, or often speaking of money (except it be in the way of almes, which must be open to all) hold him rather to be, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt, then a Monke.

Hearken therefore my fellow seruant, my freiend, my brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obserue a little, by what path you are to walke, in the holy Scripture. All that which we read in those diuine bookes, doth shine indeed, and that brightly, euen in the barke, but it is much sweeter in the substance and depth thereof. He who wil eat the kernell, must breake the nut: <hi>Reueal myne eyes</hi> (saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>) <hi>and I will consider the wonderfull thinges of thy law.</hi> If so great a Prophet confesse so great darkenes of ignorance; with what a night of stupidity may we conceiue our selues to be enuironed, who are but little ones, and as it were but sucking babes? But this veyle was not onely put vpon the face of <hi>Moyses,</hi> but vpon that also of the Euangelists and Apostles. Our Sauiour spake to the people in parables; &amp; auowing that that which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered had somewhat in it of the <hi>Mysticall,</hi> he said, <hi>He who hath eares to heare, let him heare.</hi> Vnles all things which are written of him be opened by him, who hath the keye of Dauid, <hi>which shuts and no man opens, and which opens and no man shuts,</hi> they will neuer be disclosed by any other. If you had this ground, and if your worke were perfected by this last hand, we should haue nothing more gracefull, nothing more learned, nothing more delightfull, nothing more Latin then your bookes. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is frequent in sentences, but of no very delightfull speech. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Cyprian</hi> walkes on, all sweet and smooth, like a most pure fountayne, but (employing himselfe wholy vpon the exercise of vertue, and taken vp by the troubles of persecution) he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed not at all of holy Scriptures. <hi>Victorinus,</hi> who was after crowned with an illustrious marytrdome, is not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse what he vnderstands. <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who was a very flood of <hi>Ciceronian</hi> eloquence, I would to God he could as well haue confirmed our doctrine, as he did easily confute that of others. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

my companion, and my friend, (I say my friend, though you be not yet of my acquaintance) and I will pray you, not to suspect my friendship of flattery, but rather conceiue, that I am in errour, or that I slip through the loue I beare you; then that I would deceiue a friend, by speaking hlm fayre. You haue a great wit, and an vnspeakeable store and copie of speech; and you expresse your selfe purely, and with ease, and the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and purity is seasoned with prudence; for the head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sound, all the sences are in vigour. If labour and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Scripture were added to this prudence, &amp; elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, we should see you in a short time to hold the very highest place amongst our men; and (ascending vp to the house of <hi>Sion,</hi> with <hi>Iacob</hi>) to sing vpon the house tops, that which you had learned and knowne in the priuate roomes of the house. Gird your selfe vp, I beseech you, gird yourselfe vp. Nothing of this world is giuen to mortall men, but vpon the price of great labour. Let the Church haue you noble, as the Senate had you in former time; and now prepare riches for your selfe, which you may daily bestowe, and yet will neuer fayle, as long as the world lasts. Doe it whilest yet your head is not sprinkled with grey haires; before you be ouergrowne with diseases, and melancholy, and old age, and payne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sad death carryes vs vnmercifully away.

Vpon what ground he went hence, and left vs so soon, I must not say, least I may seem to offend some. I haue entertayned him a while as he was passing by in hast; and I haue giuen him a taste of our friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end that you may learne by him, that which you desire to know of me. I entreat that by your meanes, I may salute your fellow seruant, who labours with you in our Lord.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene often doubted among many, by what Monke the Desart was first inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Some haue reached at it so high, as to ascribe the first beginning to B. <hi>Elias,</hi> &amp; then to <hi>Iohn.</hi> But <hi>Elias</hi> seemes to vs, to haue rather beene a Prophet, then a Monke; and <hi>Iohn</hi> to haue begun to be a kind of a Prophet, before he was borne. But some others
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8131:82"/>
affirme (and they haue brought the whole vulgar to be of their opinion) that <hi>Anthony</hi> was the first in vndertaking this kind of life, which yet is but partly true. For it is not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be sayd, that he was the first of all the Eremites, as that he gaue spirit to the endeauours, and designes of them all. But <hi>Amathas</hi> and <hi>Macharius,</hi> who were the disciples of this <hi>Anthony</hi> (and whereof the former buryed the body of his Maister) affirme euen to this day, that a certaine <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> was the chiefe, and prime man of this Institute, which opinion we also approue, though not so much, because he carries the name of it, as vpon other reasons. Many there are who spread abroad both these, and other thinges at their pleasure, as namely that there was a certaine man all hairy to his very feet, who hid himselfe in a hoale vnder ground, and they deuise many incredible thinges, not worth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating; and since their affirmation is so voyd of shame, their opinion seemes not worthy of confutation. But now for as much as a diligent account hath beene giuen vs of this <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> both in the Greeke and Latin tongue, I haue disposed my selfe to write some few thinges of the beginning, &amp; end of <hi>Paul;</hi> rather because it hath beene omitted by others, then that I presume vpon my selfe. For as for the manner of his life, in the middle part of his age, and what subtil sly tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sathan he sustayned, there is no mortall man, who can tell vs any newes thereof.</p>
               <p>Vnder <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Valerian us</hi> the persecutors, at such time as <hi>Cornelius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyprian</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> were conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned to the felicity of shedding their blood, many Churches in <hi>Aegipt</hi> &amp; <hi>Thebais,</hi> were blasted by a bitter storme of persecution. The Christians of that time, desired no better then to giue their liues for the name of Christ, by the compendious stroke of the sword; but the crafty aduersary going in search after slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer punishments, for the deliuery of men ouer to death, did more desire to cut the throates of soules, then of bodies; and (as was said by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who himselfe suffered Martirdome) he would not permit them to be killed, who were euen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to dye. And now to the end that his cruelty may be the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8131:82"/>
more notorious, we haue heere committed two examples to memory.</p>
               <p>When a certaine Martyr was perseuering in his faith, and continued to be conquerors in the middest both of rackes, &amp; burning plates, the persecutor commanded that he should be anoynted all ouer with hony and so (with his handes bound behind him) be extended vnder a scorching Sunne with his face vpward; to the end that he might yeild him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, vpon the sting of flyes, who before, had bene victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ouer the torments of fyer. He commanded another Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, who was flourishing in the very prime of his youth to be led aside into a most delicious garden &amp; there in the middest of pure lyllies, and blushing roses, (where also a streame of water was creeping on with a soft bubling noise, and the wind gently whisling checkt the leaues of the trees) to be spred with his face vpward vpon a bed stuffed with downe, and to be left tyed there with silken bandes, to the end that so he might not be able to deliuer himselfe from thence. Now vpon the retiring of all them who were present, a beautifull Curtisan came to make her approach, and began with her delicate armes, to embrace his necke; and (which cannot be modestly related) did also impurely touch him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, to the end that his body being altered, and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by lust the lasciuious conquerors might ouerspred him. This souldier of the band of Christ, knew not what to do, nor which way to turne himselfe, whome torments had not subdued, delight was beginning to ouercome, when at length (inspired from heauen) he bit of his owne tongue, &amp; spitting it into the face of her, who kissed him, the sense of lust, was subdued, by the sharpenes of that payne which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>At that time therefore, when such thinges as these were acted, in the inferiour <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ebau,</hi> (when the Sister of <hi>Paul</hi> was then already bestowed by him in marriage, (himselfe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a rich inheritance descended to him by the death of both his Parents; whilest then he was of the age of about fifteene years) and hauing beene eminently instructed in the literature both of the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> &amp; indued with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8131:83"/>
a meeke spirit, &amp; which greatly loued God, and finding that the storme of persecutions brought such thunder with it), he tooke a resolution of retiring into a remote, and priuate villa of his owne.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>But, O thou vast desire of gould;</l>
                  <l>How hugely doest thou make men bould?</l>
               </lg>
               <p>His Sisters husband grew to betray him, whome he ought to haue concealed; nor could the teares of the wife nor the respects of common blood, nor the consideration of God behoulding all thinges from on high, disswade him from that wickednes. But cruelty vrged him to do those thinges, though the pretext which it tooke was from piety. Now as soone as this most discreet young man grew to vnderstand thus much, he fled towardes the desart Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, where he might expect the end of this persecution, and so voluntarily he made a vertue of necessity. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on by little and little, and then pawsing, and often doing the same thing; at last he met with a great rocky hill, neer the bottome whereof there was a large kind of caue shut vp by a stone. Vpon the remouing of which stone he being more earnest in making new discoueries (according to the nature of man which loues the knowledge of hidden thinges) he perceaued a great entry there within, which being open to the sky aboue, was ouerspred by the wide braunches of an ould Palme tree, poynting out a most cleare fountayne, the streame where of breaking onely out of the ground, the same earth which had brougbt it forth did instantly sucke it vp againe, through a little hole. There were moreouer, throughout that worne mountayne not a few old roomes, wherein there might be seene certaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiles, &amp; hammers, which by that tyme were growen rough with rust, and formerly had beene imployed vpon stamping coyne. And it is related by the Aegyptians, that this place had beene vsed as a secret mint-house of money, at such tyme as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> kept that close intelligence with <hi>Antonius.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> growing now to carry a particular kind of loue to this Caue, as if it had beene expressely designed to him by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, did there imploy his whole life in solitude &amp;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8131:83"/>
prayer. The Palme-tree serued his turne, both to affoard him food, and cloathes. Which, that no man may thinke impossible, I take Iesus, and his holy Angels to witnes, how, in that part of the desart, which ioynes <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Sarazens</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, I haue seene certaine Monkes, whereof one being a recluse, had liued during thirty yeares, vpon barly bread, and puddle water; and another who continuing in an old Cesterne, which the <hi>Syrians</hi> in their language call <hi>Caba,</hi> was sustayned by the only eating of fiue dryed Figs euery day. These thinges will seeme incredible to them who are of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieuing minds, for to others, all thinges are possible.</p>
               <p>But to returne to that from which I had digressed, when now the B. <hi>Paul</hi> had lead a celestiall life on earth, being by that tyme, a hundred and thirteen yeares ould, and when <hi>Anthony</hi> hauing ninety yeares of age, had remayned alone in another Desart, as himselfe was wont to relate; a thought slipt once into the sayd <hi>Anthonyes</hi> mind, as if no perfect Monke remayned in that wildernes, besides himselfe. But whilest he was at rest by night, it was reuealed to him, that there was another much more excellent then he, whome he was appointed to find out, and visit. Therefore instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon breake of day, the venerable ould ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vphoulding his weake limmes by the support of a staffe disposed himself to be going, though he knew not directly whether. But shortly then the high noone began to inflame the world vn der a scorching Sunne, and yet he was not discouraged from his new iourney, but sayd: <hi>I confide that my God will shew me that seruant of his, whome he hath promised.</hi> Not a word more then this, when behould he sees a creature made of horse &amp; man, such as Poets are wont to call <hi>Hippocentaures.</hi> Vpon which fight, he armes his forehead with the impression of that salutiferous signe, and sayth: <hi>Tell me, O thou, where dwells that seruant of God?</hi> But he gnashing out I know not what kind of barbarous sound, and rather breaking then pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his wordes, did yet by meanes of that horrid speach, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to entertaine some pleasing discourse, with the old man; and by extending his right hand, made discouery of the way which was sought, and so striking through those open
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8131:84"/>
plaines, with a swift flight, he vanished out of the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring eyes of the behoulder. Now whether the Diuell did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue these thinges to fright the man, or els whether the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, which is wont to be fruitful of monstruous creaturs, did also bring forth this beast, or no, is vncertaine to vs. But <hi>Anthony</hi> the while, being all amazed, and reuoluing within himselfe what he had seene, proceeded on. And behould he perceaues in a certaine stony descent, which lay betweene two hilles, a kind of little man, with a crooked nose, and a rugged brow with hornes, the lower parte of whose body was made vp into the feet of a Goat. And <hi>Anthony</hi> being also stroken by this spectacle, tooke instantly to himselfe the buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kler of fayth, and the brest-plate of hope, like a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryer, but yet the aforesayd <hi>Animal,</hi> brought him the fruit of Palmes, for his prouision, as pledges of peace. Vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of this, <hi>Anthony</hi> made a pause, and demanding of the other who he was, receaued this answere: <hi>A mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I am, and one of the inhabitants of the desart, whome the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, being deluded with variety of errour are wont to worship, by the name of</hi> Fawnes, Satyres, <hi>and</hi> Incubo's, <hi>I performe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Embassadour for the rest of the flocke whereof I am. And our suit is, that thou wilt pray for vs to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon God, whome we know to be come for the saluation of the world, &amp; the sound of him is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ouer all the earth.</hi> Whilest he was deliuering these words, our aged trauayler did abundantly bedew his face with tears which the greatnes of his ioy sent forth, as the interpretors of his hart; for he reioyced in the glory of Christ, and the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of Sathan. And wondring withall, that he was able to vnderstand the others speach, and stricking vpon the ground with his staffe, he sayd: <hi>VVe be to thee, O Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, who worshipest Monsters insteed of God. VVoe be to thee, O thou adulterous Citty, to which the Diuells of the whole world resort. VVhat remaines for thee now to say? Beasts publish Christ, and thou worshipest Monsters, insteed of God.</hi> Nor had he yet ended speaking, when behould the clouen footed creature flead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as if it had beene borne by winges. That this may not moue sctuple, through the mind, which men haue, not to belieue; it was made good vnder King <hi>Constantine,</hi> by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8131:84"/>
testimony of all the world, that such a kind of man as this being brought aliue to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> became a spectacle to the whole people, and when the body was once without life, it was salted for feare of corrupting through the heat of the season, and brought to <hi>Antioch,</hi> that the Emperour might also see it.</p>
               <p>But, to proceed in my purpose. <hi>Anthony</hi> went on in his way, as he had begun, discerning no other thing, then the footsteps of Bufaloes, &amp; wiid beastes, and the vnlimited vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a <hi>desart.</hi> He knew not what to do, nor which way to direct his course. Already the second day was spent, and there remayned now but one, wherein he hoped that he should not be forsaken by Christ. He spent that whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond night in prayer, and while yet it was no more then twylight, he discerned a she Wolfe farre off, who panting through the heat of thirst, crept neer to the foot of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. He followed her with his eyes, and drawing neer (when the beast was gone) to a certaine caue thereby, he was beginning to looke in; his curiosity not seruing his turne, because the darkenes droue backe his sight. But as the scripture saith, <hi>Perfect loue dispatches feare away;</hi> and so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating his pace, and houlding his breath, the cuning spy went in; and sometimes going on, and then often staying againe, he sucked vp euery little noise into his eare. At last, through the horrour of that deepe darkenes, he discerned light farre off, and going on with a kind of greedy hast, his foot gaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a stone, and made a noyse. Vpon the sound whereof, the blessed <hi>Paul</hi> shut, and locked the doore, which had bene open before. But <hi>Anthony</hi> then cast himselfe outright before the gates, and was begging entrance, till it had growen to be the sixth houre of the day &amp; more, saying: <hi>You know who I am; from whence, and for what cause I come, I confesse that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue not to appeare in your presence; but yet vnles I see you, I will not retire. You who receaue beastes, how can you reiect a man? I haue sought now, and I haue found now; and now I knocke, that it may be opened to me. If I obtaine not thus much, I will dye heer at your gates; at least you will not refuse to bury me, when I shall be dead.</hi>

                  <hi>No man doth so desire, as that he wil threaten withall. No man accompanies his teares with iniury or reproach. And can you mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle if I receaue you not, when your errand is but to dye at the gate.</hi> Then did <hi>Paul</hi> smile, and open the doore; which was no sooner done, but they did euen incorporate themselues by mutuall embracements, and saluting one another by their proper names, did ioyne in giuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to our Lord. Now <hi>Paul</hi> sitting downe with <hi>Anthony,</hi> after he had giuen him a holy kisse, began thus to speake; <hi>Behould how he, whom you haue sought with so great labour, is all couered with rude gray haires, and hath his body euen rotten already with ould age.

                  </hi> As they were in speech of these thinges, they looked vp, and saw a Crow sitting vpon the braunch of a tree, who flying gently downe layed a whole loaf of bread before their wondring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Paul</hi> vrged <hi>Anthony</hi> to do it, vpon the right of hospitality which <hi>Paul</hi> was to pay; but <hi>Antony</hi> excused himself, vpon the respects which he ought to the antiquity of the other. At length this resolution was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that both of them should take hould of the bread, which each of them, pulling by contrary wayes towards himselfe, might find his part in his owne handes.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8131:85"/>
that night in watching. And as soone as the world saw day agayne, the B. <hi>Paul</hi> spake to <hi>Anthony</hi> after this manner. <hi>It is long O brother, since I knew you were an Inhabitant of these parts, it is long since God made me a promise, that I should haue you as a fellow seruant of myne. But now because the time of my long repose is at hand, and for (that according to my desire of being dissolued &amp; being with Christ,) there remaynes a crowne of Iustice for me, vpon the finishing of my course; you are sent by our Lord, to couer this poore body with earth, or rather to restore one earth to another.</hi> Vpon the hearing of these wordes, <hi>Anthony</hi> (all in teares and sighes,) besought him not to forsake him so, but to accept him for a companion in that Iourney. But then <hi>Paul</hi> replyed thus: <hi>You must not desire thinges for your selfe, but condescend to the conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of others. It were good indeed for you, if laying downe the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of flesh and blood, you might follow the lambe; but it is also expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the rest of your brethren, that they may be more instructed by your example. I beseeeh you therefore returne, (vnles my suit be of too much trouble to you) and bring that Cloake for the wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of this poore body, which Athanasius the Bishop bestowed vpon you.</hi> This request was made by the blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> not because he greatly cared, whether his corps were to putrify naked, or coured (he who had liued so many yeares, without any other garment then of the woeuen leaues of palmes,) but to the end that the grief for his death, might be asswaged in the mind of <hi>Anthony,</hi> by his departing away. But <hi>Anthony</hi> being amazed at that which had bene sayd to him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> &amp; his cloak, as if he had seen Christ in <hi>Paul,</hi> did worship God in his person, and presumed not to make him any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, but shedding teares in silence, &amp; kissing both his hands and eyes, he returned to his Monastery, which was afterward take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <hi>Saracens.</hi> Neither did his feet suffer his hart to out strippe them; for though his body, being extenuated by fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, were then also defeated by his many yeares, yet with his mind he ouercame his age. At length, all weary &amp; pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he ended his iorney, and got home. And when two of his disciples, who had beene wont to serue him a long time before, came running towards him with these words, <hi>Where, O Father, haue you been, and stayed so long?</hi> He answered: <hi>Woe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>to me sinfull man, who carry but the false name of a Monke, I haue seen Elias, I haue seen a Iohn in the desart, and I haue truly seen Paul in a paradise.</hi> And so holding his peace, and beating his breast with his hand, he fetch the cloake out of his little <hi>Cell.</hi> And his disciples beseeching him that he would declare more fully what the matter was, he answered thus: <hi>There is a tyme for silence, and a tyme for speech.</hi> Then going forth, and taking not so much as a bit of food, he returned by the same way he came, thirsting after him, desiring to behould him, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating him, both with eyes, and hart. For he was full of feare least (as indeed it came to passe) the other should in his absence, render vp that spirit of his, which was due to Christ. And when the next day was come, &amp; he had iornyed some three houres, he saw <hi>Paul,</hi> brightly shyning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in pure whitenes, &amp; ascending vp on high, in the middest of troupes of <hi>Angels,</hi> and of the quiers of <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi> Then <hi>Anthony</hi> casting himselfe headlong downe vpon his face, drew his hood ouer his head, and weeping, yea and euen roaring out, he sayd: <hi>VVhy, O Paul, dost thou forsake me? VVhy art thou gone without letting me so much as take my leaue? Thou, whome I came to know so late, why art thou departed so soon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> it was afterward related by <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he dispatched that rest of the way, with so great speed, as that he flew like a very bird. And he had reason to make hast, for being entered into the caue, he saw the body without life, his knees doubled vnder him, his necke erected, and his hands extended abroad on high. And conceauing at the first that he had been yet aliue, he ioyned with him in prayer; but afterwards, when he heard him not send forth any such sighes, as he was wont to vse in prayer, he rushed vpon him, with a dolefull kisse; and then grew to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that euen the dead corps of the Saint, did pray after a sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to God (to whome all things liue) by that posture of reuerence. <hi>Anthony</hi> therefore hauing shrouded the body, &amp; brought it forth; and singing hymnes and psalmes, according to the tradition of the Christian Church, was troubled that he had not there some spade, wherewith he might dig, and make a graue. And wauing between the variety of seuerall passions, and casting with his thoughtes many wayes, he sayd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8131:86"/>
thus within himselfe: <hi>If I returne to the Monastery, it is a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of no lesse then three dayes; if I stay heere, I shall loose my tyme &amp; labour; my best way would be euen to dye, and by casting my selfe headlong against this warryer of thyne, O Christ, to deliuer vp my last breath.</hi> Whilst he was reuoluing these things in his mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behould, from the more inward part of the desart, two Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bore themselues with speed towardes him, their manes al wauing about their neckes. At the first, vpon this sight, he was much frighted; yet then instantly casting vp his mind to God, he remayned as void of feare, as if he had but seene some paire of Doues. But the Lyons, hauing directed their course to the corps of that other blessed ould man, made a stand, and fawning with their tailes, they lay downe at his feet, roaring out with a huge noyse, so as a man might plainely vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that they bewayled the death of <hi>Paul</hi> after the best manner they could. Soone after, they also began to scrape the ground with their pawes, casting out sand (as if it had beene with a kind of strife who should do it fastest) they digged a place, which might be able to containe a man; and then instantly casting downe their necks, and wagging their eares, they went towardes <hi>Anthony;</hi> and as if they had demanded some wages for their paynes, they licked both his handes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and feet. But he vnderstood it, as if they had desired a blessing from him, and therefore instantly inlarging his hart towardes the prayse of Christ, for that euen these dumme Beasts, did also vnderstand that there was a God, he expressed himselfe thus, <hi>O Lord, without whose becke, neither doth any leafe fall from a Tree, nor any Sparrow light vpon the ground, be good to these creatures, as thou knowest.</hi> And so making a signe with his hand, he gaue them a commandement to be gone. As soone as they were departed, he submitted his old shoulders to the waight of that holy corps; and laying it downe in the graue, and then casting earth vpon it, he made a kind of tombe, according to the manner. But then, vpon the next day (least this pious heyre should not become the owner of some of the intestates goods) he tooke the coat, which <hi>Paul</hi> had wouen for himselfe after the manner of Baskets, of Palme leaues. And so retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his Monastery, he made relation of al to his Disciples,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8131:87"/>
in order as it had passed; and vpon the solemnities of Easter, &amp; Pentecost, he euer vsed to weare the coat of <hi>Paul.</hi>

               <p>And now vpon the end of this little worke, I will take the liberty, to aske those men, who haue such store of Lands, as that they hardly know the names therof; they who appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell their houses in marble, &amp; thread the price of whole Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

You drinke in cupps made of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stone; this man satisfyed Nature, by the vse of a paire of hollow handes. You imbroder your garments with gold, but he had not so much as the meanest cloath, which belonged to any drudge of yours. But then, Heauen on the other side will be open to that poore man; and you with your guilt, will go downe to Hell. He was still cloathed with Christ, though he were naked; you, being clad with silke, haue lost the garment of Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> lyes couered vnder poore light dust, and he shall rise vp againe into glory; wheras you are pressed downe by those weighty and costly Tombes of stone, and are to burne in hell fire with your wealth. I beseech you be good to your selues, or els at least, be good to your riches, which you loue so well. Why wrappe you vp the bodyes of your dead friendes, in goulden cloathes? Why do you not permit, that Ambition and Pride may cease at least in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of your sorrowes and teares? Are not perhaps the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kases of rich men able to rot, vnles they be layd vp in filke? I beseech you, whosoeuer you be, that read this, be mindfull of <hi>Hierome,</hi> that sinnefull man; to whome yet, if our Lord should graunt his wish, he would much rather choose the coat of <hi>Paul</hi> with his merits, then the purple of Kinges with their paynes.</p>

Whereupon we also, rather vnder his fauour, then with meaning to shew him any disrespect, will set vpon the worke, which was begun by him; resoluing to contemne the exceptions of ill tongued men, who formerly detracting from the life, which I wrote of <hi>Paul,</hi> will now perhaps doe as much, for this of <hi>Hilarion;</hi> taxing the former of excesse in solitude, and chalenging the later, for exposing himselfe ouermuch to publicke view; that so he, who say e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hid, might be thought as good, as not to haue beene at al; and this other, who was seene by so many, might be held thereby in lesse high account.

                  <hi>Hilarion</hi> was borne in a little towne called <hi>Thabatha,</hi> which is situated towardes the South, about fiue miles from <hi>Gaza,</hi> a Citty of Palestine; and he sprung (as men are wont to say) like a Rose out of thornes, for he had Idolaters to his Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. He was sent by them to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and applyed to the study of Grammar; and there (for as much as might be expected from one of his tender yeares,) he gaue great testimony in a short tyme, both of his wit, and good conuersation. He was deere to all them who knew him, and he was a Maister of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8131:88"/>
speech; and (which passes these prayses) he was a belieuer in our Lord Iesus, and did not delight in those mad sportes, which were exhibited in the <hi>Circus,</hi> nor in the luxurious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainements of the Theatre, where so great essusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of blood was made. His whole comfort was to be at Church, when Christians were assembled there. Being then growen to heare the famous name of <hi>Anthony,</hi> which was celebrated through all the parts of Aegypt, he went on towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart, through a desire he had to see him. This he no sooner did, but instantly he changed his former habit, and remayned with him, vpon the point of two Months, contemplating the order of his life, and the grauity of his conuersation, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent he was in prayer, how humble in receauing b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, how seuere in reprehending them, how cheerefull in exhorting them; and how no corporall indisposition did at any time interrupt the abstinent &amp; rigid dyet, which he kept. But then <hi>Hilarion</hi> being no longer able to endure the freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t concourse of them who resorted to <hi>Antony,</hi> by occasion either of being possessed by Diuels, or of seuerall other infirmityes; and not houlding it to be conuenient for him to endure such troupes of inhabitants of Citties, in such a wildernes as that, and conceauing that he was rather to begin as <hi>Anthony</hi> had done; and that <hi>Anthony</hi> was then enioying the fruites of his victory, like an ould souldier, but that himselfe had scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to carry armes; he returned with some Monkes into his owne countrey. And his Parents, by that tyme being dead, he distributed part of his substance to his Brothers, and part to the poore, reseruing nothing at all to himselfe, as fearing both the example, and punishment of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra</hi> in the Acts of the Apostles, and remembring this saying of our Lord; <hi>He, who renounces not all that which he possesses, can be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of myne.</hi> He was then about fifteene yeares of age, and thus being naked, but yet armed with Christ, he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Desart, which is distant seauen mile from <hi>Matoma,</hi> the staple of <hi>Gaza,</hi> which lyes vpon the Sea coast, on the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of them, who go towards Aegypt. And although those places were all stained with the bloud of many murthers, and his friendes and kindred did declare the imminent danger to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8131:89"/>
which he exposed himselfe; yet he despised one kind of death, that he might escape another. All men wondred at his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and they wondred also at his tender yeares, sauing that the flame of his hart, and certaine sparkes of fayth, did euen shine out by his eyes. His face was but thinne, his body was delicate and leane, and sensible of any iniury of weather, &amp; of the trouble of any little either heat or could. Hauing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all couered himselfe with sacke-cloath, and besides wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a shirt of haire, which the B. <hi>Anthony</hi> had giuen him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with a country Cassocke at his departure, he betooke himselfe to a vast and terrible kind of wildernes, betweene the Sea shore on the one side, &amp; certaine fenns on the other, eating only fifteene dryed Figs euery day after Sunne set. And because those parts were growen infamous by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of cruell robberies which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted there abouts, he neuer vsed to stay long in the selfe same place. What had the Diuell now to do? Which way should he turne himselfe? He who once had vaunted and sayd: I <hi>will pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Diuell did therefore then begin to moue the sence of <hi>Hilarion,</hi> and to suggest such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of lust, as be vsuale when bodies are budding first, in the spring of youth. This young souldier of Christ was euen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned to thinke vpon obiects, whereof he was ignorant; &amp; to looke with the eye of his phansy, vpon the whole story of that businesse, wherof he had neuer taken any experience. Vpon this, being angry with himselfe, and beating his breast with his fist, (as if he had beene able to destroy his thoughts, with his handes: <hi>I will take order</hi> (sayth he) <hi>thou little Asse, that thou shalt not kicke, nor will I feed thee with corne, but with straw; I will starue thee, and I will lay heauy load vpon thee, I will exercise, and tyre thee out, both by heates and coldes, that so thou mayst haue more care, how to get a bit of meat, then how to satisfy thy lust.</hi> So that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his very life would be fayling, after the fast of three or foure dayes, he would sustaine it with the iuyce of herbes, and a few dryed Figs; praying &amp; singing often, &amp; he would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8131:89"/>
also be breaking the ground with a rake; that so the labour of his working, might ad to the trouble of his fasting. And wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing small twigs together with great rushes, he imitated the discipline of the <hi>Aegiptian Moncks,</hi> &amp; remembred the sentence of the Apostle, saying: <hi>He, who doth not worke, must not eat.</hi> Being thus extenuated, and hauing his body so farre exhausted, as that it would scarce hang together, he began one night, to heare the crying of Infants, the bleating of Sheep, the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Oxen, the lamentation as if it had been of Woeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the roaring of Lyons, the clashing noyse of an Army; and such a confusion of prodigious sounds, that being frighted with the noyse of them; before he perceaued any sight, his hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to faynt. But he soone found them to be scornes &amp; plots of the Diuell; and so casting himselfe then vpon his knees, he signed his forhead with the Crosse of Christ. Being defended with such a helmet as that, and compassed in by the coat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of fayth, he fought more valiantly, as he was layd downe, then before; already then desiring to see them, whom formerly he had euen trembled to heare; and looking for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> round about, with earnest eyes. When behould, vpon the sodayne, he perceaued by the shining of the Moone, that a charriot drawen by burning horses came rushing on towards him, and as soon as he had called vpon Iesus, all that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was swallowed vp before his eyes, by a sudden ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vpon this, he sayd; <hi>He hath cast the horse and the horseman into the sea; and some trust in their chariots, and some in their horses, but we will be magnifyed in the name of the Lord our God.</hi> Many were his temptations, and many snares were set by the Diuels for him, day &amp; night; all which if I would vndertake to relate, I should exceed the measure of one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. How often would naked Woemen appeare to him, as he was resting? How often would most sumptuous dyet be set before him, when he was fasting? Sometimes the yelling wolfe, and the grinning fox, would be leaping ouer him, when he was praying; and when he was singing, some fight of <hi>Gladiators,</hi> would present it selfe; and one, as if he had bene killed, did once fall downe before his feet, desiring buriall at his hands. He was praying, with his head bowed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8131:90"/>
downe to the ground, and his mind being once distracted (according to humane fraylty) he had I know not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought; when instantly a nimble rider, got vpon his backe, beating his sides with his heeles, and his necke with his whippe, and sayd; <hi>why sleepest thou?</hi> &amp; scornfully laughing at him as he sat, did aske him, when he was faynting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would eat any prouender, or no?</p>
               <p>Now from the sixteenth years of his age, til the twentyth, he declyned the heates, and raynes, in a poore short little Houel, which he had woeuen of reeds, and boughes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he built a little poore Cell for himselfe, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to this day. It had but the breadth of foure foot, and the height of fiue; so that it was lower then he; in length it was a little longer then the extent of his body; so that you would rather haue esteemed it to be a graue, then a house. He cut his haire once euery yeare, and it was at <hi>Easter.</hi> He lay perpetually till his death, vpon the bare ground, with a matte. He neuer washed that sacke-cloath, which he had o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce put on; affirming <hi>that it was idle, to looke for neatnes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathes;</hi> nor did he euer change any coat, till it were vtterly worne out. The holy scriptures, he had without booke; and after his prayers, and the psalmes, he would recite them, as in the presence of God. And because it would be a long busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to discouer, step by step, how he rose vp towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the seuerall ages of his life, I will brieflly first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the history thereof in grosse, and so lay it before the eyes of the Reader; and then I will in order, deliuer a more particular Relation.</p>
               <p>Between the one and twentyth, &amp; the seauen &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyth yeare of his age, he daily tooke for three yeares, a little more then half a pint of pulse, steeped in cold water; and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the other three, he tooke dry bread with water, and salt. From the seauen &amp; twentyth, to the thirtyth, he was sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by wild herbes, and by the rootes of certaine plantes taken rawe. From the one &amp; thirtyth to the siue &amp; thirtyth, he tooke for his dayly food, six ounces of barly bread, and some kitchin herbes, but halfe boyled, and without oyle. But obseruing that his eyes began already to dazle, and that his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8131:90"/>
whole body grew to haue a kind of itch vpon it, and to be subiect to an vnnaturall kind of roughnes; he added oyle to his former dyet; and till the sixtyth yeare of his age he ranne on in this degree of abstinence, not once so much as tasting, either pulse, or fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>or any other thing: At last, when he found his body to be euen all ouerwrought, and conceiued that his death was very neer at hand; from the sixty fourth, till the eightyth yeare of his age, he abstayned euen from bread also with incredible feruour of mind; proceeding as if he were but then newly entring into the seruice of God; whereas others at that time, are wont to be more remisse in their manner of life. But hauing fourescore years of age there were made for him, certaine little poore broths of flower and herbs, which were broken or cut; the whole proportion both of meat, and drinke, scarce arriuing to the waight of foure ounces; &amp; thus he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t through the whole order of his life; &amp; neuer broke his fast till Sun set, though it were vpon the highest feasts, or in his greatest sicknes. But now it is time that I returne to speake particularly of thinges in order.</p>
               <p>When he was yet dwelling in his houel, hauing eighteen yeares of age, there came vpon him, certaine murthering theeues, either as thinking, that he had somewhat, which was worth the carrying away; or els, as houlding that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to be a kind of contempt of them, that a solitary youth should presume not to be affrayd of theyr force. So as, scouring that quarter, between the sea and the Fens, from the euening to Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne rising, &amp; neuer being able to meet with his lodging; but once hauing found him in broad day light, <hi>what wouldest thou do</hi> (sayd they) <hi>if now the murthering theeues should come?</hi> To whom he answered. <hi>That the naked man feares no theeues.</hi> Whereupon they sayd, <hi>yet there is no doubt but thou mayest be killed. I may</hi> (saith he) <hi>and therefore do I feare no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering theeues, because I am ready to dy.</hi> But they, admiring his constancy, and strong faith, &amp; confessing how they had been wandring by night; and that theyr eyes had been blinded from finding him, did make him a promise to lead a better life from that tyme forward.</p>
               <p>By this time, he had been two and twenty yeares in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8131:91"/>
that desart, and was generally knowne by fame, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed ouer all the cittyes of <hi>Palestine;</hi> when in the meane while a certaine woman of <hi>Eleutheropolis,</hi> who perceaued her selfe to be neglected by her husband by reason of her barrennes (for already she had passed fifteene yeares without yeelding any fruit of mariage) was the first, who presumed to breake in, vpon the Blessed <hi>Hilarion.</hi> And he suspecting no such matter, she cast her selfe sodainly downe at his knees, and sayd: <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this bouldnes, pardon this necessity of myne. VVhy doe you turne away your eyes? VVhy fly you from your suiter? Looke not on me as a woman, but as a miserable creature. Yet, this sexe brought forth the Sauiour of the world: not the whole, but the sicke, need the Physitian.</hi> At length he stayed, and looking after so long time vpon her, he demanded the reason, both of her comming &amp; of her weeping, which as soone as he had vnderstood, he cast vp his eyes to heauen, bidding her haue fayth; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with teares, he saw her with a sonne at the yeares end. This first miracle of his, was illustrated by another, &amp; greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristaene</hi> (the wife of <hi>Elpidius</hi> who afterward was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Guarde) a woman of great nobility in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and yet more noble among Christians, returning from Blessed <hi>Anthony</hi> with her husband and three children, made stay at <hi>Gaza,</hi> by reason of her sicknes. For there, whether it were by corruption of the ayre, or as it appeared afterward, for the glory of <hi>Hilarion</hi> the seruant of God, they were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised all togeather, with a dangerous double Tertian, and the Physitians despayred of them all. The mother lay lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting loudly, and still was running to and fro betweene her three children, as if already, they had beene three coarses; not knowing which of them she was to bewaile first. But vnderstanding that there was a certaine Moncke in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes neere at hand, she forgot the trayne fit for a Matrone, and only knew her selfe to be a Mother, and went attended but by her maydes and Eunuches, and would scarce be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by her husband, to ease her selfe by ryding thither v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a poore little Asse. When she arriued with him, she sayd; <hi>I beseech you for the loue of Iesus, our most mercifull God, and by his</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:8131:91"/>
                  <hi>Crosse, and bloud, that you will restore me my three sonnes; and that the name of our Lord, and Sauiour may be glorifyed in this Citty of the Gentils.</hi> But he refusing, and saying that he would neuer go out of his cell, and being wont not only not to passe into any Citty, but not so much as into any little house, she cast her selfe prostrate vpon the ground, crying often after this manner: <hi>Hilarion thou seruant of Christ, restore me my children, let them, who were cherished by</hi> Anthony <hi>in Aegypt, be preserued in Syria by thee.</hi> All they who were present wept, yea and euen he wept who denyed her suite. Why should I vse many wor des? The woman would not away, till first he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her, that he would go to <hi>Gaza</hi> after Sunne set. As soone as he came thither, and had considered how they lay, &amp; seen the dryed limmes of all the sicke, he inuoked Iesus. And (o admirable power) the sweate broke out from them all, as if it had beene out of three fountaines. At the same tyme they tooke meat, and recouering the knowledge of their sad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and blessing God, they kissed the handes of the Saint. When this was knowne, and had beene spread farre &amp; wide, men came crowding in vpon him, both out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To whome he spake thus: <hi>If you had giuen that to the poore, which you haue cast away vpon Physitians, Iesus, the true Phisition would haue cured you.</hi> But she crying out, and begging mercy, he spit into her eyes, and instantly according to the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our Sauiour, the like miracle was wrought.</p>
               <p>Moreouer a certaine Carter of <hi>Gaza,</hi> being possessed by a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8131:92"/>
Diuell, as he was in his Carte, grew all so stiffe, as that he could neither stirre a hand, nor turne his head. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought in his bed, and being only able to moue his ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for help; he was tould, that he could not be cured, till he would belieue in Iesus, and renounce his old courses. He belieued, he promised, he was cured, and did more exult for the recouery of the health of his soule, then of his body.</p>
               <p>There was besides, a mighty strong young man called <hi>Marsitas,</hi> of the territory of Hierusalem, who did so glory in his corporall force, as that he would carry about seauen bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells of corne a great way, and a long tyme, and he vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe to exceed euen big Asses in strength. This man was afflicted by a most wicked Diuell, nor did he permit, that chaines, or fetters, or euen the barres of doores, should remaine whole. He had bitten off the noses, and eares of many, he had broken the feet of some, and the neckes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and had strocken all men with such terrour, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loaden with chaines, and roapes, he was drawne like some fierce Bull, towardes the Monastery, by men who kept him in fit distance, by strayning seuerall way. When the Brothers of the Monastery saw him, they being all in a fright (for the man was of a wonderful huge bulke) made it known to their Father. Now he, as he was sitting, required that the man should be brought before him, and let loose; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he sayd: <hi>Bow downe thy head, and come hither.</hi> He trembled, and turned his necke, nor presumed he to looke him in the face, but laying downe all his fiercenes, he began to licke the feet of <hi>Hilario<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> as he was sitting. And so the Diuel, who had possessed the young man, being ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Neither is it to be concealed, how <hi>Orionus,</hi> a principall &amp; very rich man of the Citty of <hi>Aila,</hi> which lyes close vpon the red sea, was possessed by a legion of Diuels, and brought to <hi>Hilario<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> His hands, his necke, his wast, his feet, were al loade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with yron; and his fierce gloomy eyes, did threaten men with extreme cruelty. Now when the Saint was walking with those Brothers, and was declaring somewhat to them of holy scriptures, the possessed man broke forth of theyr
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8131:92"/>
handes, who had held him; and clasping-in the Saint behind his backe, and lifting him vp on high, they all cryed out who were present; for they feared, least he should euen breake that body in peeces, which was so defeated otherwise with fasting. But the Saint smiling, sayd; <hi>Neuer trouble your selues, but let me alone with my wrastler.</hi> And so casting backe his hand ouer the others shoulder, he touched his head, and laying hould vpon his haire, he brought the man before him, and held fast both his hands; and treading with his feet vpon the feet of the possest person, he often repeated theses wordes: <hi>Be tormented, o you troupe of Diuells, be tormented.</hi> And when the party roaring out, and wreathing backe his necke, did euen touch the ground with the crowne of his head. <hi>Hilario<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> sayd: <hi>O Lord Iesus, free this captiue, free this miserable creature; it is in thy power, as easily to conquere many, as one.</hi> I shall tell you a strange thing. There were heard diuers voices, yea the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused clamour of whole people, proceeding out of the mouth of that one man at once. This man being cured, came also, not long after, with his wife and children to the Monastery, bringing many presents with him in the way of gratitude. Of whome the Saint asked this question: <hi>Haue you not read, what</hi> Giesi, <hi>and what</hi> Simon Magus <hi>suffered, whereof the one tooke a reward that he might sell, and the other offered one, that he might buy the guift of the holy Ghost?</hi> And when <hi>Orionus</hi> had sayd with teares, <hi>Receaue my present, and do you bestow it vpon the poore.</hi> He answered: <hi>Your selfe can best tell, how to distribute your owne goodes, you who walke vp and downe the world, &amp; know the persons of poore people: but I, who haue giuen away, that which is myne owne, why should I meddle with that of others? The name of distributing to the poore giues occasion of coueteousnes to many; but true mercy hath no trickes. No man bestoweth goodes better then he, who reserues nothing to himselfe.</hi> But the party being still in griefe, and lying vpon the ground, <hi>Hilarion</hi> sayd: <hi>Be not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, o my sonne, at this which I do, both for my good and for thyne owne; for if I take thy present, both I shall offend God, and the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Diuells, will returne to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who can passe ouer in silence, how one of <hi>Maioma,</hi> the Staple of <hi>Gaza,</hi> who squared stones for building, vpon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8131:93"/>
the Sea cost, not farre from his Monastery, being all defeated by a Palsy, and brought by his fellow-labourers to the Saint, did instantly returne againe to his worke. For that coast, which spreades is selfe both before Palestine and Aegypt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soft by nature, becomes rough, by reason that the sand growes by degrees into the nature of stone; and so grauell sticking to it by little and little, it becomes other to the hand, though it become not other to the eye. There was also an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other called <hi>Italicus,</hi> a free man of the same towne, &amp; a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who kept horses for the <hi>Circus,</hi> which vsed to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other horses of an Officer of <hi>Gaza</hi> who was a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Idoll <hi>Marnas.</hi> For it hath beene maintained in the Citties subiect to the Roman Empire, euer since <hi>Romulus</hi> his tyme, that in memory of that fortunate rape of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> &amp; in honour of <hi>Consus</hi> the God of Counsaile, certaine charriots should runne seauen tymes round about the place, and the victory should be his, whose horses could outstrip and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the rest. This <hi>Italicus</hi> therefore, finding that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current vsed the help of a Witch, who by the meanes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diabolicall imprecations, did giue impediment to his horses, and add speed to his owne, came to the Blessed <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> &amp; begged of him, not so much that his aduersary might be disaduantaged, as that himselfe might be assisted. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an improper thing to the venerable old man, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his prayers vpon such toyes. And when he smiled, and sayd: <hi>Why rather do you not bestow the price of your horses, vpon the poore, for the saluation of your soule?</hi> He answered, Thar the profession, which he followed, was allowed, and that the thing which he then desired, was rather vpon constraint, then choice; That a Christian man might not indeed haue recourse to Magick-Arts, but rather desire help from a serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christ, especially against them of <hi>Gaza,</hi> who were the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries of God, and insulted, not so much ouer him, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Church of Christ. The Saint being therefore entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Monckes, who were present, required that a cup of earth, wherein he vsed to drinke, should be filled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and deliuered to <hi>Italicus,</hi> which as soone as he had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he sprinkled the stable with that water, and the horses,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8131:93"/>
and their riders, and the charriot, &amp; the bars of the race. The people was in a wonderfull expectation of the euent: for the aduersaries of <hi>Italicus</hi> had published all this businesse with scorne; and his fauourers did exult out of the certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of victory, which they made to themselues. But the signe being giuen, the horses of <hi>Italicus</hi> fly away, and those others were able to make no hast; the wheeles of <hi>Italicus</hi> charriots grew hot with speed, but those others were scarce able to keep sight of the former. There was an excessiue noise made by the people, in so much as that euen the Pagans themselues cryed out, that, <hi>Marnas was ouercome by Christ.</hi> But then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries being mad with rage, made instance that <hi>Hilarion</hi> might haue had his proces framed, as being a Witch in fauour of Christians. But in the meane tyme, that vndoubted victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, both in those present sports of the <hi>Circus,</hi> and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afterward, was the occasion that very many were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the Fayth of Christ.</p>
               <p>There was a Virgin consecrated to God, belonging to the same staple towne of <hi>Gaza,</hi> to whome a young man dwelling neere her did make loue. Not preuailing in his enterprise, though he had beene frequent in touching, in iesting, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king signes, and whisling, with the like, (which are wont to be a kind of preface, to the destruction of virginity) he made a iourney to <hi>Memphis,</hi> that vpon manifestation of the wound, which he had receaued, he might by meanes of Magicke arts, returne strong enough to subdue the Virgin. So that after a yeare, being instructed how to proceed by the Priests of <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> who was not wont to cure, but to destroy mens soules, he came with a mind full of presumption, that he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in his wickednes, and he caused certaine coniuring wordes, and prodigious figures, to be grauen in a plate of <hi>Cyprian</hi> brasse, &amp; to be conueyed by digging, vnder the thres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the virgins house. Instantly vpon this she began euen to runne mad with loue, and casting away the dressing of her head, she fell to shake and tosse her haire, to gnash with her teeth, and to cry out after the name of the young man. For the excesse of loue, had exalted it selfe euen into a meere rage. She therfore, being brought by her Parents to the Monastery,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8131:94"/>
was deliuered to the old man; the Diuel beginning to howle and confessing himselfe in this manner: <hi>I was remoued by force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was brought from thence against my will; with what ease did I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude men with dreames when I was at</hi> Memphis! <hi>o the torments that I endure! Thou compellest me to go forth; but I am tyed fast vnder the threshold. I departe not therefore, vnles the young man dismisse me, who detaines me.</hi> To this, our old man sayd: <hi>Doubtlesse thy strength is great, who art held so fast by a little thread, and a plate of brasse. Declare how thou couldest presume to possesse the virgin of God. That I might keep her</hi> (sayd he) <hi>a virgin. Thou keep her so, o thou traytor of chastity? VVhy didest thou not rather enter into him who sent thee? To what end</hi> (sayd the Diuell) <hi>should I enter into him, who already was possessed by a colleague of myne, the Diuell of loue?</hi> But the Saint resolued not to require, that either the young man, or those signes of Witchcraft should be produced, till first the virgin were free, least either the Diuell might seeme to haue departed vpon any other vsuall inchantments, or els least he should be thought to haue giuen credit to the Diuels speach. And vpon this occasion he tould them, how crafty and deceitfull these Diuells are in their deuises. But he rather resolued, as soone as the Virgin was restored to health, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue her for doing these other thinges, whereby the Diuell entred to take possession of her.</p>
               <p>His fame grew not only ouer <hi>Palestine,</hi> and in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cittyes of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> but throughout other Prouinces most remote. For a neere seruant of the Emperour <hi>Constantius,</hi> shewing well of what country he was by the whitenes of his kinne and the brightnes of his haire (whose nation lying betweene the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Allmans,</hi> was not so largely spread as stout, and among historians hath been called <hi>Germany,</hi> but now enioies the name of <hi>Franconia</hi>) was possessed anciently, that is to say, from his very infancy by a Diuell, who constrained him mightly to roare out, to fetch deep groanes, and to gnash with his teeth. This man did secretly desire comodity of passage from the Emperour, but declaring ingenuously the true cause to him. He carryed also letters of fauour to the persons, who had Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sular authority in <hi>Palestine,</hi> and so he was conducted to <hi>Gaza</hi> with mighty honour, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8131:94"/>
attendance. And demanding of the Officers of that place, where <hi>Hilarion</hi> the Moncke remayned; they of <hi>Gaza</hi> being frighted, &amp; withall conceauing, that he was sent by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, thought good to attend him to the Monastery, both that they might exhibite due honour to the person recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as also, that if there should be any memory of former wronges done to <hi>Hilarion,</hi> it might be defaced by this new act of obseruance. The old man was then walking in the deep sand, and was softly repeating somewhat to himselfe of the Psalmes; but seeing such a troupe approaching, he stayed him selfe; and resaluting all the company, &amp; giuing them a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with his hand, he required the rest to depart from thence within an houre; but that the party indisposed, with his seruants and officers should remaine there; for he knew by his eyes and countenance, why he was come thither. The man therefore who was possessed being in suspense vpon the question, which was asked him, &amp; scarce touching the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with his feet, and roaring after a most hideous manner, made his answere in the <hi>Syrian</hi> language, wherein <hi>Hilarion</hi> spoke. And there you might haue seene the mouth of a Barbarian, which was only acquainted with the <hi>Franconian</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, speake so perfect <hi>Syrian,</hi> as that neither the hissing part, nor the aspiration, nor any <hi>Ideome</hi> of the speach of <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> was wanting to him. He confessed therefore, after what sorte he had entred into that body. And to the end that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters might also know what passed (who vnderstood no other tongues but <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>) <hi>Hilarion</hi> asked him some questions in <hi>Greeke.</hi> Who answering him also in the same la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and discoursing about many occasions of inchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and the great force of Magicke artes: <hi>I care not</hi> (sayth Hilari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>how thou entredst in; but I commaund thee, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that thou go out.</hi> And when the party was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; was presenting him with ten pound weight in gould, he on the other side was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to accept a barly loafe, which the old man offered him, with a plaine country kind of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and he was made to vnderstand thereby; that they, who liue vpon such food as that, value gold no more then durt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:8131:95"/>But it is no great matter to tell of strange thinges concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men; for brut beastes were daily brought to him starcke mad, among which there was a Bactrean Camell of hideous bignes, who had euen ground many men to death, like dust; and there were aboue thirty persons, who brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that tyme, with great noise, and all fettered with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ropes. His eyes looked red like blood, his mouth foamed, his rowling tongue swelled; but the noise of his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous roaring went beyond al the other terrour that he strok. The old man therefore, commaunded him to be let loose; &amp; instantly, both they who brought him, and they who were with the old man, did euery one of them fly away. Only he went on alone to meet him, and sayd thus in the <hi>Syrian</hi> langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: <hi>Thou dost not fright me, o Diuell, by that so great bulke of thy body; for whether thou be in the little Foxe, or in the large Camell, thou art still the same.</hi> In the meane tyme, he stood still with one of his handes extended forth. And as soone as the Beast was coming, all furious towards him, he suddenly fell down and layd his head low and leuell with the ground; all they, who were present, being in a wonder, that so great benignity could so instantly follow vpon so great fury. But the old man taught them, how the Diuell is wont to enter into Cattell, for their sakes who are the owners; and that he hates men so highly, that he desires not only the destruction of themselues, but of whatsoeuer is theirs. Of this he propounded an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how the Diuell before he was permitted to tempt the B. <hi>Iob,</hi> killed all the goodes he had. And how it ought not to make any man wonder, that vpon the commandement of our Lord, two thousand swine were cast away by Diuels; for that was done, because they who saw it, would neuer haue belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that so great a multitude of Diuels was departed out of one man, vnlesse a mighty heard of swyne had perished al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather; and so, as if it had beene driuen by a multitude of Diuells.</p>
               <p>The tyme will fayle me, if I shall pretend to speake of all the wonderful thinges which were wrought by <hi>Hilarion.</hi> For he was raysed by our Lord to so great glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Anthony</hi> vnderstanding of his manner of life, did willingly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8131:95"/>
write to him, &amp; receaue letters from him. And if at any time there came sicke persons towardes <hi>Anthony</hi> out of <hi>Syria,</hi> he would say thus to them: <hi>VVhy would you needs vexe your selues by vndertaking so long a journey, when you haue my sonne Hilarion at hand?</hi> By his example therefore, there grew to be innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monasteryes ouer all <hi>Palestine;</hi> &amp; all those Monkes would come flocking towordes him with a kind of strife. When he saw this, he praysed our Lord for his grace, and exhorted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them to profit in the way of spirit, saying: <hi>That the figure of the world passeth, and that the other future life is the true life, which is obtayned by suffering incommodities in this present life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being desirous to shew them an example both of humility, and curtesy, he vsed vpon certaine dayes, before the tymes of vintage, to visite the Cels of the Monckes. As soone as this was knowne by those Brothers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they all flocked to him, and being accompanied by such a guide as that, they went in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit to the Monasteries, carrying their prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with them; for sometymes they would arriue to the number of two thousand persons. But in processe of tyme, euery little Towne grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad of the intertainement which was to be giuen to the Saint, would bring in some of their commodityes, to their next neighbouring Monckes. Now how great care he had, not to passe ouer any one brother vnuisited how meane soeuer or poore he were, this one thing may serue to demonstrate, that he went into the desart of <hi>Cades,</hi> to visit one single disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his with a huge troupe of Monckes. He came then to <hi>Elusa,</hi> and it was by accident, vpon that day, when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of an Anniuersary solemnity, the whole people of the Towne was assembled in the Temple of <hi>Venus;</hi> for they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship her as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> to whose veneration the Nation of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> is addicted. Moreouer the Towne it selfe, for the most part is halfe barbarous, by reason of the situation of the place. They hauing therefore vnderstood, that S. <hi>Hilarion</hi> passed by that way (for he had often cured many of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who had beene possessed by the Diuell) they came forth to meet him, by whole troupes, with their wiues and children, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe their heades, and crying out to him in that <hi>Syrian</hi> word, <hi>Barac,</hi> that is, <hi>Giue vs thy blessing.</hi> These men did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8131:96"/>
with all humility and benignity, and besought them to worship God rather then stockes and stones; and withall he would abundantly weep, looking vp to heauen, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, that if they would belieue in Christ, he would come often to them. And a wonderfull grace of our Lord it was, that they suffered him not to depart, ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l he should make a designe, and draw the first lines of that Church, which fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely was to be built in that place; and till their Priest, as he was then already crowned for the offering of some idolatrous Sacrifice, might be marked with the signe of Christ.</p>
               <p>In another yeare also, when he was going forth to visite the Monasteries, and did set downe in a list by whome he would only passe, and with which others he would stay, the Monckes obseruing, that one of the company was somewhat neer and sparing, and being desirous to cure that fault of his, they wished the Saint to stay some tyme with him. But why, sayth <hi>Hilarion,</hi> will you wrong your selues, and vexe him? Which as soone as that sparing Brother vnderstood, he was out of countenance, and they all drawing one way, had yet much a do to obtaine of him who was vnwilling, that his Monastery might be in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of them, where the Saint should lodge. Yet at length after ten dayes, they went to him; but in the meane tyme certaine Guards or Keepers were placed by him in the vinyard, where the Moncks were to paste, &amp; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But being receaued by another Moncke, called <hi>Sabas</hi> (for it is fit that we name this liberall-hearted man as we concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that other, who was a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Saint then sayd: <hi>Cursed be he who preferres the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

higher place, he blessed the vinyard, and so gaue his sheep leaue to feed vpon it. Now they were not fewer then three thousand eaters. And whereas the vinyard when it was yet vntouched, was esteemed likely to bring forth, but a hundred vessells of Wine, within twenty dayes after the owner made three hundred. And that other sparing Brother, making lesse wine then he was wont, did lament too late, that euen what he had, was turned into veriuyce; which the old man had foretould to many of the Brethren. He did in particular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner detest those Monckes, who through a kind of infidelity, did hord vp any thing for the future, and did vse either dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or cost about their cloathing; or any other of these thinges, which were transitory. And obseruing that one of the Brothers, who dwelt almost fiue miles from him, was too carefull and curious in keeping his garden, and withall had layd vp a little money, he droue him out of his sight. And the party desiring to be reconciled, came to some of the Brothers, and particulerly to <hi>Hesychius,</hi> in whome the old man tooke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much contentment. When therefore vpon a certaine day, the same party had brought a bundell of greene pease, as they were in the cod, and <hi>Hesychius</hi> had serued it that euening vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the table, the old man cryed out and sayd: <hi>That he was not able to endure the stincke thereof; and withall demanded whence it came? Hesychius</hi> answering that a certaine Brother had presented it, as the first fruites of his field: <hi>Dost thou not seele</hi> (sayth he) <hi>a most abominable all sauour, and that coueteousnes stinkes in the very pease; cast them out to the Oxen, and such brute beastes as those, and see if they will ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e thereof?</hi> Now he hauing layd them in the manger (as he was bidden) the Oxen fell into a fright, and lowing after an extraordinary manner, brake their teathers, and ran euery one by a seuerall way. For the old man had this guift, that by the smell of bodyes, or garments, or other thinges which any man had touched, he would know to what vice, or Diuell he was subiect.</p>
               <p>But in the threescore and third yeare of his age, obseruing how great the Monastery was then growne to be, as also the multitude of the Brothers who liued with him, &amp; the troups of other men who brought such persons thither, as were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8131:97"/>
taken by seuerall diseases, and possessed by vncleane spirits, in such sort as that the wildernes was stuffed round about him with all kind of people; he daily wept, and remembred his former kind of life, with an incredible desire to recontinue it. And being demaunded by those Brothers what he ayled, and why he afflicted himselfe, he sayd: <hi>I am returned againe to the world, and haue receaued my reward in this life. Behould the men of Palestine, and the neighbour Prouinces, esteeme me to be some body; and vnder the pretext of gouerning a Monastery for the vse and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of the brothers, I find my selfe possessed of some poore little stuffe of my own.</hi> This was kept by the Brothers, and especially by <hi>Hesychius,</hi> who with an admirable kind of loue, was addicted to the veneration of the old man. But when he had lamented in this sort, for the space of two yeares, that same <hi>Aristaene</hi> (of whom we spake before) being the wife of the Captaine of the Guard, but hauing no part of his aspiring condition, came to <hi>Hilarion</hi> with intention also afterwards to go on towards <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi> To her he sayd weeping: <hi>And I also would be glad to go, if I were not kept prisonner in this Monastery, &amp; if indeed it were to any purpose; now it is two dayes, since the whole world is depriued of such a Father.</hi> Shee belieued it, and forbore her iourney: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few dayes after, a messenger came, by whome she heard the newes, that <hi>Anthony</hi> was dead.</p>
               <p>Let others wonder at the Miracles, which <hi>Hilarion</hi> wrought, let them wonder at his incredible abstinence, his knowledge, and his pouerty. For my part I am not so much amazed at any thing in him, as that he could so tread honour and glory vnder his feet. There came to him Bishops, Priests, whole flockes of Religious persons, and Moncks, and Matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes also, which is a great temptation; and from all sides, both out of the Citties, and Fieldes, there came multitudes of common people, yea and Iudges also, and great persons, that they might be able to get some bread or oyle, which had beene blessed by him. But he on the other side, had his mind fixed vpon nothing but some wildernes: so that one day, he resolued to be gone, and hauing procured a little Asse (for he was then so consumed with fasting, that he was scarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go) he meant to vndertake his iourney with all speed.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8131:97"/>
Now as soone as this was knowne, it wrought vpon the world there about, as if some desolation had been at hand, &amp; as if the Courts of Iustice were to haue been shut vp in <hi>Palesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> for some extreme calamity which had happened. And there grew to be assembled, aboue ten thousand persons, of both sexes, and seuerall ages, for the staying of him. Whereas he inflexible to their prayers, and scattering the sand with the end of his staffe sayd thus to them: <hi>I will not make my Lord a lyer, nor can I endure to see Churches ouerturned, nor the Altars of Christ troden vpon, nor the blood of my children spilt.</hi> All they who were present, vnderstood that some secret had beene reuealed to him, which he would not confesse; but yet howseuer, they watched him, that he might not get away. He therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and he tooke them all to witnesse, that he would not tast either meat or drinke, till he were dismissed; &amp; so after seauen days of his rigorous fasting, he was at length released. And bidding very many of them farewell, there came yet to <hi>Betilium,</hi> a huge troupe of followers; but yet perswading those multitudes, to returne, he chose out forty Monckes, who might make and take prouision, and were able to goe fasting, that is to say, not to eat till Sunset. The fifth day therefore he came to <hi>Pelusium,</hi> and hauing visited those brothers, who were in the <hi>desart</hi> neer at hand, and who remayned in that place which is called <hi>Lychnos,</hi> he went forward after three dayes, to the fort of the <hi>Theubatians,</hi> to visit <hi>Dracontius</hi> the Bishop and Confessor, who liued there in banishment. The Bishop being incredibly comforted by the presence of so great a person, after three dayes more, &amp; with much a do, our old man went to <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he might visit <hi>Philo</hi> the Bishop, who was also a Confessor. For <hi>Constantius</hi> the King, who fauoured the heresy of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> had sent them both out of the way into those seuerall places. But <hi>Hilarion</hi> going from thence, after three other dayes, came to the towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aphroditos,</hi> where meeting with <hi>Baysanes</hi> the Deacon, (who by reason of the vsuall great want of water in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart was wont to hire out Camels and dromedaries, to such as went to visit <hi>Anthony,</hi> and so conduct them to him) he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to those Brothers, that the Anniuersary of <hi>Anthonyes</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:8131:98"/>
death was at hand, &amp; that he was then to celebrate the same to him by watching all that night, in that very place where he dyed. After three dayes therefore of trauaile, through that vast and horrible desart, at length they came to a huge high mountaine, where they found two Monckes, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Pelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus;</hi> which <hi>Isaac</hi> had beene <hi>Anthonyes</hi> interpreter. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause occasion is heere so fairely offered, and that already we are vpon the place, I will in few wordes describe the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so great a person, as <hi>Anthony</hi> was.</p>
               <p>There is a high and stony mountaine, of a mile in circuit, which hath aboundance of springing water at the roote ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The sand drinketh vp part, and the rest sliding downeward grows by little and little to make a brooke; vpon the banks wherof, on both sides, the innumerable Palme-trees, which grow there, giue both great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity &amp; beauty to the place. There you might haue seene our old man passe nimbly vp &amp; downe with the disciples of Blessed <hi>Anthony;</hi> heere they sayd he sung; heere he prayed; heere he wrought; heere when he was weary he vsed to rest. These vincs, and these little trees did he plant himselfe: this little bed of earth did he compose with his owne hands: this poole did he contriue with much labour, for the watering of his garden: with this Rake, did he vse to breake vp the earth many yeares. He lay in the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and kissed that place of his repose, which as a man may say, was yet warme; his Cell was of no larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then such a square wherein a sleeping man might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend himselfe. Besides this, in the very highest top of the mountaine, which was very steep, and could not be ascended but by circling, there were two other Cells of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, wherein he would stay sometymes, when he had a mind to fly from the frequent recourse of comers, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of his Disciples. Now these two were hewen out of free stone, and had no addition but of doores. But when they were come to his garden; do you see sayd <hi>Isaac,</hi> that part thereof, which is the orchard, set with young trees, and so greene with herbes? Almost three yeares since, when a heard of wild Asses came to destroy it, he willed one of the leading Asses to stay, and beating the sides of it with his staffe: <hi>How</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:8131:98"/>
                  <hi>chaunceth</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that you eat of that which you did not sow?</hi> And from thence forth, when they had druncke their water, for which they came, they would neuer touch tree, or fruit any more. Our old man desired besides, that they would shew him the place of <hi>Anthonyes</hi> tombe: but they leading him apart, we are yet vncertaine, whether they shewed it or not. They say, that the reason why <hi>Anthony</hi> commanded it to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, was for feare least one <hi>Pergamus,</hi> who was a very rich man in those partes, should carry the Saints body to his village, &amp; so there erect a shryne.</p>
               <p>But now <hi>Hilarion</hi> returning to <hi>Aphroditos,</hi> (and adioyning o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly two of his Brothers to himselfe) remayned in the desart, which is next that place, in the practise of so great abstinence and silence, as that he sayd, he began to serue Christ but then. Now then it had beene about three yeares, when the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s seemed to be shut, and had dryed vp the earth; so that they vsed to say, that euen the Elements did lament the death of <hi>Anthony.</hi> Neither did the same of <hi>Hilarion</hi> ly hidden from the inhabitants also of that place; but the men &amp; woemen there, hauing their faces all growen wanne and worne with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, came crowding to desire some showres of rayne of the seruant of Christ, that is, of the successour of the Blessed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</hi> As soone as he beheld them, he was stricken with strange griefe, and casting his eyes vp to heauen, and raysing both his handes on high, he instantly obtayned what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired. But behould that dry and sandy country, as soone as it was wel watered with raine, budded forth vpon the sudden such a multitude of Serpents, and other venemous creatures, that innumerable persons had instantly perished, if they had not made recourse to <hi>Hilarion.</hi> But all those Sheepheards, &amp; Country people, applying certaine Oyle which he had bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, did assuredly recouer their health. Yet perceauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be also obserued there with strange kindes of honour, he went on to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp; resolued to proceed from thence to that desart of the more remote <hi>Oasa:</hi> and because from the first tyme that he had beene a Moncke, he had neuer remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any Citty, he turned a while to certaine Brothers wel knowne to him in <hi>Brutium</hi> not farre from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8131:99"/>
when they had receaued the old man with an admirable kind of ioy, they suddenly heard (the night being then at hand) that his disciples were making ready his Asse, and that he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding to be gone. And therfore casting themselues at his feet they desired him to change his mind, and then lying also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate before the threshold of the doore, they professed that they would rather dy, then loose such a guest. He answered them after this manner: <hi>I make hast to be gone, for the preuenting of your trouble; and you shall be sure to know heereafter, that I went not hence so suddenly without cause.</hi> The next day therefore they of <hi>Gaza</hi> went forth with their officers (for they knew that <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion</hi> was come thither the day before) and they entred into the Monastery; and when they found him not there, they sayd thus to one another: <hi>Are not those thinges true, which we haue sayd of this man? A Magitian he is, and knowes future thinges.</hi> But the Citty of <hi>Gaza</hi> (when once <hi>Hilarion</hi> was gone out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine, and <hi>Iulianus</hi> had succeeded in the Empire, (hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready destroyed the Monastery) made a petition to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for the death of <hi>Hilarion</hi> and <hi>Hesychius,</hi> and they obtayned it, and warrants were sent out through the whole world, that they should be sought. <hi>Hilarion</hi> therfore being gone from <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> entred into <hi>Oasa</hi> by an impenetrable kind of desart, and there hauing spent little more or lesse then a yeare, he could only thinke of sayling ouer to some Ilandes; that whome the earth had published, at least the Sea might conceale: for the fame of him had also arriued, as farre as that place, where the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was, and now he could no longer hide himselfe in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne partes of the world, where he was knowne to so many both by reputation, and person. About that very tyme <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> a disciple of his, came suddenly to him out of Palestine, bringing newes that <hi>Iulian</hi> was slaine, and that a Christian Emperour began to raigne, and that it became him to returne ro the Relickes of his Monastery. He heard, but detested that motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; hauing procured a Camell, he came through a vast solitude to <hi>Paretonium,</hi> a Sea-towne of <hi>Libya:</hi> but the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Adrian,</hi> being willing to returne to Palestine, and seeking to enioy his former glory vnder the title of his Master, did him many wronges, and at last hauing trussed vp those things
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8131:99"/>
togeather, which had beene sent to <hi>Hilarion</hi> by certaine Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he went away without his priuity. Vpon this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (because we are not likely to haue any other) I will only tell you, for the terrour of such as despise their Maisters and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that shortly aftér, this man did rot of the Kings euill.</p>
               <p>The old man therefore, hauing one of <hi>Gaza</hi> with him, did embarke himselfe vpon a ship, which was bound for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and when by the sale of a booke contayning the Ghospell (which himselfe being young had written with his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des) he meant to haue payd for his passage; the Masters sonne was suddenly possesséd by a Diuell, about the middest of the <hi>Adriatike</hi> sea, and began to cry out, and say: <hi>Hilarion, thou ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, why dost thou not permit vs to be in safety, euen at Sea? Giue me day till I may come to land, least being cast out heere, I be precipitated into the Abysse.</hi> He made answere to him thus: <hi>Stay, if my God will let thee stay; but if he will cast thee out, why dost thou lay it to my charge, who am a sinnefull man, and a beggar?</hi> This he sayd, least the Marriners, and Marchants, who were in the ship should publish him, when they came to land. But soone after this, the boy was freed; both his father and the rest, who were present giuing their wordes, that they would not name him at all. Being entred within <hi>Pachinum,</hi> which is a Promo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he offered the Maister his booke of the Ghospels for the passage of himselfe and the man of <hi>Gaza,</hi> which Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster euen from the first had no mind to receaue it, especially when he saw that they had nothing but that booke, and their cloaths, and so at last he swore he would not take it. But the old man being inflammed through the experimentall comfort he had in being poore, did reioyce so much the more, both because in very deed he had nothing of this world, and for that he was also esteemed a beggar by the Inhabitants of that place. And yet doubting least some Marchants, who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to come out of the Easterne parts, might detect him, he fled towardes the In-land, that is, some twenty miles from the Sea, and there in a kind of wild little Country, making daily vp some fagot of wood, he would lay it vpon the backe of his disciple; and that being sold in the next Towne did help them to some very little bread, which might serue by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8131:100"/>
way of reliefe, both to themselues, and such others as by chaunce vsed to passe that way.</p>
               <p>But indeed according to that which is written, <hi>The Citty placed vpon a hill cannot be concealed.</hi> For when a certaine Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-maker was tormented in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church at Rome, the vncleane spirit cryed out in him after this manner: <hi>Some few dayes since Hilarion the seruant of Christ came into Sicily, and no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowes him, and he thinkes he lyes secret there, but I will go, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale him.</hi> Soone after this, the same man shipping himselfe at <hi>Porto</hi> with his seruants, arriued at <hi>Pachinum,</hi> &amp; the Diuel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him, till he might prostrate himselfe before the little poore cottage of the old man, he was immediatly cured. This first miracle of his in <hi>Sicily,</hi> drew an innumerable multitude of sicke men, as also of deuout persons to him; so farre forth, that a certaine man of much quality being sicke of a Dropsy, was cured by him the same day he came thither: who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes being willing to make him many presents, heard the Saint vse this saying of our Sauiour to his Disciples, <hi>Freely you haue receaued, freely giue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilest these thinges were doing in <hi>Sicily, Hesychius</hi> his disciple went looking the old man ouer the whole world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king discouery vpon the Sea-costs, and penetrating euen into the desarts, &amp; hauing in fine this only confidence, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he should be, it was not possible for him to be long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. When therefore three yeares were spent, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at <hi>Methona</hi> by a certaine Iew (who was selling certaine trash to the people) that a Christian Prophet had appeared in <hi>Sicily,</hi> working so many miracles and wonderfull things, that he might be held for one of the auncient Saints. Being asked concerning his habit, his gate, his language, &amp; especially his age, he could make no answere; for he affirmed that he knew not the man, but by report. Entring therefore into the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi> he came with a prosperous wind to <hi>Pachinum,</hi> &amp; enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after the fame of our old man, in a certaine little towne which was seated vpon that crooked shoare, he found by the vniforme relation of them all, where he was, and what he he did: all they wondring at nothing so much in him as that, after so many signes, and miracles, he had not taken so much
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8131:100"/>
as a bit of bread, of any man in those partes. And to make short, the holy man <hi>Hesychius,</hi> coming at length to cast himself at his Maisters feet, and to water them with his teares, was raysed vp by him, &amp; after the discourse of two or three dayes, he vnderstood by him of <hi>Gaza,</hi> that the old man would now no longer remaine in those partes, bur that he would go on, to certaine Barbarous nations, where his name and language might be vnknowne. He lead him therefore to <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and remayning a few dayes in certaine partes neere by, he yet could not ly concealed. For a Dragon of wonderfull bignes, whome in their tongue they call <hi>Boas,</hi> in regard they are so great as to swallow vp whole Oxen, wasted all that Prouince farre and neere, and drawing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the force of his breath, not only heards of Cattel, &amp; flockes of sheep, but Country people also and Shepheards, he would sucke and swallow them vp. When therefore he had first sent vp his prayer to Christ, &amp; had appointed a great pile of wode to be prepared, he called the monster, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to clime vp that masse of wood, and he put fire to it vnderneath: and so (the whole people looking on) he burnt vp that vast and most cruell beast. But he being in great difficulty, what he were then best to doe, and which way to turne himselfe, was preparing to make another flight. And reuoluing the most solitary countryes in his mind, he grieued, that whilest his tongue was silent, his Miracles would not hould their peace.</p>
               <p>At that tyme, the Seas transgressed their boundes, vpon that earthquake of the whole world, which happened after the death of <hi>Iulian.</hi> And as if God would threaten men with some new deluge, or els that all thinges were to returne into their first <hi>Chaos,</hi> so hung the ships, being hoysed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vp to the stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tops of those mountaines. Which as soone as they of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurus</hi> saw, namely those roaring and raging waues, and that masse of waters; and that whole mountaines were brought in vpon the shoares, by those rapid floods, (being in feare of that which already in effect they found to be come to passe, that he Towne would vtterly be ouerwhelmed) they went on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o the old man, and as if they had beene going to a battell,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8131:101"/>
they placed him for their Captaine vpon the shoare. But as soone as he had made three signes of the Crosse vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sand, and held vp his handes against the Sea, it is incredible to be tould into what a huge height it swelled, &amp; stood vp before him, and raging so, a long tyme, and being as it were in a kind of indignation, at the impediment which it found; it did yet by little &amp; little slide backe againe into it selfe. And this doth <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> and all that Region proclaime euen to this day, &amp; mothers teach it to their children, that so the memory thereof may be deliuered ouer to posterity. That which was sayd to the Apostles, <hi>If you haue fayth, and shall say to this mountaine, transport thy selfe into the sea, and it shall be done,</hi> may truely and euen litterally be fullfilled now, if any man haue the fayth of an Apostle, or such fayth as our Lord commanded them to haue. For wherin doth it differ, whether a mountaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the Sea, or els whether huge mountaines of water, grow suddenly hard, being as if they were of stone, iust befor the feet of the old man, and that yet on the other side, they should runne fluid and soft. The whole Citty was in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the greatnes of the miracle was publickly knowne as farre as <hi>Salon.</hi> But as soone as the old man vnderstood thereof, he stole away by night in a little boate, &amp; within two dayes after, finding a Marchants ship, he went on towards <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But the Pirates then, betweene <hi>Malea</hi> and <hi>Cyth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All the Marriners who were in his ship, began to quake, to weep, to runne vp and downe, to make their long poles ready; and (as if one messenger were not sufficient) to crowd in vpon the old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to tell him that the Pirates were at hand. Whome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding, before they were yet come necre, he smiled, and turning towardes his disciples sayd: <hi>Why are you frighted, O yee of little fayth? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8131:101"/>
within a stones cast. He therefore went to stand in the prow of his ship, and stretching forth his hand against the assaila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, he sayd: <hi>Let it suffice that you are come so farre.</hi> O wondrous stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But twenty dayes more were not fully passed, when throughout that whole Iland, all those persons who were possessed with vncleane spirits, began to cry out, that <hi>Hilarion</hi> the seruant of Christ was come, &amp; they must hasten towards him. This did <hi>Salamina,</hi> this did <hi>Curium</hi> and <hi>Lapetha,</hi> and this did all those other Cittyes proclaime, most of them affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that indeed they knew <hi>Hilarion,</hi> and that he was the true seruant of God, but that they knew not where he kept. So that within thirty or few dayes more, there came to him two hundred possessed persons, as well men, as woemen. As soone as he saw them, he did so grieue, that they would not giue him leaue to be quiet; and (being cruell after a sort, in the way of reuenge vpon himselfe) he did so whip vp those spirits by the extreame instance of his prayers, that some of the possessed were presently deliuered, others after two or three dayes, and all within the compasse of a weeke. Staying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

there two yeares, and euer being in thought how to fly away, he sent <hi>Hesychius</hi> into Palestine to salute his Brethren, and to visit the ashes or ruines of his Monastery, with order, that he should returne the next spring after. Now though v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the former returne of <hi>Hesychius</hi> thither, <hi>Hilarion</hi> resolued to haue gone againe into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and namely to certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are called <hi>Bucolia,</hi> because no Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were there; but it was a fierce and barbarous nation: <hi>Hesychius</hi> did yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade him that he should rather procure to find out some more retired place in that very Iland where he was. And when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long search in all those partes, <hi>Hesychius</hi> had found one, he conducted him twelue miles of from the Sea into the middle of certaine secret &amp; craggy mountaines, to which a man was hardly able to ascend, euen by creeping vpon his handes and knees. He entred then, and contemplated that so retyred and terrible place, enuironed on all sides with trees, and hauing store of water descending from the brow of the hill, and a little kind of very delightfull garden, and great store of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, the fruit wherof he yet did neuer taste. There were also the ruines of a most ancient Temple, from whence (as himself related, and his disciples testify to this present day) there was heard the noyse of such an innumerable multitude of Diuels, as that a man would euen conceaue it to haue beene some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He was much delighted with this, as finding that he had <hi>Antagonists</hi> at hand; and there he dwelt fifteen yeares, and in that last part of his life, he was much comforted by the often visits of <hi>Hesychius.</hi> For otherwise by reason of the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and craggines of the place, and the multitude of Ghosts which were vulgarly sayd to be walking there, either very few or none, had both the power and the courage to go vp thither. But yet vpon a certaine day, going out of his little garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he saw a man, who had the Palsy in all his limes, lying before his dore, and he asked <hi>Hesychius,</hi> who that was, and how he had beene brought thither? The sicke man answered and sayd that formerly he had beene the Steward of a little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, to the confines whereof that very garden belonged, wherein they were. But the old man weeping, &amp; stretching forth his hand to the sicke person, who lay before him, sayd:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8131:102"/>
                  <hi>I require thee in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that thou ryse and walke.</hi> An admirable hast was made, for the wordes were yet but tumbling out of the speakers mouth, and euen very then, his limmes being growne strong, were able to support him. Now as soone as this was heard, the difficulty of the place and of the way, which was euen almost impenetrable, was yet ouercome by the necessityes of men; the people round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hauing no care more at heart then to watch, that by no meanes he might get away. For already there was a rumour spread of him, that he could not stay long in a place; which yet he was not subiect to, as being obnoxious to any leuity, or childish humour; but to the end that he might fly from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp; importunity by that meanes: for the thing to which he euer aspired, was a remote and poore priuate life. But in the eightyth yeare of his age, whilest <hi>Hesychius</hi> was absent, he wrote him a short letter with his owne hand, in the nature of a kind of <hi>VVill,</hi> bequeathing al his riches to him; that is to say, his booke of the Ghospels, his coate of sacke-cloath, his hood, and his little cloake; for his seruant dyed some few dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now whilest himselfe was sicke, there came many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout persons to him from <hi>Paphos,</hi> and especially, because they had heard, he sayd, that he was to depart to our Lord, and to be freed from the chaines of this body. With them, there came a certaine <hi>Constantia</hi> a holy woman, whose sonne in law and daughter, he had freed from death by anoynting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with oyle. He adiured them all, that they would not reserue his body any one minut of an houre, after he should be dead, but that instantly, they should couer him with earth in the same garden, all apparelled as he was, in a haire-cloath, a hood, and a country cassocke. By that tyme, he had but a very little heat, which kept his breast luke-warme, nor did any thing seeme to remaine in him of a liuing man, besides his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; only his eyes, being still open, he spake thus: <hi>Go forth, what dost thou feare? Go forth, O my soule: what dost thou doubt? It is now vpon the point of threescore and ten yeares since thou seruest Christ, and dost thou now feare death?</hi> As he was speaking these wordes, he rendred vp his spirit, and instantly being al couered with earth, the newes of his buriall was more spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8131:103"/>
carryed to the Citty, then of his death. But as soone as the holy man <hi>Hesychius</hi> had vnderstood thus much in Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, he went towardes <hi>Cyprus</hi> and (pretending that he had a mind to take vp his dwelling in the same garden (that so he might free the Inhabitants of the Country from the opinion, that they had need to keep some strict guard vpon the body) he grew able to steale it away, after the end of ten moneths, with extreame hazard of his life. He brought it to <hi>Maioma,</hi> whole troupes of Monckes, and euen whole Townes atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; and he buryed it in his ancient Monastery; his haire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, his hood, and his little cloake, being vntouched, and his whole body was also as entire as if he had beene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue, and it yeilded and odour so very fragrant, as if he had beene pretiously imbalmed.</p>
               <p>And now me thinkes, that in the last period of this booke I may not conceale the deuotion of that most holy woman <hi>Constantia,</hi> who vpon receauing the newes, that the dear body of <hi>Hilarion</hi> was now carryed away into Palestine, did instantly giue vp the ghost, approuing euen by death her true loue to that seruant of God. For she had beene wont to spend whole nights in watching at his sepulcher; and for her better help in prayer, to speake to him as with one who were still present with her. To this very day you may discerne a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull contention betweene them of <hi>Palestine,</hi> and them of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> the former challenging his body, and the later his sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and yet in both these places, great wonders are daily wrought; though more in the garden of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his heart was more set vpon that place.</p>

After this very sort I, who haue long held my peace (for he hath made me silent, to whome my speach is a torment) desire first to exercise my selfe in some little work,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8131:104"/>
and as it were to rub off a kind of rust from my tongue, that I may come afterwardes to write a more ample history. For I haue resolued if our Lord giue me life, &amp; if my calumniators will leaue persecuting me (at least now that I am fled &amp; shut vp from them) to write from the coming of our Sauiour till this age; that is to say, from the Apostles, till the dregges of these our present dayes; in what manner, and by the meanes of what men the Church of Christ was instituted; and how it came to growth; how it increased by persecution, and was crowned by Martyrdomes; &amp; how afterward when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was put into the hand of Christian Princes, it grew grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in wealth, and power, but lesse in vertue. But of these things at some other tyme: now let vs declare what we haue in hand.</p>
               <p>There is a little Towne lying towardes the East of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronia,</hi> a Citty of <hi>Syria,</hi> vpon the point of thirty miles from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</hi> This towne after hauing beene in the handes of many, either absolute Lords or Possessours of it otherwise, came at last (when I being a young man remained in <hi>Syria</hi>) into the hands of Pope <hi>Euagrius</hi> a neere friend of myne; whome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue named now, to shew by what meanes I might come to know that, whereof I am about to write. In that Towne therefore there was a certaine old man called <hi>Malchus,</hi> whome we in Latin may call <hi>King.</hi> A <hi>Syrian</hi> he was by natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by language, and indeed <hi>Autochthon.</hi> There was also in his society a very aged decrepit woman, who seemed to be come to the very dores of death. They were both so diligently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, and so did they weare the very threshold of the Church away, that you might haue taken them for the <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizaheth</hi> of the Ghospell, saue only that they had no <hi>Iohn</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. Concerning these two, I made diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the dwellers there about, by what tye of coniunction they were knit? of mariage? of consanguinity? or of spirit? Al men made but this one answeare, that they were Saints, and persons very pleasing to God; and they tould I know not what strange thinges of them: and so being drawne on with this delight, my selfe did set vpon the man, and curiously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the truth of things, he made me this account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8131:104"/>
I am (sayth he,) my sonne, a husband-man of that tract which belonges to <hi>Maronia,</hi> and I was the only child of my Parents, who being willing to make me marry, as being the only spring of their stocke, and the heire of their family; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared that I rather chose to be a Moncke. By how great threates of my Father, and by how faire allurements of my Mother, I was persecuted, to the end that I might be content to loose my chastity; this only consideration may serue to shew, that I forsooke my home, &amp; fled from my Parents. And because I could not goe Eastward (for that <hi>Persia</hi> was so neer at hand, where there was a guard of Roman souldiers) I tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my course toward the West, carrying I know not what little thing with me, by way of prouision, which might only secure me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the extreamity of want. Why should I vse many wordes? At length I came to the desart of <hi>Chal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>is,</hi> which lyes somewhat Southward of <hi>Imma,</hi> and <hi>Essa,</hi> and meeting there with certaine Monckes, I deliuered my selfe ouer to their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; getting my liuing by the labour of my handes, and restraining the lustfullnes of flesh and blood, by fasting. After many yeares, a desire came into my mind of returning into my country; &amp; whilest my Mother was yet aliue (for by that tyme I had heard of my Fathers death) to become a comfort of her widdowhood, and that then after this, hauing sould the little possession which I was to enioy, I might bestow a part vpon the poore, a part vpon erecting a Monastery, and a part (for why should I blush to confesse my little confidence in the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God?) vpon the supply of myne owne expence &amp; charge. My Abbot began to tell me alowd, that it was but a temptation of the Diuell, and that the subtile snare of the old enemy, did but lurke vnder a specious pretext. That this was but to returne, as a dogge would do to his vomite: that many Monckes had beene thus deceaued: that the Diuell is neuer wont to shew his face without a maske. He propounded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples to me out of Scripture, and that among the rest, how in the beginning of the world <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by a hope of diuinity. And when he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade with me, he besought me euen vpon his knees, that I would not forsake him, nor destroy my selfe, nor looke backe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8131:105"/>
ouer the shoulder, when I had the plowgh in my hand. But woe be to me wretched man. I ouercame this Counsellour of myne by a most wicked kinde of victory conceauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that he sought not my good, but his owne comfort. He went following me therefore out of the Monastery, as if he had beene carrying me to a graue, and giuing me at last a long farewell: <hi>I shall see thee</hi> (sayth he) <hi>o my sonne, marked out by the burning iron of Sathan; I inquire not after thy reasons, nor do I admit of thy excuses; the Sheep which goes out of the fould, doth instantly lye open to the wolues mouth.</hi>

               <p>Vpon the passage from <hi>Beria</hi> to <hi>Essa,</hi> there is a desert neer the high way, where the <hi>Saracens</hi> are euer wandring vp and downe in their inconstant kind of habitations, the feare wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make trauaillers resolue not to passe that way but in great troupes; that so their eminent danger may be auoyded by the mutuall help of one another. There were in my company me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and woemen, old men, young men, and children to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of seauenty in the whole; and behould those <hi>Ismaeliticall</hi> riders of their horses and Camels, rushed in vpon vs with their heades full of haire tyed vp with ribandes, their bodyes halfe naked, wearing but mantles, and large hose: at their shoulders hung their quiuers, and shaking their vnbent bows, they carryed also long dartes; for they came not with a mind to fight but to driue a prey. We were taken, we were scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and all distracted into seueral wayes. As for me, who had beene the naturall owner of my selfe for a long tyme before, by lot I fel vnder the seruitude of the same Maister with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine woman. We were lead, or rather we were carryed lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily away vpon Camels, and being alwayes in feare of ruine through out all that vast desert, we did rather hang, then sit. Flesh halfe raw was our meat, and the blood of Camels our drinke. At length hauing passed ouer a large riuer, we came to a more inward desert, where being commanded (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of that nation) to adore the Lady, and her children whose slaues we were, we bowed downe our necks. But heere being as good as shut in prison, and hauing our attyte changed, I begun to learne to go naked; for the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratenes of that ayer permits not any thing to be couered,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8131:105"/>
but the secret parts. The care of feeding the sheep was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ouer to me; &amp; in comparison of a greater misery, I might account my selfe to enioy a kind of comfort, in that by this meanes I seldom saw either my Lords, or my fellow-serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: me thought I had somewhat in my condition, like that of holy <hi>Iacob;</hi> I also reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred <hi>Moyses:</hi> for both they had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes beene shepheardes in the desert. I fed vpon greene cheese and milke; I prayed continually, and sung those psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes which I had learned in the Monastery. I tooke delight in my captiuity, I gaue thankes to the iudgments of God for my hauing found that Moncke in the wildernes, whome I had lost in myne owne country. But, o how farre is any thing from being safe from the Diuell! O how manifould, and vnspeakeable are his snares! For euen when I so lay hid, his enuy made a shift to find me out. My Lord therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing, that his flocke prospered in my hand, and not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any falshoud in me (for I knew the Apostle to haue commaunded, that we should faythfully serue our Lords, as we would do God) and he being willing to reward me, that thereby he might oblige me to be yet more faythfull to him, gaue me that she-fellow-slaue, who had formerly been taken captiue with me. And when I refused to accept her, affirming that I was a Christian, and that it was not lawfull for me to take her for a wife, who had a husband yet aliue (for that husband of hers had also beene taken togeather with vs, and carryed away as the slaue of another Lord) he grew all fierce and implacable towardes me, and euen like a mad man began to runne at me with his naked sword, and if instantly I had not stretched forth myne armes, and taken hould of the woman, he had not fayled to take my life. And now, that night arriued, which came too soone for me, and was the darkest that euer I saw. I lead this new halfe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wife, into a caue; hauing taken bitter sorrow for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher, who was to lead vs home from the wedding; and both of vs abhorred one another, though neither of vs confest so much. Then had I indeed a liuely feeling of my bondage, and laying my selfe prostrate vpon the ground, I began to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8131:106"/>
bewayle the Moncke whome I had lost, saying: <hi>Wretched creature that I am, haue I beene kept all this while aliue for this? Haue my grieuous sinnes beene able to bring me to so great misery, as that hither to being a Virgin, yet when now I find my head full of hoary haires, I should become a marryed man? VVhat auayles it me to haue contemned my Parents, my Country, and my goodes for the loue of our Lord, if now I doe that thing, for the auoyding whereof, I contemned all the rest? vnlesse perhaps all these miseries are come iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly vpon me, because I would needes returne to my Country? But tel me, o my soule, what are we doing? Shall I perish, or shall I ouercom? Shall I expect the hand of God, or shal I runne my selfe vpon the point of my owne sword? Turne thy sword vpon thy selfe: the death of thy soule is more to be feared; then that of thy body. It is a kind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome for a man rather to haue suffered death, then to haue lost his virginity. Let this witnes of Christ remaine vnburyed in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes; my selfe will be both the persecutour &amp; the martyr.</hi> Hauing spoken thus, I vnsheathed my shining sword, in that darke place, and turning the point against my selfe, I sayd: <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well vnfortunate woman, and take me rather as a Martyr, then as a marryed man.</hi> But she casting her selfe downe at my feet, spake to me in these wordes: <hi>I beseech you for the loue of Iesus Christ, and I adiure you by the straightes, wherein we find our selues in this sad houre, do not cast the guilt of shedding your blood vpon me; or if there be no remedy, but that you will needs dye, turne first your sword vpon me, and let vs rather be married thus in death, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. Although myne owne husband should returne to me, I would obserue chastity, which I haue beene taught by my captiuity; yea I would keep it so, as that I would rather wish that I might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, then it. VVhy should you dy, rather then be marryed to me, who would resolue to dy, if you should resolue to marry? Take me to you, as the wife of chastity, and esteeme more the coniunction of the soule, then of the body. Let our Lords conceaue vs to be man and wife; but let Christ know vs to be as Brother and Sister. VVe shall easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men that we are marryed, when they see that we do so entirely loue one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confesse I was amazed, and admiring the vertue of the woman, I loued her the better for that kind of wife:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8131:106"/>
but yet did I neuer so much as behould her naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; I neuer touched her flesh, for feare least I might loose that in peace, which I had preserued in warre. Many dayes passed on betweene vs in this kind of matrimony; this mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age making vs more acceptable to our Lords and Maisters, as freeing them from all suspition of our running away: yea sometymes it would fall out, that I might be absent in that desert for a whole moneth togeather, like a Shepheard well trusted with his flocke. After a long space of tyme, whilest I was sitting alone in the wildernes, seeing nothing but heauen and earth before me, I began to consider with my selfe in silence, and to reuolue many thinges in my heart, which I had knowne, when I conuersed with the Moncks; and especially I called to mind the countenance of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of myne, who had instructed, who had cherished, and who had lost me. And whilest I was beating vpon these thoughtes, I behould a flocke of Antes, to swarme in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine straight passage, who carryed burdens euen greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own bodyes; some of them had taken vp certaine seeds of herbes with their mouths, as if it had been with pincers; others were carrying earth out of ditches, and would make certaine fences against the entry in of water; some, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that there was a winter to come, tooke of graines of corne, &amp; brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in, least the earth when it should grow wet, might conuert the corne already gathered into new corne for the next yeare; others carryed the bodyes of their dead with a sad kind of solemnity; and (which yet is more to be wondered at) there was none going forth, of all that troupe, who would hinder any one that entred in, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if they discouered any, who were in danger of falling vnder their waight or burden, they would lend him their shoulders to keep him vp. What shall I say more? That day shewed me a pleasant obiect. Whereupon, remembring <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> who sendes vs to imitate the sharp sighted prouidence of Antes, and stirring vp our sloathfull mindes by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; I began to be weary of my captiuity, and to aspire towardes the Cels of Monkes againe, and to loue the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

of those Antes, in that they labour in common, where nothing is proper to any one, but all thinges belong to all. When I went backe to my lodging, I see the woman co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towardes me, nor was I able to dissemble the sorrow of my heart. She asked me, why I was so troubled? I tell her my reasons, and she exhorted that we might take our flight. I coniure her to promise silence; she giues me assurance, and so continually whispering about this busines, we were layd and tossed betweene hope and feare.</p>
               <p>I had in that heard two Goates of a huge bignes; which being killed, I make vessells of their skinnes, and I prepare their flesh, for our prouision. And the first euening when our Lords might conceaue that we were layd to rest, we set v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our iourney, carrying the skinnes and the meat. When we were come to a riuer, which was some ten miles of, we commit our selues to the waters, hauing first layd our selues vpon these skines, which were stuffed out; and we holpe our selues with our feet, as it might haue beene with oares, that so the riuer carrying vs downeward, and landing vs much lower on the other side of the bancke, then where we put our selues into the water, they who followed vs might loose the trace of our feet. But in the meane tyme our flesh being wet, and part of it also being lost, it did hardly promise vs food for three dayes. We drunke euen to satiety, by way of prouision against the thirst which we were to haue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. We ranne, and yet euer looking behind our backes; &amp; made more way by night then by day, partly by reason of the danger, which might haue growne to vs by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and partly through the excessiue heate of the Sunne. Wretch that I am; I tremble euen whilest I am but telling it: and though indeed I be wholy now secure, yet all my body quakes to thinke thereof. For after the third day, we saw a farre of in a doubtfull kind of sight, two men sitting vpon Camells, who were coming towardes vs at full speed: and presently our mind, which was apt to foretel mischiefe to vs, began to thinke that our Lord and Maister had resolued our death, and that we euen saw the Sunne grow blacke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

vs. Whilest we were thus in feare, &amp; conceaued our selues to be betrayed by our footesteps printed vpon the sand; we found a Caue vpon our right hand, which pierced farre vnder ground. But fearing least we might fall vpon some venemous beastes (for Vipers and Basiliskes and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, &amp; such other creaturs, declining that great heat of the Sunne, are wont to betake themselues to the shad) we entred indeed into the Caue; but instantly at that very entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we committed our selues to a hollow, which was within vpon the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, not daring to proceed any further on, least by flying one kind of death, we might haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon another: conceauing this within our selues, that if God will help vs as being miserable, we shall be safe; but if he despise vs, as being sinnefull, we shall fall into the handes of death. What kind of heart do you think we had? What kind of fright were we in, when our Lord, &amp; a fellow slaue of ours were stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neere the Caue, and by the print of our feet were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy arriued as farre, as that darknes would giue them leaue? O death how much more grieuous art thou in expectation, then in effect! Euen againe my tongue growes to falter with feare and care, and as if my Lord were but now crying out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, I haue not the heart to whisper out a word. He sent his slaue to fetch vs out of the Caue; himselfe houldes the Camells, and hauing drawne his sword, he expects our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth. In the meane tyme, that seruant being gone three or foure cubites on, we seeing him with his backe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes vs, (for the nature of our sight is such, as that all things are darke to those who enter into any obscure place, after they haue beene in the Sunne) we heard his voice sound through the denne: <hi>Come forth you villaines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out, you who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for death. VVhat do you expect? VVhy do you stay? get you out our Lord calls you, he expects you with patience.</hi> Whilest he was yet speaking, behould we saw, euen in that darknes, that a Lyonesse already rushed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that man, &amp; hauing strangled him, drew him all bloody in. Deare Iesus, how full were we of terrour, and of ioy withall! We perceaued our enemy destroyed, though our Lord and Maister knew it not. For

when he saw the delay, he suspected that we two had resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted one, and so not being able to differ his wrath, he came forward to the Caue with his sword in his hand, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his slaue of cowardise, with a furious kind of rage, he was first seised vpon by the Beast, before he came to our retreate. Who are they, which can belieue, that the Beast should fight for vs, in our owne presence? But being freed from that feare, the like destruction presented it selfe before our imaginations; sauing that it was safer to endure the rage of a Lyonesse, then the wrath of a man. We were afflicted with feare, euen to the very heartes, and not venturing so much as once to stirre, we expected the euent of the busines, in the middest of so many dangers, being only defended, as with a wal, by the conscience which we had of our chastity. The Lyonesse being wary, least she might chance to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some snare; and finding that she was seene, takes fast hould of her whelpes, and carryes them forth, and leaues the lodging to our vse. Neither yet were we so credulous as to breake out in hast; but expecting long, and sometimes thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to go out, we neuer had a fancy, as if we were to fall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon wild beasts. But at length, after the end of the next day, the horrour in which we were being remoued, out we went in the euening, and we saw some kind of Camels, whome for the excessiuenes of their speed they call <hi>Dromedaries,</hi> rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating vpon those meates which they had eaten before, and then drawing them downe againe into their stomackes. And we mounting on them, and being refreshed with new prouision, arriued by that desert to the Roman Garrisons, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the tenth day after, &amp; there being presented to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, we gaue him an orderly account of what had passed. From thence we were sent ouer to <hi>Sabinus</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where we receaued a iust price for our Camels. And because that Abbot of myne, did now rest in our Lord, when I was brought to that place, I restored my selfe to the Monckes, and I deliuered her ouer to the Virgins; louing her as my Sister, but not trusting my selfe with her, as with my Sister. This story did <hi>Malchus</hi> being ould relate to me,
