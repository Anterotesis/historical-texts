            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a strange Land, neuer found
out till now of late in this present
time, there was a kind of people
that had great heads and litle wits,
&amp; strong bodies, but weake hearts.
The men were onely knowne by
their shapes from monsters, and
the women onely by their tongues
from pictures: the aged spent their
time most in wearinesse, and the youthfull in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
their Cities and Townes were of ancient buildings;
their houses large within, and without beautiful, many
roomes richly furnished, and with many pictures but few
people: their gardens and orchards so full of flowers
and fruites, and so finely dressed, planted and pruned,
and weeded, that it seemed they made their pallaces their
Paradise: for by their hellish courses it seemed that they
thought of no other heauen.</p>
            <p>Nature being (as it were) the goddesse of their worship,
when supernatural was too high for their capacities their
apparel of diuers colours according to the varietie of their
humors their Churches like shops, and their wares bables;
their inuentions Apish, and their fashions foolish; while
their wisdome going no further then the world, kept them
from the wealth aboue the world. Their language more
full of eloquence then truth, and their actions of more


<pb facs="tcp:4937:4"/>
craft then conscience. Their Priests reade a language, that
often gauelleth their owne vnderstandings; and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is without rule of grace. Their deuotion is full of
darknesse; for they cannot see in the day time without a
candle: and their prayers are by the dozen, when if they
miss-tell one, they thinke all the rest lost. And for Saints,
they haue so many to serue, that the diuell wil not let them
come at God.</p>
            <p>Meetings they haue many, vpon small matters. Their
musicke is most in a Iewes trumpe, and their dances are
all without measure. Feasts they make many times, when
their flesh is Guls, and their fish Gudgeons.</p>
            <p>The rich are for the most part couetous, and the poore
patient: for punishment is much more common then
charitie. Cuckolds they haue in communitie; for they are
not so wise as to account of honestie: and for wittals, they
haue it growne to such a custome, that it neuer troubles
their conceit. Their wooing is like bargaining; for their
purses make their matches: and iealousie so holds in loue,
as kils the comfort of kindnes; when the agents for flesh,
breake the order of fasting dayes.</p>
            <p>Warres they haue seldom, and their quarels most vpon
the cup; their great Ordinance are Pot-guns, and their
small shot halfe Cans. Their fields are commonly cellers,
where they are so ouercome with kindnesse, that their
forces are all ouerthrowne. When they are to trauell, they
haue horses, but most of them Hobbies, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they buy at Faires for small prices: and some few Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
that are such T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s, that they will start at euery But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflie,
and fall downe ere a man be well mounted. Their
riding is without spurres; for their Nagges are willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for their way.</p>
            <p>Asses they haue many, which beare great burthens;
and when they haue laboured them all day, they walke
them at night; and they feed them poorely. Their dogs
are commonly little ones, and they are most of them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Fancies, which when they grow olde they knocke


<pb facs="tcp:4937:4"/>
them on the heads. Cattell they haue store, and most of
them Cowes; for there is hardly a house without a Calfe:
and Swine a world; for euery Stie hath a Sow or two in
her. Birds they haue many, but their chiefe pleasure is in
Wagtailes, that are pretie fowles, and euer pidling in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
plashes. Cuckoes they haue great store, but they sing
onely in May; and Parrots very many, that talke strange
things in their languages: and Cock-Sparrowes so many,
that they can scarce find Hens for their treading. Duckes
and Geese in abundance, and they breed out of measure.
Other birds they haue, as Tittimouses and Robin Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breasts,
Larks and Buntings, which were often caried
to the markets, and bought for small prices. Ringdoues
they had many, but Turtles very few. Exercises they
haue many but chiefly wrestling, when they haue more
foiles then faire falls. Sometime they vse riding of the
wilde Mare, shooing of the Goose, and sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ting at the
Conie. Hunting they vse little, but to finde a Hare at
squat, a Doe at laire, a Foxe in a snare, a Mouse in a trap,
a Woodcocke in a springe, or a Blackbird in a pitfall.</p>
            <p>Some strange trickes they haue to get mony with,
as to make a Begger speake like a Lord, a Foole like
a wise man, a Cobler like a Captaine, and a boy like
a wench; but that is but for a time; for when the date of
the letter is past, the counterfet is conceiued, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis
returneth to his owne shape. When there are
any burials, they mourne much; for the youthfull, because
they die so soone; for the aged, because they liued so long:
for the wise, because there is so few left; and for the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
because they want companie: for the rich, that they
had no more for them, and for the poore, that they might
haue prayed for them: wiues for their husbands, because
they are vnprouided of new; husbands for their wiues,
because seldome comes the better: parents for children,
because of the losse of hope of their goodnesse; children
for their parents, for losse of hope of the more goods. But
their mournings were not long, for they lasted not so


<pb facs="tcp:4937:5"/>
long as their apparell; for out of sight, out of minde; and
they knew they must liue by the liuing, and not by the
dead. The mony-men are very couetous, for they will not
lose the scraping of a kettle; and the women are very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
for when they make broth, though it be very thin,
they will not lose the dropping of their noses. For the
yong things, they are as wanton as kitlings, for they will
play with a mouse, till they haue wearied her of her life:
and for the aged, they are so melancholik, that the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
haue no pleasure in them. For Louers, they are so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
that they will weepe if they haue not their wils; but
if the Groome get his Bride, he will so pranke it, and she
so prinke it, that while it is hony Moone there wil be such
ioy, as if Summer should neuer heare of Winter. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
they haue not many, and few that speake one wel:
and for learning, it is most in obseruation; for as the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
goes, the Geese follow. Their husbandrie is most in
turning vp of fat earth; and their corne is Rie and Oates,
which they sow in the Spring, and reape in the Fall. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
they haue not many, for labour sweates out ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
but for their wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they are ful of qualmes, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they haue declined with the masculine gender.</p>
            <p>Their trafficke is much for trumpery, and if they
saue their stockes whole, they thinke they haue made a
good market. Their Aduentures are fearfull, for they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the body for the soule: and their mindes are so
fantasticke, that their wits are like weathercocks. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they regard not, but take it as they finde it: and for
loue, it is so light, that they know not how to take hold
of it. They haue among them certaine Fortune tellers,
which vse commonly among fooles: and for knaues, they
are so cunning, that they go vnder the shadow of honest
men. Some odde shauers they haue among them, called
Die Doppers, whose diuing or dopping somtimes proues
deadly; for they will diue so closely into your pocket for
your purse, that you can hardly see them till they be vpon
the gallowes. Other kinde of close mates there are, that


<pb facs="tcp:4937:5"/>
cary Rings in their mouthes, to keepe their tongues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their teeth; and they are called Squiers, but they are
onely of the order of the Apple: their names are often
recorded in a Court of Correction, where the Registrer of
Rogues makes no little gaine of Rascabilians. Other kind
of subtill companions there are, which are called Setters,
which finding yong heads that are too narrow in the
browes, will feed their humors with such follies, as may
either bring them to beggery, or in the height of an idle
braine, for words aboue wit, breake the backs of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
or send them to heauen in a string. Now these,
they say, are great with the Diuell, for they do a great deale
of mischiefe in the world: their names are onely found in
the notes of destruction, for by their hellish courses they
sell themselues to damnation. Other kind of knick-knac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
there are, which betwixt knaue and foole can make
an ilfauourd passage through the world. Schollers they
haue many, that are perfect in the home-book, who when
they were yong, were taught their crosse-row, and to spell
and put together, before they could well reade.</p>
            <p>They had moreouer a kind of Rimers, which were
great proficients to the Players and Pedlers, which
are the fooles of Poets, for they taste little of Poetry, more
then the last two letters: but for the pot, they may well
challenge that badge, for it is the maintainer of their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Now among all these, they haue a kinde of Naturals,
which get the start of better wits, for they are prouided
for the backe and the belly, without care or labour; and
somtime haue accesse where better braines are barred out:
and if they be she-fooles, they are kept fine and cleanly,
to come and play with children and aged people. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all these, it is set downe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that there is one great foole
of their owne chusing, that for a certaine time hath the
commandement of most part of them, who during his
time may do very much in little matters; who with his
copesmates, hauing in his hand the staffe of smal strength,
and willing to shew the greatnesse of his little wit, for to


<pb facs="tcp:4937:6"/>
make a Stable of his gouernment, to the subiects of his
Supernoditie, set downe certaine Articles to be obserued
and carefooly to be lookt vnto, as they would answer it
at their pleasure, and those scarce worth the printing; yet
were to be read in Markets, Faires, Wakes, and merrie
meetings, vpon such dayes as should be thought fit for
such a purpose.</p>

being gouerned by Apes and Asses, the great Foole of all

thing among other he hit on strangely to saue charges

then they should lacke lodging, they should sit in the

            <p>This little worshipful <hi>Iohn a Nods,</hi> in stead of a mistake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
gentleman, hath bin in his youth brought vp in learning
how to reade ilfauouredly, and to write worse, and yet
with much adoe, after his schoolemistris an old woman
with spectacles had taught him his Primer, and the Clerke
of a country Church had taught him to write a Copie or
two, and put his name to a bill Lobligatorie, he grew to
such a delight in reading of Ballads and hearing of olde
stories, that he bought at the second hand out of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie
of little learning, some few bookes of his mothers
language, which hauing kept long in an old chest did now
serue him for his Librarie: which bookes sometime asse
he was able to finde idle time, which at the best is little
better, he would now and then take out of his course cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet,
and reade by peece-meales as it came into his addle
braine: the names whereof, as I found them set downe,
were these, I meane chiefly those whom his little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
tooke most pleasure in: <hi>Presidents of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Newes of no importance,</hi> and <hi>Labour in vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first for <hi>Presidents of Imperfections:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that would put out his eyes, because he would see
no vanities, would be a blind man, and so an imperfect
man.</p>
            <p>He that would cut out his tongue, because he would
tell no vntruthe, should be a dumbe man, and so an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
man.</p>
            <p>He that would cut off his hands, because he would take
no bribes, should be a lame man, and so an imperfect
man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4937:8"/>
And as of men, so of women.</p>
            <p>A maide is no perfect woman, because without the
helpe of man, she is onely called a Maide, and not a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>A widow is an imperfect woman, because with the
losse of her man, she loseth the title of a woman, and is
onely called a widow, but not a woman.</p>
            <p>A barren woman is no perfect woman; for a woman
was created to increase an multiply: till therefore she haue
brought forth children, she is an imperfect woman, except
the fault be in the man, and then he is an imperfect man,
to put such imperfection vpon a woman.</p>
            <p>A whore is no perfect woman; for euery woman is
either a maide, a wise, or a widow; and being neither of
these, she must needs be a monster, and so an imperfect
woman.</p>
            <p>A painted woman is no perfect woman, for all women
by nature are either faire or foule: but if an artificial faire
be set vpon a foule complexion, it makes but a speaking
picture, and a picture is no perfect woman.</p>
            <p>These and such like were his <hi>Presidents of imperfections,</hi>
which for his poore instruction he would take some idle
humors to bestow his blind sight vpon.</p>
            <p>The next booke was intituled, <hi>Newes of no importance,</hi>
which I found set downe as followeth.</p>
            <p>First, in the Gulfe of small grace, neare to the coast of
Comgligrande, vpon the fourteenth day of the fifteenth
moneth, in the strange yeare of foule weather, it is said,
that in the passage boate betweene <hi>Verola</hi> and <hi>Gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ria,</hi>
two dangerous places for infection, the boate entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lake of Lasciuiousnes, a very vnwholsome harbor,
with ouercharging the vessell, perished a great number of
poore people, who bringing but common ware to the
market, and their greatest losses being Asses and galled
Hackneys it seemed there was no great misse of them, for
I find nothing worthy nothing written of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being Newes of no importance, they serued onely


<pb facs="tcp:4937:8"/>
for a tale of a tub, to exercise the braines of such a Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the land of Vnluckinesse, in the citie
of Sinfulnesse, it was reported that Sir <hi>Henrie</hi> had land,
Sir <hi>Lawrence</hi> litle wit, and Sir <hi>Ninny</hi> nothing worth, three
Knights of the Order of Saint-Asse, men of infamous
memorie, after that they had runne through the courses
of expences, without euer hope of recouerie of either
coine or credit, going in the gulfe of Canavery, to see a
Beare hunt a wilde ducke, fell by chance into a But of
Malligo, where they were drowned horse and foot: what
became of their Funerals, or Epitophs vpon their deaths,
hauing no matter in their liues to be recorded, I can say
nothing, but that the Newes being of no great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it is no matter for their passage out of life, but for
feare of their passage to no better; and so let them go, and
as many fooles as will follow them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the Iland of Saint <hi>Elfe,</hi> the great Ladie of
little worth, which was no lesse kinde to her neighbours,
then readie to entertaine strangers, and for her recreation
had set vp many May-poles in diuers places neare to her
dwelling place. Now for her diet, she vsed most to feede
vpon such morsels as most fitted her appetite, especially
such nourishing meates as best agreed with the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her complexion; when in an idle humour one eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
she was so busie with a Lobstart, that with a surfet
vpon the same, she fell quezie stomackt, and so inflam'd
her blood, that she grew fantasticke, and in a few nights
after set many of her Maypoles on fire, and in a little time
after, with the extremitie of passion, fell into the Falling
sicknesse, which in a short time brought her carkas into a
consumption, and so in a few dayes after into her last
lodging in the earth: but for any great memoriall of her,
I reade nothing, but that in her life time she had the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp of youth, who since her death haue continued
their course to their vtter condemnation; but since that
for any matter of great note, more then that shee was


<pb facs="tcp:4937:9"/>
a notorious peece of pedlers stuffe, the newes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of no importance, it is no matter what became of
her.</p>
            <p>4. In the valley of Saint Grineums, the great Lord of
Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>zie bush, venturing to ride late in the night, and not
seeing his way, fell into a deepe bog, where he was so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
that with a cold after a heate, he caught such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse,
as that many of his copartners in his passages were
greatly afraid that he would fall into a consumption both
of bodie and goods: a great infirmitie, and hardly to be
helped. But hearing no matter of worth in the man, nor
any thing, but that he liued in all vnworthinesse, and died
nothing worth; the newes being of no importance, it is
no matter what became of him, onely as a Lord of Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e,
let him be well boiled, and serued in a messe of
Bruesse at a beggers table, and so let him go.</p>
            <p>5. From the coast of Careaway neare the Cape of ill
Hope, there came newes of a little Knight of great valour,
Sir Walter whet whistle, who was of that force, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
encountred with him, if he stood long with him, in
the end he was ouerthrowne Now there dwelt neare him
one Sir Dogbolt Driebread, who did oftentimes make a
roade into his countrey, and vpon a time set vpon him
with all his Forces, thinking at vnawares to surprise with
him; of which an euill neighbour to them both, Sir
Swines head Great swallow hauing intelligence, with his
armie came vpon them both, and so stoutly followed his
fortune, that he tooke them both prisoners in the field, and
made them both Tributaries to his greatnesse. Whether
the newes be true or no, it is of no importance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
onely fit for the great Foole to feede his humour
withall.</p>
            <p>6. In the vnknowne Iland, some twelue thousand
miles from the great Bay of <hi>Port de Pouero,</hi> where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
monsters keepe their Court vnder water, it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that in that Land were great store of flesh, but little
wholesome for the vse of man, sauing onely Hares and


<pb facs="tcp:4937:9"/>
Conies, which well dressed would now and then serue
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>urne for a strong stomacke: For most of their other
beasts were Foxes, Wolues, and Badgers and Polcats,
which were the spoile of many yong Lambs and sucking
Rabbets, yea and sometime of elder Game. They had also
in that country great store of Foule and birds of diuers
fethers, but few of them wholesome or toothsome, as
Dawes, Rookes, Crowes, Night rauens, Shrich Owles,
Cormorants and Guls, which feed vpon Lambs, Rabbets,
Mice, Wormes, Fish, Carion and Garbidge, but few of
them whose flesh was fit to be serued at any Table of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
but among many other Fetherd creatures, they
had many balde Buzzards which fed much vpon Titri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouses
and hedge sparrowes, which were no sooner out
of the hedge, but they would be vpon them, and sometime
so ouergorge themselues with them, that with foule fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and ouerfeeding, they would fall flat on their backes,
with their heeles vpward, so weake and faint, that euery
Crow might haue a picke at them.</p>
            <p>Now the Traueller into that country, who brought the
newes from thence, being vnhappily by ill weather cast
vpon that coast, and finding little or nothing to trade for,
that might giue him hope of any gaine, hauing vpon a
cold night lien watching at a Coniborough, and scarce
well, and wearie, in the morning making haste to get on
boord, with a fit gale for his purpose, put out of an ill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and gate roundly to sea, and safely returned home
againe, sauing that he gat such a numnesse in his ioynts
and stiffnesse in his elbowes, that he could scarce put his
hand to his head, to take off his hat at the deliuery of his
trauell Of which hearing nothing worth any thing, being
of no great importance, I found it serued onely for an
idle Foole, to fit the great humour of his little
wit.</p>
            <p>7. In the Iland of <hi>A Merricat,</hi> vnder the Equinoctial
line, in the Straits of <hi>Margerian</hi> in a swift current between
the Lake <hi>Maudelina</hi> and the mouth of the riuer of <hi>Allitia,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:4937:10"/>
by reason of certaine vnwholesome vapors that arose out
of certaine Sulphurous mines neare vnto the sea, diuers
passage-boates perished, or grew so rotten, that if any of
the passengers made shift to get home again, though with
losse of their ware, and danger of their liues, yet neither
they nor the vessels were euer fit for any good emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or to any seruice of worth; but being likely that
either they were olde vessels that could abide no foule
weather, or some small Barkes that were swallowed vp in
some swelling billowes, since the certaintie thereof is not
yet knowne, and being doubted that some of them haue
bin hotly shot at betwixt wind and water, till the returne
of the next <hi>Gazette,</hi> there is little to be said to it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
newes of no importance, it may passe for a Fable
among the like fancies to fit the fancie of such a
Foole.</p>
            <p>8. From the Desert of <hi>Arabia</hi> it was reported that the
people of that country liue strangely, neither by trade
nor trafficke, fishing nor fowling, nor yet by cheating
nor cozening, but by plaine theeuing; so that betwixt
them and the Turkes there is such hauocke with killing
and spoiling, that the poore Friers in diuers places among
them or neare vnto them are in pitifull feare of their
liues: a great deale of land they haue, but ill inhabited,
and Fruit trees but few, and the Fruit very watrie, and of
little or no good nourishment. They are commonly well
horsed, and weaponed for Bowes and arrowes, darts and
swords, but Peeces few or none: and therefore being no
matter of importance, the newes are not worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
more then that it is a wonder that they should haue
a King among them, that may be called the King of
theeues: For being all outlawes, they must haue a strange
kind of gouernment, which it should seeme is but during
pleasure.</p>
            <p>Now to these and such other toyes, hee had some
odde discourses of Labour in vaine, which were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but as they came to my hands I haue set them downe,


<pb facs="tcp:4937:10"/>
which were as followeth.</p>
            <p>1. In time out of minde, when Beasts and Birds could
speake, and windes could whisle wondrous things, there
was in a strange country a great bird like an Eagle, that
flying vp and downe in diuers places of the world<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> espied
by chance a far off a faire bird like a Phenix, vpon a high
rocks, sitting among a number of faire Foules and sweete
singing birds round about her, but she sat in a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
aboue them all: now this other great bird in his
pride scorning all birds but himselfe, and enuying the
greatnesse of this faire blessed bird, called a councell of
his kites together, to find out some deuice or other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to seeke the death and ouerthrow, not onely of her,
but of all the goodly Foules and sweete birds about her.
Much talke there was how to bring this matter to effect,
and the better to set it on work, before the enterprize was
attempted, the great Bird sent out certaine Buzzards as
spies to flicker about the coast of the country, where the
faire bird kept her high flight, who being returned with
matter of such maiestie, as bred increase of malice in the
heart of the proud bird, he standing so much vpon his
strength, that he thought no bird should be able to beare
a fether in his frowne, commanded forthwith a number
of cages to be made, in which he put a number of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,
woodcocks, Dawes, Rauens and Crowes, Guls and
Kites, to make warre with this faire Bird and her Fowles:
which were no sooner put to sea, but a chattering Pie in
all places where she flew, cried, Victorie, victorie: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
passed along the Seas, neare the coast, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with such a flight of braue birds, as put the cages
with all their forces to such a flight, as so draue them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the rocks and sands, that few of them were able to get
home, with the hard newes of their heauie fortune: but
when the great Birde beheld the wofull spectacle of his
drouping flight, hee fell into such an agonie, through a
passion in his disgraced pride, finding his labor all in vain,
stoupt his traine, hung downe his head, and shortly after


<pb facs="tcp:4937:11"/>
turned vp his heeles. And thus ended his discourse of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in vaine; a tale of a tub without head or foote: and
therefore, like a Fable of the Foxe and the Goose, I leaue
it to the Gander with whom I found it.</p>
            <p>2. In the Iland of <hi>Terra Lorida,</hi> a place of great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
of small wares, neare the chiefe Citie of <hi>Nullibi,</hi>
in an vniuersalitie, in stead of an Vntuersitie, where Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
were as ill read as taught, there was a deepe studient
in the secrets of Nature, which labouring much to bring
all to nothing, wrought day and night for the Moone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
in the water, when hauing spent both time and
meanes, to worke wonders out of imaginations, finding
Nature not so subiect to Art, but to keep her owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in all properties, when his fire lacked fuell, his eyes
were ouermatched, and a long hope of great substance
went away all in smoke; and while he laboured to marry
the Sunne and the Moone together, there was such a
cloud betweene his wit and the light of wisedome, that
he could effect nothing to his purpose; and that with the
stone of Philosophie, many braines had bin beaten long,
and the head nere the better, with a great deale of griefe,
and little hope of amends, walking one day to the Sea
side, and studying how to find out the cause of the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and flowing of the sea, but neuer able to finde it out,
saw as it were a vision, or rather some conceited appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a man lading of water into a pot, which though it
was full and ranne ouer, yet he still laded in water: when
this little well learned Scholler wondring at his worke,
asked him what he meant to do? quoth he, As you doe,
Labour in vaine; and so vpon the sudden vanished out
of his sight, and left him so perplexed, that with very pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to see the passion of the poore man, I awaked.</p>
            <p>3. In the old time when Hobgoblin and Robin good
Fellow made country wenches keepe their houses cleane
ouernight<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for feare of walking spirits should get into


<pb facs="tcp:4937:11"/>
their chambers, and ere they were aware slip into their
beds, and get them with child before morning. In a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
village called Lobkin the large, there dwelt a plaine
dealing man, who with his wife a good breeding crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with eating of Mummada pudding and the inward
of a beast, with the helpe of a pot of Ale and Ginger,
found the means to fill the world with beggers: the poore
man hauing passed many dayes in no small purgatorie
with her intollerable tongue, which would call him by
many more names then belonged to a Christian, sought
all the meanes to bring that vnquiet creature into some
more peaceable course, pleasd her humor in all he could,
but all would not suffice, but an Eios hawke would euer
be prating; but when she was either at iacke or at feeding;
so this tatling gossip that tooke a continuall pleasure to
heare her selfe speake, though seldome to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
the poore man so tired out with trying all meanes
he could to stay the ringing of this house bell, and finding
his labour all in vaine, resolued to put on such a patience
as was past all vnderstanding, and to let her talke till she
was weary, which could be neuer while she had breath,
and letting her haue her swinge till he could no longer
suffer it, knowing a day appointed when they should ride
to a Wake or a wassell, a merry meeting of gossips and
their Assebands, her Mare that she vsde to ride to market
on, being then in the stable and fed with the best hey and
oates, to please his Dame, but little to her knowledge kept
her from water a day and a night before she was to ride:
but when the day came, and she was mounted and vpon
her way, it fell out that they were to go through a deepe
riuer, where the Mare greedy of water to quench her
thirst, as almost or rather stronger headed then her Dame,
ranne into the deepe, and stumbling in a hole, floundring
out with much ado, threw her into the poole, and with
much ado saued her selfe. When the poore man looking
backe and not hearing her speake, who all the way before
neuer held her peace, but was euer finding fault with the


<pb facs="tcp:4937:12"/>
ill setting of her pannell, or the raines of her bridle, or the
shooing of her neere foote, because she would now and
then trip somewhat low, and so with one thing or other
be euer finding fault to keepe her tongue wagging; but
when he could not heare her speake, and seeing onely her
clothes appeare a little in the water, after he had got out
his Mare, called for helpe to get out his Dame, in a maner
dead; which being layed on the bank, and the water pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of her belly by her mouth, she gaue three or foure
gasps, and opened her mouth as if she would haue spoken:
whereat the poore man affrighted, started, and falling
backward, me thought fell vpon me, and therewithall I
awaked. And thus ended the dreame of the Labour
in vaine, to quiet an vnquiet and an intollerable
Scold.</p>
            <p>Now this great Foole had also in his Librarie, in the
bottome of his olde chest, certaine Poeticall, or rather
potticall Dreames put into time, but for reason, more then
for naturall capacities, I find little; yet such as they were,
and fitted the humour of his noddle pate, as I found them
after his death, left for a Legacie to his cousins Loblollies,
I thought good to set them downe in maner and forme
following.</p>

               <l>And with a crie of mastiffe curres did take the Bore in chase,</l>
               <l>Who scouling set his bristles vp, and champed with his chaps,</l>
               <l>And with his tusks vpon the ribs, full many a curre he claps,</l>
               <l>And ouer hedge and ditch he goes, and all the chase withstood,</l>
               <l>And fumes and fomes and suuffes as he were master of the wood:</l>
               <l>But close behind a tree there stood a Huntsman with a dart,</l>
               <l>Who twixt the shoulders and the rib did strike him to the heart:</l>
               <l>When vp the Bore turnd both his heeles, the Huntsman all came in,</l>
               <l>And all the mastiues and the curres did such a crie begin,</l>
               <l>And such a shout the people made, as if the aire had rent,</l>
               <l>Wherewith I wakt, and marueld what this kind of hunting meant,</l>
