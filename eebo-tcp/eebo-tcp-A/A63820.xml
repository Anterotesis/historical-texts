         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Despise not the Rules for promoting Health and Temperance, the ways of God and Nature are plain and simple, but mighty in operation and effects, the Body is as an Instrument to the Soul, and being out of tune no harmony can be expected in the Microcosm. The Curious

            <p n="1">1. THe first step to Wisdom is to know thy self, the Consummation of it, to know God thy Creator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nature is the Art of God, or that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct property wherewith he hath endued every thing in the Universe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is not a greater Note of Folly then to be Ignorant of the true Value and Knowledge of the Things that are.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore follow not the Opinions of the Vulgar, for they generally slight and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise things precious and excellent, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire things vile and pernitious.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take not the Name of thy Creator in thy Mouth, except thou hast some inward sence of His wonderful Power, Virtue, Strength, Beauty, and Majesty, and that He is thee all, the sustainer and preserver of thy self and all Beings.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Honour not the Sepulchres of the Saints
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102588:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Wise Ancients, and at the same time Stone the present Prophets that appear in the same Spirit of Wisdom.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Imprison thy Tongue lest it imprison thee; Nature knows it was an unruly Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and therefore barrocadoed it in with Teeth, and for one Mouth gave us two Eyes, two Ears, two Hands, to teach us, that our Business should be to see and hear, and do good Actions, rather then only to talk of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodness; and the Heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the harsh Fire, and under the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divided forms of Nature.</p>
            <p n="8">8. 'Tis not Words but Things, not Names but Reason, not Resemblances but Realities, not Sublimeties but Simplicities, that the Sons of Truth doth seek after.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Seek not the splendid Drudgeries, or High Places and Offices of this World, for they often draw the Soul into Perdition, and the Body into Distempers.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Entertain Charity, and seek Peace with all Men, and be helpful to thy Friends, and kind to Strangers, but Love and do good even to thy Enemies, for otherwise thou doest but usurp, not deserve the Name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Lye not for Gain, nor never let Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest so byass thy Understanding and Mind, as Justice cannot stand upright.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Give the Lord Praises for all things, because he is the Fountain of all things.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Boast not of thy own Acts, though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102588:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou dost exceed in Arts or Sciences, but consider whatever thou canst do more then thy Neighbour is the Gift of the Lord, and not thine, be not therefore proud of that which is none of thy own.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Know that Satisfaction is the greatest Riches, and Content the only thing that makes Men Happy.</p>
            <p n="15">15. A little supports Natures Wants, but the whole World cannot satisfie a Wantons Desires.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Think not therefore those only Happy that have great Possessions, for as little sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the real Necessities of a King as of a Begger.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Riches and Honour will not satisfie the Mind and Soul of Man, because there is no simile between them; every thing must have its own Food, or else that groans and dies; that which is Incorporeal, must have Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Food.</p>
            <p n="18">18. For as the wants of Nature cannot be enlarged equal to Mens Riches, so neither can their Pleasures be augmented without doing Nature an injury.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Riches are commonly snares, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather to be shunned then greedly sought after, except it be to do good, and to support <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="21">21. Therefore always entertain in thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmical Castle those three grand Friends of Mankind, Humility, Patience, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Whenever you Eat or Drink, <hi>Do it</hi> (saith Wisdom) <hi>in Remembrance of me,</hi> that is, fear my Name, and submit to the guidance of my Spirit, who will teach the Sons of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom all things necessary.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Desire not variety of Meats nor Drinks for fear the Soul be overwhelmed in the dark Clouds of Wrath and Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Eat not to dullness, for that is a token of Gluttony, and a forerunner of Diseases.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Delight not in Meats and Drinks that are too strong for Nature, but always let Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be stronger then your Food.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Prolong not the Pleasures of the Palat by improper mixtures or wanton Sauces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the necessities of the Stomach, for whatsoever is superfluously received is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Nature, and the Seed-Plot of Diseases.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Eat not before your former Food be concocted, if you would avoid Crudities and varieties of Distempers.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Moderate Fasting is a most excellent Physician both for the Body and Mind.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Do not Eat or Drink any thing that is hotter then your Blood, except in a Physical

way, for fear lest you infect the Fountain of Life with a Scorbutick Humour.</p>

            <p n="47">47. Forbear Riding except it be on neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but use Walking and going on Foot, for such Exercises do propagate Health, Strength and Agility of Body and Mind.</p>

When you look upon, or behold any Fruit, Seed, Grain, Flower, Trees, Grass, Fountain of Water, Beasts, or any other Created Being of the Works of the All-wise wonderful God, then cast your Eyes inward, and consider the unsearchable Wisdom, Power, and Strength of the Creator, and learn by an inward sight of visible things to adore and ever admire the Maker and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stainer of all these wonderful Beings, and reflect upon thy own Weakness and Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which come on Mankind by Sin, and so sink down into Humility, which is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all other Vertues.</p>

            <p n="55">55. For every Speech and Action carries the power and strength of its respective Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple with it, so has a certain natural power to awaken and strengthen its likeness whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Good or in the Evil.</p>
            <p n="56">

            <p n="57">57. But on the contrary every evil thought, word, and act, takes its Birth from the evil bitter Root, and dark fierce Wrath, or first Principle, in which God is called by the Prophets, a Jealous angry God, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming Fire.</p>
            <p n="58">58. Likewise all kinds of Oppressions either to Man or Beast do arise from the same poysonous Radix.</p>

            <p n="64">64. Much speaking, though it be from Wisdom, is lightly set by, amongst Fools,

               <p n="175">175. Now from this good Principle do arise and proceed all good Thoughts, Meditations, Words, and Works, it is the Witness that condemns in every Man the evil of his way, and Judges them, and leads Men out of evil into good, and by its friendly Influences and Councel it mightily endeavours to allay all the Furious, Harsh, Passions, Pride, Vain-glory, Covetousness, Envy, Back-biting, Fighting, Killing, and all Violence, which do proceed from the dark Original, or unregenerated Principle, or Wrathful Nature, and is the Blessed Genius that leads and teaches all its Followers the ways of Wisdom and Virtue.</p>

between Jest and Earnest, and all Plays and Games, and whatsoever do tend to Vanity and Lenity; but more especially, as is said before, when such shall be joined to the Principle of Wrath, then such become of evil cunning Natures, and subtle Inclinations, having two Faces, <hi>viz.</hi> Good with the Good, and Evil with the Evil, and are of very pernitious Dispositions; whosoever is found in this fault, as many 1000 are, it goes very hard with them, and their Souls are beset with a great company of Enemies both within and without.</p>

               <p n="260">260. But in some things or Foods the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers property in the Fire is most potent, and then such are of a harsh, bitter, hot, or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous Spirit, and phlegmatick Body, and of strong, gross taste and smell, subject to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and therefore such Foods ought in a special manner to be avoided, and of that

               <p n="284">284. It is the very foundation of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the parent of Humanity and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it attracts the good out of all Things, and potently resists the Evil.</p>
               <p n="285">285. It is the Mother of Pity, Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Mercy, gives the opportunity of time and mature Consideration, opposing all Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and irregular Inclinations.</p>
               <p n="286">286. It is the only Friend of Charity, and Enemy of Wantonness; the Nurse of Plenty, and the very radix of a sound and healthy Generation.</p>

               <p n="290">290. For Temperance brings Man again near unto his first Innocent Estate, and fits him to live again in the Garden of Pleasure,

amongst the innocent Herbs and Fruits, and prepares him for the Consummation of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the Coelestial Paradice.</p>

the Center out of which it is departed, that so it may be a Dwelling or Temple for God, wherein the Divine Will and friendly Love of God worketh and governeth all things.</p>
               <p n="313">313. That happy Man that doth live in, and under the Divine Will, and is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Light and Love of Jesus Christ, hath no strife about, nor in Religion, because in all things he hath resigned his Will unto Gods Will, Countenances, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends that which is good in all Men, let their Form, or Worship, or Religion be what it will.</p>
               <p n="314">314. Let no outward Opinion, Form, or Ceremony separate thee from having Union with thy Neighbour, nor Meats, nor Drinks, nor any thing but Evil.</p>
               <p n="315">315. For there is nothing Recommends Man unto his Maker, but Obedience to the Requirements of his Holy Spirit or Divine Principle of his Light and Love, which leads all its Followers into Innocency and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p n="316">316. God is Love, and he that loveth not his Neighbour whom he daily Communicates with, cannot love God, as the Scriptures of Truth do testify, for Man is Gods Image.</p>
               <p n="317">317. Remember that whatsoever Offence or Evil thou dost to thy Neighbour, is also a Sin against God.</p>
               <p n="318">318. There is no outward Religion, or Form of Worship, has power to reinvest Man again in his first Original State, but only

Faith in the Lord Jesus, Love, Humility, and Obedience unto the Commands of the Lord, and a peaceable innocent walking with his Neighbour.</p>
               <p n="319">319. Therefore when thou considerest the varieties of Religion, and Forms that Men do worship God in, be sure to embrace that which tends most to the Glory of God, and the good of thy Fellow Creatures, and which most exalts Innocency and Well-doing, for God will not be Invoked with Lip-service only, and outward Ceremonies, most of which hides the purer Pearl in the Rubbish of Formality and Hypocrisie.</p>
               <p n="320">320. Above all things entertain and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish good Thoughts, for serious Thoughts and Meditations concerning our holy Creator are fed and increased by Divine Power and Understanding, and kindles the Life of Love, so that it longeth, and continually hungreth after God, and the teachings of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="321">321. Christ is the true Touchstone to the knowledge of things Divine, and the Corner Stone to all Spiritual Buildings, consider therefore in all thy ways whether thy Words and Actions do enter out of Love into Love, and whether the Peace of God which passeth all Understanding be sought and desired.</p>
               <p n="322">322. Remember that all Strife about the Divine Will of God, whereby Men do despise one another, though it may cover it self with a Mantle of Zeal, doth yet in truth proceed from Self-hood and Pride, for the Wrath of

Man worketh not the Righteousness of God.</p>
               <p n="323">323. Such Disputations and Contentions do generally, or for the most part, arise from outward Reasonings, vain Imaginations, and Custom, for if Men dwelleth in Innocency, and willeth with his Creator, what need he dispute about that which he enjoys and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth.</p>
               <p n="324">324. Men ought in friendly sort to confer together, and offer one another their Gifts and refined Knowledge in Love, to try all things, and hold fast that which is good, and not to stand so stiff in their own Opinions as if they could not Err.</p>
               <p n="325">325. Man ought to consider what a mighty strong Enemy he hath within himself, which continually suggesteth strange Thoughts and Apprehensions concerning God and his Will, which often occasions Men to insult over one another, whence Sects, Parties, and Factions about Religious Matters do arise.</p>
               <p n="326">326. He that contends furiously about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 'tis to be feared has no true Religion at all, and that will force others to bow to his poor narrow Thoughts, touching such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Mysteries, gives a great sign, that he neither knows God, Nature, nor himself, nor has felt the Operation of the Divine Dove like Spirit of Peace in his Mind.</p>

               <p n="328">328. Remember also that all such Strife and Alterations about the Testaments of Christ do arise in Mans Heart for want of Love, and the Divine sight or skill in the Heavenly Mysteries, which cannot be any otherwise obtained but only by turning the Will and Thoughts unto God by Temperance and Self-denial, Innocency, and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the true Eye-salve that clears the inward sight of the Understanding.</p>

As the great Eye of the Material World or Sun doth with its glorious friendly Beams and sweet Influences penetrate all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Things and Bodies, and fills them with its good Vertues, whereby they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, grow, and increase, and become useful and most pleasant; The like, but in a more sublime and mysterious manner, is to be understood of the holy Spirit and Light of Jesus Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> he animateth, cherishes, and governs all that doth resign their Wills unto his Sovereign Government over both Soul and Body, and all Evil Inclinations, and by its friendly and gracious Influences makes them grow and become pleasant Fruit in the Paradise of God, and a right Branch

on the good Vine, in which Heavenly State God and Man are united, and God dwells in this Spiritualized Man, as the Sun dwelleth by its Influences in Fruits and Plants, and maketh them fragrant and ripe for glory.</p>
               <p n="330">330. For as the Material Heavens and Caelestial Bodies do by their Influences pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this gross lower World, and all things therein, giving them vertue and power, so Christ penetrates the Converted Soul by his inward ruling power, and resisteth the vain Lusts, Wrath, Violence, and all other Evils that the Earthly Man is subject to.</p>
               <p n="331">331. A Christian in all his ways must have three Guides, Truth, Charity, and Wisdom, Truth to go before him, Charity and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on either side, if any of the three be absent, he wanders out of the way or stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; You shall see some do hurt by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even Truths uncharitably, and others, whilst they would salve up a dangerous Error, with Love, have failed in their Wisdom, and offended against Justice: A Charitable Untruth, and an Uncharitable Truth, and an unwise management of Truth or Love are all to be avoided by him that would go with a right foot in the narrow way.</p>
               <p n="332">332. Of making many Books, there is no end, saith the Wise Man, but above all others Books of Quarrels and Controversies are apt to have no end for number, as well as no good end or scope and effect upon either the Writers or the Readers.</p>

               <p n="334">334. Such violent Contemners works, as for the most part they begin their Clamors without cause, so they manage them without either Reason or Charity, every Mote in their Antagonist is a Beam, every misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretable though innocent Expression, Heresie or Blasphemy against Holy Scripture, or a Doctrine of Devils.</p>
               <p n="335">335. On the contrary, every Argument or Text they themselves use, though never so miserably wrested, is invincible like the Sword of <hi>Goliah,</hi> there is none like it; Thus they please themselves, and seek not Truth, but the Triumph of a supposed Victory.</p>
               <p n="336">336. The great art and too common practise of these Book-worms, these Gnawers of other Mens harmless Papers, is to pass over and neglect what they cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is good, and fit to be put in practice in a Mans Writings, and to hunt and lie at catch for someting that may admit of a quarrel, or be rendred odious to the People, as being contrary to their common Customs and Apprehensions; Thus like some sort of troublesom Flies, they delight on Sores and Ulcers, and if they cannot find faults, will make them.</p>

Christianity is an easie Yoke, and a hard one, easie to bear when once taken up in good earnest, and once accustomed to it, but the Heart requires much labour e're it can be induced to stoop under it, yet finds as much Contentment when it hath stooped; Men are apt to think Religion se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,

               <p n="351">351. The Proud Man hath no God, the Envious Man hath no Neighbour, the Angry Man hath not himself; now what can that Man have that hath not himself, or what is a Man the better if he have himself and wants all others, or what is he the nearer if he have himself and others, and yet want God; or in fine, what boots it me to be a Man, if I be either Wrathful, Proud, or Envious?</p>

Even the best Things ill used becomes Evil, and on the other side, the worst Things used well turns to Good, a good Tongue used to Deceit, a good Wife used to defend Errors, a strong Arm to Murther, Authority to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, a good Profession to Dissemble and Cheat, People are all Evil contrariwise, (as Poysons may in wholsome Medicines) Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Sins by a good use, proves of great Advantage.</p>
               <p n="354">354. There is nothing more easie than Lipp Divinity, and Breath Religion, to discourse of Spiritual Matters from the Tongue of others, but to hear it spoke from the Soul, &amp; to feel the

Power of Religion in our Hearts, subduing our Affections, and mortifying our Lusts, and to express it out of the Truth of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, is both rare and hard; and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this the other is nothing worth, but will rather increase our Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="355">355. The Soul of Man through Evil and Disobedience has broken it self off from Gods Holy Will, whence Darkness, and all Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth overwhelm him, and seperate him from that Equallity and Temperature he was made to live in, and so becomes Blind as to God and Virtue.</p>

and Beastial Dispositions, are all according to their radix, so that they enjoy as much Delight and Pleasure as the more clean and tractable Animals do.</p>
               <p n="359">359. But still the very sight and looks of these fierce Creatures are a terrour to the more gentle and friendly Natures of clean Beasts; so that what is an evil or terrour to one thing, is the cause of Delight and Joy to another, for every Creatures highest Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction consists in its living, and continuing in the Power and Operation of that Principle, wherein it was originally made or brought forth.</p>

The same is to be understood of the fallen Angels, their Evil and Misery, is, that they have through Pride, Envy, and evil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, immers'd themselves into another Principle than what they were made; for they were formed by the Divine Powers, to live in the light and love of God, Fierceness, and Pride was not manifest in their first State, therefore Wrath and Darkness is their Pain and Torment.</p>

               <p n="365">365. But all Men in the World do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glorifie God, either in his Love or Anger, according to what Principle they live in: For, (as the Apostle saith) The Sober and Virtuous are a sweet savour unto the Lord of Peace, in the Holy Power of his Kingdom of Love and Light; and on the other side, the Wicked are a savour of Death in the Kingdom of Wrath, Fierceness, and Eternal Woe.</p>

Souls, nor does it concern the Temporal State of this World, how Men do Worship their Maker, provided they yield Obedience to the Civil Laws of their Country, and pay their Tribute, and live innocent, sober Lives, for such Subjects are so far from being dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Governments, that they are the grand preservers of the Peace and Happiness of those Countries wherein they live.</p>
               <p n="367">367. Man knows very little of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Work of God in the outward visible Nature, but much less of the invisible Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spiritual Kingdom, from whence all the external Forms, Figures, Shapes, Bodies, and Virtues proceed.</p>
               <p n="368">368. He that is Angry, or Contends with his Brother about outward Forms and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in Religion, provided Men be Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and fear the Lord, does really fight and contend with their great Creator, who hath made all Men and all Things to differ and vary in their Colours, Shapes, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Dispositions.</p>
               <p n="369">369. Consider what great Impressions, and almost invinceable Prejudices, Education, and the Modes of Countries or Places, do make in the Hearts and Souls of Men, so that what is esteemed a great Evil in one Country, is not in another; nay, especial Evils comes to be esteemed no Evils at all, especially in such as are not govern'd by the in-shining and in-dwelling Light of Jesus Christ.</p>

               <p n="371">371. Know therefore, and conclude for certain, that Disputations and Contendings, Revilings and Persecuting of others, because they cannot see, or believe as thou dost, or wouldst have them, do arise from Self-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, where the properties of Nature are at enmity with each other, and are contrary to Reason and Nature.</p>
               <p n="372">372. It is a Virtue well worthy of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for Men to remove and put away all such Things as may at any time give occasion for Wrath, or evil Words, vehement Passions, or cruel Deeds, as all Rich Meats and Drinks, costly Garments, and Houshold-Stuff, and the like which being by Servants imbezled and spoiled, administers occasions unto many Evils both in Words and Works.</p>

               <p n="377">377.

Let Passionate and Chollerick Men, when they are in a composed frame of Spirit, and the Light of Understanding shines and bares rules in their Souls, oblige themselves by secret Promises, that by permission of the Lord, when ever they shall find themselves moved to Wrath or Passion, then the better to prevent such outrages against God and their own Souls, they will withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of Company, read a Chapter in the Bible, or stand still in silence for one quarter of an Hour, in which time the light of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will arise in their Hearts and Souls, and dissipate, allay, or moderate the Fumes of these Perturbations and irregular Motions.</p>

let them resolve to drink small Drink or Water; use a spare Diet, and Eat mean and simple Foods, practise proper Exercises and Labour, rise early in the Morning, resist vain and idle Imaginations, as soon as they offer themselves to the Mind; and above all keep virtuous Men Company, and refrain as much as in them lies, the conversation of such Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as are subject to Lewdness.</p>
               <p n="386">386. There is no Man by his Birth, or his Estate, priviledged to be idle, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is Universal to all the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the sweat of thy Brows thou shalt Eat thy Bread, and he that will not labour in some kind or other for the good of Mankind is not worthy to Eat or Live; therefore let all Gentlemen, who too generally subject themselves to an idle Life, (that proves an in-let to many other erronious Evils) know that they have no exemption or excuse from proper Exercises, and useful Labours in the fight of the Lord.</p>

Some may suppose this to be but a mere Fancy, because we see them not, but let such consider, that the adorable Creator that has made all these wonderful Things we behold, hath created many more wonderful Beings in the intellectual internal World, of which this outward is but a Similitude, and the reason why we cannot comprehend, or see the Angels, is because our outward Eyes are Earthy, and not sublime enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Spiritual Essences, every Eye sees no farther then into its own radix.</p>

And therefore in time of Sleep, when the outward gross Sences and Properties are stilled, or as a Man may properly say, Dead, then the good Genius and Holy Angels have more freer recourse and communication with the Soul and Intellects, and does reveal and foretell wonderful Things in Dreams, which when the Body and Sences are awake, they cannot do, because their gross and external Eliments and Sences are powerful, and do predominate and hide the intellectual Pearl.</p>
               <p n="394">394. Nothing is a greater Magnet to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract good Angels, and the communication of pure Spirits, then Innocency and the Child-like Nature; therefore it is said by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Children, Their Angels behold that Face of the Father.</p>
               <p n="395">395. It was a witty and true Speech of the obscure Philosopher <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> that all Men awake are in one common World, but when we sleep, each Man goes into a several World by himself, which thô it be but a World of Fancies, as to the outward Eliments and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; nevertheless, it is the true Image of the Little World, which is in every Mans Heart, for the Imaginations when the Sences are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, do not only shew the present State of each Man's Soul, and what Property do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the upper Dominion, but also what our Dispositions, Complexions, and Inclinations are waking, and as many in their Dreams reveal those their Secrets to others, which they would never have done awake, so all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102588:38"/>
may, and do discover to themselves in their Sleep, those Secret Inclinations, which after much searching, they could not have found out waking, therefore we need not doubt, but as God heretofore hath taught future things in Dreams, so still he teacheth the present estate of the Heart; this way, some Dreams, 'tis true, are from our Selves, vain and idle like our selves; others are Divine, which teach us Good, or moves us to Good, and others Devilish which sollicits us to Evil, for Man is fall'n into the Good and Evil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therefore let the Night teach us what we are, and the Day what we should be, so shall neither Night nor Day be spent unprofitably.</p>
               <p n="396">396. Entertain Innocency, and be not weary of well-doing, but daily endeavour to increase in Self-denial, Abstemiousness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Temperance, and Purity, and to moderate the fierce, wrathful Spirit, by the Lambs Nature, for light and darkness are near unto every Man.</p>
               <p n="397">397. The evil Nature and wrathful Spirit cannot be any otherwise overcome, but by the sweet, friendly Nature, and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the love and light of God in Jesus Christ; for nothing can make the Wrath of the Father to bow, but only the inshining light and satisfaction of the Son.</p>
               <p n="398">398. But when Man gives himself up into the intire government of the Divine Principle; or Gospel of the Son of God, then is fulfilled that of <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>the Wolf and the

All immoderations are Enemies as to Health, so to Peace; he that desires more, wants as much as he that has nothing, the Drunken-man is as Thirsty as the Sweating Traveller, settle therefore thy Mind in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the worthlessness of all outward Things, hanker not after that which it may be thou canst never obtain, and art sure not long to enjoy.</p>

A sincere Christian, for the sweet Fruit he bares to God and Man, is compared to the noblest of all Plants, (the Vine) now, as the most generous Vine, if it be not Pruned, runs out into many superfluous Branches, and are apt, like <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, to wax wanton if not cut short of their Desires, and Pruned with Afflictions; if it be Painful to Bleed, 'tis worse to Wither; 'tis better we should be Pruned to grow, then cut up to burn.</p>

               <p n="492">492. Remember, and let it be one principal point of thy unfeigned Religion, to desire no more of the things belonging to the Body than is needful and natural, for whatsoever is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouds the Intellectual powers of the Souls spirit, for the Essences of all our Meats and Drinks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts not from us, but becomes Essential, as is mentioned before.</p>
               <p n="493">493. The true Religion is for a Man to know God in the Center of his Heart, and to obey the Voice of Wisdom, and regulate himself in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward things.</p>
               <p n="494">494. The Life of a true Christian is to depart from all Intemperance, superfluity, uncleanness in Meats, Drinks, Cloathing, Imployments, and Communication, and to withdraw into loneness and Silence, and to will as God his Guide wills.</p>
               <p n="495">495. And remember that he that lives as he ought needs but a few things, and those easie to be procured, a small Cottage, a little Garden, a Spade, Corn, and Water, white Garments, a little Wood, a Straw-Bed, which are the most useful and necessary, and will support Nature to the highest degree, and a little labour and less care will procure them.</p>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:102588:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>496. Straw-Hats will serve instead of Beavors and Castors.</p>
               <p n="497">497. Wooden Shooes instead of Leather, for their Journeys are but small.</p>
               <p n="498">498. White Linnen and Woollen instead of rich Colours, for there is no need of rich Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to cover the outside, when the inside is arrayed with Virtue.</p>
               <p n="499">499. The Fire of Wood supplies the want of Candles made of the Fat of the Beasts, no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enters into their Tents.</p>
               <p n="500">500. A little Corn and a few Herbs do boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully supply Nature with both drie and moist nourishment to full satisfaction, there is no need of the trading with Butchers.</p>
               <p n="501">501. A few Vessels serves, their Drinks is brued to their Hands by the preserver of the World. A piece of Bread and a spoonful of Oatmeal or Flower mixed with a pint of Spring Water makes a Breakfast or a good Supper.</p>
               <p n="502">502. Milk as it comes from the Cow is highly esteemed, and counted great Food, being eaten with good Bread, there is but little need of Butter, and less of Cheese.</p>
               <p n="503">503. Bread, Water, and Flower, without any farther preparation, Bread and Milk, Herbs and Bread, Fruit and Bread, are the most useful and necessary Foods, which are ready at hand, and may be obtained by every one with little labour of Body, or trouble of Mind.</p>
               <p n="504">504. All Men ought to consider, that the chief cause of all Diseases and Unhealthiness to young and old, is for want of Government and Wisdom, and the desiring those things that are out of the ways of simple Nature.</p>
               <p n="505">505. There are not many Diseases where Men walk in Natures Path, and avoid Compositions, and as much as in them lies fiery Preparations.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:102588:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>506. The more Men imitates Nature the nearer they come to their first State of Innocency, and thereby obtain Health of Body and vigor of Mind.</p>
               <p n="507">507. An Example of this we have in all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals or Beasts who continue in that pure Law they were made in, and placed under, how Healthy most of them are when Men do not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them otherwise by Oppression and Disorders.</p>
               <p n="508">508. Keep therefore O Man unto thy Heavenly Guide that the Lord hath placed in the very Center of thy Heart, turn thy Eyes inward, and learn Wisdom, this Divine Spark, and holy Son of Light, if obeyed in the Life thereof, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily shew and teach Man all things both for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human that are necessary for this Life and that which is to come.</p>

Study thy self, for that worthy thing in thee cannot be known, nor its Voice distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other Voices, but only by Self-denial, Sobriety, and Cleanness, in the practise of Silence, alone leaning on the Shoulders of none but only thy beloved Jesus.</p>
               <p n="510">510. Remember that the true pleasure of Temperance, and the many benefits that follow Sobriety, cannot be imagined by those that lives Riotous Lives, so neither can the sweet Influences thereof be enjoyed without self-denial, and some trouble to old <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="511">511. If thou wilt know God, and the sweet Influences of his good Spirit in thy own Soul, then thou must live as it were alone, for there is but little Company in the ways of Virtue and Self-denial.</p>
               <p n="512">512. There is nothing does make Men more sensible of Gods Blessings then Temperance, and Cleanness in Meats, Drinks, Imployments, and Communications.</p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102588:47"/>513. How ready are the sober of Mind to give the Lord Thanks for his Mercies, and how sweet is every mean thing.</p>
               <p n="514">514. Temperance is endued with Divine Power, it fits the Mind for the Worship of God, their Beds are easie, their sleep sound, not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Indispositions, nor molested with Fevers, their Heads are not dulled with Fumes, nor their Stomachs oppressed with fainting Fits, or windy griping Humours, they rise as fresh as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun, and are fit for the Exercises both of the Body and Mind, their Radical moisture flowes freely through every part, like a pleasant Gale of Wind which moderates the Centeral Fires that they burn not too violently: This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent State of Body and Mind is not attainable without the fear of the Lord, and self denial, which are the first steps to all true Wisdom both Spiritual and Natural.</p>

               <p n="17">17. Intemperance wounds the Body with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and the Soul with Ignorance and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, perpetually perplexing the latter with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Desires, and the former with needless Toils.</p>

               <p n="19">19. Intemperance is the Original of all evil and vain Imaginations, it makes Men turn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and imbroils the World with Plots and Wars, that they may gratifie their own unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lusts.</p>

               <p n="22">22. Intemperance makes Men more unnatural than the worst savage Brutes, for they often get Children in the heat of Lust and Drunkenness, and then suffer both Mother and Child, either to perish or go a begging.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Intemperance causes Men to Blaspheme their Creator, and is the root of Covetousness, Murders, Pride, Vain-glory, and every evil Word and Work.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Intemperance renders the Body a sink of Diseases, the Mind a Cage of unclean Thoughts, banishes all good Meditations, and makes People Desolute and Vile.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Intemperance causes those of the Female Sex to turn common Prostitutes, or makes them Rude, Bold, Surly and Inhuman, for it destroys their curious friendly Human Nature, and fits them for hard slavish Imployments, which do ill become their Delicate Shapes, and loving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate Complexions.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Then <hi>Cain</hi> was Wrath, and his Countenance fell, which does further denote, that the angry Principle predominates in the Lifes Center, then the Lord said, <hi>Why art thou Wrath, and thy Countenance fallen, if thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted,</hi> which does sufficiently intimate, that <hi>Cain</hi>'s Offering was not Corn of Wine, or any of the common Fruits of the outward Principle, which in themselves are innocent and harmless, but rather of evil uncircumcised Works, which were not, nor never will be acceptable to the Lord of Love and Innocency.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then <hi>Cain</hi> rose up (that is, he elevated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the fierce, harsh wrath) as he was in the Field, (that is in the will'd Nature) and flew his Brother <hi>Abel, viz.</hi> the innocent Divine Principle, which the wrathful, harsh, fierce property does still Slay and Murder, in the Hearts of all <hi>Cain</hi>'s Children.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi> adds further, that after <hi>Cain</hi> had slain his innocent Brother, <hi>He departed from the presence of the Lord,</hi> which could not be as the great Creator is understood in the two grand Principles of Love and Anger, because he is the Life, the being of all Beings, and in every thing, but <hi>Cain</hi> departed out of the presence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine innocent Principle of Love and Light, and went into the Land of <hi>Nod</hi>; that is, took up his Habitation in the wrathful, fierce, earthy proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and built a City; that is, he grew strong and powerful in the inward and outward Principles
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102588:50"/>
of Wrath, and became a great Lord and Master in all Inventions of Building of Cities, Trading by Sea, Violences, Oppressions, and most apt in the use of all killing and warlike Weapons; for from this <hi>Cain</hi>-like fierce Spirit, do proceed all the great Oppressions and Murthers that are common unto Mankind, and always did, does, and ever will endeavour to domineer over innocent <hi>Abel,</hi> or the principle of Love and Meakness, and to keep the whole Earth in Bondage.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It would be but a symtome of Vanity or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norence, grosly to conceive that <hi>Cain</hi> offered Corn, Oyl, or other external Fruits, or that <hi>Abel</hi> brought Sheep, Lambs, Calves, or the Fat of them; their Offerings were the living Powers of their Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> evil and good Works; the first were <hi>Cain</hi>'s producing from the harsh, earthy, fierce, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Principles that had the Government in him; the latter, were <hi>Abel</hi>'s flowing from the Divine innocent Fountain, and each was received of each, that is the Holy Fountain of Light and Love, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering by simile, and it was a sweet savour thereunto, as springing from the same Root; as on the other side, <hi>Cain</hi>'s was swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of the harsh, wrathful Principle by sympathy, having the same basis, but the Kingdom of Love could not accept his Offering, because the same was an Abomination unto it; nothing is wellcome there but well-doing, that is, innocency and good Works, which makes up the main of true Religion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Men cannot see and distinguish the Spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> in themselves, except they first come to discern and know themselves, by, and through Obedience to the Voice of VVisdom, which gives a true Sight and Understanding: All that the Lord requires of the Children of Men, is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102588:51"/>
to walk in his Law of Love, and do unto all as they would be done unto; the first step unto which sublime State, is for every one to know himself, and to distinguish the voice of <hi>Cain</hi> from that of <hi>Abel,</hi> which are essentially in every Man.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

FRom the Kingdom of <hi>Cain</hi> joined with the outward Principle of this World, that is, from the first and 3d Principles does proceed and arise most Arts and Inventions, and not from the Nature of <hi>Abel</hi> or second Principle of Gods Love, which therefore we find complaining, that Man was made Upright, but had sought out many Inventions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may easily be observed, that most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions or curious Arts in Man do proceed from an ill Ground or Root, <hi>viz.</hi> from the high, proud, fierce Principle; this is manifest in the generality of Arts and new Inventions that are brought to light in our times, and the same is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood from the beginning, else the Lord had not complained of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Few and easie are the things that serve for the support of Humane Nature, and to supply its Necessities, as plain Plowing, keeping of Sheep, and the like, which every Man is taught by his Natural Genious or Instinct, without being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to a Master of Art, but on the contrary, those innumerable Arts, and needless Inventions, that stand Man in no stead, but lead him to vanity and evil, are very hard, difficult, and chargeable to be obtained, and if any of such Inventions do chance in some respect to assist Man, it was not the intention of the Inventor so much fixt on the general Good, as on Ambition, Covetousness, and the like, that he might get Money by it, be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed Famous, and have the Praise of Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you Read over <hi>Polidore, Virgil,</hi> Books of the Inventions of things; or <hi>Paucicolus,</hi> of things lost and found; or were it possible to number up

all the Inventions since the beginning of the World, there will not perhaps appear one of a thousand that was needful, or indeed beneficial unto Mankind, and clear of Evil in the Root.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore <hi>Cain</hi> is mentioned to be the first that built a City, as signifying, that he was the Father of needless and harmful Inventions, which Cities and great Towns have chiefly applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto, for nice Inventions and superfluous Arts are not promoted amongst Plowmen and Sheepherds, for they are plain down-right, or rather upright honest Men, and imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves equally Innocent and Necessary; thus were all the holy Patriarchs, plain simple Herdsmen and Sheepherds, in whom was contained the Royal Line of the Divine Principle, or holy Seed of the Woman, that can bruise the Head of the Inventions, or Serpentine Nature, as <hi>Abel, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>; and at the Manifestation or Birth of Jesus, the Grand Shepherd of Souls, the same was first proclaimed by the Angels to those that were innocently tending their Flocks.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Not to insist on those black Arts which are generally decried, as Negromancy, Conjuring, the Skill of mixing and preparing Poysons, and the like; What do most of the rest and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Crafts tend unto, but either Violence, Oppression, and the Destruction of Men, or to fraud and Cousenage, or to Gluttony, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Luxury, and Effeminacy, or to Pride and Vanity?</p>
               <p n="7">7.

Did not all such things originally arise from the Bottomless Pit, that deep dark poysonous Abyss of Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Wrath? And still from the same horrid Fountain do proceed all new Inventions that tend to the Destruction of Man, wherein it may be observed, that Christians have been more unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily Ingenious than those they call Heathens, which is much to be lamented, though the latter have so far learnt of them, that now they are grown no less expert in the mischievous uses of those Inventions, and not seldom do therewith plague and destroy the Original Authors.</p>

AS a Medicine drives its Qualities from the Ingrediencies, as a Building is weak or strong, according to the proportion of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials and good Workmanship in joyning them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: So Meats and Drinks, whereby Men are nourished and sustained in this mortal State, have a far greater Influence and Operation, not only on the outward Body and Senses, but also on the Intellectual Faculties, or Soul, than the vulgar does imagine, for the Spirit makes all things Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bread being the equallest a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Bread was the principal Food the Creator ordained for Man, after the Fall, it having the first place before all other Foods, therefore the Lord said, <hi>In the sweat of thy Brows thou shalt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102588:55"/>
eat thy Bread</hi>; for all other things that Man needs to feed on, can be prepared without Labour, or with very little, as Herbs, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there goes considerable pains to the procuring of Bread; and hence too we are taught to Pray for our Daily Bread, as including under that Name, all things necessary for the support of Human Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Outward cleanness in Meats, Drinks, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exercises, is of great use, and prevents, and as it were, cuts off in the bud many Diseases and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, both from the Body and Mind; therefore the Light of the Gospel, or Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple makes that part of <hi>Moses</hi> Law touching Cleanness Essential, when it opens its self in the Center of Man's Heart, and it is a Ceremony to none, but such as are ignorant of Gods Law, and the Sympathetical Operations.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Frequent Bathing, or Washing in pure Running Water, is highly convenient for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, especially after easing themselves, for the same will in a great measure prevent the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Diseases of the Fundament, some of which are incurable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be careful that you do not sit on Common house of Easement, which oftentimes proves of evil consequence, and infects the Party with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases of various kinds, according to each Mans Constitution or Complexion; therefore those in Cities that would avoid such Dangers, ought to ease themselves in a vessel of Water, and when the Excrement is cold, then to put it into the House of Office, particular Reasons in Nature I have shewn elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Have a care of Compositions, use and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, Simplicity; for Wisdom. In the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Food, preserve Unity, that is, prepare but one thing at a time, for things of differing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p n="8">8. Flesh and Herbs, Roots and Puddings, are not to be prepared together in one Vessel, but each alone, because of their different Nature, and times of preparation, for Water, after it hath boiled an hour, more or less, will not prepare any sort of Food to that degree of Excellency as at first.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The chief occasion why Mankind is so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to frequent Fevers, is the variety of Foods, improperly compounded, especially the common eating of Flesh and Fish; As also, Butter, Cheese, and the use of strong Drinks, for always fat Foods do fur the Stomack, and are hard to be separated, either by the natural heat, or by the Liquor that is drank, especially strong hot Drinks; Water being the proper Minstrim or Liquor for the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; for this Cause, Obstructions and Fevers, as also hot Diseases are so common, and griping Pains and Fluxes; such Meats and Drinks do awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the original fierce Fires.</p>

All Foods proceeding from the vegitable Kingdom are innocent, more equal in there Parts, easily dissolved, affording fine Spirits, therefore those that live chiefly on such innocent Foods, are more airy, pleasant, cool, and full of Delight in Body and Spirit, which none can know or understand, but such as have experienced it for some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time.</p>
               <p n="12">12. All that would prevent Fevers, and many other Diseases, and keep themselves in harmony, should apply themselves to simple Foods, <hi>viz.</hi> Bread, Fruits, Herbs, and the like; forbear all sorts of Flesh, Fish, and eat sparingly of Butter Cheese, and Milk, and eat but little Fat, besides Oil; for this you must always remember, that every thing begets its likeness.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Bread, Herbs, Seeds, Fruits, and most, or indeed all vegetative Foods do represent unto Man the Divine Principle of Light and Love; but Flesh be it of what kind it will, does denote the harsh wrathful Principle, and Mans Desires so much after it, is a true sign that he lives in that harsh, fierce, killing Principle.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For now-a-days, if any Man should be condemned to live only on Bread and Water, and what might be made thereof, he would think himself hardly dealt with, which do demonstrate the high degree of Mans Depravation, and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Divine Vision, or first simple State.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Many of the Holy and Wise Antients have declined and decried the eating of Flesh and Blood, especially of such Creatures as are unclean, and that will eat the Flesh of their Fellow Creatures; but never did any of the Philosophical Men forbid the eating of such harmless things, as Herbs, Bread, and the like, but have recommended

them as most agreeable to Nature and Health.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THE Compositions of sweet fat Foods and Spices, all mixed together, do destroy the innocent ways of Nature, especially when done without understanding the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, clog and obstruct the Stomack, and too much open the Gate of <hi>Venus.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The frequent eating of Flesh and Fish, and such as are Rapacious, mixed with the richest ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getations, do open and manifest the hidden inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Properties of such Flesh and Fish, thereby increasing Lust, and evil beastial Inclinations.</p>

The great quantities of Food, wherewith most People overchange Nature, which do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate superfluity of gross Juices; and if such Foods be from the Animal Kingdom, as Flesh, Fish, Butter, Eggs, Milk, or various sorts of them mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, then they do so much the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Inclinations to <hi>Venus</hi>; for Flesh and Fish
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102588:57"/>
do much more strengthen the Venerial Property, than simple Vegetations, especially when joyned with strong intoxicating Liquors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The frequent, or overmuch drinking of strong fermented Drinks, especially when the Foods are fat, rich, spicy, and succulent, then if there be not great temperance in quantity, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is set into an unnatural Flame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The too frequent visiting the shades of <hi>Venus,</hi> with the before-mentioned Intemperances, do extremely promote to the utter ruin of many thousands; this is the secret Enemy that wounds the bravest Gallant, and strongest Nature, and send them down with Sorrow to the Grave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The common Lying of Men and Women together on hot soft Feather-beds, which do hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Rest, keep the Body too hot, causing many silly Discourses, and sometimes wanton ones, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing <hi>Venus</hi> on both sides, whence proceeds weak Limbs, feeble Joynts, and poor low effeminate Spirits.</p>

These Inconveniencies are much increased by great drinking of strong Spirituous Liquors, which the natural heat of the Stomach does quickly separate, for the spirituous parts of all firmented Liquors are on the wing, and when such Drinks comes into the Stomach, the more pure and volatile spirits thereof do as it were in an instant join and incorporate, and draw them forth, so that in a little time they spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into all the External parts, and cause them to burn with heat, whereby the whole Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes uneasie and disordered.</p>

               <head>Of Foods that are Easie, Innocent, and most Healthy.</head>
               <p n="1">1. ALl Vegetative Foods are not only whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, but easily concocted, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Ferment or Menstruum of the Stomach can with much more facility dissipate, dissolve, and disgest Vegitations, than Flesh or Fish, and the reason is, because the former are not only more innocent and equal in their parts, but more sharp and less Oyley, and withall more Spirituous, 'tis true they are endued with an Oyly Body, but it is as it were a Spirituous Oyl, as it manifest in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Vegitations, in whose preparations, if due care and prudence be not used, both the spirit and also the Oyl will evaporate, and then the thing becomes of no use nor true virtue, the Oyl in all Vegetations being the ponderous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and also is the house or dwelling place of the Volatile spirit, and if any violence be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the spirit, then also the Oyl does with the true spirit become either suffocated or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated; for this very cause all Herbage that has
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102588:59"/>
lost its spirit does neither smell well, nor weigh heavy, for that fragrant smell proceeds from the Essential spirits, and the weight and ponderous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is from the Oyl; the very same is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in all Grains, as Wheat, Barly, Rye, and the like, the true colour also do arise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed both from the Essential spirit and Oyly quality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore all Vegitative Foods, especially such as are made of Corn, as Wheat, Rye, Barly, or the like, are far more agreeable and harmonial than Flesh and Fish, easier of digestion, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a finer, livelier and more brisker spirit, and less phlegm or gross Juices, which the Natural heat and sharp pleasant Minstruum or Runnet of the Stomach can easily digest, and send down into the passages, and so free the Joynts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Body from Inconveniencies: This is manifest by External Operations, for how quickly will Bread dissolve being put into Water, nay the whole dry Corn it self being infused grows soft and tender in a little time, but how long may one infuse Flesh, Fish, Cheese, or Butter, before they dissolve or grow more tender? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Foods do also keep the Body cool and pleasant, preventing Fumes and Vapours from flying into the Head, because such Foods do not generate them, as all fat Victuals does, for their crude, obstructive, phlegmatick Juices that lodge in the Stomach and Vessels, that cause Fumes and Vapours, as also Fevers, for the principal cause that Fevers are so frequent, is that surplusage of matter that proceeds from Intemperance in Foods, both in quantity and quality, for when People over-charge Nature then the digestive faculty cannot make a perfect separation, but the gross Juices does load, stop, and fur the passages, whence
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102588:60"/>
is generated thick Blood and impure Spirits, so that Nature becomes stagnated, which does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately stir up and awaken the Centerial Fires in all parts of the Body, and makes the whole burn with an unnatural heat, uneasie and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom, which is that we call a Fever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore in a special manner after full Meals of Flesh or Fish, or other fat Foods, Men ought to be cautious of drinking too plentifully of strong spirituous Drinks; a cup of good Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to most Constitutions has had far better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to carry off a full Meal of such Foods than strong Liquors, for good Water is endued with a mild friendly quality, of a dissolving, dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating, digestive nature, and therefore help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Concoction better than Spirituous Drinks, as may be gathered from most or all External Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for Water, especially River Water, or Spring Water, such as will Wash, Boil, and Brew well, will dissolve and dissipate hard Coagulated Bodies sooner than strong Drink or Spirits, as Water will dissolve Sugar sooner than Beer, Wine, or Brandy, for in the last especially it will lie a great while before it dissolves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Vegetative Foods affords not only the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most vigorous spirits in the Bodies of either Men or Beasts, but more fine and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, free from the seeds of violence, passion, and inclinations to Beastiality.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For the forementioned Reasons, those that live wholly on Vegitations can drink more strong spirituous Drinks, and with far less prejudice than those that live on Flesh and Fish, for they will not so soon fume up into their Heads, nor so much heat their Bodies, finding their Stomachs free from those Crudities and flatulent Juices, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the others are pestered, and consequently
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102588:60"/>
the digestive Property more powerful, the Drink is presently dispatched, and the grosser parts eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by the Uretors without any let or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, but the case is otherwise in the Stomachs of such as eat Flesh and fat Foods; the truth of this may further appear by Men that do drink much strong Drink after full Meals, such will be made drunk before, and also sick before those that take the like quantity whose Stomachs are rather empty than full, and the latter are in far less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Surfets, it being seldom known that such that are both great Eaters and great Drinkers too, do live long; but on the contrary, great Drinkers that eat but small quantities of Food do often live to old Age; or if a great Eater chance to out-live Youth, they seldom but have the Gout; from all which it follows, that Animal Foods, which are for the most part fat, are nothing so Excellent or Commendable as Vegitations, which none can understand or know, but Doctor Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, talk will not convince any Man, no not Men of the greatest Reasons.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Some will be apt to object and say, that it is nonsence to discourse after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> to affirm that fat Animal Foods, are not so good as poor lean Vegitations and Victuals made thereof, for we see (will they say) that fat things are desired by all or most, and if Flesh be not fat it is counted worth little, because fat is counted to be of a brave healing, nourishing Nature and Operation, and therefore our Nurses endeavour to make sucking Children to take it even against their Stomachs.</p>

And what is your brave Butter and Cheese, but the digested Juice of Grass and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, all dried Grains, as Wheat, Barly, Rye, and many other sorts are endued with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit, and pure Oyl, much finer and freer from grossness and phlegm than Flesh, or the product of Flesh, the Oyl of Grains being as it were vollatile like a Spirit, so that when it comes into the Stomach it is brisk and lively, most easily separated and digested, as being turned into an Unctious substance, from whence the fatness of these Creatures that live on Corn does proceed, which Unctious quality does also contain a bright lofty exhillerating spirit, that makes all such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures so strong, lively, and brisk, that they have no need of the fat either of Flesh or Fish; The very same would happen to Man, if he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himself with Vegitative Foods, and good Drinks made thereof.</p>

Yet according to his own method of Logick, (which is the Art of Reasoning) it is thought se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral undergraduated Animals may fairly put in for a share in that Epethite or Difference; And still what this Reason is, where it exists, and whence it proceeds, (is a Question) 'tis certain it does not unfrequently take up Arms against it self, witness Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> (a Person that might claim as great an interest in that Indowment as most our Age has known) who lays it down as a Maxim, That as oft as Reason is against a Man, (that is against Advantages and Inclinations) so oft would a Man be against Reason; witness also that Prodigy of Wit the late Earl of <hi>R</hi>— who with the highest colour of Reason, wrote a virulent Satyr against Reason it self, endeavouring to expose it as the greatest Plague of Human kind, and which rendred them both more absurd and miserable than the most brutish of Beasts.</p>

Fighting with, and killing not only our own Kind, but all others, seems to be natural, and therefore the highest of Reason with them, for they account those things and practises to be their rights and priviledges, and that God justifies them in doing the Voice of the Fierce Wrath, as Captain <hi>Vratz</hi> the German that was Executed here some years ago for the Murther of Esquire <hi>Thin,</hi> being a little before his Death urg'd with the hainousness of his Crime, and what deep and sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ought to be found in him before he could expect a Pardon from God, he answered, That he knew indeed that killing a Man was always amongst little People counted a great business, but in many Circumstances lookt upon by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality under a far different Aspect, and that he did not doubt but God Almighty would
