            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleaſed to accept this poor rude paper, it is a Meſſenger ſent to tell you good Tydings: We have aſſaulted and taken <hi>Preſton,</hi> a Towne very conſiderable, and which much tends to the advancement of the Publike worke in this County, and ſo not altogether impertinent to the Kingdome. We were about 900, or 1000 Firemen, horſe and foot, and about 600 Bill-men, Halberdiers and Club<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; our march in the night was tedious, eſpecially to many who had marched the night before, and to accommodate us in that, God gave us a faire night, ſuch as had not beene of a ſpace before, yea, and indeed the day forerunning threatned us a very foule night; this was of God: Our men aſſaulted it a little before Sun-riſing, in an houres time they were Maſters of it: It was well fortified with Brick-Walls, outer and inner: Our men (but eſpecially 3 Companies that came from <hi>Mancheſter)</hi> fell on with notable reſolution: Captain <hi>John Booth</hi> ſcaled their walls, bidding his Souldiers either follow him, or give him up; but they forgetting their owne ſafety followed him. The garriſon fought it out ſtoutly, they kept their inner workes with puſh of Pike, and alſo the Breach they kept with their ſwords, which aggravates the matter: We have not loſt above 3 or 4 men (very ſtrange) falling upon them in their Workes; of theirs I ſaw ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead in one ſtreet end at leaſt 5 or 6, beſides other parts of the Towne ſeverall, and many in the houſes not calling for quarter; And as if men muſt have been ſingled out for ſlaughter, wee could ſcarcely have picked out better, the Major (that was reſolute to deſperateneſſe in the Cauſe, that had often times been heard ſweare, <hi>He would fire the Towne ere he gave it up, and begin with his owne houſe)</hi> was ſlain, and that very day he had appointed to conſtrain the well-affected, or to have ſeized on their eſtates, Sir <hi>Gilbert Houghtons</hi> brother a Captain, and a deſperate Papiſt; Mr. <hi>Weſtby</hi> a Phyſitian and a deſperate Papiſt; a Serjeant to the Freehold, that came lately out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a moſt wicked wretch, were of the number of the ſlain: Severall of our men are ſhot, but none mortally, (its notable) many are ſhot in two or three or four ſeverall places, and neither to death, nor dangerouſly: We have taken ſome priſoners of note, Captain <hi>Farrington,</hi> Sir <hi>John Talbots</hi> ſonne, one <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and they ſay, <hi>Anderton</hi> of <hi>Clayton,</hi> if ſo, I aſſure you, he is one of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable men for eſtate, and activity in the County, and many others, with many Arms, and a large part of things juſtly, and by plunder (alas, that that is ſo much lamented, but moſt hard to be prevented,) ſeized on: more priſoners of note, we had been poſſeſſed of, but that honeſt flight reſcued them: The fruit of this deſign is not yet perceived, but will ſhine forth more and more, I am confident: It blocks up the way, that all the North vaſt part of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where were the chief Malignants, and the Cream of the Earls Forces; yea, and indeed, they will come in (I am perſwaded, and partly perceive already) and ſubſcribe to the Propoſitions. So ſoon as matters were ſetled, we ſung praiſes to God in the ſtreets (Sir it was wonderfull to ſee it) the Sun brake forth and ſhined brightly and hot, in the time of the exerciſe, as if it had been Midſummer. Truely Sir, we owe (ſubordinate to God) a great deal to Sir <hi>John Seaton:</hi> Things are artificially and methodically done, paſt what they were before; he is a man of wonderfull care, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied induſtry; onely rather too harſh for our Northern knotty rigged diſpoſitions; had he the meek ſpirit, and ſmooth tongue of S. <hi>M. Sparrow,</hi> he were Peerleſſe, and without parallell, doubtleſſe. Sir I am in haſt, juſt come from <hi>Preſton,</hi> and the Poſte about to take horſe, pardon my rudeneſſe, and brevity; onely, I beſeech you aſſiſt us in praiſes, that we may not looſe God for want of praiſes, and pray for us, that plunder cry not louder for juſtice then prayer for mercy: Remember my love and ſervice to your wife, Farewell is the wiſh of</p>
