            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As for those Medicines published at the latter end of this booke, I shall not desire your protection for them, because I never made you, nor any man acquainted with them, For I intended that they should be Protectors for themselves: but however I hope that my endeavours in this small treatise will not be unpleasant, but acceptable to you, for the good which I believe it will do in the World; and so for this time I rest in some measure of assurance of your worships favour.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>1. What are the causes of the Pestilence. 2. How they are avoided. 3. Meanes to preserve the body from Infection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are divers causes of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease. The first is sin, which ought to be repented of. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond an infected and corrupted air, which should be avoided. The third an evill diet, which should be amended. The fourth are evill humours heaped together in the body, being apt to putrifie, and beget a Fever, which must be taken away by convenient medicines.</p>
               <p>Therefore whosoever would preserve their bodies from infection, let them first make their peace with God, in whose hand is the power of life and death. Then let them use the meanes, and shun all those things that are able to beget this disease, as all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and corrupted aire, all fogges and mists that do arise from the earth or water, and all stinking smels that do arise from dunghills, sinks, graves, carrion, snuffs of candles, or rotten fruits, or any thing else that doth putrifie and stink. Abstain from all meats and drinks that beget rottennesse and filthinesse in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94025:5"/>
the body (&amp; so consequently a Fever or the Plague) as excessive eating of fruits, especially those that are unripe. Also forbear all sorts of fish that have neither scales nor shels, as Eels, Lampreys, and the like. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, take heed of over-charging the stomacke with meats, or drinks, or hot Wines; but especially your unripe medium Wines.</p>
               <p>If any shall find themselves oppressed with gross &amp; corrupt humors, so that they are in danger of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease they shall be cleansed, by taking one ounce and half, or two ounces, of the infusion <hi>Crocus metallorum,</hi> (which is to be bought at every Apothecaries) &amp; put to it <hi>Oximel</hi> half an ounce, this shall give them five or six vomits, and almost as many stooles. And after every vomit, let them drinke some warme posset drinke; so let them keepe themselves warme that day: one houre after it hath done working let them eat a messe of warm broth made with a neck of Mutton, or with such fresh meat as the sick are best able to buy; of which meat let them eat sparingly for the present. Those that are so tender or weakly that they cannot brook this vomit, they may be very well purged from corrupt humours, by taking one or two drams of <hi>pilulae Pestilentiales:</hi> But the poorer sort that cannot goe to this charge, may take instead thereof <hi>Aloes</hi> one dram in the pap of an Apple, stewed Prunes, or else in a little Ale or Beere. This pill, and this <hi>Aloes,</hi> are excellent remedies for women and children, and they are so safe that women with child may take them. After the bodie is purged, it shall be necessary to draw six or eight ounces of bloud from the liver or middle vein of the arme, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be able to sustain the losse of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94025:5"/>Such as have lived temperatly and sparingly, and so consequently are not oppressed with corrupted hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, such shall not need any the asoresaid evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or purgations; but let them shun, as much as they can, all infectious and corrupted aire: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a thing almost impossible in the Citie of <hi>London;</hi> therefore they that are timorous and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full may carry about them the roots of <hi>Enula cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pana,</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> dried or candied, of which they may bite now and then. Also the waters of <hi>Scabies, Angelica,</hi> or <hi>Pimpernell,</hi> are great preservations for children against the Plague, if two spoonfuls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be taken in a morning fasting.</p>

            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. 2.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>1 By what signes you may know whether the sick be infected with the Pestilence. 2 How those signes doe encrease or decrease every day; 3 Whether life or death be likely to ensue; 4 A caveat not to tamper with those that begin to amend of themselves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THose that are infected with the Pestilence, in the beginning or first day thereof, are taken with an extraordinary cold outwardly, and a burning heate inwardly, a great paine and girding about the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, a sluggishnesse and drousinesse of the whole body, a losse of appetite, a bitternesse in the throat, with a desire to vomit, &amp; sometimes they do vomit.</p>
               <p>The disease continuing unto the second and third day, the heate breaketh outwardly, stronger, and stronger, so that there followeth a great paine in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94025:6"/>
head, and a difficulty of breathing, superfluous sleeps, and sometimes superfluous watchings, they grow frantike and light-headed, and they looke very sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly: And if there doth any swelling appear under the eares, armes, cheeks, or groines, and that these signes aforenamed doe begin to cease, Then shall the sick recover immediatly without any medicine, onely give him a plaster or pultesse to ripen the tumour, which must be applyed the next day after the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling appeareth; but give him nothing inwardly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be a warme Caudle, or Ale-brue, or Broth; for for if you give him a vomit or purge, you shall strike the swelling into the noble parts, and the sick shall be in danger of his life: and if you let him bloud, you shall draw the venemous humour from the Soare into the veins, and disperse it with the bloud through the whole body, and thereby destroy the health of the patient, and shorten his life; as it came to passe with a good friend of mine. Also if you give him any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to provoke sweat, you shall restore the Fever again, and so the sicke shall die without redemption; yea, and more miserably, then those that never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, unlesse God be more mercifull unto him; whereof I have had a sorrowfull experience.</p>
               <p>Therefore bee carefull that you doe not tamper with those that do begin to amend: for those very Medicines that are excellently available against any Fevers in the beginning or encrease of them, being given in the declination or recovery, will bring the patient into a Relapse, which is worse then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer disease, and which shall greatly endanger life. For how many have died by the unseasonable taking of Treacle, Mithridate, and other good Medicines?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94025:6"/>
Wherefore I have often said, that a skilfull Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an by watching his time shall doe more with à cup of warme drinke in the cure of the Plague, or any Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, then the ignorant shall do with all the excellent Medicines that are in the Apothecaries Shop.</p>
               <p>Now if the rising doe appear, &amp; that the symptoms or signes aforenamed doe not begin to cease, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encrease, Then shortly after there will appeare some blains or spots, &amp; so death ensueth, unlesse you draw ten or twelve ounces of bloud (according to the strength of the sick) from the liver or middle vein of the arme, on that side where the rising is.</p>
               <p>But if so be that the sicknesse continueth unto the third and fourth day, and the symptomes remaine in their full vigour, then shortly will the spots come forth; and then I know no medicine that can deliver from death, except God be more mercifull to the sick: But only on the third day before the spots ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear it shall be greatly available to give him one of the cordial sweats prescribed in the ensuing Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 3.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>1 Here are prescribed certain approved remedies for the cure of the Pestilence, 2 The order and manner how to use them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHosoever shal perceive their bodies infected with the Plague, let them take on the first day of the sicknesse the vomit, in that order and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it is laid down in the first Chapter. And after it hath done working with them, they shal find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94025:7"/>
as well as ever they were in their lives: for it clenseth the stomack and bowels from al corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which is one of the chiefest causes of the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But if the sick be weak and cannot bear a vomit, it shall be good to give him one dram of the foresaid <hi>pillulae pestilentiales,</hi> or instead thereof one dram of <hi>Aloes,</hi> you may give it either in pill or in potion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the sick can best take it, and in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it let him drink some warm broth.</p>
               <p>But if it be so, that this course hath been neglected the first day, or beyond the time of 24 houres, it will bee in vaine to use it the second day: Yea, it will bee dangerous, seeing that the infection is dispersed by the bloud throughout all the Veines of the bodie. Therefore on the second day of Visitation it shall bee good to draw from the Median Veine of the arme so much bloud as the patient can endure to bleed: and if the sicke hath not gone to the stoole du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his sicknesse, you shall give him either before or after bleeding this Clyster. <hi>Take of Beets, Violet leaves, Burrage, Buglosse, Scabios, of each one handfull, French barley one ounce; boyle all these in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantitie of water untill it be halfe consumed, then strain it, and take three quarters of a pint of the decoction, and put to it of the Electuary of Hierapicra five or sixe drams, oile of Rue one dram, red Sugar one ounce, the yolk of an egge, and a little salt; so make you a Clyster thereof, and administer it bloud warme.</hi> Also you may admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the sick this Clyster. <hi>Boyle an handfull of Rue, in a pint of posset drinke, and put to it a piece of sweet butter, a little honey, the yolke of an egge, and a thimble full of salt; make a clyster and administer it bloud warme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if that the sick amend not upon this course ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94025:7"/>
the second day, or that this means hath not been used, but that hee continueth sick untill the third and fourth day, so that the infection hath taken hold of the vitall spirits, Then keeping him warme in his bed, you shall use this Cordiall to sweat with all. <hi>Take of the water of Scabios, Burrage, Buglosse, and Angelica, of each halfe an ounce, the Electuary of egges two scruples, or one dram, of Bole Armoniak one scruple, Syrrup of Roses halfe an ounce, make it into a potion,</hi> and let the sick drink it up at once or twice: two or three spoonfuls hereof is sufficient for a child. Or the poorer sort may take two peny-worth of Treacle or Mithridate, in a quarter of a pint of Dragon water. With either of these Medicines you may sweat the sick, untill some tumour doth appeare, or that he commeth to know himselfe amended. For this is the last medicinall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge we have in the cure of the Plague. If you can, keep the sick from drinking and sleeping for the space of three houres untill the medicine hath done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But if you cannot, let the patient drinke a little Limon posset, made with some Marigold flowers, and Harts horn.</p>
               <p>And if signes of amendment doe appeare, doe not take him out of his bed, or let him coole suddenly: But let him sweat on gently of his own accord, for it is natures sweat following the medicine, which will doe him more good than a Kingdome. In this last sweat you may give him some Caudle or Alebrue: &amp; when the sweats begin to cease of themselves, &amp; his skin grows dry and warme, then let him sit up by a good fire; Aire his cloathes, and so let him give God thanks for his life.</p>
               <p>Adde, if any tumour appeare you may ripen it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94025:8"/>
with this Emplaster. <hi>Take six figs, raisins of the Sun stoned half an ounce, salt two drams, honey one ounce, beat them all together, and heat it well with some oile of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill upon the fire, so spread it upon some cloth,</hi> and lay it warm to the tumour, shifting it every twelve houres untill it look with a white head: and when it is ripe, if it be difficult to break, lay to it some Goose dung made warme with some sweet butter or sallet oile; also the root of a white Lilly rosted, with some sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, to which put a piece of sweet butter, &amp; apply it very warm to the soare, But if it will not break with this means, then you must open it with a penknife or lancet; else the corruption will rot the flesh, even to the very bone, and when you have opened it, squeeze out the corruption with your hands, and put into the soare, a tent made with <hi>unguentum basilicon,</hi> or <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum, &amp; mel rosarum,</hi> and lay upon the tent a plaster made with <hi>Diachilon:</hi> Continue your tents untill all the corruption be drawn out, then the plaster of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilon</hi> will cure it perfectly.</p>
               <p>If any that are ancient or weak shall be infected with the Pestilence, it shall not be necessary to give them any purge, vomit, or sweat, or to let them bloud; because they cannot beare the losse of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny spirits as are spent by such evacuations. Therefore you may lay upon the pit of the stomack of the sicke a young live puppy, and if the sick can but sleep the space of three or foure houres, they shall recover presently, and the dog shall die of the Plague. This I have known approved; and I do believe that it will be a cure for all leane, spare, and weake bodies both yong and old: provided, that the dog be yonger then the sick.</p>

            <head>Certaine Instructions for the cure of the Small Pox.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He nature of the Smal Pox dispersed this yeer throughout many parts of this Kingdome, I have found to bee more malignant, then any that have reigned in my remembrance; so that many of all ages and sexes, but especially children have miserably died of them: because for the most part, the pestilence is joyned with them, as it doth plainly appeare by those spots, blains, and risings, that follow them. I have likewise observed that those medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as <hi>Mithridate, Treacle, Safforn</hi> and the like, that formerly have cured the small Pox, now availe nothing: yea, they are dangerous, if inwardly taken (especially if the Patient hath been long sick) but if they be outwardly applyed, as I shall shew eft-soons, they will prove good remedies at this time. But how many a tender hearted mother have I seen that, out of an unhappie care of her sicke childe, hath by rash counsel &amp; the unseasonable giving to it hot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall medicines, encreased the Fever, multiplyed the matter of the small pox, and inflamed the Spirits, so that the Pestilence hath many times followed? But howsoever the child harh beene uncurable, which otherwise if nothing at all, or else some small thing of little strength, had been administred, might have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94025:9"/>
recovered; whereupon I observed the sundry ways and meanes practised by Physitians, women, and my selfe, and seeing the diverse events of them, I labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to find out a certain and secure way for the cure of this disease; which having found by experience I have (together with this treatise of the Plague) sent it to the Presse, hoping that no man will either hate mee, or envie mee, for doing good, and that those that find benefit by it will thank me for it.</p>
            <p>The Primitive or externall causes of the Small Pox are all one with those which are of the Plague, as an evill and corrupted aire, a disorderly dyet, that begets surfets; as also for the antecedent causes which are corrupt humours heaped together in the body: therefore those meanes that I have prescribed in the first Chapter to preserve the bodie from the infection of the Plague, they will also bee a meanes to preserve from the Small Pox. Those that are taken sick this yeere with the Small Pox are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after the same manner as those that are infected with the pestilence, &amp; in the beginning it can scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discerned by an expert Physitian from it, But only by these signes.</p>
            <p>Those that are infected by the small Pox are not so violently affected with heat and cold, nor pains in the stomack and head, as those that are sick with the Pestilence,</p>
            <p>Moreover, those that will have the small Pox their skin is puft up, and blown like a bladder, so that their face and eyes doe shine: they have a great itching in many parts of their bodies, but chiefly about their Nose; they yawn much, also they finde a great paine and heavinesse in their back bone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94025:9"/>Now if you shall perceive by these signes, that the sick will have the small Pox, keep him warm, but not too hot; neither let him take cold; but give him breathing room enough, as he lyeth in his bed: Then lay a plaster of Mithridate or Treacle to the pit of his stomack, and if hee be at mans estate, let him drinke up all this Cordiall by two or three spoonfuls at a time every houre; but if it be a child, the one halfe will be sufficient. <hi>Take of the waters of Roses, Burrage, Buglosse, and Treacle-water, of each an ounce &amp; half, of the syrrup of Limons, and Clove-gilly-flowers of each one ounce, mix them together, and make thereof a potion:</hi> Also the poorer sort may take <hi>Roses, Burrage, Carduus, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold Flowers, and Harts horn, of each a like quantitie, and boyle them in posset drinke, turned with a Limon, or white wine:</hi> for one above twenty yeers of age let him drink three quarters of a pint at severall times, sweetned with Sugar; and for a child halfe the quantitie will suffice. Let the sick sweat gently with either of these Medicines so long as hee can well endure it: for the longer the better; seeing the Medicines of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are no violent sweats; &amp; during the sweat you may give him now and then to quench his thirst a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little Limon posset-drink by it self. If he can you may let him sleep whilst he sweateth. And if hee lie quiet during the sweat, by Gods blessing, within the space of eight or ten houres at the most, he shall find himself finely recovered of his sicknesse. Then give him no more of his Cordial or sweating posset drink, but only of his Limo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-posset drink, if he be thirsty; but let him lie warm in his bed til his skin grow dry, then shortly after the Pox will begin to shew themselves. But they will not bee many although every one of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94025:10"/>
them will be far greater then the small Pox do use to be; yet none of them will pit except they be much tampered withal, or picked with the nails. But if so be that those which have white heads do burn and rage extreamly, you may prick their heads with a Needle and let out the corruption: there is nothing else to be done with those upon whom they are come out, and the Fever abated but that they keepe themselves warm, sit still and be quiet.</p>
            <p>But if that the sick hath not gone to stool in a long time: before you give him this Cordiall to sweat, you shall cause him to goe to stoole by a clyster, or else which is better by a Suppositor made with Honey and Salt, or a Violet Comfit. And if the sicke bee yong, strong, and full of bloud, you shall without danger doe very well, if you draw from him eight or ten ounces of bloud before you lay him to sweat; for then the Cordiall will have more power, room, and liberty, to play upon the disease, and will the sooner and better drive out the Pox. If the <hi>quintessentia vitae</hi> be given in the waters of Roses, Burrage, or Buglosse, it will drive out the small Pox without sweating, and cure the sick immediatly.</p>
            <p>But if the small Pox be come forth, and that the Fever continue in his full vigour still, so that the sick doth not amend, but grow worse and worse, then you shall not give them any hot Medicines inwardly, nor any thing that doth provoke sweat; for now hot cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall Medicines will encrease the Fever (and in the beginning they would have quenched the Fever) and turn all the humours of the body into the matter of the small Pox; so that there is nothing but a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death likely to follow, oftentimes accompanied with the Pestilence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94025:10"/>This evill is much practised by those women that prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they wil drive the smal Pox further out, when they are come out already. Wherefore they do but beget the Fever again, and where there are but ten they will make a thousand. Therefore be carefull in this case, what you do, and give to the sick every hower nothing else but two or three spoonefulls of Rose water, sweetened with a little sugar. This will coole the body, quench the Fever, cause rest, and then a stoole, and thereby the sick shall recover pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. By these meanes I have cured many very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly that have been dangerously sick in all mens sight even to Death, as many in the City can beare mee witnesse.</p>
            <p>As I have warned you not to give many hot things when the small Pox are come forth, so I would have you beware of giving those that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold, as the waters of Plantane, Letice, Purslane, Poppy, and the like; which (as I have Knowne) have relieved many for the present, and wrought an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cure in the sight of the common people; but by their cold qualities, they have so congealed and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the humours in the body, that the sick will never be healthfull all the daies of their lives, as I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in many.</p>
