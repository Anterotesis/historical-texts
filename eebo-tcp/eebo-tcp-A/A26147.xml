            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Honourable The Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament Assembled. The Humble Petition of Sir <hi>Robert Atkyns</hi> Knight of the Bath,</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THAT your Petitioner, in the several Publick Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments he hath undergone, hath had more than ordinary occasion of observing the encreasing Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Courts of Equity in this Kingdom, and how the Common-Law (the Birthright of every <hi>Englishman</hi>) hath been, and still is every day more and more invaded by it.</p>
            <p>He hath taken the pains to collect many of those continual complaints from time to time made by the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in Parliament, against the Exercise of that New Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the very beginning of it.</p>
            <p>And your Petitioner hath great reason also, to take notice of the Exercise of the Iurisdiction of Appeals from the Proceedings of those Courts: And humbly presents this Honourable House with what he hath collected, in order to your Service therein.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner craves leave to make use of that freedom which belongs to every <hi>Englishman,</hi> to tender you a Complaint against so publick <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd spreading a Grievance.</p>
            <p>He doth not Appeal, nor complain of any thing that meerly concerns himself: He only subjoins a Case wherein himself was a Party, meerly as an Instance of the large Exercise of a power
<pb facs="tcp:55358:3"/>
against the known and fundamental Rules of the Common-Law, as he conceives.</p>
            <p>That Case of your Petitioner happened very lately in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; But it is generally known in the Courts of <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> That as your Petitioner had occasion, he hath for many years frequently and publickly in his Station enveigh'd against the Encroachments of Courts of Equity, and that late course of Appeals.</p>
            <p>But on the behalf of the whole Kingdom he humbly offers his Service, and lays before You what he hath observed and collected upon this Subject, after near Threescore years Experience.</p>
            <p>And submits All to your Wisdom, to proceed in providing Iust Remedies.</p>
            <closer>
               <hi>And your Petitioner shall ever Pray,</hi> &amp;c.

            <head>OF THE Supreme Jurisdiction IN THE KINGDOM OF ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE House of Lords have a very Ancient and Transcendent Jurisdiction; but it is not Absolute nor Arbitrary in the Exercise of it, nor Universal; and in all Cases it is a Power Limited by Law, and must be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd according to the known Rules of Law.</p>
            <p>And though the Peers are very Great and Honourable, yet they are but Men, and not Infallible; and therefore a Writ of Error lies upon their Judgments: And the Law allows that liberty to the meanest Subject, to demur to the Jurisdiction of any Court whatsoever, even that of the House of Lords.</p>
            <p>Let us Enquire into their Jurisdiction, when it began, and in what Cases they have a Right to it.</p>
            <p>An Eminent Author, suppos'd to be the Late Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> upon occasion of the great Cause between <hi>Skinner</hi> and the <hi>East-India-Company,</hi> (so much disputed between the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament) hath in Print Asserted.</p>
            <p>That the House of Peers hath their Right of Judicature from the beginning of the Nation, <hi>Page</hi> 134.</p>
            <p>He affirms it is a Power Lodged in them by the very Frame and Constitution of the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55358:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>As to the Extent of their Jurisdiction, <hi>Page</hi> 213. he affirms, That they have an undoubted Right to an Universal and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power of taking Conusance of all manner of Causes of what nature soever; and of Judging and Determining of them, if no particular Law do otherwise dispose of them.
<q>
                  <l>Nec Metas rerum, nec tempora ponit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The first of these seems to Entrench very far upon the Regal Power. He not only makes their Power equal in time to it, owning no Derivation from it, but in effect Claims a Co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with it: But the Claim of such an Independent and Original Power, sounds like that which is taken to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar of the Supreme Power, as to the Administration of it, <hi>viz.</hi> In all Causes, and over all Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, he holds that the Peerage sets bounds both to Power and Liberty, <hi>Page</hi> 71. as this Author maintains it. It may easily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood (by what follows) what is meant there by (Power) <hi>viz.</hi> The Regal Administration of it. Whereas the Common-Law of <hi>England,</hi> and all the Authors and Writers of it, do with one Consent acknowledge, Jurisdictions within this Realm are deriv'd from the Crown. And that no Court hath an Absolute and Unlimited Power, save the Supreme Court of the Nation, consisting of the King, Lords, and Commons As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Parliament, and in them indeed is the True Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power under God. But that, according to the different nature of Causes, some are distributed into one Court, and some into another: But not any one Court hath Jurisdiction in all Causes, save that of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And that all Courts must proceed by some certain known Rules, that is, the Courts of the Common-Law, <hi>Secundum legem &amp; consuetudinem Angliae</hi>; And Courts of Equity, according to the ancient and constant Precedents, and Usage.</p>
            <p>But this Court of Peers (for I confine my self still to what is asserted by this Noble Author) doth wholly exclude the King, and ingross all to themselves? No, by no means. He allows the King a single Voice among them, <hi>Page</hi> 145. as a Chief Justice in another Court, whose Voice or Opinion hath no more force than that of a Puisny Judge. No, not so much as a Casting-Voice, where they are <hi>equally divided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall offer to Consideration upon what grounds and proofs this Noble Author doth Entitle the House of Peers to this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55358:4"/>He hath been led into these Opinions, I fear, by some late over-zealous and injudicious Writers, who, out of a too fond and forward Zeal to depress the House of Commons, in the late Exorbitant Power which they took upon them in the late Times, in order (I say) to the decrying of their Usurped Power; those Writers thought they could never sufficiently Exalt the Power of the Lords, to over-ballance that of the Commons.</p>
            <p>And it may perhaps be useful (by the way) to take notice of the strange Revolution that in the late Times happened to the Government of this Nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Kings began first to strain Prerogative too high up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Both the Houses of Parliament thereupon join'd together in Usurping upon the Regal Power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After some short time the late House of Commons, by the help of their Army, laid aside the House of Lords.
<q>
                  <l>(Sic cum sole, perit Syderibus decor.)</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. After some time again a lesser part of the House of Commons exclude the greater part.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And these their own Army over-top, as being but the Fragment of that House.</p>

            <p>These Modern Writers, who are such earnest Advocates for the House of Peers, ascribe to the Lords all that vast Power and Jurisdiction, which they read in our Ancient Histories to be exercised by the National Assemblies in the Times of the old <hi>British, Saxon, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>Thus Writes Mr. <hi>William Pryn,</hi> in his Plea for the Lords and House of Peers, <hi>Page</hi> 164. That the House of Peers had this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Jurisdiction vested in it both in the Times of the <hi>Brittish, Saxon, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings; and other Modern Writers Chyme in with him.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is most Evident by our more Ancient and most Judicious Authors, and Antiquaries, That the great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies which were convened in Ancient Times here in <hi>England,</hi> were quite of another Constitution and Complexion from the now Two Houses of Parliament, and had no resemblance to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55358:5"/>It was in those Ancient Times but one great and numerous Assembly that met: Not distinguish'd either by those several Terms of Lords and Commons; or by Two Houses, the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the Lower, nor by any other dividing Titles.</p>
            <p>Those great Assemblies had under our several Kings, and together with them, the whole Legislative, and Judicial Power, with little distinction to be found in the Exercise of those Two mighty Powers. The Members of them were not qualified neither by any Title of Honour, (though there might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Titles in those Times) but they were qualified and entitled to their Power by their Possessions and Tenures, and some few by certain great Offices.</p>
            <p>This great Assembly could not properly be called The Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of the Nation, (for they came not all to these Assemblies as chosen by the People) but most of them came thither in their own Personal inherent Right, and might more justly be call'd, the Principals of the Nation, and look'd upon as the true Owners and Proprietors of the Nation, accounting the Land-Interest to be the main, and the true, and stable Interest, and might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly be termed, The Nation it self Assembled, or the People Assembled.</p>
            <p>It was the Land-Interest then that gave both Honour and Power. <hi>Dat Census Honores</hi>; yet it cannot be denied, but that the Ancient Boroughs did Elect their Representatives, even in the most Ancient Times, who were at first a small part of these great Assemblies; though now much more numerous, and weigh down the ballance; and this is proved to have been long before the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> though those late Writers date it from that time only.</p>
            <p>It would be folly to undertake to give any clear or large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Supreme Judicatures that were in the Times of the Ancient <hi>Brittons, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> which many of our late Writers pretend to do.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Agricola</hi> tells us of the old <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> that at the time of the coming of the <hi>Romans</hi> into this Land, they did not so much as <hi>in Commune Consulere</hi>; that is, they had no Common-Council, nor did they meet together to Consult how to repel their common danger; but were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into a multitude of Feuds and Factions, under their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guli</hi> or pretty Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rarus duabus tribusve Civitatibus ad propulsandum Commune peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Conventus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55358:5"/>After the <hi>Britons</hi> were wholly subdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> they receiv'd Law and Magistracy from their Conquerors. <hi>Net legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus suis patriis uti permissi sunt</hi> (though it is impli'd, that they had Laws of their own) <hi>Sed Magistratus à populo Romano cum Imperio &amp; securibus missi, qui jus dicerent,</hi> says Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia Page</hi> 48. for which he cites his Authors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons,</hi> who succeeded the <hi>Romans,</hi> divided the Nation into Seven parts, and Constituted the <hi>Heptarchy.</hi> It were in vain to search for an House of Lords, or any one Supreme Judicature all that time for all the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Judicature in those times must be Seven in number, if any; for the Seven were Independent one of the other.</p>
            <p>Most part of the State of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government is so obscure (says our great <hi>Selden</hi>) that we can see only Steps or torn Relicks of them, rather than so much as might give full satisfaction.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing in their times to our purpose, (that is, concerning one Supreme Court of Judicature, to which the whole Nation was subject) it must fall towards the latter end of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times; After <hi>Egbert,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> had reduced the other parts of the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> under his Obedience; when they did <hi>in unum coalescere,</hi> and were all seven melted down into one Mass.</p>
            <p>And after the several Governments and parts were united, though the Government was but One, yet there were Three several and distinct Laws remain'd in force, which had their several Limits and Precincts. See <hi>Lambert, De priscis Anglorum Legibus, Page</hi> 180.</p>
            <p>And these were not meerly some certain different Customs (for so it is to this day in our several Counties; as of <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> and Burrough-<hi>English,</hi> &amp;c. but they were under Three distinct Systems or Bodies of Laws; so that it could not be any way practicable during that time, to have any one great Court of Judicature for the whole Land.</p>
            <p>By which of those Three Laws should that great Judicature have proceeded?</p>
            <p>But after some time those Three different Bodies of Laws were found incompatible with one entire Government, as it came to be at last; and therefore King <hi>Edgar</hi> (a <hi>Saxon</hi> King) out of these Three Bodies of Laws, by the Counsel of his Wise men, Compos'd one great Body of Law to be observ'd by the whole Nation of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> gave new Vigour and Life of this new Body, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards extracted out of those Three Old Bodies of Laws, and are indeed the Fountain and <hi>Materia prima</hi> of that which we now call, <hi>The Common-Law of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55358:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>From these we derive our Trials by Twelve Men, our levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fines of Lands, and the Offices of Sheriff, Coroner, Constable, and many more of our Laws, Customs, and Offices continued amongst us ever since unto this day.</p>
            <p>And these are those good Old Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> which <hi>William</hi> the First (who is stiled the Conqueror) did more than once swear to govern by; which proves him to be indeed <hi>no Conqueror.</hi> And these make up the greatest part of Our <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall mention some few Precedents, in the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> of their Supreme Judicature, and examine what resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance they bear with that used at present amongst us.</p>
            <p>And then I shall give some account of the Supreme Court of Judicature in the beginning of the <hi>Norman</hi> Government during the time of their first Six or Seven Kings; and by the way still examine, how justly any Court now in being, can be said to derive their Power from them, and to Sit and succeed them in their Seat.</p>
            <p>And in the last place, I shall make my Conjecture, how and at what time the <hi>Magnum Concilium in Parliamento,</hi> or the House of Peers, first began to exercise the Supreme Judicature.</p>
            <p>And while I run through the Precedents, and cite my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whoever reads them, may at the same instant make their Observation of these particulars ensuing, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive will evidently result and arise from them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That the Supreme Power of Legislature, and the Supreme Power of Judicature (which yet are distinct things in themselves; for it is one thing, <hi>jus dare,</hi> and another thing, <hi>jus dicere</hi>) both these high Powers (I say) under our several Ancient Kings, resided in one and the same Assembly, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the very same Persons, but with different methods in their way of proceeding, that is, whoever had an hand in the Legislature, was not excluded from the Judicature, wherein it differs from our present Constitution; which is, that the House of Peers, who have but a share in the Legislature, yet now claim to themselves the sole power of Judicature as the last resort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing that I shall observe out of the several Precedents and Authors that I shall mention, is this, That the great Convention and Assembly that anciently had these Two great Powers of Legislature and Judicature, were but one entire great Body and Assembly, not divided into two or more parts, nor distinguish'd (as now) into Two Houses, or by the names of Lords and Commons; but these Powers resided equally in them, <hi>Tota in Toto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55358:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That all, or the far greatest part of the Members of these great Assemblies, came not thither by the choice, or at the will and pleasure of the Prince, as he thought fit to single them out by name, (as Peers are made usually) nor did they all come by Election or Office, though there were some of both those sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Bishops, and the Burgesses of the Burroughs: but the far greatest part came by a certain Right they had to meet in those Assemblies; but what gave them their Right, or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or capacity, so to meet, doth not so clearly appear to an hasty Reader of our History, and Antiquities.</p>
            <p>It is evident, it was not any meer Title of Honour or Dignity; for Anciently in <hi>England</hi> there were not any Dignities but what were also accompanied with Offices, and ceased with the Office.</p>
            <p>But it did proceed from their Lands and Posessions: which as they gave them Honour, so they gave them Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in those Ancient Times. And this they learnt from the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Example was followed herein by most of those Nations that had fallen under their Conquest.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These Assemblies were very great and numerous, far exceeding in number both Houses of Parliament at this day (were they both put together) so that they cannot with any colour of Reason be thought an Assembly of Lords only, (as our Novel Writers would impose upon us;) for it is absurd to think that so great a number should be all Lords, for then there would be none left in the Nation to bear the Character of Commons, save only the <hi>Plebs,</hi> or <hi>Faeces Populi</hi>: And the Title or Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Lords cannot subsist, without a body of some Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors, from whom the Lords may be distinguish'd.
<q>
                  <l>Tolle Relatum, &amp; tollis Correlatum.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Though the Freeholders of the several Counties did not then (as now) meet in those Assemblies by their Representatives duly chosen, so that any Assembly could properly be said to be the Representative of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> (which is much insisted on by our new fort of Authors, who would decry and depress the House of Commons, as being but of yesterday, in comparison with the Antiquity of the House of Lords; that is, but from the Nine and Fortieth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>; whereas the Lords have been (as they affirm) from time immemorial, and co-aeval with the Nation it self; yet (which is more in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Antiquity of the Commons in Parliament) it will appear, that the Freeholders generally met there themselves, (in the great Assemblies then used) in their own proper persons, undistinguish'd by any such Terms of Lords and Commons and all were upon the same level.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55358:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>A Representative is but of the Nature of a Deputy, or Delegate, to supply the place of one that is absent; such as in the House of Lords they call Proxies, (who sometimes have been such as were no Members of that House) and such as in the Convocation of the Clergy they call'd <hi>procuratores Cleri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great Freeholders, as being the Principals (rightly called) may more properly, and in a true genuine sense be sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The National Assembly.</hi> Those met in their own proper personal Capacity; for the Land-Interest in the hands of the true Owner (the Freeholder) is the only true, stable, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, fixed Interest of the Nation. The Farmers and Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders were at first, and in Ancient Times look'd upon, and accounted, but as Servants and Dependants upon the Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and little regarded by the Common-Law. And for those that followed Merchandize, and Trade, though they ever sent to these great Assemblies by Election, (the Manufacture of Woollen Cloth greatly flourishing in the Reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> which gave occasion to those Ancient Guilds or Societies that were setled in <hi>Lincoln, York, Oxford,</hi> and other Cities, and Ancient Burroughs in <hi>England</hi>; which Trade was wholly lost in the troublesome times of King <hi>Iohn, Henry</hi> the <hi>Third, Edward</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>: And then our Trade ran in Woolls, Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels, and Leather, carried out in Specie, till recover'd again by the peaceable times of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> as the most Learned in the Law, the late Chief Justice <hi>Hales</hi> does assert in his <hi>Origination of Mankind</hi>;) yet those Ancient Burroughs were not then so numerous in those Elder times, nor were the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then in so great Esteem, as having to do in Moveables only, and a transient Interest; and as we use to say, <hi>Here to day, and gone to morrow,</hi> and were therefore of an Inferior ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and made no great Figure. And it was then a Legal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement for the Guardian in Chivalry to marry the Ward, being the Heir of a Freeholder that held by Knights's Service to the Daughter of the Burgess of a Burrough.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The last Observation shall be this, That the Freeholders encreasing at last, in their number, by the sub-dividing of their posessions and tenures, and thereupon growing seditious and tumultuous, and an unwieldly Body, and less valuable and venerable in their Individuals and particulars, <hi>Mole ruebat suâ,</hi> they came to be divided, and the greatest part of them at last discontinued their coming to these Assemblies, and so they broke in two, and fell into two Houses, and their Powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came parted between them; and one part assum'd or had
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55358:7"/>
assign'd to them, some of the Powers, and the other part what was left: <hi>Cúm quercus decidit, unusquís<expan>

            <p>These Observations and Conclusions I have thought fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to propose before I peruse the Precedents, and cite my Authors; That the Reader may take notice, by the way, upon the opening of them, how properly, truly, and naturally these Observations result, and are made out, some by one Precedent and Author, and some by another, which otherwise by an hasty reading might possibly escape the being observ'd.</p>
            <p>It will not be altogether impertinent, by the way, to take notice of the temper and usage amongst the Ancient <hi>Britons,</hi> before the coming of the <hi>Romans,</hi> testified by our most credible Authors which seem to have a countenance this way, <hi>viz.</hi> of translating all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs by the body of the Freeholders: And that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this humour of the Nation was, as we use to say, bred in the bone. Although they seldom or never had any National Assemblies, as before hath been observ'd, unless upon some great and extraordinary sudden occasion, like that of chusing <hi>Cassibilan</hi> for their General upon the Invasion by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the like, which was but temporary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the <hi>Roman Annalist,</hi> says of the Ancient <hi>Britons, De Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus rebus Principes consultant: De Majoribus, Omnes. Ita tamèn ut ed quó<expan>

            </p>
            <p>Note, (<hi>Principes</hi>) here signifies not Princes or Monarchs, but the great or chief men, as will appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Plebs,</hi> or common sort, were not excluded, whenever they did consult, or transact any publick Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ziphilinus</hi> out of <hi>Dio Cassius,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Britons. Apud hos</hi> (says he) <hi>Populus magnâ ex parte Principatum tenet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not meant of the power of Government, as if they were a Republick, or had any thing of a Democracy; for <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries tells us, that the Old and Primitive Government amongst the <hi>Britons,</hi> as to the Title and outward Form of the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was Monarchial and Regal. <hi>Olim Regibus parebant</hi> (says he). But it must therefore be understood, that the People had this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatum</hi> in Subordination to the Kings. It was not Engross'd into the hands of an Aristocracy; and what can <hi>Principatus</hi> else consist of; unless in Legislature and Judicature?</p>
            <p>Our late Innovators would have us believe, that (<hi>Populus</hi>) doth sometimes signify only the Lay-Lords, met in these Ancient great Assemblies, in distinction only from the Clergy; as when our Annals or Records mention <hi>Clerus &amp; Populus,</hi> (as they often do) it is not (say they) to be understood, as if the Common people met; but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55358:8"/>
only those of the higher Rank, the Lords, or Nobility. Therefore I have cited <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who speaks of the <hi>Plebs,</hi> or <hi>Plebeians,</hi> who used to meet to consult of the greatest Matters, <hi>De Majoribus Omnes consultant,</hi> as before was observ'd. (<hi>Omnes</hi>) comprehends the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians,</hi> and excludes none.</p>
            <p>But under their favour (<hi>Populus</hi>) does most usually signify All but the highest Rank, and is exclusive to them only, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by way of distinction from the Prince or Clergy.</p>

            <p>To come to the times of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who next succeeded the <hi>Romans,</hi> even in the time of the Heptarchy, We have one Instance or Precedent in the time of <hi>Ina,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> (which was the most Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all the Seven, and at last swallowed up all the rest.)</p>

            <p>This was at that time the Supreme Judicature, and the last Resort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55358:8"/>There was a Proceeding in a Civil Cause before their Supreme Court, or <hi>Witena-Gemot</hi>; under King <hi>Eldred,</hi> Son to King <hi>Edgar,</hi> who began his Reign (says Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>) <hi>Anno</hi> 978. one <hi>Leoffius</hi> had bought Land of <hi>Adelwold</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and denied to pay for it; And he had also dis-seis'd the Bishop of certain other Lands:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edicitur placitum apud Londoniam</hi>; where the <hi>Duces, Principes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapae ex omni parte confluerant</hi>; which word (<hi>Satrapae</hi>) extends to the middle sort, as I shall show by and by. The Bishop <hi>coràm cunctis suam causam patefecit</hi> (he opened and pleaded his own Cause) before them all. <hi>Quâ, rè, benè, &amp; ritè, ac apertè ab omnibus discussa</hi> (not commanding the Parties and Auditors to withdraw while it was debated by the Court) <hi>Omnes reddiderunt Iudicium</hi> on the Bishop's side. This Case is also mention'd by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Titles of Honour, <hi>Page</hi> 633.</p>
            <p>One case more that I shall trouble the Reader with of the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, shall be that of <hi>Earl Godwin</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor, Seld. ib.</hi> 634. There the King himself, in his own person, did Sue an Appeal of Murder against Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> for the death of <hi>Alfred</hi>; The <hi>Witena-Gemote</hi> sate at <hi>London</hi> and the Cause was heard before <hi>Omnes Regni Magnates</hi>; where the word (<hi>Magnates</hi>) comprehended also persons of the middle sort, as well as those of the highest Rank, (as I shall clearly prove); but the matter was compounded, and twelve Earls bought it off with as much Money as Each of them could carry to the King in their Arms. <hi>Note,</hi> this was in the time of a Saint King too, <hi>viz.</hi> (St. <hi>Edward.</hi>)</p>
            <p>I come now to the times of the <hi>Normans,</hi> where we may have a much clearer account, and by the Precedents and Writers of those times, the Observations I have made concerning the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Supreme Judicature then, from what is now used, will much more evidently appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First</hi> (stiled the Conqueror) though he took great care to enquire out the Laws and Customs of the Realm used in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor</hi> (his immediate Predecessor) by a Jury of twelve Men out of every County, and took an Oath more than once to observe them; yet he introduced a mighty Change in the state of Affairs in disposing of the Lands, and reserving new Tenures.</p>
            <p>But this I may with some confidence affirm, that though the persons were changed, that is, <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Normans</hi> instead of <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi>; yet the Substance, the Frame and Constitution of the Government still continued as it was before, and likewise the Body of the Laws.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons Witena-Gemot</hi> now began to be call'd a Parliament, after the <hi>French</hi> Language; but it consisted of the same sort of Men, whose Right to meet there (I speak as to the generality) was from their possessions: And in like manner, and of the same persons,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55358:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was the Supreme Court of Judicature compos'd, though different in power; yet was there no difference in the qualifications of persons.</p>
            <p>Now the old titles of <hi>Dux,</hi> Alderman, or Earl, <hi>Heretoche, Vavasor,</hi> and <hi>Thane,</hi> where translated into <hi>Comes,</hi> and <hi>Baro,</hi> though very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly.</p>
            <p>But long after this <hi>AEra,</hi> or Epoche, of the coming of the <hi>Normans</hi> (as before), they were no otherwise honorary than meerly as they were officiary, or feodal. There were no Stars that serv'd only to shine and glitter, but they all had their useful influences too: And the honour was but the shadow or reflexion of their Power and Authority, and they had the Ballast too of large Possessions. <hi>Ut Romae olìm Senatores è censu Eligebantur</hi>; so was it ever in <hi>England</hi> till the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> or <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> when meer swelling Titles came in the place of Offices and Estates.</p>
            <p>And it seems very consonant to Reason and Justice, that none be admitted to a share in the Legislature, (which disposes of Lands, and imposes Taxes and Charges upon them;) and that none have a Voice in the Supreme Court of Judicature, (which Judges and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines ultimately of Estates and Titles to Lands,) but such as have good Estates in Lands themselves; as by the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Law (which continues Law still) that none shall serve of a Jury that is to try the Title of Land, but he that hath a Freehold in Land of his own.</p>
            <p>The Bishops in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times held their Lands free from all Secular Service in Frank-almoign; but they had Place and Voice in Parliament, as Bishops, and as they were spiritual only, but not in respect of any Tenure or Baronies, as afterwards they did in the times of the <hi>Normans.</hi> And Burgesses were Elected to Serve for the several Burroughs (which were then but few) as is clearly proved by the Record of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> of a Petition of the Burgesses of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> as it hath been publish'd by Mr. <hi>Petit</hi> of the Temple.</p>
            <p>And it is very likely, that the great Officers of the Kingdom came thither by virtue of their Offices. But the greatest part (no doubt) of that great Body, was made up of those who had a Right to meet there in respect of their Possessions (their Freeholds.) And from thence, and from the great Power and Authority which they shared in, at those great Assemblies, they were in the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws and Annals stiled <hi>Nobiles, Magnates, Proceres, Primates, Principes, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niores, Sapientes,</hi> and by such like Compellations.</p>
            <p>And from hence have arisen those gross Mistakes and Errors, which some of our late zealous Writers have been guilty of, who affirm, that ever any one House, as now constituted, had that great power from the first Constitution of the Government.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws and Annals, all the great things that were acted in those times, and all the Laws that were then made, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55358:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Judgments then given, are reported to be made and done, by persons describ'd and mention'd by the Titles then in use; namely, by the Names of Aldermen, or Thanes; and by the Attributes of <hi>Nobiles, Principes, Proceres,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Norman</hi> Translators when they Translate those <hi>Saxon</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, render them (though unduly) in the dialect, and by the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles used in their own Times, <hi>viz. Comites &amp; Barones</hi>; because in their own times none were usually accounted <hi>Magnates, Nobiles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres, Principes,</hi> and the like, but such as were in the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>rate Authors, (such as Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> and others) hastily catch at these Mis-translations, and from thence fiercely argue, that all the power both of Law-making and Judicature under our Ancient Kings were only in the <hi>Comites</hi> and <hi>Barones,</hi> and so still ought to be; And that the Commons have but Usurp'd upon the House of Peers, and that from the time only of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas in truth there were in those times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> no such Titles (as <hi>Comites</hi> and <hi>Barones</hi>) in use, to any such purpose as they have been applied to, since the coming of the <hi>Normans</hi>; and they had another kind of signification and power, long after the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> till about the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> than what they have now; and not till much about the same time is it that these Anti-Commoners allow to be the first beginning and date of the Jurisdiction of the House of Commons; and that till then there was no such House.</p>
            <p>Our Famous <hi>Selden</hi> takes notice of these Mis-translations of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws and Annals by the <hi>Norman</hi> Writers, <hi>Pag.</hi> 604. of his Titles of Honour.</p>
            <p>The Translation, says he, of (Alderman) or (Earl) in King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Laws into the word (<hi>Comes</hi>) proceeded from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, who, after the <hi>Norman</hi> Monarchy, in their turning and translating the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, thought that (Earl) was used for (<hi>Comes</hi>) in King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s time, because it was so afterwards in their own times.</p>
            <p>That kind of fault (says <hi>Selden</hi>) is most common.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> (another of our Learned Antiquaries) takes notice of the same Errour in our <hi>Norman</hi> Translators, in rendring Words and Titles, <hi>Non è more Saeculi antiquioris,</hi> but according to the Titles of Honour used in their own times; when in truth they signified different things.</p>
            <p>As if a man should go about to prove the Name and Office of <hi>High-Sheriffs</hi> to be as Ancient as the times of the <hi>Romans</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Godwin</hi> in his <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, <hi>Page</hi> 176. translates the words (<hi>Triumviri Capitales</hi>) into (<hi>Three High-Sheriffs</hi>;) and should argue that whatever was done at <hi>Rome</hi> by those (<hi>Triumviri</hi>) should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55358:10"/>
belong to the Office of our High-Sheriffs, which would be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
            <p>We may as well argue that the vast power Exercis'd heretofore in <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Capitalis Iustitiarius Angliae</hi> (as his Title was) who indeed was all one with a Pro-rex or Viceroy (and whose Office wholly ceased in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First</hi>) may now be used by the Chief-Justice of the Kings-Bench, who often hath the same Title as (<hi>Capitalis Iustitiarius Angliae</hi>) given him.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Nobilis</hi>) says Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times denoted every Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
            <p>Now because (<hi>Nobilis</hi>) in our times is mostly restrain'd to the Peers of the Realm, whom we call (the Nobility,) our new Writers and Arguers ascribe all that power to the Lords in <hi>Parliament,</hi> which they read in the <hi>Norman</hi> Translators (such as <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> &amp;c.) was Exercis'd in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times by those that in those times were stiled (<hi>Nobiles</hi>); when in truth that Power and Authority was in the times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> likewise in the hands of the middle sort of persons in the Kingdom, as well as in those of the highest sort under the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, and all then called (<hi>Nobiles.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Thus (<hi>Thanes</hi>) who in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times signified <hi>Lords of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> and was not a distinction of Honour, is generally translated (<hi>Barones</hi>) by our (<hi>Norman</hi>) Translators; and that was not so alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improperly done (as I shall show by and by;) for the word (<hi>Baro</hi>) from the time of the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and a long time after, signified no more than a (Tenant in <hi>Capite</hi>) and was then no Title of Honour.</p>
            <p>The words <hi>Nobiles, Proceres, Magnates, Optimates,</hi> and such like, were not in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times restrain'd to the men of the highest Rank, such as our Earls and Barons are now; but extended to all persons of the better sort, and above the vulgar. Not only to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians</hi> and those of the <hi>Senatorian</hi> Order, (to speak in the <hi>Roman</hi> dialect) but also to those of <hi>Equestris Ordinis,</hi> excluding none but the <hi>Ignota Capita,</hi> or <hi>sine Nomine turba,</hi> such as the <hi>Romans</hi> stiled (<hi>Plebeians.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> in his Glossary, <hi>Page</hi> 84. <hi>Avo Henrici primi</hi> (says he) <hi>Procerum Appellatione computari videntur Omnes maneriorum Domini</hi>: So that Titles in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, and in the beginning of the <hi>Norman</hi> times did all resolve themselves into <hi>possessions</hi> of Lands, and were feodal.</p>
            <p>For the word (<hi>Magnates,</hi>) it most clearly includes also those of the middle sort; or (as I may term it in the now dialect) of the lower Nobility.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Petit</hi> of the Temple, in his Book of (the Ancient Right of the Commons asserted) cites a Record in the Tower, <hi>Tertio</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>membrana</hi> 16<hi>ta. dorso, Rotulo clauso</hi>; where there are these
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55358:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
words enter'd, viz. <hi>Inhibitio, nè qui Magnates,</hi> viz. <hi>Comes, Baro, Miles, seu aliqua alia Notabilis persona transeat ad partes transmarinas.</hi> So that by this (<hi>videlicet</hi>) <hi>Milites</hi> are comprehended, under the word (<hi>Magnates</hi>), and <hi>Nobilis,</hi> is no more than (<hi>Notabilis.</hi>)</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Book <hi>De priscis Anglor. Legibus.

            <p>The same sense of the words (<hi>Magnates &amp; Proceres</hi>) appears in a Record of the Exchequer in the King's Remembrancer's Office, <hi>inter Communia brevia de termino Trinitatis.</hi> 34. <hi>E.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Nay, the words (<hi>Baro &amp; Baronagium</hi>) which one would think should be <hi>Propria quarto modo,</hi> to our Peers, and should be peculiar and characteristical Notes of distinction between Peers, and all others their Inferiors: These very words had a much larger extent, and were comprehensive of all Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi>; Nay, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to all Lords of Mannors, if not to all Freeholders: And this for a long time after the coming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced them first amongst us.</p>
            <p>And the very Title of (<hi>Barones</hi>) gives all our Peers, whether dignified with those higher Titles of Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the sole Right of Sitting in the House of Peers, and they Sit there <hi>Eo nomine,</hi> and not meerly by force of those higher Titles.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, I presume, that those higher dignities are never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd alone, but accompanied at least with that most peculiar Title of the Peers, I mean the Barons.</p>

            <p>The same Learned Author, in his Titles of Honour. <hi>Fol.</hi> 609.691. tells us, that in the beginning of the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary or Parliamentary Barons, were only Barons by Tenure, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55358:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
created by the King's Writ or Charter of good Possessions, whereby <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>First</hi> reserved to himself a Tenure in Chief by Knight's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or by Grand Serjeanty. And that Knights Service was to serve the King upon occasion with such a number of Men at Arms as was reserv'd by the Charter, or Grant; and this is called a Tenure <hi>per Baronagium,</hi> and the number of all Knights Fees (out of which Baronies were made up) amounted (as <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> who lived in the Conqueror's time, says,) to Sixty thousand Knights, or Men of War.</p>
            <p>Now these Tenants in <hi>Capite</hi> were the most of those that made up the great Assembly, called a Parliament, and they were the Judges of the Supreme Judicature; for, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> says, in those times, <hi>Tenere de Rege in capite,</hi> and to be a Baron, or to have a Right to sit with the rest of the Barons in Councils, or Courts of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Laws of those times, are <hi>Synonomies,</hi> and signify the same thing.</p>
            <p>All these Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> (had the whole Kingdom been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Scale,</hi> and weighed as <hi>Bocaline</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> weighed all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States in <hi>Europe</hi>: These Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> (I say) made up the greatest part of the weight, I may say, the whole weight, if Land only were to be weighed.</p>
            <p>For under these Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> by degrees in process of time, all the Freeholders derive their Estates, who are therefore to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as cast into the Scale with the Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi>; who originally had all the Lands: For Lease-holders, Farmers, and Copy-holders, are but in the nature of Servants or Persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd under the Freeholders; and the Copyholders did truly and literally hold their Lands at first <hi>ad voluntatem domini,</hi> till time gave it the Reputation of a Legal Custom, and to a more durable inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; and Leases for above 40 years, were not allow'd in those ancient times; but adjudg'd and held to be void, as vying in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue with Inheritance; but they have of later times been counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by Courts of Equity, and made equal in esteem with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Estates and Inheritances, being altogether under the Rule and Government of those Courts, and having their dependance upon the decrees of those Courts, and have the same privileges and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with Inheritances, under the new notion of being by their decrees made to wait upon the Inheritances, and subject to Trusts, which those Courts take upon them to have the Controulment of; and hereby the Freehold and Inheritance of Lands are of little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and value, in comparison of those high powers and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which by the Law and Original Institution of the Nation did at first belong to them: All this tends to the great Subversion of the Common-Law, and of the very Constitution of the Nation; and to all the good Rules and Orders of it; and in length of time, if not before remedied, will bring all Estates in Land to depend
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55358:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon Decrees in Equity, and to be Ruled by their Arbitrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and then farewel to the Common-Law.</p>
            <p>And these Freeholders, who were but the offspring of those An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> are by the Common-Law, the true and right Owners and Proprietors of the Kingdom: And accordingly, as in them was the true value, stable, firm, and fixed interest of the Nation; so in them did the Law place the Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the King, (who was always the Supreme in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.) Hence it is, that a Trial by Freeholders, is in the Sense and Language of the Law, a Trial <hi>per patriam</hi>; for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Country, and the Country is truly theirs.</p>
            <p>And it is a mighty power if we Enquire into it, and much of it still remains; though it has been exceedingly abated and humbled, by the swelling of Equity, and by certain Acts of Parliament made in troublesome Reigns; yet there are some remains, and the marks and footsteps of those many and great benefits that are lopp'd and pared off from it.</p>
            <p>These Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> and Freeholders were the Persons who under our Kings made up the Primitive Constitution of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both as to the Legislature, and the Supreme Judicature, or last Resort, though now those powers run in a new Channel.</p>
            <p>I shall instance in some of those Ancient and Inherent Rights and Freedoms, which those Freeholders, or Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> did enjoy at the Common-Law, and in the times of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and from times as Ancient as any Records do reach, till, by several Acts of Parliament, made for the most part in unquiet times, they were depriv'd of them: Which will best discover the true and original Constitution of the Government, and give great light to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have now in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> to find out the Supreme Judicature.</p>
            <p>Almost all the Suits and Causes that did arise in the Nation, came under the hands and power of the Freeholders, <hi>ad primam instantiam,</hi> at the first rise of them, and they judged of them both as to matters of Fact, and points in Law, in the Country.</p>
            <p>And then the greater and weightier matters of the Law met the same persons again at the last Resort of all Causes in the <hi>Witena-Gemots</hi>: For these Freeholders made up the main body of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councils and great Assemblies.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman,</hi> in his Glossary. <hi>Fol.</hi> 70. speaking of the <hi>Magnates</hi> and <hi>Proceres,</hi> explains who were meant by those high terms, that is, the good Freeholders. And he shows likewise what Judicial power they had, in those first times.</p>
            <p>

            <p>These Freeholders had the Election of the Conservators of the Peace, who had that power which is now in the hands of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of the Peace, and hath been so from the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> at which time it was wrested out of the hands of the Freeholders by an Act of Parliament procur'd by Queen <hi>Isabel,</hi> during the Life-time of her deposed Husband, and in the Minority of her Son King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> meerly to gain the power of the Kingdom into the hands of her party that she made against her Husband (the deposed King.) And ever since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Peace hath been in the hands of the Commissioners; or Justices of the Peace. This we are taught by our Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and by the Learned Lawyer and Autiquary (Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi>) in his <hi>Eirenarcha,</hi> Fol. 16. and 19, 20. and 147. and by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in his Second <hi>Instit.</hi> Fol. 174, and 558.</p>
            <p>These Freeholders ever did, and still do to this day chuse the Coroners (who were heretofore the most sufficient Knights of the County.)</p>
            <p>And they still chuse the <hi>Verderors</hi> where there are any Forests.</p>
            <p>All this appears to have been the Right of the Freeholders long before the Conquest. See <hi>Lambert,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, <hi>Fol.</hi> 147. among the Laws of King <hi>Edward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Erant &amp; aliae potestates &amp; dignitates</hi> (for Power and Offices, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and dignities in those times went hand in hand.) <hi>Per provincias &amp; per singulos Comitatus totius Regni constitutae qui</hi> Heretoches <hi>apud</hi> Anglos <hi>vocabantur. sc.

            </p>
            <p>These are not the words of Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> or meerly his Opinion and Conceit, he only recites the words of the Law in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times. And the Law does refer it to the times of the <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Britons,</hi> for they were the men who called these Leaders by the name of <hi>Heretoches.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:55358:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thus we see how large an extent this word (<hi>Barones</hi>) did bear; that it comprehended all Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> who at first were the only Freeholders: Till by Subfeodations the number of Freeholders en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease'd infinitely, which caused a great alteration. But the first Tenants <hi>in Capite</hi> had large Possessions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notandum est</hi> (says Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi>) <hi>libere hos tenentes nec tam exiles olim fuisse, nec tam vulgares, ut hodiè deprehenduntur, nam villas &amp; dominia in minutas hereditates nondum distrahebant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have set forth their Country Jurisdiction; now to speak a word of their Supreme Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his Glossary tells us, <hi>Barones olim de causis cognoscebant ad Aulam Regiam delatis.</hi> There was the last resort, and the Court of Equity.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>First</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) in the 4th year of his Reign, brought the Bishops and Abbots under the Tenure by Barony, <hi>Concilio Baronum suorum,</hi> which by the Proofs that I have already offered, signify the Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> and the Eminent Freeholders, and a Parliament, (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> takes it.)</p>
            <p>The Bishops contended earnestly against it; for the Power and Jurisdiction being then in the hands of so great a number, it made it the less desirable; so that, as Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi> tells us, The Clergy look'd upon it as a diminution of their former Immunity and Freedom which they had assum'd and adjudg'd due to themselves. <hi>Detrahere videtur nomen Baronis ab Ecclesiasticarum Immunitate quam tunc Ecclesiastici maximè splendebant. Hoc. nostratibus</hi> (says Sir <hi>Henry Spelman) jugum injecit, Omnium Primus. Willielmus Senior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the Tenth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second, Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi> that proud and insolent Prelate, would have cast off this Yoke again, like a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> and he stifly stood upon the Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clergy. Then (says <hi>Selden</hi>) that great Parliament at <hi>Clarendon</hi> was held: And <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Hoveden</hi> says, that <hi>Clerus &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus Regni</hi> were then Assembled, which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> expounds to be a Parliament.</p>
            <p>In this Parliament (says <hi>Selden</hi>) those <hi>Avitae consuetudines</hi> (which made the great quarrel between <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi>) were Recogniz'd.</p>
            <p>And it is very material towards the deciding of another great Controversy that has of late been agitated, that Custom for the Prelates withdrawing from matters of Blood, is recited as one of these <hi>Avitae Consuetudines</hi>; for the Bishops (as I observ'd before out of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) had places in those general Conventions in all the times of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> And in all those times it seems it was their custom to withdraw: For it was <hi>Avita Consuetudo,</hi> and we know that Customs must be exactly pursued. And this Custom is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd and declar'd by Act of Parliament, (the Parliament at <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon.</hi>)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55358:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Though by the Ancient Canons of the Church, (which was the ground of that Custom) at first it was left to their own choice.</p>
            <p>Among those Articles this was one, <hi>Quod Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, &amp; Universi Personae qui de Rege tenent in Capite, habeant possessiones suas de Rege, sicut Baroniam, &amp; sicut caeteri Barones Debent interesse Iudiciis Curiae Regis cum Baronibus quoús<expan>

            </p>
            <p>Who these (<hi>Barones</hi>) were in those times most plainly appears by this very Law, <hi>viz.</hi> They are such <hi>Qui tenent de Rege in Capite</hi>: And what their Right, and Power, and Jurisdiction is, (for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I chiefly cite it) <hi>debent interesse Iudiciis Curiae Regis</hi>: This <hi>Curia Regis</hi> plainly appears to be the Supreme Judicature, which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after, and which some late Writers conceive did in all times belong to the House of Peers; but 'tis a mistake in them, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the word (<hi>Barones</hi>) mention'd in it; And they think it bears their Signature, and peculiarly belongs to them: Whereas by this Law it undeniably appears to belong to that vast number of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <hi>in Capite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we may believe Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> (who is <hi>fide-dignus,</hi>) the Honour was so much the less, because it was transferrable.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The only Titles that we meet with in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, as we learn out of Mr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> are <hi>Alderman,</hi> which in the times of the <hi>Danes</hi> was translated into <hi>Eorl</hi>; and in the <hi>Norman</hi> times into <hi>Comes.</hi> And the Title of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retoch.</hi> (which I have just now Explain'd) and those other Titles of <hi>Vavasor,</hi> and <hi>Thane,</hi> had all a reference to possessions in Land; And were rather Officiary than Honorary, and were generally due to these Tenants <hi>in Capite,</hi> who were the same with (<hi>Barones.</hi>)</p>
            <p>For that of <hi>Alderman,</hi> or <hi>Comes,</hi> or <hi>Satrapa,</hi> says <hi>Cambden,</hi> in his <hi>Britannia, Page</hi> 135, and 136. <hi>Comitis nomen ut dignitatem notaret sine administratione, in usu non fuit,</hi> in the Elder times; and so says <hi>Selden</hi> in his Titles of Honour, <hi>Page</hi> 604.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec dum haereditaria fuit dignitas: Initio dignitas temporaria posted vitae aequalis.</hi> But in that Age, Titles of Honour and Place were no more hereditary, than Virtue and True Worth were, which are not <hi>ex traduce</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> made the first Viscount, which still is also a name Officiary.</p>

            <p>The name of <hi>Vavasor,</hi> says <hi>Seld. ib.</hi> 625. was feodal only, and not at all honorary. In <hi>Doom's-day</hi> (says he) it sometimes occurs as a <hi>Synonomy,</hi> with <hi>liberi homines Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Tenants <hi>de Rege in Capite,</hi> were the persons that had Right to Sit in Parliament, and in the Supreme Judicature and Councils, during the times of the first Six or Seven of the Kings next after the coming of the <hi>Normans.

            </p>
            <p>Now for the mighty number of which this great Assembly did ever consist, Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> in his Book, wherein he asserts the Right of the Commons, <hi>pag.</hi> 100. cites a passage out of <hi>Matth.

            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi> in his Glossary says of these Barons, That they were <hi>Ingens Multitudo, quae plus minus,</hi> were Thirty thousand, <hi>nullo tecto Convocari poterat.</hi> Therefore they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55358:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
met in great Camps and Fields. And Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi> says, He can hardly believe (<hi>Quod nonnulli perhibent) quod Omnes Barones lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum aliquando in summis illis Comitiis obtinuisse,</hi> because of their vast number.</p>
            <p>By all this that hath been said, and so fully proved, I suppose it clearly appears, that those that made up the Assembly for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature, and Supreme Judicature, came thither by a feodal Right (unless the Burgesses only, and some Ecclesiastical Persons, and some great Officers.)</p>
            <p>Here is not in all these Precedents, Records, or Testimonies of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors and Antiquaries, the least mention of any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction among them, like that of Lords and Commons, or Upper and Lower House; or that they were divided in their place of Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Meeting; for as is before observ'd, their number was so vast, that <hi>nullo tecto convocari poterant.</hi> No one House could hold them.</p>
            <p>In the case of <hi>Godsol,</hi> and Sir <hi>Christop. Heydon,</hi> 12. <hi>Iac. in Serjeant Rolls</hi> 1. <hi>Rep. Fol.</hi> 18. It was affirmed by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> that in Ancient Times all the Parliament sate together; and that he had seen a Record of it in the Thirtieth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the First. But <hi>William Pryn</hi> (according to his accustomed humour) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in this, in his Preface to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Abridgment of the Records of the Tower.</p>
            <p>It may be concluded, that they all had a Right to come to the great Convention; for had they all been called by special Writs, (as the Lords now are,) the King would never have call'd so great a number, which do but hinder business.</p>
            <p>There is not the least mention of special Writs, and it would have been an infinite Work to issue out so many Writs, Printing not being then invented. Therefore no doubt but they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a general Summons. There is not the least intimation of any distinction in their Power, but every one had a like share in the Power, both in the Legislature and Judicature.</p>
            <p>None came amongst them by a meer Title of Honour and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but in Right of their Possesions and Tenures. This was not indeed the Representative of the Nation; but, (as I said before) the Principals, and in effect, the whole Body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is much greater.</p>
            <p>But at last this great Body fell with its own weight; for, says Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman, Cùm sua tandem laborarent multitudine Conventús<expan>

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:55358:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>And Learned <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us in what time a division of this great Body was effected. <hi>Henricus Tertius</hi> (says he,) (in his <hi>Britannia, pag.</hi> 137.) <hi>Ex tantâ Multitudine</hi> (speaking of the Parliament in those times) <hi>quae seditiosa &amp; turbulenta fuit, Optimos quos<expan>
                     <am>

                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Rescripto ad Comitia Parliamentaria evocaverit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have plainly the Original of the House of Peers, and of particular and special Rescripts or Writs of Summons to the Optimacy, distinctly, and by themselves. <hi>Cambden</hi> quotes his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor for this, but names him not. <hi>Ex satis antiquo Scriptore loquor,</hi> (says he.)</p>
            <p>It was referr'd to the King to single out, and select some to whom he thought fit to direct his special Writs or Summons, and these and no other were to come to Parliament.</p>
            <p>If this may be credited, then we have the <hi>Epoche,</hi> and the Date of our present Constitution, and the Original of the Division of that very ancient, great, and numerous Assembly; and it made a mighty <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> and Change. The Freeholders parted with that great Power and Interest which they had both in Legislature and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, from the very Foundation of the Government, and the Nation it self: Even from the time of the <hi>Ab-origines,</hi> (if there were ever any such,) and they have been upon the losing-hand ever since, as appears by what I have already observ'd in closing their Rights of Elections.</p>
            <p>And thus they brake in two, and became two Houses both at one time, and were Twins in their Birth. Here was no <hi>Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture,</hi> yet the one went away with a double portion upon the parting.</p>
            <p>And this (taking in the History) is a confutation of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the House of Commons (as being by Election) was in time long after the Date of the House of Peers; surely they started both together.</p>
            <p>Great <hi>Selden</hi> agrees in the Substance with Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> but differs from him only in the time, and some other circumstances, when this Revolution happen'd. And for Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>'s <hi>satis antiquus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> professes he diligently sought for this Author, but could never meet with him; nor does Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> give any credit to that Author.</p>
            <p>He supposes the distinction of <hi>Majores,</hi> and <hi>Minores Barones,</hi> (which doubtless did arise upon this Revolution) <hi>pag.</hi> 708. began not long before the great Charter of King <hi>Iohn</hi> (Father to King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi>) and that Charter was made in the Seventeenth and last year of King <hi>Iohn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Division of <hi>Barones</hi> (which all Writers agree in, and which appears by King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Great Charter) evidently shows, that the two Houses began at the same time; for <hi>Majores</hi> cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55358:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Minores.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> supposes this was done by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though that Act be not now Extant: Nor is there any express Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of it. And he supposes it was not submitted to the King to chuse out whom he thought fit; But that the Act of Parliament did mention them by name at first, to whom particular Writs were to be directed.</p>
            <p>Some part of the very words of that Charter of King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s we have in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Titles of Honour, <hi>pag.</hi> 709. and in Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman</hi> in his Glossary, <hi>pag.</hi> 83. <hi>Faciemus</hi> (says that great Charter) <hi>Summoneri Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopos, Episcopos, Abbates, Comites, &amp; Majores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Barones Regni,</hi> Sigillatim, <hi>per literas nostras: Et praetereà faciemus submoneri</hi> in generali <hi>per Vice-comites Omnes alios qui in capite tenent de Nobis</hi>; which is a clear proof, that till about this time, there was no distinction: And that which did Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Parliamentary Baron, was his Tenure <hi>de Rege in Capite</hi>; so that all who held <hi>in Capite,</hi> had an inherent Right to sit there. And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, all came by a general Summons directed to the Sheriff.</p>
            <p>What hath been hitherto said serves to prove, That before this time of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> or King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> (his Son) there was only one great Assembly of the Nation; that is, of the most Eminent, and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable and interested persons of the Nation, who came not by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, save those that were chosen from the few and ancient Burroughs: Nor was there then any Representative, as now.</p>
            <p>And that those great Assemblies were in those times the true Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> and that the word (Baronage) did not belong only to such as the King by special Writ is pleas'd to call or summon; or by Patent to confer the Title upon; but as our most judicious Writers tell us, the word (<hi>Baronagium</hi>) did extend to all Degrees and Orders; for they came to all great Assemblies by Tenure, till the aforesaid time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision.</p>
            <p>And there are the footsteps of this Ancient Right still amongst us, in that the Freeholders (whom we call Free-suitors) are still the Judges of that Court, which Anciently was the great and buisy Court (the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Court.) And those Elections that are still remaining of Trustees or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives in Parliament, and of divers Legal Officers, which must be by Freeholders only, and the persons to be chosen, ought to be out of the Freeholders themselves.</p>
            <p>And so much of the Ancient Constitution of a Baron still remains, as that in his Creation he must be entitled of some place, that it may favour of the Realty, and make the Honour and Title Inheritable.</p>
            <p>And the Baron still continues his Freedom from Arrests, as having by presumption of Law, an Estate in Land, which will make him liable to Justice: And therefore a <hi>Distringas</hi> shall issue out against him instead of a <hi>Capias.</hi> And the Law will allow of no Averment against a Peer, that he hath no Lands whereby to distrain or to levy Issues upon.</p>
            <p>No doubt but the Lords had from the time of this great Division ever since, a very large, though not an universal Jurisdiction; nor have they had it from the very first Constitution of the Government, as is by some pretended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55358:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>When this great Assembly, this great and numerous Body, was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into parts, no doubt but the several parts did (as the Four great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains after the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did) assume and take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Agreement, several shares of the power that was then dissolv'd.</p>
            <p>The Lords took a large share, and the Commons, (for so now they began to be distinguish'd) took the rest; and we may reasonably suppose it was confirm'd by some Law that then pass'd, and hath been since lost.</p>
            <p>And the like presumption we know is made by our Courts of Law in many like cases: And it is well known that the Parliament-<hi>Rolls</hi> of that time are all lost.</p>
            <p>And the best Rule whereby to judge what was allotted to each, will be by ancient, constant, quiet, and uninterrupted Usage and Practice. <hi>Usus &amp; consuetudo est Lex Parliamenti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The House of Lords did exercise a Jurisdiction in cases of Appeals for Criminal Causes, till by the Act of 1<hi rend="sup">mo.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th c.</hi> 14. they were restrain'd.</p>
            <p>That Act doth Ordain, That <hi>from thenceforth no Appeals shall be pursued in Parliament,</hi> the Exposition of which Statute must be made by observing the mischiefs that occasion'd the making of that Law, and the constant practice after it.</p>
            <p>The preamble recites, That many Mischiefs did often arise by Appeals: And the History of the times of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> (the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding King) tells us what those Mischiefs were: When in that disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly troublesome Reign, the Lords were so divided into Feuds and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that the Lords (who were to be the Judges) became Parties, and were Appellants one against another. This was the mischief.</p>
            <p>Then for the practice after the making of that Act, that Law was never intended according to the generality of the words, to exclude all Appeals whatsoever, but such only as were at the suit of private persons.</p>
            <p>For the constant practice hath been, ever since, as well as before, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Appeals in Parliament, when they come to the Lords by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment from the Commons.</p>
            <p>The Lords had, and still retain, the Jurisdiction over their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for trial of Peers in cases Capital.</p>
            <p>The Lords had, and still have the Jurisdiction in Writs of Error, to examine Judgments given in the King's-Bench; but this was under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules, and with some restraint; for constant and quiet usage and practice do warrant all these.</p>
            <p>Let us enquire into the <hi>placita Parliamentaria,</hi> I mean those that are publish'd by Mr. <hi>Ryley,</hi> of the times of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> &amp;c. and observe what light they give us.</p>
            <p>The true Title of those Pleas are <hi>Placita coram ipso domino Rege &amp; ejus. Concilio, ad Parliamenta sua.</hi> In which Titles, <hi>Regis Concilium, &amp; Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> seem to be distinguish'd, and to signify two several things (as in truth they did.)</p>
            <p>When and how came these Pleas to be discontinued ever since
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55358:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi>? When did the Law pass that restrain'd them? We have not one such Plea to any effect, between the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> and the time of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> nor from thence to this day, near 300 years. What is come in the place of them?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Placita Parliamentaria</hi> were in a strict and regular form of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Petition of Declaration, the Plea, the Replication, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinder, and the Continuances entred upon Record in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the process was by Latin Writs; and all the Proceedings entred upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in <hi>Latin,</hi> as Proceedings at the Common-Law ought to be. How came this to be altered? All of later times (at least before the Lords) are in <hi>English,</hi> and the process are <hi>English</hi> Orders only.</p>
            <p>Had these <hi>Placita</hi> been before the Lords, how happens it that there are so few (if any) Reports among them of Pleadings upon Writs of Error, which the Lords claim as out of all dispute to be within their Jurisdiction? Hardly any of these are to be found amongst them; and these had been worthy Reporting, being in matters difficult, weighty, and full of Learning.</p>
            <p>What was this <hi>Regis Concilium</hi> (so constantly mention'd) in these Pleas, as those before whom they were held?</p>
            <p>☞ Amongst these Records and Pleas, we find <hi>All the Peers</hi> themselves in a Body several times petitioning to the King and this Council, and receiving Orders and Rules from that Council.</p>
            <p>It is absurd to think, that all the Lords in a body would petition to themselves; as at the Parliament held 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Second, Ryley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamentaria,</hi> pag. 425.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ex parte Praelatorum, Comitum, Baronum, &amp; aliorum, porrecta est petitio in hoc Parliamento, in haec verba.</hi>

            <p>Concerning payment of Escuage. And the Answer to this Petition is, <hi>per Concilium Regis,</hi> the like <hi>ib. pag.</hi> 448.</p>
            <p>We have another Example of it in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to that Book, <hi>viz.</hi> of the time of 18 <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> pag. 619. wherein the Lords in a body pray liberty to approve or improve their Mannors, without the King's License. And the Answer to it is, That it could not be done without a new Law, to which the Commons would not consent.</p>
            <p>It is evident in those Records and Pleas, that others are mention'd to be of that Council, then the Peers, as <hi>pag.</hi> 266, and 331.</p>
            <p>There is an Inhibition by the Treasurer, and the <hi>Concilium Regis,</hi> not to deliver a Prisoner; and <hi>page</hi> 386. 14<hi>th Edward</hi> 2. the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed who should <hi>receive</hi> Petitions at the Parliament, and who should Answer them: And those that were appointed to Answer them are called <hi>Triers of Petitions</hi>: These seem to be the persons that made the great Council, or the King's Council, (as they are called in those Records.) These in Parliaments of late have been wholly discontinued.</p>
            <p>We find this Council, while they were in being, sate in Places, where
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55358:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we cannot reasonably suppose that the House of Lords ever sate; as <hi>pag.</hi> 87. in Mr. <hi>Ryley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamentaria, Coràm Rege &amp; Concilio apud Lond. in domo Ottonis de Grandissono, extra palatium ipsius Domini Regis apud West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monasterium.</hi> And pag. 98. at <hi>Bergavenny</hi>; and pag. 108. at <hi>Stilbeneth. extra London,</hi> which I suppose is meant of <hi>Stepney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Judges are mentioned as Members of this Council, <hi>pag.</hi> 140. not meer Assistants.</p>
            <p>Now we come to Writs of Error; wherein it is generally admitted, that the Lords have a Jurisdiction, and from thence (as I suppose) it is inferr'd by a parity of Reason, that they likewise have a Jurisdiction in Appeals from Courts of Equity. An Appeal from a Decree in Equity being something of the same nature with a Writ of Error at the Common-Law.</p>
            <p>It is true our Law-Books are full of this Title, and speak of Error sued in Parliament. But under favour it is not of an universal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in all Cases of Erroneous Judgments, but with divers Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and under certain Rules in our Law-Books.</p>
            <p>It hath been often Resolv'd, that the Lords cannot proceed upon any Writ of Error, till first the King hath Sign'd a Petition for the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a Writ of Error to be sued out.</p>
            <p>As in the Year-book of 22 <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d. Fol.</hi> 3. It is there held, that a Writ of Error in Parliament lies not, till the King be petition'd for it, and till the King have Sign'd the Petition. Which Signing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Commission which gives the Authority.</p>
            <p>And in the case of <hi>Edward Hadelow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hadelow's</hi> Case.</note> where Judgment was given for the King: Upon the King's Signing a Petition for a Writ of Error, and the Writ sued out, the Roll in which the Judgment was entred, was brought by Sir <hi>William Thorp,</hi> Chief-Justice of the King's-Bench, into the Parliament: Upon which the King assign'd certain Earls and Barons, and with them the <hi>Iustices,</hi> to hear and determine the business: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was determin'd, the Parliament was ended; yet the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners sate still, but the King was gone.</p>
            <p>And it was urged before the Delegates (for so they are called) That the Judgment could not be Revers'd, except in Parliament; and there it is said, that the King hath no Peer in his Land, and that they cannot judge the King.</p>
            <p>How came that in to Debate? Why it was in the Case of an Outlawry, which is always for the King's benefit; and where the King is concern'd, the Lords have no Jurisdiction without the King's allowance; and the King doth not think fit to refer it to the whole House of Lords; yet the King will have Justice done, and he will be inform'd if the Outlawry were duly sued out. But the King himself assigns the persons that shall judge of it; And yet it is said, that this is suing Error in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for when the Parliament is risen, it is held that the Delegates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King could not proceed: So that Pleas may be held in Parliament by the King and his Council, such as he shall specially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for that purpose at every Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55358:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>And yet they may be stiled <hi>Placita Parliamentaria,</hi> being transacted only in time of Parliament, but not by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>This case of <hi>Edward Hadelow</hi> teaches the true nature and course of a Writ of Error in Parliament, and the right method of proceeding upon it, and the King's Prerogative in it: And how that case wherein the King is any way concern'd in interest, (as he is in cases of Outlawry) shall be Examin'd by none but such as are specially assign'd by the King.</p>
            <p>See the case in the Year-Book of 1<hi rend="sup">mo</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now concerning Proceedings in Equity in general, the <hi>English</hi> Court of Chancery, (the Court of Equity there) it hath not been of any great Antiquity, and upon what Legal Foundation it stands, is not easily to be affirm'd: As I have made appear in a larger Treatise, <hi>Of the Original of the Iurisdiction of the Chancery in matters of Equity</hi>; To which I refer my Reader.</p>
            <p>Our Ancient Authors, as the <hi>Mirror</hi> of <hi>Iustices, Glanvil, Bracton, Briton,</hi> and <hi>Fleta,</hi> although they treat of the Chancery, as it proceeds according to the Rules of the Common-Law, <hi>viz.</hi> in Repealing of Patents, and in Cases Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd, yet none of them do once mention the Court of Equity there; and yet their undertakings were to treat of all the several Courts then in being, which proves the Court of Equity in Chancery was not then in being.</p>
            <p>It hath been adjudg'd, 26. and 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the King's-Bench in <hi>Perrot's,</hi> and in <hi>Marmaduke Langdales Case. Cok.</hi> 12. <hi>Rep. Fol.</hi> 52. That a Court of Equity cannot be Erected by Patent, but only by Act of Parliament, or by Prescription.</p>
            <p>And the Chancery hath no Prescription for a Court of Equity, as appears by those Ancient Authors.</p>
            <p>If the Chancery it self have no Right of Prescription, then there is no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for any Prescription in Cases of Appeals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is there any Act of Parliament that gives it.</p>
            <p>The First Decree (as I take it) in Chancery, is but of the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>; and that was Revers'd, for that it was in a matter properly determinable at the Common-Law.</p>
            <p>The best proofs of the Power and Jurisdiction of a Court are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Precedents of a Court: And if it be by Prescription, it must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by ancient and frequent Precedents. <hi>Plowd Comment.</hi> in the case of the Mines. <hi>Fol.</hi> 301. <hi>b.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any Court Usurp a Jurisdiction in a case where it appears in their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55358:18"/>
very Proceedings themselves, that it hath no lawful Jurisdiction; what they do in such case is <hi>Coràm non Iudice,</hi> and is utterly void.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Exercise of a Jurisdiction by way of Appeal from a Court of Equity for Error in their Decrees, I shall make mention of the very Records, and Acts of the House of Lords.</p>
            <p>I have search'd into the Journal of the Lords, and I find a Record or Entry there of the Parliament held 18 <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. And we need search no higher, for that gives a full account of all the times then pass'd, as to the point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Supreme Judicature and Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>18 <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. <hi>Fol.</hi> 175. Of the Lord's Journal, I find by an Entry of the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> in that year, That a Comittee had been named by the Lords to take into consideration the Customs and Privileges of the Lord's House, and the Privileges of the Peers, or Lords of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And that a Sub-Committee had been named, who had express power to reward such person as by their Warrant should search among the Records for Privileges and Customs; and that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> had been appointed for that purpose, and had taken much pains in it.</p>
            <p>I observe by the way, That the House of Lords were not then of the same Judgment with the Noble Author I have before mentioned, who asserts the Right of Judicature of the House of Peers to be by the very first Constitution of the Government, Universal, and in all Causes whatsoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less restrain'd by some Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Had that been true, there had been no need to search for Precedents to warrant their Proceedings in any case. It had been sufficient to justify the Proceedings, if no Act of Parliament could be found to restrain them in any such case; the labour of which would have been properly on his part that would presume to dispute their Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>No, the Lords took the right course to examine it; if there were no Precedents, the Lords concluded that then they had no Right to a Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and no Persons, nor Court, can assume to themselves at their own will, any Authority or Jurisdiction; <hi>Quis me constituit Iudicem?</hi> said our Blessed Saviour, there must be a constitution of it. And it was properly enough ask'd by the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> of our Saviour, <hi>Who gave thee this Authority?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would observe too, that the Sub-Committee of the Lords employ'd for that purpose, (of searching for Precedents) a person, who was in his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (the Famous <hi>Selden</hi>); no Record could escape his discovery</p>
            <p>Further in the 208<hi>th</hi> Folio of that Journal of the 18<hi>th</hi> year of King <hi>Iames,</hi> on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (for he, it seems, took special care of it) mentions in his Report to the Lords the Proceedings of that Committee, <hi>viz.</hi> A Collection made of Customs and Orders of the Lord's House, and of their Privileges made out of Records: And he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that Collection to the House, and desir'd it might be preserv'd as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial whereunto men may resort as occasion should require, and make use of it. It was thereupon ordered by the House, to be delivered to the Clerk to be kept for that purpose.</p>
            <p>So that this was intended by the whole House of Lords to be a Standard, whereby to measure and judge of their Jurisdiction and Privileges for the future.</p>
            <p>I find the Title of that Committee, <hi>Fol.</hi> 91. to be, <hi>A Committee for searching for</hi> Precedents for Judicature, <hi>Accusations and Iudgments,</hi> anciently used <hi>in this High-Court of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55358:18"/>This shows, it must be an ancient Usage or nothing. Therefore late and modern Usage and Precedents, are, in the Judgment of the Lords, of no great Weight, to Entitle them to a Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Fol.</hi> 105. of that Journal, there is an Order made, 27.<hi>Mar.</hi> 1621. for Collection of Money among the Peers to pay the Charge for searching for Records in the Tower, and elsewhere, and to have Copies of them certifi'd under the Officer's hands. Every Earl and Viscount was to pay Forty Shillings, and every Bishop and Baron Twenty Shillings.</p>
            <p>I have perus'd that Book, Entitled, <hi>A Collection of Privileges or special Rights, belonging to the Baronage of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>What is meant by that Title, appears by the Table to the Book, which consists of these Heads following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>

            <p>Another Head, is, The Lords appointing Judges out of themselves, for Examination of Judgments in other Courts, <hi>Fol.</hi> 95.</p>
            <p>I thought this last Head, or Title, might afford something to our purpose, relating to Appeals.</p>
            <p>Under this Head there is nothing mention'd but concerning Erroneous Judgments given in the Court of King's-Bench at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or upon the Statute of 27 <hi>Elizabeth, Cap.</hi> 8. Of Judgments given in the Exchequer-Chamber, by the Judges of the Common-pleas, and the Barons of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, upon Error to Examine Judgments given in the King's-Bench; from whence Error lies also before the Lords, by the express words of that Statute; which no doubt is therefore a very Legal Power and Jurisdiction in the Lords, being Exercis'd in the method directed by Law, as before is observ'd.</p>
            <p>The Book of this Collection expresly takes notice, That no Writ of Error lies in Parliament upon a Judgment given in the Court of Common-Pleas, till that Judgment have been Revers'd, or Affirm'd in the King's-Bench. As it was answer'd in Parliament, in the Case of the Bishop of <hi>Norwich. Rot. Parl.</hi> 50. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Articl.</hi> 48.</p>
            <p>The like Resolution did the Lords give after Hearing all the Judges, and long Consultation, and a referring the Consideration of that matter to a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Committee of the Lords, in a Case of the late Earl of <hi>Macclesfeld</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Earl was Plaintiff in the Exchequer, in an Action of <hi>Slander,</hi> and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there in that Court given against him; whereupon the said Earl (since this last Revolution) sued Error before the Lords, passing by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod directed by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 31. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. for Suing Error upon Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given in the Exchequer; And the Lords were upon the very point of Reversing that Judgment in the Exchequer; but being by one of the said Judges then also sitting on the Upper Wooll-sack, put in mind of that Stat. of <hi>E.</hi> 3. they did forbear to proceed to do any more upon it, referring it to the Order limited by that Statute.</p>
            <p>This proves, That the Lords are tied to a method too, in cases where they have a Rightful Jurisdiction: They must not take it <hi>ad primam Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> nor <hi>per Saltum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that Collection I have mentioned, under that <hi>Lemma</hi> of <hi>Examination of Iudgments in other Courts</hi> (which is comprehensive enough) I find notice taken
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55358:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Hadelow</hi>'s Case. 22. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fol.</hi> 3. and <hi>Flourdew</hi>'s Case, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Fol.</hi> 20. which I cited before at large. And these concern only Cases of Erroneous Judgments in the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Title of <hi>Offences not Capital,</hi> there is mention of no case but upon Accusations for Criminal Causes.</p>
            <p>It begins with <hi>William Latimer</hi>'s Accusation of <hi>Iohn at Lee</hi> for Offences against the State.</p>
            <p>It mentions the Case of <hi>Richard Lyons,</hi> for procuring of Patents for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advantage, and of the new Impositions without Parliament.</p>
            <p>It instances in the Case of <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> accus'd by the Commons, And the Case of <hi>Alice Peirse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Case in 7 <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi>d num.</hi> 11. of <hi>Michael de-la-Pool,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> accus'd by <hi>Iohn Cavendish</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Fishmonger, for Bribery.</p>
            <p>And the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Case, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>num.</hi> 26. and <hi>Thorpe</hi>'s Case; but they are all in Criminal Causes.</p>
            <p>While this Committee was in being, I meet with an Appeal made to the Lords from a Decree made in Chancery: And (as I take it,) 'tis a decree made by the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> (though he is not named by his name) it is <hi>Fol.</hi> 181. in the Journal of the Parliament, 18. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1621.</p>
            <p>The Third of <hi>December</hi> in that Parliament, Sir <hi>Iohn Bourchier</hi> by Petition Appeals to the Lords from a Decree in Chancery, wherein he himself was Plaintiff against <hi>Iohn Mompessom</hi> and others, and there were cross Suits, and they were about Accounts between them. And Sir <hi>Iohn Bourchier</hi> had a Sum of Money decreed to him, but not for so much as he thought was due; and therefore he Appealed, and complain'd in his Petition to the Lords, of an <hi>hasty Hearing</hi> of his Cause in Chancery, and that his Witnesses were not heard, and uses the very formal word of <hi>Appeal</hi> in his Petition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fol.</hi> 188.6. <hi>December,</hi> It was referr'd to the Lords Committees for Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, to consider whether it were a formal Appeal, or not.</p>
            <p>I must confess, it doth not clearly appear to me, what the true meaning, or ground of that Order is; for (as I now said) the Petition does expresly use the word (<hi>Appeal.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December Fol.</hi> 196. The Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Reported, That divers Lords Sub-Committees appointed to search for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, ☞cannot find that the word (<hi>Appeal</hi>) is usual in any Petition for any matter brought before them. This deserves to be noted.</p>
            <p>So that it seems the Lords Committees understood the meaning of their Order to be, to search for <hi>Precedents</hi> (if there had been any) where the Lords had used in former times to admit of, and to receive Appeals before them, against Decrees made in Chancery, or in any Court of Equity.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop further Reports, That they could not find so much as the word (<hi>Appeal</hi>) used in any Petition;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> and that it must have been by way of Petition, if any way. This shows the Novelty of it; for he likewise reports, That all matters complain'd of before the Lords must be by <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Petition, and in no other Form.</p>
            <p>And that the Ancient accustom'd Form of the Petitions must be (<hi>To the King and his Great Council</hi>;)<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note.</hi>
               </note> this is very observable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> here, That the Direction and Entitling of Petitions to <hi>the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled,</hi> omitting and leaving out the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55358:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King in the Direction (as it is now used, and hath been ever since King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> went away from the two Houses in 1641.) is not according to Ancient Form and Custom.</p>
            <p>And that the Ancient accustom'd Form was not to the Lords, by the Title of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal assembled in Parliament, as now used, but to <hi>the Great Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whom that great Council did consist of, and by whom Nominated and Constituted, I have made some conjecture, by what I have before in this Treatise discours'd of, concerning that <hi>Magnum Concilium in Parliamento</hi>; and concerning the ancient and constant usage till of late years, and until the separation between the said King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> of the King's appointing <hi>Triers of Petitions</hi> in every Parliament. Let the Reader take occasion here to look back upon what I have herein already discours'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, which may give light to this matter.</p>
            <p>In the last place, the Archbishop reports, That they could find but only one Precedent of this nature; which was a complaint by Petition against <hi>Michael de-la-Poole</hi> (Lord Chancellor) <hi>for matters of Corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Precedent I have mention'd before; for <hi>Michael de-la-Poole,</hi> Lord Chancellor, was accus'd in the Seventh year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> by <hi>Iohn Cavendish</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Fishmonger, for Bribery.</p>
            <p>I presume too, according to the usual Form of Petitions, (as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop reports them to be) that this Petition was directed <hi>to the King and his Great Council,</hi> and not <hi>to the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>assembled in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I conceive this only Precedent (as the Archbishop calls it) is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the same nature, (as hath been so frequently used of late, and still is) for an Appeal against a Decree meerly for Error in Judgment.</p>
            <p>For to Err in Judgment in making a Decree, and for the Judge that makes the Decree, to receive a Bribe in the case, are two different things; for to Err in Judgment (as <hi>Humanum est Errare</hi>) is of a meer civil Nature; but to be corrupt, and take a Bribe, though the Decree be just, is of a Criminal Nature; and therefore not to the purpose of what we are discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>And there are about 240 years distance in time, between this only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and the time of this search made by the Committee of Lords, <hi>viz.</hi> 18. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. (a large <hi>Casma</hi> in a usage and custom for the Exercise of a Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And the matter in hand must still be determin'd by Precedent and Custom. <hi>Consuetudo Parliamenti est Lex Parliamenti,</hi> is the old Rule.</p>
            <p>This complaint by Sir <hi>Iohn Bourchier</hi> was in a matter, not of Error in Judgment, for then that Error must in particular have been assign'd, and the Judge not have been reflected upon; but the complaint is of a Male-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration in the Judge (an hasty Hearing, and Witnesses not heard.) And therefore the Lords in that case censure the Petitioner for casting a scandal upon the Judge. For the Lords Examin'd the matter, and found the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of the Petition to be false. The Cause had had a deliberate Hearing, and the Petitioner's Witnesses had been heard; yet the Petitioner for the scandal had but an easy pennance, and that was remitted wholly, <hi>viz.</hi> to acknowledge this offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:55358:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>But note this was a proceeding against him upon his own Petition: He himself Entitled the Lords in this case to a Jurisdiction. It doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that any Adverse party was Summon'd to defend it, the Lord-Keeper himself defended it upon the point of scandal.</p>
            <p>There is yet another most Memorable Case in the very Journal of the Lords too, and that is Four years after. <hi>viz.</hi> 22. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. which is as followeth; and it comes strongly home to the point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Appeals.</hi>

            <p>It is to be found in the Journal of the Lords. 28. <hi>May</hi> 22. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>The Lords Committees, who were appointed by the whole House to Examine the Cause, Heard Council on both sides several days, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the House their Opinion for the Petitioner and Appellant.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Respondent, <hi>George Matthews,</hi> petitioned the Lord's House against that Report, and Opinion of the Committee; and in his Petition alledges, That he was inform'd by his Council, <hi>That it had been the course of the House to Reverse Decrees only by Bill legally Exhibited</hi>; that is, by a Bill to pass into an Act by Parliament; (for what can a Bill in that case other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise signify?) This shows, that the whole Parliament are the proper Judges of it.</p>
            <p>The Lord's House hereupon being tender and cautious how they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a new Jurisdiction, name another Committee of Lords, to set down an Order in that Cause.</p>
            <p>That Committee Report their Order, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cause be Review'd in Chancery by the Lord-Keeper, by such Lords as the Lords House should name, and by any Two of the Judges, as the Lord-Keeper should name,</p>
            <p>For which end the Lord-Keeper is to be an humble Suitor to the King from the House; to grant a <hi>Commission</hi> to himself (the Lord-Keeper) and the Lords to be named by the House.</p>
            <p>The Lords House approv'd of the Order, and named Seven Lords. The King granted the <hi>Commission</hi> accordingly, and the Decree in Chancery was Revers'd upon it.</p>

            <p>But the King's Commission is the true, regular, and warrantable ground and foundation of all the further Proceedings in that Case.</p>
            <p>And all this by the Direction, and with the Opinion and Judgment of the Lords themselves, in a Case wherein they had begun, and made a large progress in the Exercise of a Jurisdiction, and then wholly desisted.</p>

            <p>But as to the Remedy against an Erroneous Decree in Chancery, I have already given my advice at large in that former Treatise of mine before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, to which I refer my Reader. It is high time that it should be settled in some constant course.</p>
            <p>The Noble Author, suppos'd (as I said before) to be the late Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi> in his Book beforemention'd, hath asserted a very large Jurisdiction to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the House of Peers, which in the consequence, if it be observ'd and put in practice, will be of mighty concernment to the Subjects: Nor hath it been answer'd, or taken notice of by any, as far as I have heard.</p>
            <p>That Author ascribes to the Lords a power to try, and determine a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact in issue, although the Right of a Freehold depend upon it; and this, by Proofs without a Jury, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. and this he grounds upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of the case of <hi>William Paynel,</hi> the Record whereof is in <hi>Ryley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamentaria, Fol.</hi> 231. What then becomes of that great privilege of the people of <hi>England,</hi> of being tried by the Country, and by their Neighbours;? and inferior Courts of Equity will be very apt to tread in their steps, and do the like; and it deserves to be enquir'd into, if it be not already frequently so done.</p>
            <p>The Lords will not be likely to reform it upon Appeal from these Courts of Equity, if that should be assign'd for Error, if they themselves should practice it, as this Author says they may.</p>
            <p>Nor does that Precedent of <hi>William Paynell</hi> any way countenance that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for there the (<hi>Concilium Regis</hi>) gave Judgment upon Matter of Fact confess'd, where there needed no trial at all.</p>
            <p>The same Noble Author affirms, That the Lords may entertain or dismiss Causes as their occasions will give them leave, or as they have leisure from the greater affairs of the Kingdom; so that sometimes they cannot be at leisure to do Justice: If this Opinion be allow'd, <hi>Cessa regnare,</hi> says the Petitioner to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> when that King refus'd to answer her Petition for want of leisure.</p>
            <p>The Lords can (says the same Author) grant a temporary dismission to a Defendant, by an Entry made of <hi>Eat inde sine die ad praesens</hi>: but may Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon him again for the same Cause at another time when they think fit: If
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55358:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this be true, a man shall never know when his Cause is at an end; nay, the Chancery will give further costs after the Parties and Cause are out of the Court, and long after the whole matter is at end, without any new process.</p>
            <p>The persons of whom this high Judicature doth consist had need be men of great Learning in the Law, and of long Experience: For the matters that should come before them are such, as are too difficult for the inferior Courts to determine, and are very abstruse; and yet those inferior Courts are generally furnish'd with such as are of great Abilities, and long Experience, and usually spend Thirty or Forty years in hard study, to make them fit for the discharge of their Offices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be Learned ye that are Iudges of the Earth,</hi> says Almighty God, that Judge of Judges. Hence Governors are wont to be called Senators, and in the time of the <hi>Saxons</hi> they were called Eoldermen or Eldermen, for their Age, Gravity, and Experience.</p>
            <p>It would indeed be a Miracle in Nature, if any one could truly affirm of himself, <hi>Me jam jam à puero, illicò nasci Senem, or nasci Iudicem,</hi> to be able to judge in those abstruse and difficult Causes.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> being accus'd before <hi>Faelix,</hi> did (and that without insinuating flattery) tell his Judge, That he did the more cheerfully answer for himself, because <hi>Faelix</hi> had been (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledg'd) of many years a Judge unto that Nation: And he said the like when he stood before King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> because he knew him Expert. And it is a just and commendable course, always practis'd in all our inferior Courts. That after a Cause hath been pleaded, that both Parties, and Council, and Witnesses, and all others that will, are permitted to be present, and to hear the Repeating, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and true stating the Case by the Bench, and Court, and to hear the Debate of it, to observe, and be in a readiness to rectify any misapprehension, or mistake (if any happen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and so to set the Court right again.</p>
            <p>As also, that the grounds and reasons of the Opinions of the Judges may be known, that the People may the better know thereafter how to square their actions: And that the Law may be the better known to those that are subject to it. For there ought to be one certain known Rule of Law, whereby one and the same Case is to be determined, and not two or more contradictory Laws in one and the same place.</p>
            <p>It was a woful condition, when at the same time some were burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> for being Protestants, and others for being Papists; which made one cry out, <hi>Bone Deus, quomodo hic vivunt!</hi> &amp;c. Inferior Courts, and the Superior must judge by the same Law and Rule; for <hi>Misera est Servitus, ubi jus est vagum.</hi> And it is impossible to serve two contrary Masters; and it is a sad case, where the Trumpet of the Law gives an uncertain sound, for then a man knows not how to order his affairs.</p>
            <p>There may indeed be a different Method, and Course of Proceedings in the several Courts, and yet all conform to the same Law. And it is sometimes said by our Judges, that what is Law in the Exchequer is Law also in the King's-Bench, and Common-Pleas.</p>
            <p>If it were otherwise, great Confusion would arise. And this Law is not known by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, it is not infus'd all at once, but acquir'd by long Study, and long Experience.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> in his Advancement of Learning, <hi>pag.</hi> 445. holds it just, that Judges should alledge the reasons of their Sentence, and that openly in the Audience of all the Court.</p>
            <p>And anciently amongst us in <hi>England,</hi> the Courts used to enter the reasons given by the Judges, upon the Record of the Judgment; which is now suppli'd in some measure, by Reports of Cases adjudg'd, and of the Arguments at Bar, and at Bench.</p>
            <p>But we have few or no Reports of Cases adjudg'd in the Supreme Court, since those that are printed by Mr. <hi>Ryley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that ancient Cause of <hi>Adelwold,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times under King <hi>Eldred,</hi> the Record mentions, that the Bishop himself, <hi>Coram cunctis suam cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam patefecit.</hi> He pleaded his Cause himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qua Rebenè, &amp; ritè, ac Apertè, ab Omnibus discussa,</hi> (it was openly debated) <hi>Omnes reddiderunt Iudicium.</hi> This was at the <hi>Miccel-Gemot,</hi> there was no withdrawing.</p>
