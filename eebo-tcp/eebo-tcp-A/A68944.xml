         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of former Letters, concerning other voyages by one of
theſe fiue trauellers formerly performed, directed to the
ſaid Gentleman <hi>Bezaliel Biddulph:</hi> I could not ſatisfie my
ſelfe vntill (by the meanes of friends) I came to the ſight
of the reſt alſo, which were many in number, at leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:2104:4"/>
twenty letters, beſides the voyage to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> all dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vnto one man: Some by the Preacher aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
maiſter <hi>William Biddulph:</hi> and ſome by his brother
<hi>Peter Biddulph</hi> Lapidarie and Diamond cutter in thoſe
Countries. Out of all which Letters I haue gathered the
matter therein contained, (leauing out onely ſome ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and priuate matters) and haue thought good (for
the helpe of Trauellers and delight of others) to make
one body of them, and (without the conſent of either of
them) to put them in print. For the one of theſe two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
is yet beyond the Seas; the other (after ten yeeres
trauell) is lately arriued into England, and hath ſundrie
times beene requeſted (by diuers of his good friends) to
publiſh his trauels, but he could neuer be perſwaded ſo
to doe, but anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he knew how to ſpend his time
better, and that he was not ignorant of the incredulitie
of others in ſuch caſes, who wil hardly beleeue any thing
but that which they themſelues haue ſeene; and when
they heare any thing that ſeemeth ſtrange vnto them,
they reply, that trauellers may lie by authority: but they
are liers themſelues which ſay ſo; for trauellers haue no
more authority to lie than others, neither will they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
vnto themſelues more liberty to lie than others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
being men that feare God, as they (of all others)
ſhould be, who goe downe to the Sea in ſhips, and ſee
the workes of the Lord both by Sea and by Land, and
his wonders in the deepe.</p>
            <p>In regard whereof, hee hath beene ſo farre from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his trauels, that he (being a very modeſt man) taketh
no delight to ſpeake thereof, except it be vnto ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friend. But for that old acquaintance which I
haue had with him (hauing beene his ſchollar) and that
<pb facs="tcp:2104:5"/>
mutuall loue betwixt vs of long continuance; I was ſo
bold to make knowen vnto him, that I had ſeene all the
letters which both he and his brother <hi>Peter Biddulph</hi> had
written to their friend <hi>Bezaliel Biddulph,</hi> (wherein they
diſcourſed of all their trauels) and what paines I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to gather them together for mine owne delight, and
direction in my trauels, which I purpoſed ſhortly to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.
Whereupon he requeſted mee to keepe them
ſecret to my ſelfe, which I told him I had done, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I had read in one of his letters to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bezaliel
Biddulph,</hi> the like requeſt, which hee made vnto him in
theſe words: <hi>I pray you keepe my Letters to your ſelfe, lest
whiles to giue content vnto you in writing what you would, I
receiue diſcontent my ſelfe in hearing what I would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heereby I found him very affable, and willing to
conferre with me of his trauels, and to giue me direction
for mine, and to reſolue me in any thing I deſired, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
my purpoſe of imprinting them, when (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with him and other trauellers into thoſe parts)
I had perfected them. Yet, foraſmuch as a publike good
is to be preferred before a priuate, I could not but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
vnto others that which I my ſelfe had learned of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
For that which <hi>Perſius</hi> ſpeaketh interrogatiuely,
in this caſe I vnderſtand poſitiuely:</p>
            <q>Scire tuum nihil eſt, niſi te ſcire hoc ſciat alter:</q>
            <p>That is,</p>
            <q>
               <l>It is nothing for thee a good thing to know,</l>
               <l>Vnleſſe thou impart it toothers alſo.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2104:5"/>
And who knoweth what good may redounde vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by reading of this diſcourſe of other Countries?
For hereby all men may ſee how God hath bleſſed our
Countrie aboue others, and be ſtirred vp to thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Hereby ſubiects may learne to loue, honour, and obey
their good and gratious King, when they ſhall reade of
the tyrannous gouernement of other Countries, and of
the mercifull gouernement of theirs.</p>
            <p>Heereby hearers may learne to loue and reuerence
their Paſtors, and to thank God for the ineſtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the preaching of the word amongſt them; when
they ſhall reade in what blindneſſe and palpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
other nations liue, not knowing the right hand
from the left in matters that concerne the kingdome of
Heauen, and yet reuerence and honour their blind guids
and ſuperſtitious Church-men like Angels, and prouide
for their maintenance roially.</p>
            <p>Heere wiues may learne to loue their husbands, when
they ſhal read in what ſlauery women liue in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and in what awe and ſubiection to their husbands,
and what libertie and freedome they themſelues enioy.</p>
            <p>Heereby ſeruants may bee taught to be faithfull and
dutifull to their Maſters, when they ſhall read of the
brutiſh and barbarous immanitie in other Countries of
maſters towards their ſeruants; who not only beat them
like dogs, but ſell them at their pleaſure, and ſometimes
kill them for ſmall offences.</p>
            <p>Heere rich men may learne to be thankefull to God,
not onely for their libertie and freedome of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and perſons; but of their goods alſo: when they
ſhall read, how in other contries no man is maſter of his
<pb facs="tcp:2104:6"/>
owne, but as the fatteſt oxe is neereſt vnto the ſlaughter,
ſo the richeſt men are neereſt vnto death.</p>
            <p>Here poore men may learne to be thankefull to God
for their benefactors, and not to be repining and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
beggers (as many of them are) when they ſhal read
how in other countries the poore liue like brute beaſtes,
on graſſe and water, the rich hauing no more mercie on
them, then the rich glutton had of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere they that trauell in England may learne what a
benefit it is to haue the refuge of Innes in their trauell,
and bee content to pay well for it, where they are well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
wheras in other countries they lodge without dores
all night and carie their prouiſion with them.</p>
            <p>And the publiſhing hereof without the Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
may perhaps bee an inducement vnto him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
this diſcourſe, by adding thereunto the diuerſities
of Religions in thoſe countries, and what conference and
diſputation he hath had with Iewes, Ieſuites, and people
of ſundry other countries: and by perfiting any thing
which herein ſhall be thought imperfect.</p>
            <p>And yet I haue had conference with one of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and ſhewed his Letters vnto many other trauellers
of good iudgement, who haue beene in thoſe parts, and
all of them ſubſcribe vnto the trueth of euery thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained. And of my ſelfe I haue ſet downe nothing
but what I either haue found in the Letters of theſe two
brethren (maſter <hi>William Biddulph,</hi> and <hi>Peter Biddulph</hi>)
or elſe (by conference with one of them and ſundry other
trauellers of credit) heard ſpoken and deliuered for truth.</p>
            <p>Onely in two things (I confeſſe) I haue beene ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bold with mine Authors. Firſt, in the number of
their: letters for whereas they wrote very many letters,
<pb facs="tcp:2104:6"/>
and his companions went thither onely as trauellers to
ſee the Holy Land.</p>
            <p>Againe, if it were his owne doing, he being both wiſe
and Religious (as hee is accounted) would neuer bee ſo
ſimple to publiſh his owne diſgrace in Printe, in going
to Maſſe, and obſeruing many other ceremonies as are
mentioned in that booke which goeth foorth vnder his
name.</p>
            <p>In the voiage of the fiue Engliſhmen from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi>
(which is the laſt letter) I haue written only of their
trauels thither, and ſuch things as they ſaw there, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their returne, for I could not meet with any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherein my Authour had written thereof, neither
could I learne it of him by conference with him, for
when I ſpake vnto him thereof, deſiring him to ſet it
downe in writing for my further direction, I could haue
no other anſwere of him but this which <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſpake to
Queene <hi>Dido,</hi> as <hi>Vigil.</hi> ſetteth it downe <hi>Aeneid. lib.</hi> 2.</p>
            <q>Infandum regina iubes renouare dolorem.</q>
            <p>that is,</p>
            <q>
               <l>A dolefull worke me to renew</l>
               <l>(Deare friend) you craue, wherefore adew.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Whereby I perceiued he tooke no pleaſure to talke of
it, and leſſe to write of it. The reaſon, I vnderſtood by
others; becauſe it was more dangerous, troubleſome,
and tedious to him then all the reſt of his voiage: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
nights they ſlept in the open fields, when it rained all
night exceeding faſt, and in the day time they were often
<pb facs="tcp:2104:7"/>
dangered by theeues, and oftentimes in the night they
were glad to hire a guard to watch whiles they ſlept, for
feare leſt their throats ſhould be cut whiles they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe:
and many other miſeries they were ſubiect vnto,
as hunger and thirſt, heate in the day, cold (being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borles)
in the night.</p>
            <p>And beſides many miſeries which hee hath indured
by land; he hath very narrowly eſcaped many extreame
dangers by Sea, whereof I will mention only one, which
I haue heard, not only from his owne mouth (with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
memorie vnto God for his miraculous and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
preſeruation) but alſo from others who were in the
ſame danger with him. In relation whereof they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in one, that it was on this manner.</p>
            <p>Ann. Dom. 1605 Febr. 9. He, with ſome other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen,
viz. <hi>Sampſon Newport,</hi> and his brother <hi>Edward
Newport, Edward Concke, Martin Kentiſh, William Welch,
Thomas Mania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d,</hi> and others: hauing occaſion to trauell
from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Zante</hi> (for want of an Engliſh ſhip)
imbarked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in a <hi>Raguzean</hi> ſhip which was bound
thither. Wherein they ſailed ſafely, vntill they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> or the 53. Iles in the Arches, where
they were a while becalmed ouer againſt <hi>Milo,</hi> where
they were minded to touch.</p>
            <p>But ſuddenly this calme was turned to a ſtorme, which
ſpeedily droue them out of the ſight of <hi>Milo,</hi> and <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milo,</hi>
and ſo confounded the <hi>Raguzean</hi> Mariners (being
no skilfull Nauigators) that they knew not where they
were, (an vncomfortable caſe in ſuch a dangerous place,
amongſt ſo many Ilands ſo thicke together.) Before them
they ſawe land in three places, yet none of them knew
whether it were the maine land, or ſome Iland, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:2104:7"/>
were ignorant what courſe to take. The prouidence
of God ſo directed, that they paſſed ſo neere the Ile <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigotta,</hi>
as ſeldome or neuer any ſhip did, and not ruſh
vpon the rockes.</p>
            <p>When they were paſt this Iland, they were out of the
Arches or <hi>Cyclades,</hi> and had ſea-roome inough, which
was ſome comfort.</p>
            <p>But the ignorance of the Mariners, The violence of
the ſtorme, The weaknes of the ſhip, and the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the company with whom he was ſhipped, were
great cauſes of diſcomfort.</p>
            <p>The Mariners were ignorant, not accuſtomed to ſaile
by compas or cunding of the ſhip, but by the eie and
view, and to be ſtill in ſight of land, The ſtorme ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
more vehemently, and continued three daies and
three nights together; during which time, they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eate nor drinke, nor ſleepe. The ſhip was weake and
halfe full of water, ready to be ſplit in pieces with euery
blaſt of wind, or to bee deuoured by euery waue of the
Sea.</p>
            <p>The boat which the ſhip towed after her, was cut off,
and let goe at randome without hope of euer ſeeing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
leſt it ſhould be full of water, and ſinke, and draw
the ſhip alſo vnder water. The companie as they were
of diuers nations, ſo of diuers natures: and as they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in religion, ſo likewiſe in their conuerſation and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
during the continuance of this tempeſt. For the
ſtorme increaſed, the aire thundered, the winds bluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Sea raged, and the waues thereof ariſing like
mightie mountaines, toſſed vp the ſhip (to vſe the Poets
<hi>Hyperbole</hi>) ſometimes as high as heauen, and by and by
tumbled her downe againe as low as hell; ſo that (as the
<pb facs="tcp:2104:8"/>
Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh, Pſal. 107. 27.) <hi>They were toſſed to and
fro, and ſtaggered like drunken men, and all their cunning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone,</hi> euery man called vpon his god (like the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in <hi>Ionas</hi> ſhip.) The <hi>Raguzeans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the gods and goddeſſes, the Hee Saints, and She
Saints, and caſt <hi>Grand Benedicta</hi> into the ſea, to aſſwage
the madnes therof. Which nothing preuailing, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the ſhip called maſter <hi>Samſon Newport</hi> (an Engliſh
Merchant) and told him in Italian that hee vnderſtood
that the Signior <hi>Reuerendo Dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore Ingleſe:</hi> that is, That the
reuerend Engliſh Doctor (who was in his ſhip) had bin
at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and requeſted him to ſpeake vnto him, if he
had any holy reliques in his cheſt which hee brought
from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to giue him ſome to throw into the Sea,
to pacifie the rage thereof. M. <hi>Newport</hi> made anſwer,
that he knew that their Engliſh Preacher had no ſuch
Reliques as he deſired.</p>
            <p>Then there was nothing amongſt the ſuperſtitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
but weeping and wringing of hands; ſome prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
boards ready to caſt themſelues into the Sea, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at euery blaſt when the ſhip would bee diſiointed
and ſhaken aſunder: Others pattering on beads, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
large vowes to <hi>Madonna de Lauretta,</hi> if ſhee would
deliuer them; and to this Saint and that Saint, if they
eſcaped.</p>
            <p>The Maſter of the ſhip, called <hi>Andrea,</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Stephano,</hi> (being both owners of the ſhip) ſaid, that
ſurely the Engliſh Doctor was a Coniurer, for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaw him without a booke in his hand, but ſtill read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vntill (by his learning) he had raiſed a ſtorme vpon
them; and thought it beſt to make a <hi>Ionas</hi> of him, and
to caſt both him and his books into the Sea: which they
<pb facs="tcp:2104:8"/>
had done indeed, if God (in mercy towards him) had
not preuented them; for our Engliſhmen (like good
Chriſtians) hauing learned out of the Scriptures (Pſal.
46. 1.) That <hi>God is a pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

promiſed to deliuer them that call vpon him in time of
trouble, gaue themſelues both iointly and ſeuerally to
praier, and all the time of this tempeſt <hi>cried vnto the Lord
in their trouble, and he brought them out of their diſtreſſe.
He turned the ſtorme to calme, ſo that the waues thereof were
ſtill.</hi> And ſo (at length) by the prouidence of God, they
came all ſafely to their deſired Port, where they heard
of many ſhips (as ſome reported, fiftie) which were caſt
away in that ſtorme, out of which they were deliuered.
Many ſuch deſperate plunges hath he eſcaped in his ten
yeeres trauell, which I haue heard of, but forbeare (for
breuities ſake) to ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, I thought it not meet to preſſe
him any further therewith, leſt the remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
miſeries, ſhould be a cauſe of freſh ſorowes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he hath indured much hardneſſe both by ſea and
by land, &amp; ſo much as may ſeeme admirable, yea, almoſt
incredible that ſuch a ſpare leane man, and of ſuch a
weake body (as he ſeemed to be of) ſhould endure in ten
yeeres tedious trauell together. And yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his continuall dangers both by ſea and by land, hee
hath continued ſtill to preach the Goſpel conſtantly and
boldly (in Heathen countries) both by ſea and by land;
receiued great honour amongſt them; and is now at
length (by the prouidence of God) returned into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
countrie in health and ſafety to preach the Goſpell
whereſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God to call him: and is at this
<pb facs="tcp:2104:9"/>
day the greateſt traueller (of a man of his calling, that I
know) in all England both by ſea and land.</p>
            <p>By land, he hath trauelled further then <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the
ſame way that <hi>Iacob</hi> did from <hi>Hebron</hi> to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi>
and hath had as hard lodging in his trauell as <hi>Iacob</hi> had,
viz. the ground to his bed, a ſtone for his pillow, the skie
for his couering, and ſometimes the aire for his ſupper.</p>
            <p>By Sea, farther then S. <hi>Paul,</hi> then <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or <hi>Vlyſſes</hi>
haue done, and all the whole way that they all haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled,
and further.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (gentle Reader) if thou take in good part
theſe his trauels, and my paines and labour in collecting
them together, it may perhaps encourage him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
them, and me to procure them, and to adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
his conference and diſputations with Iewes, Ieſuits,
and ſundry other nations (which I vnderſtand hee hath
had with them) and ſuch arguments as haue beene vſed
on both ſides, &amp; letters in ſundry languages which haue
beene written on both ſides from one to another.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, I leaue him (with his foure fellow
trauellers) ſoiourning at the earthly Ieruſalem; and thee

This citie is in forme like vnto a top-ſaile, broad below, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

a ſtrong Caſtle neere vnto the water ſide. It was firſt called

of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> who in the time of the ciuil warre betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
<hi>Pompey,</hi> valiantly defended <hi>Pompeyes</hi> part. By the Moores and
Turkes at this day it is called <hi>Iezaier,</hi> but by the Spaniards it is
called <hi>Algier.</hi> The people of this place, and the Spaniards are
bitter enemies, and annoy one another oftentimes.</p>
            <p>About 300. leagues from <hi>Argier</hi> wee ſaw <hi>Teddel,</hi> a citie in
<hi>Affrica,</hi> and cape <hi>Bonne,</hi> which was formerly called <hi>Hyppo,</hi> where

their wings are wet, which is not farre, but oft agables length.
<hi>Porpiſces</hi> and many other ſtrange and deformed fiſhes we ſaw in
our voiage, the names whereof we knew not. We ſaw alſo ſword
fiſhes and threſhers: which two kind of fiſhes are deadly enemies

<hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the earth whereof will ſuffer no venemous
thing to liue: we ſaw alſo an Ile called now <hi>Pantalarea,</hi> but of
old it was called <hi>Paconia.</hi> It is very full of hils and rockes:
there groweth great quantity of Cotton, Capers, Figs, Melons
and Reiſings. The Iland is full of ceſternes. They ſay, that
not onely the men of that Iland, but the women alſo are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good ſwimmers, but whether they be all ſo or not, I know
not: but ſure I am, we ſaw one woman come ſwimming from
thence to our ſhip (being becalmed) with a baſket of fruite to
ſell. The Ile is but thirtie miles in length, and ten miles in
breadth.</p>
            <p>The day following, we ſaw <hi>Sicilia,</hi> a famous Iland in the
<hi>Tyrrhen</hi> ſea,<note place="margin">Sicilia.</note> 618. miles about. The Iland is moſt pleaſant,
and no leſſe fertile. In this Iland is <hi>Aetna,</hi> an high hill, burning
continnally with brimſtone: it is now called <hi>Mons Gibelli;</hi> out
of this hill riſeth moſt horrible ſmoake, and flames of fire, and
ſometimes burning ſtones in great number. I haue heard that
in this Ile there is a water whereinto if a dog be caſt, he will die
preſently, but being taken out and caſt into another water neere
vnto it, he liueth againe, but this I haue not ſeene, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

rocke called <hi>Scylla,</hi> and ouer againſt this dangerous
rocke, there is a gulfe of the ſea called <hi>Charibdis,</hi> commonly at
this day called the <hi>Kirbies.</hi> It is a very dangerous place, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

<hi>Scylla:</hi> Marriners which ſaile betwixt theſe two, are

            </q>
            <p>And in the <hi>Terrhen</hi> ſea by <hi>Sicilie</hi> there is another Ile called

that is 150. miles, accounting three leagues to a mile.</p>
            <p>Ouer againſt cape <hi>Paſſera</hi> (which is a marke for Marriners
at the Eaſtward end of <hi>Sicilia</hi>) there is an Iland called <hi>Malta,</hi>

where (vpon ſome occaſion) we touched. It is that Iland men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

his companions (I mean Proteſtants or any good Chriſtians)
to the fire in kindnes to warme them, they will rather in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie
caſt them into the fire to burne them. Then a viper came
on <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, and hee ſhooke him off without hurt: but now
there are ſo manie viperous people there, who vſe ſo ſtrict In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſtion

            <p>The next places of any note, which wée ſaw,<note place="margin">Zephalonia.</note> were two
Ilands in <hi>Graecia,</hi> namely, <hi>Zephalonia</hi> and <hi>Zante,</hi> betwixt
which two our Ship paſſed. Both of them are inhabited by
<hi>Greekes,</hi> but gouerned by the Signiory of <hi>Venice,</hi> who every
third yéere ſend <hi>Prouidores</hi> with other Officers to rule there.
They are both very fruitfull Ilands, yéelding great ſtore of
currance, oliues, pomecitrons, oringes, and lemmons, but
ſmall ſtore of corne, which they continually fetch from other
Countries. If through extremity of wether, or danger of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
or curſares, corne be not duly brought vnto them, in
ſhort time they are ready to famiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zephalonia</hi> was of old called <hi>Ithaca,</hi> where <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> the ſonne
of <hi>Laertes</hi> was King, who excelled all other <hi>Greeks</hi> in eloquence
and ſubtilty of wit. He is commended by ancient Writers, for
a famous Traueller: but if he were liuing in theſe daies, his
trauels would be counted nothing, in reſpect of the trauels of
many other now liuing: for he trauelled but betwixt <hi>Venice</hi>
and <hi>Egypt</hi> which is now a common voyage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zante,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zante<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> of old was called <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> it was ſomtimes a wooddy
Ile in the ſea <hi>Ionium,</hi> on the Weſt of <hi>Peloponeſus.</hi> But there
is now very little wood in it. It is hilly round about, but the
middle of it is a plaine and fruitfull valley, yéelding great ſtore
of Currance, which are brought from thence into <hi>England.</hi> The
<hi>Greekes</hi> wonder what we vſe to doe with ſo many Currance,
and aſke ſometimes whether we vſe to dye with them, or feed
Hogges with them. They were a very poore kind of people,
when our Engliſh Marchants vſed traffique there firſt: but
now they are growen rich and proud.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a citie in that Ile called <hi>Zante</hi> by the name of the
Iland, which citie was built by <hi>Zacynthus</hi> ſonne to <hi>Dardanus,</hi>
who raigned there. We ſtaied ten dayes in the rode of this city
before we could get Pratticke, that is: leaue to come amongſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2104:13"/>
them, or to vſe traffique with them, for their cuſtome is not to
giue preſent Pratticke vnto any ſtrangers, vnleſſe they bring a
letter of health from the place whence they come, which we had
not. And therefore ſome of our companie who had buſineſſe
there, we ſent to the <hi>Lazaretta,</hi> which is a place like vnto the peſt
houſe in More-fields, where, though they be in health, yet there
they muſt ſtay ſo long as it pleaſeth the Signiors of health,
which is ſometime twenty, and ſometimes forty dayes: and
in the meane time, if any of their companie fall ſicke, though it
be at the end of fortie daies, yet muſt they ſtay forty daies lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
So long as they are kept without Pratticke, they haue a
Guardian ſet to watch them that they come into no companie,
neither any man into theirs: yet may their friends come to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
them, and ſtanding farre off, may ſpeake with them, but if
they come too neere them, the Guardian will cry out vnto them,
<hi>Alargo, alargo,</hi> that is: Stand backe. And whoſoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
ſo néere them as to touch them, looſeth his owne Pratticke, and
muſt kéepe them companie during their continuance there. If
they bring any letters for any Merchants in the Citie, the Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wil open them &amp; aire them at the fice before he wil deliuer
them. But if the letter be ſowed (or if there bee any thread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them) they muſt not be deliuered vntill they that brought
them haue Prattick. And this they doe vnder pretence of auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſickneſſe: but they haue a further meaning therein, <hi>viz.</hi>
partly to get money and bribes; and partly to bee acquainted
with the buſineſſe of all commers, and what commodities they
bring. And whoſoeuer preſumeth to come on ſhoare without
Pratticke, is in danger of hanging, or hauing the ſtrappado. And
though they haue a certificate that there is health in the place
from whence they came, yet muſt they not come on ſhoare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haue ſhewed their <hi>Fede,</hi> or <hi>Neate patent</hi> vnto three
officers, called Signiors of health.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zante</hi> is very much ſubiect vnto earthquakes. There is no
yeere paſſeth without many earthquakes, eſpecially in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
of September and October, in which moneths I haue

whereof they build houſes very lowe, leſt they ſhould bee

an <hi>Italian</hi> ſhip being in great diſtreſſe by extremity of wether in

manner: <hi>O bleſſed Virgin, deliuer me out of this danger, and J
will offer vnto thee (if I come ſafely to Gazopo) a candle as bigge

plucked him by the ſhoulders, and ſaid, O maſter, what doe

For it is impoſſible you ſhould performe it. Whereunto he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
Hold thy peace foole, it concerneth vs to ſpeake faire now
we are in danger, and to make large promiſes: but if ſhe deliuer
vs, I will make her content with a candle of ſeuen or eight in

whom I haue heard of, who in a dangerous ſtorme, ſéeing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>From <hi>Madonna de Gazopo</hi> we ſailed along by <hi>Albania,</hi> and
were driuen with a croſſe winde to <hi>Ottronto</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> at the

            <p>After we came as high as the Iland <hi>Creta,</hi> which is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Candie,</hi> we left the way towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> and entred into

the Arches (called <hi>Archipellago</hi>) betwixt <hi>Cerigo</hi> and <hi>Cerigotta.

            <p>About twenty leagues from <hi>Cerigo,</hi> we touched at an Iland

and yéeldeth great ſtore of milſtones and dymmety, which are

we tooke boat to ſaile to ſée another Iland not farre from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>

            <p>About twenty miles from <hi>Delos</hi> there is another Ile called

               <hi>Seriphus,</hi> by an inhabitant whereof <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was

            <p>But the moſt famous and fruitfull Iland in all the <hi>Arches</hi> at

               <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 15.) ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe it reſembleth the Gréeke letter <hi>Chi</hi> in forme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion:

<hi>Methrodorus, Chio,</hi> of the <hi>Nymph Chione;</hi> and (as others ſay)
<hi>Macrine</hi> or <hi>Pythioſa;</hi> but at this day called <hi>Syo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Iland is inhabited chiefly by Gréekes, but gouerned
by Turkes. It is full of gardens, oringes, lemmons, citrons,
figs, peares, apples, pruans, apricocks, dates, and oliues: and
likewiſe of all ſorts of hearbes, ſwéet flowers, good and holeſome
waters. There is alſo great ſtore of maſtick in this <hi>Iland,</hi> which
is gathered of certaine trées like vnto <hi>Lentiſcos</hi> trées, in this
manner: About the beginning of the moneths of <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi>
the huſbandmen with a ſharpe pointed iron, doe rent and
cut the barke of the trées in diuers places, and out of theſe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and cuts procéedeth the maſticke by drops, as it were
gumme, which they gather in the moneth of September fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Iland</hi> are alſo great ſtore of Partriges, which both
in colour and quality doe much differ from ours. Their colour
is ſomewhat red, and they are as tame as though they were
chickens or hens. In certaine villages of this <hi>Iland,</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people doe féed them by great flocks, driuing them in the day
time to graſe in the mountaines; and towards night, the boyes
or girles (which doe kéepe them) doe call them together by a
whiſtle or ſong. And theſe Partriges being accuſtomed to ſuch
calls, preſently euery flocke (which ſometimes are two or thrée
hundred) gather to their conducter, which bringeth them home
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2104:16"/>
to their village and dwelling, as though they were hens, or
tame géeſe. They goe alſo a feeding by ſmall flocks in the ſtréets
of the City.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Iland</hi> is one of the ſeuen which contended for <hi>Homers</hi>

Emperous,</hi> which were firſt to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> and giue
place to the Popes, becauſe, both Emperours and Popes could
not raigne together in one Citie. And that hinderance was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away long ſince, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great tranſlated his
imperiall Seat to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and indowed the Popes with
the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy</hi> lying about it.</p>
            <p>The Emperours then being farre off, and (by reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
warres with <hi>Saracens</hi> and enemies in the Eaſt) notable
to maintaine their own right in the Weſt, the Popes incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon them too far, and vſurped ſo much authoritie, that they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2104:20"/>
diſcarded them cleane in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at their pleaſure ſet vp other
Emperours in the Weſt, but ſuch as would take an oath to bée
ſubiect to the Apoſtolike Sée of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledge the
Popes to be vniuerſall Biſhops. So the hinderance was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> remooued to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and
Antichriſt was manifeſtly diſcloſed not long after when <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
the third obtained the title of Vniuerſall Biſhop, which
was 900. yéeres agoe, for (as <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith) none but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
would aſſume vnto him ſuch a title.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had no regard to any prophecie, when

to be ſo ſituated (whereas otherwiſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had once
thought to haue ſetled elſewhere) as that it was (as you would
ſay,) the nauel or middeſt vnto the whole <hi>Romane</hi> iuriſdiction,
which, as we know, ſpread it ſelfe farre and néere: and yet it
could not poſſibly otherwiſe fall out, becauſe that ſo the <hi>Romane</hi>

which God before had reuealed. So the prouidence of God gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this whole enterpriſe of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ſo fulfilled what
himſelfe had decréed.</p>
            <p>Hereby you may perceiue two cauſes wherefore <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
remoued from <hi>Rome.</hi>

that he who hath deſerued well, ought not to be forgotten, but
with all duties of loue and kindneſſe remembred and regarded.
And that foule vice of ingratitude I haue alwaies abhorred;
yea the very ſuſpicion thereof I haue euer deteſted, as a vice
moſt odious and deteſtable both to God and all good men.
Wherefore if all loue require loue againe, I were moſt vnkind
if I would not requite your loue towards me, with mutuall
loue and gratefull memorie. But the cauſe of my long ſilence

the Grand-ſigniors Paſſe ſhewed for all the paſſengers in the

away. Yet if the maſter of the ſhip pay extraordinarily, they
may more ſpéedily be diſpatched: and many giue very liberally
(when they haue a good winde) rather than they will be ſtaied

            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Rhodes</hi> we came to <hi>Cyprus,</hi>

There is great ſtore of cotten-woollgrowing in this <hi>Iland,</hi>
and exceeding good wine made héere, and the beſt dimetey, with
other good commodities. From hence a French Gentleman
(who came in our ſhip from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) imbarked himſelfe
for <hi>Ioppa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioppa</note> with a purpoſe to goe to <hi>Ieruſalem. Ioppa</hi> is not two

            </p>
            <p>But our Ship from <hi>Cyprus</hi> went to <hi>Tripoly</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tripoly in Syria.</note> a City
on the maine land of <hi>Syria,</hi> néere vnto <hi>Mount Lybanus,</hi> which

(as the ſimple inhabitants thereof ſuppoſe) therefore it is called

to embrace the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> and yéeld themſelues to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> making large promiſes vnto them if they
would ſo doe: whereof they deliberated long, but in the end
yéelded, vpon condition they might haue liberty to vſe their
owne Liturgie, and Ceremonies, and Lents (for they ſtrictly
obſerue foure Lents in the yéere) and other cuſtomes. Euer
ſince which time, the Pope hath and doth maintaine ſome of
their children at <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe Chriſtians which dwell vpon
<hi>Mount Lybanus,</hi> are called <hi>Maronites:</hi> they are very ſimple and
ignorant people, yet ciuill, kinde, and curteous to ſtrangers.

growing together, as bigge as the greateſt oakes, with diuers

Cedars which haue growen on <hi>Mount Lybanus,</hi> yet now there
are very few, for we ſaw none but theſe 24. neither heard of
any other but in one place more. At theſe Cedars many <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranes</hi>

            <p>From theſe Cedars we returned towards <hi>Tripoly</hi> another

mountaine, from whence the water runneth downe into a
déepe valley betwixt the Patriarkes houſe and the hill, and in
the fall, the water maketh an excéeding great noiſe, like vnto
that <hi>Catadupa</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where the fall of <hi>Nilus</hi> maketh ſuch
a noiſe, that the people are made deafe therewith that dwell
neere it. This place is ſomewhat like vnto it in fall, but not in
effect: for this water being not ſo great as <hi>Nilus,</hi> maketh not
the like noiſe, neither worketh the like effect. There is alſo an
extraordinary <hi>Eccho</hi> thereabout.</p>
            <p>One ſide of the Patriarkes houſe is a naturall rocke, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of hewen ſtones and ſquared timber: a very ſtrong houſe,
but not very large, nor ſpetious to behold. So are alſo many
of their houſes, in moſt of their villages, built againſt a rocke,
as a wall vnto one ſide of it,<note place="margin">That is, Lord Ioseph.</note> eſpecially <hi>Emeer Vſeph</hi> his houſe,

read and ſung very reuerently, with Confeſſions, Praiers,
Thankeſgiuings, the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> ſung, and Chapters
both out of the old Teſtament and the new diſtinctly read. It
reioyced me greatly to ſee their order: and I obſerued in theſe
ancient Chriſtians called <hi>Nazarites,</hi> the antiquitie of vſing ſet
formes of Praiers in Churches, and alſo the neceſſitie thereof,
that the people might haue ſomething to ſay Amen vnto, being
read in their mother tongue, that they may learne to pray priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
by thoſe Praiers which they daily heare read publikely.

            <p>And although their Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> bee counted
their chiefe Patriarch: yet I haue knowen one <hi>Mileſius</hi> (a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

preferred to the place by maſter <hi>Edward Barton,</hi> an Engliſh
Gentleman, and Lord Ambaſſadour for Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of
famous memorie, (and the mirror of all Ambaſſadours that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>After whoſe death, this good man <hi>Mileſius</hi> was by the Gréeks
diſplaced from being Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> (which they
durſt not doe whiles maſter <hi>Barton</hi> was liuing) becauſe, being
a man of knowledge, he laboured to reforme the Greekes from
many of their ſuperſtitious cuſtomes. Whereupon (preſently
after the death of maſter <hi>Barton</hi>) they ſaid their Patriarch was
an Engliſhman, and no Gréeke, and therefore Manzulled him,
that is: diſplaced him. Yet bearing ſome reuerence towards
him for his learning, made him Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And
being there Patriarch, he excommunicated the Patriarch of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochia,</hi>
becauſe he accepted of reliefe at the Popes hand; and
made him come to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to humble himſelfe vnto him,
and acknowledge his fault before he would ſuffer him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his Patriarkes office.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Henry Lello</hi> (a learned, wiſe, and religious Engliſh

and in many things excéeded him, eſpecially in his religious
carriage and vnſpotted life: and had not the times béene more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2104:32"/>
troubleſome in his regiment, than in the time of his predeceſſor
Maſter <hi>Barton;</hi> he would euery way haue gone beyond him.
He firſt of all reformed his family, and afterwards ſo ordered
himſelfe in his whole carriage, that he credited our Countrey:
and after ten yéeres gouernment of the Engliſh Nation there,
he returned into his Countrey with the teares of many, &amp; with
generall good report of al Nations there dwelling or ſoiourning;
&amp; is worthily by his excellent Maieſty rewarded with Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

After this (<hi>ſaith</hi> Daniel) I ſaw in the viſions by night, and behold,
the fourth beaſt was fearefull, and terrible, and very ſtrong. It
had great iron teeth; It deuoured, and brake in peeces, and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the reſidue vnder his feet; and it was vnlike to the beaſts that
were before it, for it had ten hornes. <hi>Hitherto ſpake</hi> Daniel <hi>of

            <p>
               <hi>Now followeth the Prophecie of the Turkiſh Kingdome, in
theſe words,</hi> Dan. 7. 8. As I conſidered the hornes, behold, there
came vp among them another little horne, before whom there
were three of the firſt hornes pluckt away. And behold, in this
horne were eies like the eies of a man, and a mouth ſpeaking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous

            <p>And afterwards, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>The fourth beaſt ſhall be the fourth
Kingdome in the earth, which ſhall bee vnlike to all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,

downe, and breake it in peeces. And the ten hornes out of this
Kingdome, are ten Kings that ſhall riſe; and another ſhall riſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and diligence, he ſo inſinuated and wrought himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the good fauour and liking both of his maſter and miſtreſſe,
that when his maſter died, and had leaft all his wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vnto his wife, ſhe made choiſe of her ſeruant <hi>Mahomet</hi>
for her huſband, making him Lord and Maſter both of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and of her ſubſtance. The man being thus raiſed from
baſe and low degrée, to great wealth and poſſeſſions, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a working and aſpiring head, did from thencefoorth plot
and imagine how he might raiſe himſelfe in honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
preſuming that the greatneſſe of his wealth would bée
a fit meane to worke his higher fortunes. Neither was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in the expectation of his hope: For conſorting himſelfe
with one <hi>Sergius</hi> a fugitiue Monke, a notable Heretike of the
<hi>Arrian</hi> Sect (whom he had made bounden vnto him by his
great liberalitie) there grew ſo ſtrict a league of amity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
familiarity betwéene them, that they had many times pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
conference, how and by what meanes <hi>Mahomet</hi> might
make himſelfe way to riſe in honour and eſtimation. After
much conſulting and debating of the matter, the beſt courſe
which they conceiued to effect their purpoſe, was to coine a new
kinde of Doctrine and Religion, vnder colour whereof (the
times then being troubleſome, the people full of ſimplicitie and
ignorance, Religion alſo waring cold, and neglected) they
thought it an eaſie matter to draw many followers vnto them,
and by that meanes to grow great in the eie and opinion of the
world. Héereupon theſe two helhounds (one of them being an
Arch enemie vnto Chriſt and the truth of his Religion, and the
other ſéeming a méere Atheiſt or prophane perſon, neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Iew,</hi> nor perfect Chriſtian) patched vp a particular doctrine
vnto themſelues out of the old and new Teſtament, deprauing
the ſenſe of both of them, and framing their opinions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their owne corrupt and wicked affections; they brought
foorth a monſtrous and moſt diuelliſh Religion, ſauouring part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> partly of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and partly of <hi>Arrianiſme,</hi>
as I will ſhew you more particularly in that which followeth:
But firſt marke (I pray you) how <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecie (before
ſet downe) is prooued true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:2104:36"/>
               <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 623. <hi>Herachius</hi> being Emperour, <hi>Mahomet</hi> moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſedition, and forthwith the <hi>Saracens</hi> or <hi>Arabians</hi> ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
theſe thrée dominions, <hi>Egypt, Syria</hi> and <hi>Aphrica,</hi> which
are the thrée hornes plucked from thoſe ten hornes of the fourth
beaſt: and <hi>Daniel</hi> aſcribeth to this little horne, that is: to the
Turkiſh Empire, thrée notes whereby it may be knowen.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt whereof is a new Law contrary to the Law of
God. For the <hi>eyes</hi> doe ſignifie a law ſubtilly inuented.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The ſecond marke is, Blaſphemie againſt the moſt high,
which is Chriſt.</hi> For the mouth ſpeaking words againſt the true
God, ſignifieth blaſphemies againſt the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>3. The third note is Crueltie towards the Church; <hi>And hee
ſhall conſume</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Saints of the moſt high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The fourth is, an endeauour to Aboliſh the Goſpell and
the Church. <hi>Hee ſhall thinke</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that hee may change
times and lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God would haue this prophecie to be extant for a ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the godly againſt the crueltie of Turks, that when they
ſhould ſée the euent to anſweare to the prophecie, they might
not be offended at the ſtumbling blocke of ſo great perſecution,
and of ſuch reuolting from the true Church. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus forewarned by the Prophet, let vs take heart to our
ſelues againſt this Turkiſh tyranny and wickedneſſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſéeing how the euent hath anſwered to the prophecie. For
there haue foure Monarchies béene one after an other. And
now raigneth a people which are enemies to God, that openly
doeth aboliſh the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall Scriptures.
Thus you may ſee how fully <hi>Daniels</hi> prophecie is fulfilled.</p>
            <p>I will now procéed to ſhew more plainely how the Turkes
began,<note place="margin">How the Turks began.</note> multiplied, and encreaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his youth, by reaſon of his pouertie, liued by
theft and robberie. Afterward hauing heaped much riches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
he was a ſouldier among his countrie men the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
vnder <hi>Heraclius.</hi> In the warre he found occaſion of principality
and power. For when the <hi>Arabians</hi> being offended with <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi>
for denying them their pay, and for his religion had ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
themſelues from him, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ioyned himſelfe to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gried
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2104:37"/>
ſouldiers, and ſtirred vp their minds againſt their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and encouraged them in their defection. Whereupon,
by a certaine company of Souldiers, he was choſen to bee their
Captaine (as they commonly are extolled in euery commotion,
which fauour the wicked enterpriſe of the rebellious people, and
ſet vpon the mightie, and gouernours.)</p>
            <p>In this new Captaine many could not abide the baſeneſſe of
his birth, nor the odiouſneſſe of his former life, eſpecially, they
loathed him for a diſeaſe he had, which was the falling ſicknes.
He therefore to redeeme himſelfe from this contempt (which is
an eaſie matter among the fooliſh common people) pretended a
diuinitie in his doings, faining himſelf to enter communication
with God, and ſo when he talked with him, to be rauiſhed out
of himſelfe, and ſéemed like vnto one afflicted with the falling
ſickeneſſe. And therefore he ſaid plainely (but vntruely) how
he was no more a Captaine, and Prince elected through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of Souldiers, but a Prophet, and a meſſenger of Almighty
God, that vnder the ſhew of Diuinitie, hee might haue all men
the more obedient vnto his words.</p>
            <p>But, for as much as he was rude altogether and vnlearned,
hee adioyned vnto himſelfe two maſters and counſellers that
were Chriſtians: the one whereof was <hi>Sergi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the other <hi>John Neſtorius,</hi> to whom there came a third who was
a <hi>Iew,</hi> a <hi>Talmudiſt.</hi> Of which thrée, euery one of them defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his ſeuerall ſect.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſuppoſing that hee ſhould not onely
gratifie his companions, but alſo the more eaſily allure all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vnto himſelfe, receiued all, that is: The pertinacie of <hi>Arius,</hi>
the errour of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and the vaine inuentions of the <hi>Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt.</hi>
And therefore he receiued from the Iew Circumciſion;
from the Chriſtians ſundry waſhings, as it were Baptiſmes.
And with <hi>Sergius</hi> he denied the Diuinitie of Chriſt. Now ſome
worſhipped Idols, others were Baptiſed and ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in Chriſtianitie, who, as ſoone as they had left the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Emperour for the hatred they bare againſt him, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
foorthwith the Religion which hee defended, euen after the

            <p>
               <hi>Mahomets</hi> manner to enlarge and eſtabliſh his kingdome
was this,<note place="margin">How the Turks increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> (which alſo his maſters taught him.)</p>
            <p>Hee ſaid how God at the firſt, to mankind ſent <hi>Moſes;</hi> after
him, Ieſus Chriſt; who were indewed with the power to worke
miracles. But men gaue ſmall héed to them. Therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to ſend <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a warrier without miracles, that
whom miracles had not mooued, weapons might compell.</p>
            <p>Hee ſaid, how he was the laſt meſſenger, and that after him
none ſhould come; how Chriſt in the Goſpell had prophecied of
him, and how tidings was of him through a wonderfull light,
which paſſed from <hi>Eua</hi> by ſucceſſion of kind through all women,
euen to his very mother.</p>
            <p>Sée the ſubtiltie of this diſſembler and deceiuer <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
who knowing that hee was deſtitue altogether of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
gift to worke miracles; hee fained that hee was ſent
with the ſword. But this Armed man at the length was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
and receiued a ſoare wound in his mouth, whereby he

               </gap>o a ſhamefull foyle, and that, the very day before hee had
(from the oracle of God) promiſed victorie to him and his. Yea,
and while he was yet a common thiefe, he was oftentimes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſore of the <hi>Drianites,</hi> whoſe Cammels he ſet vpon returning
from <hi>Mecha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that Citie which hath him now in honour, ſometime ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged
him vnto death, as a very hurtful théef, and appointed a
reward if any could bring him vnto them, either quicke or dead.</p>
            <p>This champion firſt a théefe, afterwards a ſeditious ſouldier,
then a runnagate, after that a Captaine of a rebellious hoſte,
perſwadeth light heads, enemies to the true Religion, how hée
is the meſſenger of God; whereby wee may gather how great
the power of Satan is in them, which imbrace not the truth.
Whereof it is, that at this day that aduerſarie of God defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

               <head>Of Mahomets lawes and eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</head>
               <p>AND for the better broaching abroad of his deuiliſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
hee hath preſcribed certaine lawes or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and fortified the ſame by Policie.</p>
               <p>His lawes are in number eight, which are partly Politicall
and party Ceremoniall.</p>
               <p>The firſt, concerning God: which is this.</p>
               <p>1. God is a great God, and one onely God, and Mahomet is
the Prophet of God.</p>
               <p>In this Commandement they acknowledge a God; and alſo
Chriſt they acknowledge to be a great Prophet: but deny him
to be the Sonne of God, for God (ſay they) had no wife, and
therefore could haue no ſonne. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> they hold to bee
a greater Prophet then Chriſt, and the laſt Prophet of all.</p>
               <p>For it is a common ſaying amongſt them, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was
the friend of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> the meſſenger of God, Chriſt the
breath of God, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was the Prophet of God.
They ſpeake reuerently of them all foure, and puniſh as well
thoſe that blaſpheme Chriſt, as thoſe that ſpeake euill of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
Yea, they acknowledge Chriſt to be the Sonne of the
Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> but not to haue beene borne according to the
common courſe of nature, but to haue procéeded from her
breaſts. And as for his conception by the holy Ghoſt, they
know not what it meaneth; neither doe they know whether
there be any holy Ghoſt or not. But in their praiers they often
reiterate theſe words together, <hi>hu, hu, hu,</hi> that is: he, he, he. In
deſpite of all the Chriſtians there is but one God; he, he, he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is God. For they hold, becauſe we acknowledge thrée
perſons, that therefore wee worſhip thrée Gods, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
but one God, and are altogether ignorant of the
Trinitie in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie in Trinitie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Commandement is, concerning their duety
toward their Parents, in theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:2104:38"/>
2. Obey thy parents, and doe nothing to diſpleaſe them, either
in word or deed.</p>
               <p>How badly this duty is performed among them, I know by
experience: for I did neuer read or heare of more diſobedient
children to their parents, either in word or déed.</p>
               <p>The third is concerning their Neighbours, which is this:</p>
               <p>3. Doe vnto others as thou wouldeſt be done vnto thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Some of them are iuſt in their dealings one with another:
but moſt of them vniuſt &amp; deceitfull in their procéedings with
ſtrangers, ſome few ſhopkéepers only excepted.</p>
               <p>The fourth is concerning praier, wherein is required,</p>
               <p>4. That euery man fiue times a day repaire to their Churches, to
make publike praier vnto Mahomet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> haue no bels, but very faire Churches, and high
Steeples; and at the houres of their publike praier they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to Church by the voice of Criers, who goe vp into their ſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and cry with a loud voice, <hi>Come now and worſhip the
great God.</hi> And ſometimes alſo thus: <hi>La Illa Eillala, Mahomet
Reſullala:</hi> that is, <hi>God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
And ſometimes no more but thus: <hi>Ollah hethbar:</hi> that is,
<hi>God is alone:</hi> that is, <hi>There is but one God.</hi> And oftentimes
there is but one Crier in one ſtéeple. But on their Sabboth
day (which is friday) and at ſundry other times, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men crying and bauling in euery ſtéeple, like a kennell of
hounds when they haue ſtarted their game.</p>
               <p>The firſt méeting at publike praier euery day, is before the
riſing of the ſunne.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is about noone or midday, and on their Sabboth
day two houres ſooner, and againe at noone, ſo that they pray
fiue times euery day, and on their Sabboth day, ſix times.</p>
               <p>The third time for publike praier euery day, is at the tenth
houre of the day, called by the <hi>Turkes, Kindi;</hi> by the <hi>Moores, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera,</hi>
about thrée or foure of the clocke after noone.</p>
               <p>The fourth méeting is about ſunne ſetting.</p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt houre of praier, is two houres within
night, before they goe to ſléepe.</p>
               <p>Before they come to praier, they prepare themſelues thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2104:39"/>
by outward waſhings of themſelues, in token of reuerence,
and ſuffer no women to come to their Churches, leſt the ſight
of them ſhould with-draw their mindes from praier. And
though they doe not come to Church, yet when they heare the
voice of the Criers, they will pray whereſoeuer they be, and fall
downe and kiſſe the ground thrée times.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes alſo theſe Criers walke about the ſtéeples in the
euenings, and ſing (after their rude manner) <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes
in the Arabicke tongue. And when rich men heare them ſing
well, and with cléere voices, they are ſo delighted therewith,
that they vſe to ſend them money.</p>
               <p>Their fifth Commandement is concerning faſting, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That one Moone in the yeere, euery one (of any reaſonable
age) ſpend the whole time in faſting.</p>
               <p>They haue but one Lent in the yéere, and then they faſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
in this manner: When the new moone changeth, which
they call <hi>Romadan,</hi> then during all that moone, they faſt all the
day long betwixt ſunne riſing and ſunne ſetting, and neither
eat nor drinke any thing at all. But when the ſunne ſetteth,
then the crier calleth them to Church, and after they haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then they may eat what kinde of meat they will (ſauing
ſwines fleſh, which is forbidden by their Law) and as oft as
they will, vntill ſunne riſing: ſo that their Lent is but a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of day into night. During this moone <hi>Romadan,</hi> they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
this kinde of abſtinence very ſtrictly. And ſo ſoone as the
next moone changeth, which they call <hi>Byram,</hi> then their Lent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
and they hold a feaſt for thrée daies ſpace together. At
which time (they ſay) <hi>Mahomet</hi> deliuered vnto them their law.</p>
               <p>Their ſixth Commandement is concerning Almeſdéeds.</p>
               <p>6. Let euery man, out of his ſtore, giue vnto the poore, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
freely, and voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Their Almes is either publike or priuate.</p>
               <p>Their publike Almes is a ſacrifice or offering of ſome beaſt
for a ſacrifice vnto <hi>Mahomet</hi> once euery yéere: which being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
it is cut into ſmall péeces, and giuen all to the poore.</p>
               <p>Their priuate Almes (notwithſtanding their Law) is much
neglected; for I haue heard of many poore people who haue died
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2104:39"/>
amongſt them for want of reléefe: and in the way as I haue
trauelled, I haue found ſome dead for hunger and cold. And
though a man be neuer ſo poore, yet if he be not able to pay his
Head money to the King yéerely, they are beaten, and their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children ſold to pay it. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our murmuring and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
poore were héere but a ſhort time, they would learne to bee
more thankfull to God and man, and how to eſtéeme of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
beſtowed on them, and not curſe and reuile (as many of
them doe) if any one that paſſeth by them doe not giue vnto
them. The <hi>Turkes</hi> are more mercifull to birds, cats, and dogs,
than to the poore.</p>
               <p>Their ſeuenth Commandement is concerning Marriage.</p>
               <p>7. That euery man muſt of neceſſitie marry, to encreaſe and
multiply the Sect and Religion of Mahomet.</p>
               <p>Their cuſtome is to buy their wiues of their parents, and
neuer to ſée them vntil they come to be married: and their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is nothing but enrolling in the <hi>Cadies</hi> booke. And it is
lawfull for them to take as many wiues as they will, or as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as they are able to kéepe. And whenſoeuer he diſliketh any
one of them, it is their vſe to ſell them or giue them to any of
their men-ſlaues. And although they loue their women neuer ſo
well, yet they neuer ſit at table with men, no not with their
husbands, but wait at table and ſerue him, and when he hath
dined, they dine in ſecret by themſelues, admitting no man or
mankinde amongſt them, if he be aboue twelue yéeres of age.
And they neuer goe abroad without leaue of their husbands,
which is very ſeldome, except it be either to the <hi>Bannio</hi> or hot
Bath, or once a wéeke to wéepe at the graues of the dead, which
is vſually on Thurſday, being the Ene before their Sabboth,
which is Friday, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabboth on Saturday, and the
Chriſtians on Sunday, thrée Sabboth daies together in one
Country. If their huſbands haue béene abroad, at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the houſe, if any one of their women be ſitting on a
ſtoole, ſhe riſeth vp, and boweth herſelfe to her huſband, and
kiſſeth his hand, and ſetteth the ſame ſtoole for him, whereon
they ſate, and ſtand ſo long as he is in preſence.</p>
               <p>If the like order were in England, women would be more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2104:40"/>
dutifull and faithfull to their huſbands than many of them are:
and eſpecially, if there were the like puniſhment for whores,
there would be leſſe whoredome: for there, if a man haue an
hundred women, if any one of them proſtitute herſelfe to any
man but her owne huſband, he hath authoritie to binde her,
hands and feet, and caſt her into the riuer with a ſtone about
her necke, and drowne her. And this is a common puniſhment
amongſt them; but it is vſually done in the night. And the
man, if he be taken, is diſmembred.</p>
               <p>But the daughters and ſiſters of the great <hi>Turke</hi> are more
frée than all other men and women. For when their brethren
die, they liue: and when they come to yéeres of marriage, their
father (if he be liuing) or brother (if he be King) will giue vnto
them, for their huſbands, the greateſt <hi>Baſhawes</hi> or <hi>Viziers</hi>
whom they ſhall affect, and ſay vnto them, Daughter, or ſiſter,
I giue thée this man to be thy ſlaue and bedfellow: and if he be
not louing, dutifull, and obedient vnto thée, héere, I giue thée
a <hi>Canzhare</hi> (that is, a dagger) to cut off his head. And alwaies
after, thoſe daughters or ſiſters of the King weare a broad and
ſharpe dagger: and whenſoeuer their huſbands (which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto them by the King to be their ſlaues) diſpleaſe them,
they may and doe cut off their heads.</p>
               <p>They exempt no calling from marriage, but hold it a bleſſing

many hundred, yea (as I haue heard) a thouſand women only

when he killed his owne two ſonnes <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi>
with the infants of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> rather than he would faile of his

to be the <hi>Great Turkes</hi> hogge than his ſonne: for they (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

500. yéeres agoe, in time of a great dearth, called all the
poore people in all the whole Country, into a great barne, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to make a great dole: But hauing them ſure enough,
he fired the barne, and burnt them all vp, ſaying, <hi>Theſe be the
Rats and Mice which deuoure vp the corne.</hi> This was his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to make bread better cheape. But for this vnmercifull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
God made him an example for all vnmercifull men, to the

in ſuch terrible ſort, that where his name was written in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
walles, or hangings, they neuer ceaſed till it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
out; and droue him from houſe to houſe to ſaue his life. And
where he had a ſtrong Tower in the middeſt of the great Riuer
of <hi>Rhene,</hi> which yet ſtandeth there to be ſéene in the midſt of the
Riuer, he thought himſelfe ſure if he could flie thither: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
the Rats ſwamme after him thither, and there
deuoured him: And it is called the Rats tower to this day, as
Trauellers know, and I my ſelfe haue ſéene this preſent yeere
1608. <hi>Iuly</hi> 7. It ſtandeth on a little <hi>Jland</hi> in the midſt of the
Riuer of <hi>Ryne,</hi> betwixt the Cities <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Cullyn,</hi> or <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

the Riuer, where is made the beſt <hi>Rheniſh</hi> wine in all <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
Not far from <hi>Sanquer,</hi> where there is a choller of iron faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

their company, to put in their necks, to make them frée, and are

                  <hi>SVLTAN Mahomet</hi> (this great Turkes father) when he
came to the Crowne, put to death 19. of his brethren (according
to the cuſtome of his predeceſſors) as a wicked policie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
treaſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> are yet ſomewhat better, (although too bad)
where the eldeſt ſonne is king after the death of his father, and
all the reſt of their brethren haue their eyes put out, yet liue.</p>
               <p>Other Turkes haue thrée wiues, and haue as many women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues

The manner of their mariage is this. Firſt, if a man like
a yong woman, he buyeth her of her father, and giueth a great ſummne of money for her, and then enrolleth her in the <hi>Cadies</hi>
booke, that hee hath bought her of her Father for his wife, and
then the friends feaſt and banket together, and this is all they
performe in mariage. Onely the father of the yong woman gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
great ſtore of houſhold-ſtuffe with her, and this is caried
openly by particulars through the ſtréetes of the citie on horſes
or Cammels, and ſometime by men and women, the parties
newly maried going before with muſicke playing before them.</p>
               <p>Their eight Commandement is the ſame with our ſixt.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their <hi>Alcoran</hi> it is written that God hateth murther. And
they ſay, that it is the ſecond ſinne which crept into the world
after the creation, being firſt committed by curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> who
killed his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> And their beliefe is, that this ſinne of
wilfull murther is impardonable. But if it be by méere chance,
or in their owne defence, or elſe in lawfull wars, or in caſes of
iuſtice by the Maieſtrate they hold it lawfull.</p>
               <p>Often haue I heard Turkes brawle one with another, and
in words moſt vilely reuile one another; but neuer did I ſée
or heare of two Turkes in their priuate quarrels ſtrike one
another, neither dare they ſtrike one another, for if they do, they
are preſently brought before the Maieſtrate, and ſeuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
Yea, if one doe but lift vp his hand to ſtrike another, hée
is caſt into priſon, and kept in irons, vntill he haue payed ſome
great fine, or receiued ſome other puniſhment. But they will
ſtrike Iewes and Chriſtians oftentimes, who dare not ſtrike
them againe. If a man in ſecret be killed and found dead, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
openly in the ſtréete, or priuately in an houſe, the maſter of
the houſe, or the pariſh where hee dwelleth muſt find out the
murtherer, otherwiſe hee himſelfe ſhall be accuſed of murther,
and both he, and the whole <hi>Contrado</hi> where hee dwelleth muſt
pay vnto the <hi>Subbaſhaw</hi> ſo many hundred Dollers as ſhall be
required at their hands.</p>
               <p>And therefore the <hi>Subbaſhaws</hi> oftentimes being wicked men,
doe hire ſome deſperate perſon to kill a man in the night, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2104:41"/>
thereby he may take occaſion to eat of the whole <hi>Contrado.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">William Matrin. Anno Dom. 1603. Sept. 18.</note> We
had an Engliſh man, not long ſince, who ſléeping on the <hi>Tarras,</hi>
(that is, on the top of the houſe) in the night, (as the cuſtome
of the contrie is in the heate of Sommer) who had his throat
cut being aſléepe in bed, by two or thrée wicked men, who came
from the ſtréete by a ladder to the top of the houſe; and after they
had committed this murther, being diſcried by the barking of a
dog, and ſéene alſo by the maſter of the houſe through his
chamber windowwhere he ſlept, (but not plainely diſcerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

houſe (an Engliſh man alſo) was in trouble himſelfe, becauſe he
could not find out the murtherers, and it coſt him an hundreth
Dollers at the leaſt before hee could bee fréed, and the whole
<hi>Contrado</hi> or Pariſh, was alſo fined.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, if an houſe be robbed, he who is robbed, muſt
either finde out the thiefe, or els he himſelfe ſhall be troubled for
it, and put to a great fine.</p>
               <p>If an houſe be but endangered by fire either by the burning
of a chimney, or any other ſmall part thereof without great
harme, yet they will lay to his charge, who dwelleth therein,
that he would haue burnt the whole Citie; and take from him
all that he hath, and impriſon him as long as they pleaſe. Such
ſecret murtherers, théeues, and violent oppreſſors are they;

with them, as bruite beaſts amongſt vs, whom they vſe as
ſlaues in all kind of drudgerie. It it better to be a ſeruant in
England, then a maſter ouer many ſeruants in Turkey.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the eight Commandements of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the two chiefeſt points forbidden in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> are, the
eating of ſwines fleſh, and the drinking of wine. Yet many
of them drinke wine vntill they be drunken: but I neuer heard
of any Turkes would eate ſwines fleſh.</p>
               <p>The things conſidered, being ſo fond and rediculous, it
may ſéeme ſtrange, that men of courage in Turkey, doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
this deceiuer and deluder of mankind.</p>
               <p>But it is the leſſe ſtrange if we conſider how he hath fortified
his law with foure bulwarks or ſtrong defences.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, hée commandeth to kill them which ſpeake againſt
the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And therefore no man dare gaineſay or deny any
thing contained in their <hi>Alcoran:</hi> but whoſoeuer ſhall dare
either to diſpute againſt that booke, or to doubt of any Article
therein written, he ſhall be ſure, either to haue his tongue pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of his head, or els his bodie to be burnt and conſumed
with fire.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, he forbiddeth conference to be had with men of
a contrary ſect or religion.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, he forbiddeth credit to be giuen to any beſide the
<hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, hee commandeth them to ſeparate themſelues
altogether from other men, and to ſay, <hi>Let me haue my law, and
take you yours: ye are free from, that which I doe, and I likewiſe
from that which you doe.</hi> And herein I hold it better for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and other Chriſtians to ſoiourne and to vſe trade and
trafficke amongſt Turkes then Papiſts; for, the Turke giueth
libertie of conſcience to all men, and liketh well of euery man
that is forward and zealous in his owne religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:2104:42"/>
But among the Papiſts no man can buy and ſell, Vnleſſe
hée beare the markes of the beaſt as S. <hi>John</hi> foretold, <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
13. 17.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, to driue away all feare of damnation from the
mindes of his Diſciples, <hi>Mahomet</hi> telleth them, that euery man
ſhall be ſaued by his owne Religion (he only excepted which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolteth
from the <hi>Alchoran</hi> vnto another Law) The <hi>lewes</hi> by the
Law of <hi>Moſes; Chriſtians</hi> by the Law of the Goſpell; and the
<hi>Saracens</hi> by the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And they hold, that at the
day of iudgement all ſhall appeare vnder thrée banners; The
<hi>Iewes</hi> vnder the banner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> vnder the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> and other <hi>Mahometans</hi> vnder <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi>

which they deſcribe after an earthly, ſenſuall, and brutiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
affirming,<note place="margin">Mahomets paradiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ground of Paradiſe is of golD, which is

together, planted with all fruitfull trees, the pleaſant riuers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thorow the greene fields, whereof ſome powre out milke,
others white honey, others the pureſt wine; and that there they
ſhall be clothed with all ſorts of colours, except blacke.</hi> And
therefore the <hi>Turkes</hi> to this day weare no blacke; but when
they ſée a man clothed in blacke, many of them will goe backe,
and ſay they will fly from him who ſhall neuer enter into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.
Yet whoſoeuer will liue in quiet amongſt them, muſt<note place="margin">A note for trauellers.</note>
neither meddle with their Law, their Women, nor their
ſlaues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomets</hi> comming to iudgement was expected 20. yéeres
ſince; for their beléefe was, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> would come againe
at the end of 1000. yéeres (as he promiſed them) and bring them
to Paradiſe: which time expiring, and he not comming, they
haue dealt more fauourably with him, and giuen him longer
time; for they ſay he was extremely ſicke when he was aſked
of the time of his comming, and that he anſwered them with
ſuch a low voice, that he could not well be vnderſtood: and that
they which reported that he would returne at the end of 1000.
yéeres, miſtooke him, for that he meant 2000. yéeres. At which
time, if he doe not come (according to promiſe) they will looke

for him no longer, nor belacute;eue in him any more, but become
Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moores</hi> are more ancient dwellers in <hi>Aleppo</hi> than <hi>Turks,</hi>
and more forward and zealous in <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> than <hi>Turkes:</hi>
yea all the Churchmen amongſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> are <hi>Moores,</hi> whom
the <hi>Turkes</hi> count a baſe people (in regard of themſelues) and call
them <hi>Tots.</hi> Yet their Churchmen they haue in great reuerence;
and not only theirs, but they reuerence Churchmen of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and call them holy men, Saints, and men of God.</p>
               <p>I my ſelfe haue had great experience héereof both in the place
of my abode at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and in my iourney towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>

both <hi>Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> and other Nations, would very reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ſalute me after the manner of their Country: yea their
very ſouldiers, as I haue walked in the fields, with many other
of our Nation, without a <hi>Ieneſarie</hi> to guard vs, though they
haue béene many hundreds together, yet haue they not offered
either me or any of my company wrong, for my ſake, but haue

that I was an Engliſh Preacher, came and kiſſed my
hand, and called me the Engliſh Patriarke. Yea in all my ten
yéeres trauels, I neuer receiued, neither was offered wrong by
any Nation but mine owne Countrimen, and by them chiefly
whom it chiefly concerned to protect me from wrongs: yet haue
I found them moſt forward to offer me wrong only for doing
my duty, and following the order of our Church of England:
knowing that I had none of the Reuerend Fathers of our
Church to defend me. So would it be in England, if we had
not the Reuerend Fathers in God the Lord Biſhops of our
Church to protect vs. All other Nations, both Heathen and
Chriſtian, goe before vs héerein, in reuerencing and prouiding
for their Churchmen. The <hi>Turkes</hi> honour their <hi>Muftie</hi> (which

Chelfalines,</hi> and Chriſtians of all other Nations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
double honour vnto them: only in England, where there
is a more learned Miniſtery (I ſpeake by experience) than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nation in the world, they are leaſt of all regarded: Which
maketh our Aduerſaries, the Papiſts, ſay, (as I haue heard
ſome of them ſpeake in my hearing, many thouſand miles from
England) that if we our ſelues were perſwaded of the truth of
our Religion, we would reuerence our Churchmen as they do,
and not ſcorne them and contemne them as we doe.</p>
               <p>They alſo account fooles, dumbe men, and mad men, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones,</hi>
that is, <hi>Saints.</hi> And whatſoeuer ſuch mad men ſay or do,
though they take any thing out of their houſe, or ſtricke them,
and wound them, yet they take it in good part, and ſay, that
they ſhall haue good lucke after it. And when ſuch madde men
die, they Canonize them for Saints, and erect ſtately Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ouer their graues, as we haue héere many examples, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
of one who (being mad) went alwaies naked, whoſe
name was <hi>Sheh Boubac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sheh Boubac.</note> at whoſe death they beſtowed great
coſt on his funerall, and erected an houſe ouer his graue, where
(to this day) there are Lampes burning night and day, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
idle fellowes (whom they call <hi>Daruiſes</hi>) there maintained
to looke vnto his ſepulcher, and to receiue the offerings of ſuch
as come to offer to <hi>Sheh Boubac,</hi> which they take to themſelues,
and there is no wéeke but many come out of the City of <hi>Aleppo</hi>
and other places, to offer. For this ſepulcher is built on an hill,
thrée miles from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> betwéene the Kings garden and the
fountaine of fiſhes. If any be ſicke, or in danger, they vow
that if they recouer or eſcape, they will offer ſo much money, or
this or that good thing to <hi>Sneh Boubac.</hi>
               </p>

whom they call <hi>Sheh Mahammet a Santone,</hi> who goeth
alwaies naked, with a ſpit on his ſhoulders; and as hee goeth
thorow the ſtréets, the ſhop-kéepers will offer him their rings;
and if he thruſt his ſpit thorow their rings, they take it for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,

he take any thing from their ſhop boards, or bor them or any
of their houſe: yea they are yet more mad vpon this mad man
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2104:44"/>
than ſo, for both men and women will come vnto him, and kiſſe
his hand, or any other part, ſometimes his thighs, and aſke
him counſell, for they hold that mad mens ſoules are in heauen
talking with God, and that he reuealeth ſecrets vnto them. In
regard whereof, the <hi>Baſhawes</hi> themſelues oftentimes, and
chiefe Captaines will come vnto him with ſome preſent, and
kiſſe ſome part of his naked body, and aſke him whether they
ſhall goe to battle or not, and what ſucceſſe they ſhall haue in

               <p>Not long ſince, the <hi>Turkes</hi> had a victorie againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;

fighting againſt their enemies, and that by his helpe they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

will cut it from his backe, and beate him, and aſke him how he
dare preſume to weare <hi>Mahomets</hi> colour, and whether he bee

               <p>The Turks haue no Printing amongſt them, but all their
Law and their Religion is written in the <hi>Moriſco</hi> tongue, that

tonge, he is a rare man amongſt them that can ſpeake it. Some
few amongſt them haue the Italian tong: and many (eſpecally
in and about <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>) ſpeake the vulgar Greeke, that

               <p>The Diet of the Turks is not very ſumptuous,<note place="margin">Diet of the Turkes. Pilawe.</note> for the moſt
common diſh is Pilaw, which is good ſauory meat made of Riſe,
and ſmall morſels of Mutton boyled therein, and ſometimes
roſted Buckones, (that is, ſmall bits or morſels of fleſh.) Their
more coſtly fare is Sambouſes and Muclebites. Sambouſes
are made of paſte like a great round Paſtie with varietie of
hearbes and meates therein, not minced but in Buckones. A
Muclebite is a diſh made of Egs and hearbs. Their ſmaller
Sambouſes are more common, not ſo big as a mans hand, like
a ſquare Paſtie, with minſed meat therein. They haue alſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
of Helloway, that is, ſwéet meats compounded in ſuch ſort
as are not to be ſéen elſwhere. The poorer ſort féed on hearbs and
fruites of the trées.<note place="margin">Coffa.</note> Their moſt common drinke is <hi>Coffa,</hi> which
is a blacke kind of drinke made of a kind of Pulſe like Peaſe,
called <hi>Coaua;</hi> which being grownd in the mill, and boiled in
water, they drinke it as hot as they can ſuffer it; which they
find to agrée very well with them againſt their crudities and
féeding on hearbs and rawemeates.</p>
               <p>Other compound drinkes they haue called <hi>Sherbet,</hi> made of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2104:45"/>
water and Sugar, or hony, with ſnow therein to make it coole;
for although the countrie bee hote, yet they kéepe ſnow all the
yeere long to coole their drinke.</p>
               <p>It is accounted a great curteſie amongſt them to giue vnto
their frends when they come to viſit them, a Fin-ion or Scudel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
of <hi>Coffa,</hi> which is more holeſome than toothſome, for it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
good concoction, and driueth away drowſineſſe. Some
of them will alſo drinke Berſh or Opium, which maketh them
forget themſelues, and talke idly of Caſtles in the ayre, as
though they ſaw viſions, and heard Reuelations.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Coffa</hi> houſes are more common than Ale-houſes in
England; but they vſe not ſo much to ſit in the houſes as on
benches on both ſides the ſtréets néere vnto a <hi>Coffa</hi> houſe, euery
man with his Fin-ion ful; which being ſmoking hot, they vſe to
put it to their noſes &amp; eares, and then ſup it off by leaſure, being
full of idle and Ale-houſe talke whiles they are amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
drinking of it; if there be any news, it is talked of there.
They haue alſo excellent good fountaine waters in moſt places
of that countrie, which is a common drinke amongſt them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in Sommer time, and in their trauels at all times of the
yéere.</p>
               <p>Some of our Merchants haue weighed their water and ours
in England when they haue come home, and haue found their
water lighter then ours by foure ounces in the pound; and the
lighter the water is, the more pleaſant it is to drinke, and goeth
downe more delectably, as if it were milke rather than water.</p>
               <p>In great Cities where the fountaines are either farre off, or
not ſo plentifull, there are certaine poore men which goe about
the ſtréetes from morning to night with a Beares ſkinne full of
water, ſowed vp and faſtened about his ſtoulders like a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
budget, with a bole of braſſe in his hand, and offreth water
freely to them that paſſe by, except they giue them any thing in
curteſie, (ſome ſeldom times.)</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of them are very courteous people amongſt<note place="margin">Salutations of the Turks.</note>
themſelues, ſaluting one another at their méetingwith their
hand on their breſt (for they neuer vncouer their head) with
theſe words: <hi>Salam Alike Sultanum:</hi> that is, peace be vnto you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2104:45"/>
Sir. Whereunto the other replieth, <hi>Alekem Salam,</hi> that is:
Peace be to you alſo. And ſometime thus: <hi>Elph Marhabba ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
Or in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> thus: <hi>Hoſh Geldanos, Sophi Geldanos:</hi>
that is: Welcome my déere friend. And in the morning, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alkier
Sultanum,</hi> that is, good morrow Sir: and in the euening
thus. <hi>Miſalker Sultanum,</hi> that is: good euen Sir.</p>
               <p>And when friends and acquaintance meet, who haue not ſéene
one another many dayes before, they ſalute one another in

thus, <hi>Iſh halac Seedi?</hi> that is: How doe you Sir? And <hi>Iſh bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tac?</hi>
that is: how doth thy Gate? (meaning all within his gate)
And ſo procéed by particulers to aſke how doth thy Child, ſlaue,
horſe, cat, dog, aſſe, &amp;c. and euery thing in the houſe, except his
wife; for that is held a very vnkind queſtion, and not vſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. And if a man come to their houſes, and at the
doore enquire of the children for their father, they will anſwere
him: but if he enquire for the mother, they will throw ſtones
at him and reuile him.</p>
               <p>Their women (as hath béene ſhewed before) haue little liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to come abroad, except it be on the Eue before their Sabbath,
(which is Thurſday) to wéepe at the graues of the dead, or to the
<hi>Bannios</hi> or hot Bathes to waſh themſelues (as the vſe of the
contry is.) And when they come abroad, they are alwayes maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
for it is accounted a ſhame for a woman to be ſéene bare-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
yea, they are ſo iealous and ſuſpitious ouer them, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wil not ſuffer their owne ſonnes, after they come to foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene
yéeres of age, to ſée their mothers.</p>
               <p>Theſe be their common ſalutations one to another.</p>
               <p>Their more ſpeciall ſalutations to great perſonages are
theſe.</p>
               <p>When a man commeth to ſalute the great <hi>Turke,</hi> or Grand
Signior himſelfe (into whoſe preſence few are admitted except
Ambaſſadors and great Perſonages) they are led betwéene
two by the armes, for feare of a ſtab, by which meanes one of
their Grand Signiors was once killed, and when they returne,
they goe backwards; for it is accounted a diſgrace to turne their
back-parts to a great man. In like manner they ſalute their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2104:46"/>
                  <hi>Baſhawes</hi> and other great men, (but not led by the armes) but
with their hands on the breſt, bowing downe their heads to
kiſſe the ſkirt of his garment, pronouncing theſe words, <hi>Ollah
towal omrac Seedi.</hi> That is: God prolong your dayes Sir. And
ſo long as they talke with a <hi>Baſhaw</hi> they ſtand with their hands
on their breſt maiden-like, and bow low at their departure,
and goe backward. They neuer vncouer their heads vnto any
man, no not to the King himſelfe; yea, it is a word of reproach
amongſt them to ſay when they miſlike a matter, <hi>I had as liue
thou ſhewedſt me thy bare head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They call one another diuerſly, and not alwaies by their
names, but ſometimes by their fathers Calling, trade, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée:
as <hi>Eben Sultan,</hi> that is, <hi>The ſonne of a King: Eben Terzi,
The ſonne of a Tailor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſometimes by their father qualities, as <hi>Eben Sacran,</hi>
that is, <hi>The ſonne of a Drunkard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſometimes by their markes, as <hi>Colac cis,</hi> that is, <hi>A
man without eares: Cowſi Sepher,</hi> that is <hi>Sepher with the thinne
beard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſometimes by their Stature, as <hi>Tow-ill,</hi> that is, <hi>A tall
man: Sgire rugiall,</hi> that is, <hi>A little man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſometimes by their Offices, as <hi>I-aſgee,</hi> that is, <hi>A Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie:
Nibe,</hi> that is, <hi>A Clerke, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſometimes by their humours, as</hi> Chiplac, <hi>that is,</hi> A
naked man; Or, <hi>One who was of a humour to weare no cloathes
but breeches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their common word of curteſie either to ſtrangers, or
ſuch whoſe names they know not, or whom they purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
is <hi>Chillabee,</hi> that is, <hi>Gentleman.</hi> And there is no man
amongſt them of any degrée, will refuſe to anſwer to any of
theſe names. But if nature haue marked them either with
gogle eies, bunch backes, lame legs, or any other infirmitie or
deformitie, as they are knowen by it, ſo they are content to bée
called by it.</p>
               <p>But they that haue gone on pilgrimage to their holy Citie
<hi>Mecha,</hi> where their Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> was buried, at their
returne are called Hogies, that is, <hi>Pilgrimes,</hi> as <hi>Hogie Tahar,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2104:46"/>
Hogie Mahammet, &amp;c.</hi> which is counted a word of great grace

as in <hi>Iobs</hi> tune they liued by theft and robberie and ſpoile of

               <p>They are a baſe, beggerly, and rogiſh people; wandering vp

becauſe they are <hi>Mahomets</hi> Countrimen, and he allowed them
liberty to liue by theft. Yet their Kings doe no great harme, but
take toule or tribute of the Carauans as they paſſe by, which if
they pay willingly, they paſſe quietly, and are not robbed, but
a little exacted vpon.</p>

One of their Kings hath often times pitched his tents néere
vnto the City of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and many Merchants being deſirous
to ſee them and their order, tooke occaſion to preſent him with
ſome ſmall preſent or other, which he tooke very kindly, and
admitted them to his table, and gaue them a tent to lodge in all
night: on the morrow for breakfaſt one of them made him a
minſed pie, and ſet it before him hot as it came out of the ouen:
But as <hi>Diogines</hi> accuſtomed to féed on roots, hauing a péece of a
tart giuen him to eat, and as he was eating it, being aſked what
it was, anſwered that it was bread; and when he was laughed
at for his anſwer, he ſaid again, Either it is bread of a very good
making, or bread very wel handled in the baking: So this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
or Diogenicall King accuſtomed to féed groſly, hauing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſéene a pie or paſtie before, maruelled what it was: And
when he ſaw it cut vp and opened, and perceiued ſmoke to comè
out of it, ſhrunke backe, fearing it had béene ſome engine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

when he perceiued no fire followed the ſmoke, he was content
to taſte of it, and highly commended it, as the daintieſt diſh that
euer he taſted of in his life.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Arabian</hi> Kings neuer kéepe any money in their purſes,
but ſpend it as faſt as they finde it, and when they want, with
their ſword they ſéeke a new purchaſe. Some are ſouldiers,
fighting faithfully on any ſide that will giue them pay. Some
of this rogiſh <hi>Arabian</hi> race follow neither of their Kings, but
wander from place to place in caues and rocks, and liue by their
ſword, not only robbing, but killing ſuch as they can ouercome.
Others of them (of a better minde) ſoiourne in Cities of trade
and trafficke, and make themſelues ſeruants to any Nation
that will ſet them on worke, and well reward them. Some of
them are horſe-kéepers, ſome Baſtages, that is, Porters, and
ſome vnder-cookes in kitchins, and are very ſeruiceable. But
for the moſt part their lodgings are on ſome dunghill or other,

Babylon, Grand Cayro,</hi> and euery great Citie and place of
Marchandiſe throughout all the Turkes dominions, who are
knowne by their hatts: for they were accuſtomed to weare red

head <hi>Vizier</hi> being their enemy) they are conſtrained to weare
hatts of blewe cloth, becauſe red was accounted too ſtately
and princelike a colour for them to weare.</p>
               <p>They are called by three names, which were giuen to them of
old. Firſt, they are called <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> (as ſome ſuppoſe) of <hi>Heber</hi>
the fourth from <hi>Noah,</hi> in whom the hebrew tongue remained
at the confuſion of tongues, whence he had his name. But S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> and other fathers affirme, that they were firſt called
<hi>Hebreweof Abraham,</hi> with the alteration of a fewe letters, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei
quaſi Abrahaei,</hi> that is, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> as it were <hi>Abrahites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly they were called Iſraelites from <hi>Jacob</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
whoſe grandfathers <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they were called <hi>Iewes,</hi> after that <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
(which for the vnity of minds were (as it were one <hi>Tribe</hi>)
following <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Solomon</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
made the kingdome of Iuda. The other ten betaking them to
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſet vp the kingdome of the
<hi>Ephramites</hi> or <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And what became of thoſe ten tribes, the
Iewes acknowledge themſelues to be ignorant. Only ſome of
their <hi>Rabbies</hi> thinke them to bee in <hi>Tarracia:</hi> the onely reaſon
which I haue heard them alledge for their opinion is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they often vnderſtand by <hi>Tartarians</hi> who came from
thence to vſe marchandiſe in <hi>Aleppo</hi> and elſe where, that there
are many amongſt them called by <hi>Hebrew</hi> names to this day.
Of theſe thrée names whereby they are knowne, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
name whereby they are called at this day is, the name of
<hi>Iewes.</hi> One and the ſame people thrice changed their names, &amp;
often the place of their abode: And to this day they haue no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2104:49"/>
king nor country proper to themſelues, but are diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole world, and in euery place where they come, they
are contemptible and of baſe account,<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 25.</note> according to the cry of
thoſe crucifiers. <hi>His blood bee vpon vs and our children,</hi> which
is fulfilled this day in our eares and eies. They are of more
vile account in the ſight of <hi>Turkes</hi> then <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> in ſo much
that if a Iewe would turne Turke, he muſt firſt turne <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
before they will admit him to be a <hi>Turke.</hi> Yea, it is a word
of reproach amongſt the <hi>Turkes,</hi> &amp; a vſuall proteſtation amongſt
them, when they are falſly accuſed of any crime, to cleare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
they vſe to proteſt in this manner, <hi>If this be true; then
God graunt I may die a Iewe,</hi> And the Iewes in like caſes vſe
to ſay, <hi>If this be not a falſe accuſation, then God graunt I may
dye a Chriſtian,</hi> praying better for themſelues then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
and as all of them muſt be that ſhall bee ſaued. And the
poore <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſoiourning and dwelling in theſe partes doe
hate them very vncharitably and irreligiouſly: (in that we read
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. many arguments prouing that they ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
againe.) for on good fryday in many places (eſpecially
at <hi>Zante</hi>) they throw ſtones at them, inſomuch that they dare
not come out of their houſes all that day, and yet are ſcarſe in
ſafety in their houſes, for they vſe to throw ſtones at their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
and dores, and on the roofe of their houſes. On thruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
about noone, the Iewes begin to kéepe within dores, and
continue there with their dores ſhut vntil ſaturday about noone,
for if they come forth before that time they are ſure to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but after noone on Eaſter eue if they come abroad, they
may paſſe as quietly as euer they did. Theſe in their blinde
zeale thinke to be reuenged on them for whom Chriſt prayed
ſaying, <hi>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they
doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſome ignorant Chriſtians refuſe to eat of their meat or
bread: their reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> refuſe to eat or drinke
with Chriſtians to this day, or to eat any meat that Chriſtians
kill. But it is not vnuſuall amongſt Chriſtians of better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to eat of the <hi>Jewes</hi> meat, which ordinarily they buy of
them: for the <hi>Iewes</hi> to this day eat not of the hinderpart of any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2104:50"/>
beaſt, but only of the former parts, and ſell the hinder quarters
of their béefe, mutton, kids, goats, &amp;c. to Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>They obſerue ſtill all their old Ceremonies and feaſts, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
only excepted, which the <hi>Turkes</hi> will not ſuffer them to
doe: for they were wont amongſt them to ſacrifice children,
but dare not now for feare of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> Yet ſome of them
haue confeſſed, that their Phyſitians kill ſome Chriſtian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or other, whom they haue vnder their hands at that time,
in ſtead of a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>If a man die without children, the next brother taketh his
wife, and raiſeth vp ſéed vnto his brother: and they ſtill marry
in their owne kindred. Many of them are rich Merchants:
ſome of them Drogomen, and ſome Brokers. Moſt of them
are very crafty and deceitfull people. They haue no beggers
amongſt them, but many théeues, and ſome who ſteale for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
becauſe they dare not begge.</p>
               <p>They are alſo very great Vſurers, and therein the <hi>Turkes</hi>
ecell them: for although there be Vſurers amongſt them, yet
they allow it not: for if a Chriſtian or any man borrow money
of a <hi>Turke</hi> (though he promiſe him intereſt) yet if he pay the
principall, he dares not moleſt him for intereſt, nor complaine
of him, being againſt their law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabboth is on Saturday, which they obſerue ſo
ſtrictly, that they will not trauell vpon any occaſion on that
day, nor receiue money, nor handle a pen to write, (as I haue
knowen by experience in a Doctor of Phyſicke:) but on the
morrow he would take double fées of his Patient.</p>
               <p>They read their law in the Hebrue tongue, written in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries
or long roles of parchment. And the Old Teſtament
is alſo read in the Hebrue. But their Cakams and Cohens
preach in the Spaniſh tongue. All matters of controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
themſelues are brought before their Cakam to decide,
who is their chiefe Churchman. <hi>Cakam</hi> in Hebrue is as much
as <hi>Sapiens</hi> in Latine, that is, a wiſe man: and <hi>Cohen</hi> in Hebrue
is as much as <hi>Sacerdos</hi> in Latine, that is, a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Iewes</hi> can read Hebrue, but few of them ſpeake
it, except it be in two places in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and that is at <hi>Salonica,</hi>

               <p>I haue ſundry times had conference with many of them;

ſtole him out of his graue whiles the ſouldiers (who wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

wicked Nations there dwelling: in whom I obſerued more
by experience than I heard of them, or noted in them when I
was amongſt them at <hi>Mount Lybanus.</hi> And eſpecially for the
manner of their marriage, and how they honour the ſame.</p>
               <p>They buy their wiues of their fathers (as others there dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
doe) but neuer ſée them vntill they come to be married, nor
then neither vntill the mariage be ſolemnized betwixt them: for
there is a partition in the place where they méet to be married,
and the man and his friends ſtand on the one ſide, and the yoong
woman &amp; her friends on the other ſide, where they may heare,
but not ſée one another, vntill the <hi>Caſſies</hi> bid the yoong man put
his hand thorow an hole in the wall, and take his wife by the
hand. And whiles they haue hand in hand, the mother of the
maid commeth with ſome ſharpe inſtrument made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and all to bepricketh the new married mans hand, and
maketh it bléed. And if he let her hand goe when he féeleth his
hand ſmart, they hold it for a ſigne that he will not loue her:
But if he hold faſt (notwithſtanding the ſmart) and wring her
hard by the hand vntill ſhe cry, rather than he will once ſhrinke,
then he is counted a louing man, and her friends are glad that
they haue beſtowed her on him.</p>
               <p>And how they honour marriage aboue others, I obſerued
by the naming of their firſt manchilde. For as amongſt vs the
women, when they are married, loſe their Surnames, and are

there was a little Church or Chappel there in good preparation,
whereinto (for a little money) we obtained leaue to enter, our
ſelues with our horſes and carriage, and there we brought out
our victuals, and refreſhed our ſelues, and baited our horſes,
and reſted vntill it left raining. After the ſhower, while our
horſes were preparing, we walked into the fields néere vnto the
Church, and ſaw many poore people gathering Mallas and thrée
leafed graſſe, and aſked them what they did with it: and they
anſwered, that it was all their foode; and that they boiled it,
and did eate it: then we tooke pitie on them, &amp; gaue them bread,
which they receiued very ioyfully, and bleſſed God that there
was bread in the world, and ſaid: they had not ſéene any bread
the ſpace of many moneths. We alſo gaue vnto them ſmall
pieces of ſiluer to relieue their neceſſitie, which they receiued
gratefully, and wiſhed that their Countrie were in the hands of

not vnlikely that ſome one of theſe thrée might haue dwelt at

            <p>On the fiftéenth day of March we went from <hi>Hus</hi> towards

(vntill we came within ten miles of <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) is a deſart, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited,

way certaine Canes to lodge in. But if they bring not prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them both for man and horſe, and ſome quilt or pillow
to ſléepe on, the hard ſtones muſt be their bed, and the aire their
ſupper: for ſome of their Canes are nothing but ſtone wals to
kéepe out théeues. In Cities they haue very ſtately Canes, but
not for Trauellers, but for themſelues to dwell in; for euerie
rich man calleth his houſe a Cane. But the Canes that ſtand in
high waies, are in charity erected by great men, for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Trauellers; but moſt of them are very badly kept, and
are worſe than ſtables. Our firſt daies iourney from <hi>Hus</hi> was
a very vncomfortable and dangerous deſart: we ſaw no houſe

but gouerned by <hi>Turks</hi> only. There is but one Church in the
Towne, which is dedicated to <hi>S. Nicolas,</hi> by the Chriſtians,
who firſt builded it. But both Chriſtians and Turkes pray
therein: the Chriſtians on the one ſide or Ile of the Church, and
the Turkes on the other. But the Chriſtians are ouer ruled
by the Turkes, and conſtrained to finde them oile to their lamps
in the Church. For the Turkes not only burne lamps in their
Churches euery night, but during the whole time of their Lent
they beſet the battlements of their ſteeples round about with
lampes. But when their Lent is ended, they burne lampes in
their ſtéeples onely once a wéeke, and that is on Thurſday at
night, which is the Eue before their Sabboth. After we had
refreſhed our ſelues héere, halfe the day being not yet ſpent, we

feared to goe any further. Yet meeting with company contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to expectation (March 17.) we went forwards, and ſaw no

for herunto is adioyned a fair new Church and a Bazar,
that is a Market place where trauellers may buy many good

                  <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was neuer ouercome; and that there haue béene
Chriſtians dwelling there euer ſince the time of <hi>Paul,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might keepe a memoriall of the very place: But to let the
place paſſe, the thing it ſelfe we know to be true.</p>
               <p>He ſhewed vs alſo the houſe of <hi>Ananias,</hi> which is vnder the
ground, whereinto we were led, downe a paire of ſtaires from
the ſtréete, as it were into a Celler; and the dore being vnlocked,
wee entred with candels into the place, where wee ſawe two
darke chambers, where a man cannot ſee to reade in the day
time without candels; here they ſay, he liued in ſecret for feare
of the Iewes. Many Chriſtians comming thither to ſée that
place, with a coale write their names on the wall, and there are
ſo many names there already, that there is ſcarce roome for any
other to ſet his name.</p>
               <p>Some of them report <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to be built in the place where
<hi>Kain</hi> killed his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> And ſome ſay it is néere it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

               <p>They take vpon them alſo at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to demonſtrate the
place where S. <hi>George</hi> was buried, ſo they do likewiſe at <hi>Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po,</hi>
but I thinke the one to be as true as the other.</p>
               <p>There is a fine towne néere vnto <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> about two or

moſt pleaſantly, with the gardens and pleaſant places about it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Damaſcus</hi> we met many thouſand Turkes going on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
towards <hi>Mecha</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> to viſit <hi>Mahomets</hi> ſepulchre,
as they vſually doe euery yéere about their <hi>Byram</hi> time; for
they hold that whoſoeuer once in his life time ſhall not goe on
Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> to ſée the ſepulcher of their Prophet, ſhall
neuer enter into Paradiſe. And therefore ſome of them goe
thither often in their life time, partly for deuotion, and partly
to buy merchandiſe. For there are brought thither at that time
of the yéere, great ſtore of commodities from <hi>India, Perſia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And it is forbidden to all Chriſtians vpon paine of death to
come néere <hi>Mecha</hi> within fiue miles: partly, leſt they ſhould
marre their markets; but chiefly, leſt they ſhould ſee their folly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2104:61"/>
or rather madneſſe in worſhipping an iron ſepulcher, after the
ſight whereof, many of their old men (which thinke neuer to
come thither againe) vſe to pull out both their eyes, after they
haue ſeene ſo holy a ſight (as they accout it) as their Prophets
ſepulcher, and thinke thereby to inherit heauen.</p>

yéere when the Carauan of Pilgrimes returneth from <hi>Mecha,</hi>
he that hath béene there oftneſt is called <hi>The great Hogie:</hi> and
is greatly honoured of them all, for he rideth before them all in
more ſtately apparell then they, with flowers and garlands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his horſe, and when they come néere any great Citie, the
chiefeſt men in the citie ride foorth to méet him, and bring him
into the Citie with great ſolemnitie.</p>
               <p>They falſly affirme that this their Temple at <hi>Mecha</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi>
was built by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they prepare themſelues with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
care to goe to worſhip there, then many Chriſtians do when
they come to the Lords Supper; for they diſburden their hearts
of all hatred and malice, and reconcile themſelues one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp;c. Otherwiſe they hold that all their labour is loſt, and
that they ſhalbe neuer a whit the better for their Pilgrimage.
But if they forgiue one another, and repent them for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſinnes, they thinke there to obtaine ful remiſſion of all their
ſinnes, and that at their returne they are pure and without
ſpot.</p>

often times ſtucke faſt in the puddles and miry places, and
ſometimes ready to breake their owne legs, and their Riders
necks among rocks and ſtones. It was neither pleaſant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on foot, nor riding this way, for there was no path nor euen
ground, but huge ſtones and rocks ſo néere together, that our
horſes could goe but a foot pace, and often times met with ſuch
mariſhes and quagmires, that we were conſtrained to goe
farre about before we could finde better waies to paſſe ouer.
It is alſo exceeding cold in this place alwaies (in reſpect of other
places in that Country) for there are neither trées, nor houſes,
nor high hils to keepe away the violence and force of the winds.
The Carauans that trauel vſually that way betwixt <hi>Damaſcus</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſay that this daies iourney troubleth them more
than all the reſt, and that they neuer paſſe by that way, but
they leaue two or three of their Cammels behinde them, ſome
miſfortune or other befalling vnto them. We ſaw alſo in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie

places this way, the carcaſes of many dead cammels which

came ſafely that day to <hi>Conetra,</hi> where we lodged in a good
Cane, diſtant from <hi>Saſſa</hi> 28. miles.</p>
               <p>After our tedious trauell to <hi>Conetra,</hi> finding the place plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

together from ſundry places. Some comming from
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and bound to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> pitched their tents without the
Cane, néere vnto the riuer. Others comming from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi>
and bound to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> accommodated themſelues (in ſuch
ſort as they could) within the Cane. But eſpecially in a Bazar
(like vnto a cloiſter) adioining to the Cane, wee tooke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

beholding, wondred at vs: (for it is not their cuſtome in thoſe

but to ſit ſtill on the ground like brute beaſts) and one of
them came vnto vs, and aſked vs what we meant to walke vp

or out of our wits. If your way (ſaid he) lieth toward the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end of the cloiſter, why come you downwards? And if at
the netherend, why goe you backe againe? We anſwered him,
For our pleaſure. He replied, that it was greater pleaſure to
ſit ſtill, than to walke vp and downe when we néed not. But
their brutiſh ſitting ſtil on the ground was as ſtrange vnto vs,
as our walking vp and downe was to them.</p>
               <p>It ſéemed no leſſe ſtrange vnto them to ſée a Chriſtian with
a cut dublet: and they called him foole, and aſked him what hée
meant to make holes in his coat: for they neither cut nor pinke
any of their garments, but weare them all plaine, ſparing for
no coſt to guard them with lace of ſiluer and gold if they be able.</p>
               <p>And ſuch as weare long haire on their heads, the Turkes
call ſlouens, and account them ſauage beaſts; for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
weare no haire on their heads at all, but ſhaue them eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

ſhaſh made of cotten woole, which they neuer vncouer in their

               <p>March 23. We had a more pleaſant way; for the firſt ten
miles wée rode thorow the fields and a very pleaſant Parke.
But when wée came out of this Parke or Foreſt, wee were
ſomewhat troubled, partly by reaſon of the bad way, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by bad people in the way. The way was ſtony and rockie
(as the former daies iourney was) but yet dry, and not long,
for it was but the deſcending downe a rockie hill, where though
the way were dangerous vnder our féet, yet it was pleaſant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our faces, for wée beheld the proſpect of part of the holy
Land, <hi>viz. Galile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at our deſending downe this mountaine, the people did
more trouble vs then the way; for there ſate amongſt the rocks
in our way many <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabs,</hi> with maces of Iron and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weapons, who ſtaied vs and demanded <hi>Caphar</hi> or tole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
we were glad to giue them content that wée might paſſe
ſafely by them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was glad to ſend his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> gifts,
for a <hi>Ne noceat</hi> (as the Lawyers ſpeake) that is, for feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Carauan</hi> of Chriſtians, who came after vs, though
they were many hundreds, yet ſome of them being not able,
ſome not willing to pay ſo much mony as they demanded, were
ſhrewdly beaten with their iron maſes. There was a <hi>Ieſuite</hi>
in their company, who eſcaped not without ſtripes, whereat
(as I haue heard) he reioiced, and counted it meritorious, in
that he ſuffered ſuch miſery in ſo holy a voyage. And in my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> one of his companions told him, that he meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much to ſuſteine ſuch trauell and labour, and be at ſo great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2104:63"/>
coſt and charges, and ſuffer ſo many ſtripes for Chriſts ſake:
But I know, had it not béene more for loue of his purſe than for
loue of Chriſt, he might haue eſcaped without ſtripes, yea
with theſe kinde ſpeeches, <hi>Marhabbah Ianum,</hi> that is, <hi>Welcome
my friend or ſweet-heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another place in my trauels I heard a Friar bragging of
his good workes, and ſaying, that hée had done ſo many good
workes, that if he ſhould kill thrée men, his good works would
make ſatiſfaction, and merit remiſſion for them all. To whom
one in my company anſwered, that by his murder he might
merit indéed a double reward, <hi>viz.</hi> death in this life, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the life to come, for blood will haue blood; For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed. But
to let paſſe theſe <hi>Ieſuiticall Iebuſites,</hi> or <hi>Iebuſiticall Ieſuites:</hi> In
that theſe trauellers were thus beaten for ſparing their purſes,
and though they were many hundreds, durſt not ſtrike them
againe,<note place="margin">An admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers.</note> héere I may fitly take occaſion to teach thoſe that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to trauell into Turkey, how to behaue themſelues. If
they be ſet vpon by théeues, they may defend themſelues in
their trauels, if they be ſtrong enough; but if they be poling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
(as theſe were) they muſt not be contradicted. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their Cities, nor in their trauels, may they ſtrike againe
though they be abuſed and beaten by any man (except they be
théeues and robbers) for if they doe, they ſhall either be put to
death, or haue their hand cut off. Neither if a man receiue a
box on the eare at any of their hands, muſt he giue one bad
word, or looke frowningly vpon him that ſmote him: for then
he will ſtrike him againe, and ſay, What, <hi>Goure?</hi> Doeſt thou
curſe me, and wiſh that the Deuill had me? But he muſt kiſſe
his beard, or the ſkirt of his garment, and ſmile vpon him, and
then he will let him paſſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, trauellers into thoſe parts muſt looke vpon the
picture of a ſeruant as of old he was wont to be painted, that
thereby they may learne how to behaue themſelues in trauell.</p>
               <p>I read, that of old they were wont to paint the picture of a
ſeruant at the doores of their houſes, that their ſeruants might
ſée how they ſhould behaue themſelues. And he was painted on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2104:64"/>
this manner; With the ſnout of a Swine, the eares of an Aſſe,
the feet of an Hart, with hands open, with his garments clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and on his head a bonnet, hauing on his backe a couleſtaffe,
with two veſſels, the one hauing in it fire, the other water.</p>
               <p>This deſcription, though it be rude and homely, yet it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
plainly ſeruants and trauellers their duties.</p>
               <p>The Swines ſnout declareth that they muſt not be daintie
mouthed, but muſt be content with any meat which God hath
prouided for man.</p>
               <p>The Aſſes eares, that they muſt patiently heare the ſharpe
ſpeeches of their Maſters, without anſwering againe.</p>
               <p>The Harts féet, that they muſt be ſwift in doing their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Their Hands wide open, that they muſt be faithfull, not
deceitfull: They muſt doe nothing cloſely or ſecretly: They
muſt haue their cheſts, their hands, their hearts open to their
Maſters eie and commandement, when it pleaſeth him to call
them to account.</p>
               <p>Their garments comely and honeſt, which their bonnet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that they muſt not be ſlouenly, but handſome and ſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparelled, and yet not proudly aboue their degrées.</p>
               <p>The couleſtaffe on their ſhoulder, that they muſt not refuſe
to doe any worke, no not to carry water.</p>
               <p>And the fire and water, the one before them, and the other
behinde, ſheweth their diſcretion in their buſineſſe: They muſt
not mingle fire and water together.</p>
               <p>Moſt of theſe qualities are required in Trauellers. In diet
they muſt not be dainty, but eat what they can get. Their
eares muſt not be nice, for they ſhall heare ſpeeches enough to
offend them. Their féet muſt be ſwift to flie from dangers:
Their hands wide open to giue liberally: Their apparell alſo
muſt be neat in Cities where they ſoiourne, for their credit:
But when they trauell abroad, it muſt be ſimple, for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for the baſer their apparell is, the better ſhall they paſſe:
for if they weare good apparell, their throats will be cut for
their apparell, and hope of much money: for thoſe that go braue
they account rich. And whereas in ſeruants it is commendable
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2104:64"/>
to haue aſſes eares; in trauellers it is néedfull to haue aſſes
backes alſo, to beare all abuſes in good part, and rather to beare
an hundreth abuſes then to offer one.</p>
               <p>Wherfore ſeruants and trauellers muſt alwaies remember
this Diſtichon, or couple of verſes following.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Nobile vincendi genus eſt patientia, vincit</l>

                  <l>A noble kind of conquering</l>
                  <l>is patience to ſee and heare:</l>
                  <l>He which forbeareth, conquereth,</l>
                  <l>If thou wilt conquer, learne to beare.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But to leaue theſe matters, and to procéede to my voiage.
At the foote of this mountaine there is an old Cane where v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
trauellers lodge: but it béeing not yet noone, we reſolued
to trauell 18 miles further, to the Sea of <hi>Galile.</hi> At the foote of
this ſtony hill, hard by this Cane, there runneth a pleaſant ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
which diuideth <hi>Siria</hi> from <hi>Galile.</hi> And ouer this riuer
there is a fair bridge, the one end whereof is out of the holy land,
the other in it. This riuer is called <hi>Iordane,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iordan.</note> the head whereof
commeth from <hi>Mount Libanus,</hi> and maketh three Seas.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the waters of <hi>Maron</hi> which wee left on our right
hand, about ten miles off. The other on the left hand, which lay
in our waie as we ſhould trauell.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the ſea of <hi>Galile,</hi> or <hi>Tiberias,</hi> or lake of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zereth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is the Sea of <hi>Sodome,</hi> called <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> where
the riuer <hi>Iordan</hi> endeth.</p>
               <p>The bridge that croſſeth this Riuer <hi>Iordan</hi> at the entrance
into the holy land, is called <hi>Iacobs</hi> bridge; for two cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is ſaid that there <hi>Iacob</hi> met his brother <hi>Eſau.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Iacobs bridge.</note> beginneth at this bridge, and to
this day it is a very pleaſant and fruitful Countrie. After wee
were entred into <hi>Galile</hi> about 2. miles from the bridge, our <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſarie</hi>
aſked vs whether we would go vp to a mountaine, and
ſo to <hi>Saphetta</hi> neere vnto mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> which is a place of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for Iewes; or keepe the lower way, and goe by the ſea of
<hi>Galile,</hi> which is the pleaſanter way: and thereof we made choiſe;
and tooke <hi>Saphetta</hi> in our way afterwards.</p>
               <p>About ſeuen miles from <hi>Iacobs</hi> bridge, our guide brought
vs to a well, adorned with marble pillers, and couered with
ſtone, which he ſaid to haue beene the pit whereinto <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was
put when his brethren ſold him to the <hi>Iſhmalites.</hi> But it ſeemed
to vs incredible: firſt, becauſe that was a dry pit, and this is ful
of ſweet water.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Iacob</hi> dwelt at <hi>Hebron</hi> twelue miles beyond <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and his ſonnes kept ſhéepe in <hi>Shechem.</hi> And that dry pit
whereinto they put <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was at <hi>Dothan</hi> (which we ſaw after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
And this pit which they ſhewed vs with marble pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
was in <hi>Galile;</hi> not néere <hi>Dothan</hi> nor <hi>Shechem</hi> where <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi>
brethren kept their fathers ſheepe.</p>
               <p>But by others of better iudgement wee vnderſtood that
this alſo was called <hi>Ioſeps</hi> pit, or well, becauſe it was built by
one <hi>Ioſph,</hi> not <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iacob,</hi> but ſome other. But
the ignorant people which trauell that way, are apt to beleeue
any things that is told them. About ten miles from this well,
we came to a Cane called by the Moores <hi>Minium,</hi> but by the
Turkes <hi>Miſſia,</hi> hard by the ſea of <hi>Galile,</hi> where we lodged all
night, hauing trauelled that day by computation 36. miles.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth of March we rode along by the Sea
of <hi>Galile,</hi> which, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 1. is called by two mames, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sea
of <hi>Galile</hi> or <hi>Tiberias. Galile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galile.</note> becauſe it is in <hi>Galile:</hi> and <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi>
becauſe the City <hi>Tiberias</hi> was built by it, and <hi>Bethſaida</hi>
an other ancient City; of both which we ſaw ſome ruinous
Wals. And it is ſaid in that Chapter (<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 1.) that Ieſus
went ouer the Sea of <hi>Galile:</hi> and in an other place that he went
beyond the Lake. And <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 10. It is ſaid, that hée went
into a ſlitary place, neere vnto a Citie called <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2104:65"/>
place of <hi>Iohn</hi> I learned to vnderſtand better by ſeeing it, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I could before by reading of it. For, ſéeing that <hi>Tiberias</hi>
and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> were both Cities on the ſame ſide of the Sea, and
Chriſt went from <hi>Tiberias</hi> too, or neere vnto <hi>Bethſaida;</hi> I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thereby that our Sauiour Chriſt went not ouer the length
or breadth of that Sea; but ouer ſome Arme, boſome or reach
thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo farre as <hi>Tiberias</hi> was diſtant from <hi>Bethſaida;</hi>
which is alſo confirmed in that it is ſaid elſwhere, <hi>A great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
followed him on foot thither;</hi> which they could not haue
done if he had gone quite ouer the Sea, to the other ſide among
the <hi>Gergelens,</hi> which is out of the holy Land. And therfore this
Sea of <hi>Galile,</hi> is alſo called the Lake of <hi>Geneſereth,</hi> becauſe the
Countrey of the <hi>Cergeſens</hi> is on the other ſide the Lake, from
whence the Swine ran headlong into the Sea and were choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
therein: and as that place was out of the holy Land; ſo the
people which then inhabited it, were as far from holines, when
they requeſted our ſauiour Chriſt to depart out of their Coaſts.
And ſuch like holy people inhabite there ſtill, <hi>viz.</hi> wild <hi>Arabs,</hi>
and <hi>Turks, &amp;c.</hi> We ſawe alſo (neere vnto this Sea) the place
where that Towne (mentioned <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 1. called <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile</hi>
ſtood, where our Sauiour Chriſt at a mariage turned water
into wine; in place whereof there ſtandeth now a poore village
inhabited by <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſea of <hi>Galile</hi> is (by computation) in length 8. leagues,
and in breadth 5. leagues, and euery league is thrée miles; and
then it encloſeth it ſelfe into a narrowe compaſſe, carrying but
the breadth of an ordinarie riuer vntill it come to <hi>Sodome,</hi>
where it endeth, which is called <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> that is, The
dead Sea.</p>
               <p>After we had rode about ſeuen miles by the ſea of <hi>Galile,</hi> we
left it on our left hand, and aſcended vp a mountaine on the
right hand.</p>
               <p>This mountaine was not very ſtéepie, but excéeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and fertile, for (being the ſpringtime) it was ſo beſet with
ſuch varietie of flowers among the greene graſſe, that they ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to flire in our faces, and to <hi>laugh and ſing</hi> (as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt

               <p>When we came to the top of the mountaine, we ſaw <hi>Saphet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>

formerly to haue béene Merchants of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> what they meant
to leaue their trade and to liue there: They anſwered, they
were now olde and came thither to die, that they might bée
néerer to heauen: wee told them, that howſoeuer they might
ſeeme there to bee néerer to heauen whiles they lined, becauſe
they dwelt on an high mountaine, yet that they ſhould not bee
néerer vnto heauen when they died, vnleſſe they repented and
beléeued in Chriſt, &amp;c. The Iewes haue here more libertie then
in any part of the holy land. They dare not come to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
for feare leſt the Chriſtians there dwelling, ſtone them.</p>
               <p>Whiles wee were at <hi>Saphetta,</hi> many Turkes departed from
thence towards <hi>Mecha</hi> in <hi>Arabia.</hi> And the ſame morning they
went, we ſaw many women playing with Tymbrels as they
went along the ſtréete, and made a yelling or ſcriking noiſe as
though they cryed. We aſked what they meant in ſo doing?
It was anſwered vs, that they mourned for the departure of
their huſbands, who were gone that morning on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilgrimage
to <hi>Mecha,</hi> and they feared that they ſhould neuer ſée them again,
becauſe it was a long way and dangerous, and many died there
euery yéere. It ſéemed ſtrange to vs, that they ſhould mourne
with muſicke about the ſtréetes, for muſicke is vſed in other
places at times of mirth, and not at times of mourning. But
they did it but <hi>Paruae conſuetudmis cauſa.</hi> For a litle cuſtomes
ſake. And I doubt not but many of them were glad for their
departure, and would be glader if they would neuer come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they vſe them ſo kindly.</p>
               <p>And vnder pretence of deuotion, many trauell to <hi>Mecha</hi> to

               <p>All the way which we trauelled this day, was very pleaſant;

much the rather becauſe I had read that the Papiſts to prooue

alledge this for one argument, after that Chriſt was
tranſfigured vpon mount <hi>Tabor</hi> (as we read <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 1. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
and there appeared to them, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> talking with him,

vnderſtanding that it was very dangerous by reaſon of wilde
<hi>Arabs</hi> which lodged in caues and rockes and buſhes about the
mountaine,<note place="margin">Mount Tabor</note> we hired ſome of the principall <hi>Arabs</hi> to goe with vs
and guard vs from the reſt. And as we went, we beheld the
proſpect of the mountaine to be very pleaſant, ſomewhat ſtéepy,
but not very high (in reſpect of ſome other mountaines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about)
nor very large, but a comely round mountaine, beſet
with trees and thicke buſhes, which at that time of the yéere
flouriſhed greene: we rode ſo farre as we could for ſteepineſſe
and then left ſome of our ſeruants at the foot of the mountaine
to keepe our horſes, and tooke vpon vs to clamber vp on foot,
which we ſhould neuer haue been able to haue done, had there
not beene very high graſſe, ſprigs, and buſhes to hold by.</p>
               <p>One of our <hi>Arabs</hi> went vp before vs, as faſt as if it had been
euen ground, but we came very ſlowly after, which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
would looke backe, and often vſe theſe words to chéere vs,
<hi>Gel, Gel, Gel,</hi> that is, <hi>come, come, come:</hi> And ſometimes theſe,

of breath, and one of our company cried, For the loue of God
let vs returne, for I can goe no further, Oh I ſhall die, I ſhall
die. Whereupon one of vs being néerer the top than he himſelfe
ſuppoſed, (to chéere the reſt) ſaid, Come chéerefully; I am on
the top; which ſomewhat hartued the reſt: otherwiſe they had
all gone downe againe.</p>
               <p>Being on the top, we reſted a while to take breath; and then
we walked vp and downe the top of the Mount, and ſaw onely
one houſe, or rather low cottage, vninhabited, hauing onely
two darke roomes in it, méet for foxes or iackals to lodge in, and
ſaw no ſigne of any other tauerne or tabernacle. Only we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that (many yéeres ſince) there was a Monaſterie there
inhabited by Popiſh Friers, but being moleſted by the <hi>Arabs,</hi>
tooke away the holineſſe with them, and left the mountaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them; yet ſtill they call this mount <hi>Tabor</hi> in Italian
<hi>Monte Santo,</hi> that is, the holy mountaine: as if there were ſome
inherent holineſſe in the mountaine.</p>
               <p>And two daies after we had béene there, came a Ieſuite and
two Friers with a yong Gentleman of <hi>Parris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:2104:67"/>
was a Proteſtant; and ſome other company with them,<note place="margin">Conference betwixt a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite and a Proteſtant.</note> who
had a deſire to aſcend to the top of this holy mountaine, &amp; went
all together vntill they were wearie which was at the foote of
the mountaine, and in the heat of the day: wherefore the
French Gentleman ſaid, he would ſtay for them there vntill
they returned, but was himſelfe already weary and would goe
no higher; the Ieſuite and Friers reproued him, and called him
foole, and told him he did not know what hee might merit by
going to the top of that holy mountaine.<note place="margin">Merit-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> Merit, (ſaid the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)

yéeres pardon. The Gentleman, to breake a ieſt with them,
aſked them whether he might merit fiftie yeeres pardon for the
time paſt, or for the time to come: If (ſaid he) for the time paſt,
I am not ſo old (for he was but twenty two yeeres of age) if
for the time to come, hée did not thinke hée ſhould liue ſo long.
They anſwered him, if he did not liue ſo long, he might giue the
yéeres which remained to his friends. Yet could they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to goe vp any higher.</p>
               <p>The ſame Ieſuite called this French Gentleman, Heretike,
becauſe he did not profeſſe himſelfe a Romaniſt: He denied his
argument; and although he was not able to diſpute with him
Scholar-like, yet he anſwered him Chriſtian-like, and told him
that he did abhorre the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the nature more:
The Ieſuite ſaid, Thou ſcarce knoweſt the name, much leſſe
the nature of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Gentleman replied, I haue read of
both. And that <hi>Rome</hi> had a name according to her nature, hée
ſhewed by theſe verſes following:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Roma quid eſt? Quod te docuit praepoſterus ordo.</l>

                  <l>Roma amor eſt: Amor eſt? Qualis? Praeposterus. Vnde hoc?</l>

               <p>The ſame in Engliſh:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Rome what is? A Loue. A loue? What loue?</l>
                  <l>Contrary vnto kinde.</l>

ſtaied by our <hi>Ieneſarie,</hi> who ſaw not only theſe <hi>Arabs</hi> preſent
very deſperat, with their bowes and arrowes ready drawen,
but meſſengers alſo ſent to raiſe vp all the whole rabblement
thereabout vpon vs: he told vs we were beſt giue them content
or elſe we were all but dead men: wherefore to auoid further
danger, we gaue them their owne deſire, vpon condition, they
would purſue vs no further, nor ſuffer any of their company to
moleſt vs: the chiefeſt of them anſwered, <hi>Stopherlo, Stopherlo,</hi>
that is, God forbid, God forbid we ſhould do you any harme,
if you pay vs what wee demaund; which we did with all ſpéed,
and rode away from them being glad we were rid of them.</p>
               <p>About ten miles from them we rode through a wood, (a very
fit place to harbour theeues, who had killed certaine men tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling
that way the day before, and tooke away both a man and
horſe from the <hi>Carauan</hi> which followed after; and a woman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
riding on an aſſe with their cariage) and (as our guide tolde
vs) he neuer trauelled that way but he ſawe ſome men killed:
and therefore bade vs all charge our pieces and ſhoot off when
he bade vs, though we ſaw no bodie, leſt the wild <hi>Arabs</hi> ſhould
ſet vpon vs on the ſuddain, lying in ambuſh, which wee alſo
did in a place moſt dangerous, to daunte the enemies before we
ſaw each other. But before we came vnto the moſt dangerous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2104:70"/>
place, there ouertooke vs many <hi>Turkes</hi> well armed, who dwelt
in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were glad of our company thither. And ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after we had diſcharged euery man his peece, we ſaw a great
company of <hi>Arabs</hi> on an high mountaine neere vnto our way,
yet out of the reach of our ſhot, who perceiuing vs to be too
ſtrong for them, durſt not ſet vpon vs.</p>
               <p>And ſo (by the prouidence of God) we came that night to an
ancient and famous City,<note place="margin">Samaria.</note> (ſituated in a fruitfull valley betwixt
two mountaines) called <hi>Sychar,</hi> a City in <hi>Samaria,</hi> mentioned
<hi>Iohn</hi> 4. Néere whereunto we ſaw <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour

thereof liberally and freely. The water thereof goeth downe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleaſantly, like vnto milke.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well we went into the City, and lodged in a
very ancient &amp; ſtately Cane, but very badly kept. It had béene
better for vs to haue ſlept by <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, as others did; for here
we ſlept on the hard ſtones néere vnto a Chapel in the middle of
the Cane, vnder two or thrée great figge trees and mulberry
trées, where we were ſcarce ſafe from theeues; for we had ſome
things ſtollen from vs in the night, whiles we ſlept vnder the
trees on faire broad ſtones, whereunto we aſcended by a faire
ſtone paire of ſtaires, ſix or ſeuen ſteps from the ground. <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char</hi>
is diſtant from <hi>En-gannim</hi> 27. miles.</p>
               <p>March 28. We ſtaied at this City in <hi>Samaria,</hi> called of old

               <p>The cauſe of our ſtaying this day at <hi>Sychar,</hi> was this, it was
told vs that 2. <hi>Emeers</hi> or great Lords in our way to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
were vp in armes one againſt an other, and therefore it ſéemed
good to our <hi>Ieneſary</hi> that wee ſhould ſtay for the <hi>Carauan,</hi> that
we might be the ſtronger and paſſe ſafer. But when the <hi>Carauan</hi>
came, they pitched their tents by <hi>Iacobs</hi> well, and purpoſed to
ſtay there two or three daies at the leaſt. Wee were loath to
ſtay ſo long being now but thirtie miles from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and
therefore reſolued to procéed in our iourney without any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
expectation for companie which was vncertaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March.</hi> 29. We departed from <hi>Samaria</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and met
many ſouldiers in ſeuerall companies by the way, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our <hi>Ieneſary</hi> and other Turks in our company, let vs paſſe
by them quietly, and gaue vs the <hi>ſalam alick,</hi> that is <hi>peace be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part of this daies iourney was ſomewhat pleaſant;
but, the néerer we came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the more barren and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
our way was. About ten of the clock wee came to a great
forreſt or wildernes full of trées and mountaines. When wée
were on the top of this mountaine, wée ſaw the maine ſea on
our right hand, and ſmall Ships ſayling towards <hi>Ioppa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About thrée or foure of the clocke, we came to a ruinous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Beere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beere,</note> but of old (as it is reported) <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> which
in former times was a great Citie: And it is ſaid to be the place
where <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> comming from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the feaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended) miſſed the child <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and ſought him ſorrowing; and
returning to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> found him in the Temple amidſt the
Doctors, hearing them and poſing them. Our purpoſe was to
lodge here all night, being all of vs weary and hungry, and all
our prouiſion ſpent. But finding nothing here to bee had for
money either for man or horſe; and vnderſtanding that <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
was but ten miles off, we went on in our way ſomewhat
<pb facs="tcp:2104:71"/>
faintly fiue or ſixe miles,<note place="margin">Ieruſalem.</note> and then beholding the proſpect of the
Citie, wee were ſomewhat cheered and reuiued, and ſolaced our
ſelues with ſinging of Pſalmes, vntill we came neere vnto the
Citie.</p>
               <p>Many Gréekes dwelling in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſeeing vs a farre off,
came to meet vs, ſuppoſing their Patriarch had been in our
companie, who came two or thrée daies after vs.</p>
               <p>Wee diſmounted from our horſes at the weſt gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">Ioppa gate.</note>
called <hi>Ioppa</hi> gate, or the Caſtle gate; which is a very ſtrong
gate of iron, with thirteen pieces of braſſe ordinance planted on
the wall about the gate. Wee ſtaied in the porch of this gate,
and might not be admitted into the Citie, vntill we were ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by an officer (as the maner is.) In the meane time there
came to vs two Italian Friers, <hi>viz. Padre Angelo,</hi> and <hi>Padre
Aurel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o</hi> and kiſſed our hands, and bade vs welcome, and told vs
that two other Engliſhmen were at their houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> maſter
<hi>Timberley,</hi> and maſter <hi>Borell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we were ſearched without the gate by a Turkiſh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
and deliuered vp our weapons to the porter to kéepe for vs
in the gate-houſe vntill our returne (becauſe no Chriſtian may
enter into <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with weapons) theſe two <hi>Padres</hi> led vs
to their Monaſterie; at the gate whereof wee were ſearched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by another Turkiſh officer before wee might enter into
the houſe. For the office of the former ſearcher at the gate of
the Citie was onely to receiue the weapons of all Chriſtians,
and deliuer them ſafe to them againe at their departure. But
this ſearcher went further and ſearched all our cariage which he
cauſed to be opened, to ſee whether we had any gun-powder or
any other engins there. For they are very ſuſpicious of all
Chriſtians, fearing, leſt for deuotion to the place, they ſhould
worke treaſon; therefore they ſuffer not Chriſtians to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City weaponed, leſt they make inſurrection againſt them
when they are many together, and conquer the Citie, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haue done,</p>
               <p>To this end alſo is the Citie walled about with ſtrong wals,
and fortified with foure ſtrong gates and a Caſtle, (built by
<hi>Sultan Soliman</hi>) and euery gate well planted with ordinance for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2104:72"/>
feare of Chriſtians. And partly for hope haue they enuironed
this City with ſuch ſtrong wals, that Chriſtians for deuotion to
the place, might come and build within the wals and be ſubiect to
the Turke. For though their walles bee large and ſtrong, yet
there is great roome within the wals to build more houſes then
are there, for there are fields of Corne within the walles of the
Citie; and the houſes ſtand very thin, ſcattered, and diſperſed,
héere one and there two or three together; there is not one
faire ſtréet in all <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> as it now is.</p>
               <p>After they had thus narrowly ſearched al our cariage, euen to
our Caſes of Bottles, we were admitted into the Monaſtery; at
the entrance whereinto, met vs maſter <hi>Timberley</hi> and maſter
<hi>Boreel,</hi> and then <hi>Signior Franciſcus Mannerba</hi> the <hi>Padre Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
of the monaſtery, and all the reſt in order, and bade vs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and led vs into a faire parler and ſet good chéere before vs,
and ſerued vs themſelues.</p>
               <p>After ſupper wee deliuered them our letters which wee had
brought from the <hi>Venice</hi> Conſull of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi>
Merchants there in our behalfe. Which when they had read,
the Guardian ſaid, our cuſtome is, when ſtangers come to vs,
to call them the firſt night to Maſſe, and to Confeſſion, and to
giue euery man a candle to hold in his hand at Maſſe time; and
at night to waſh their feete and to bring them to bed, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other ceremonies during the whole time of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
there.</p>
               <p>But as for vs, they vnderſtood by letters what we were; and
told vs that wee were ſo highly commended by their Patrones
and Benefactors, the <hi>Venice</hi> Conſul, and Merchants of <hi>Aleppo,</hi>
that if they ſhould ſhew vs halfe the fauour which was required
at their hands, they ſhould themſelues lie without doores, and
ſuffer vs to rule and <hi>dominier</hi> at our pleaſures. And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would not vrge vs to any thing againſt our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but giue frée libertie both of perſons and conſciences as if
we were in <hi>England,</hi> or in our own houſes elſewhere: &amp; ſo much
the rather becauſe they vnderſtood our Merchants were rich, and
hoped to gaine by vs. In regard wherof, although it were Lent,
wherein they eate no fleſh, yet offered vs Hens, Egs, Milke:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2104:72"/>
any thing that was there to bee had for money, they requeſted
vs to command it.</p>
               <p>And during the time of our continuance there, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one <hi>Padre Aurelio</hi> to attend vpon vs, and ſée that we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing; and another of his brethren, one <hi>Padre Angelo,</hi> to
be our guide abroad and to ſhew vs al ancient Monuments and
places worth ſéeing either in the Citie or out of the Citie.</p>
               <p>Theſe kind ſpeeches being vſed, they brought vs to our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
where we ſhould lodge all night, &amp; prouided for uery man
ſeuerally a good neate bed with faire ſhéetes and all things very
holeſome and handſome, where we ſlept ſwéetly, and refreſhed
our wearied bodies all that night very comfortably.</p>
               <p>But although they dealt thus kindly with vs (at the inſtance
of their benefactors) in giuing vs liberty of conſcience, yet they
deale not ſo with others. For ſome I doe know who haue béen

               <p>True it is, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> giue liberty of conſcience vnto

               <p>After we had reſted one night in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the firſt day wée
walked about the City our ſelues without our guide, onely to
view the City, not inquiring of any place what it was, becauſe
on the morrow after, and euery day during our continuance,
(which was about fourtéene daies) our guide either walked on
foot,<note place="margin">Reſolution of a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters warming himſelfe in the high Prieſts hall.</note> or rode with vs, to ſée all things worthy obſeruation. Only
one thing I obſerued and duly conſidered the firſt day I came,
which was this; that where as we read in the Goſpell, that
when our Sauiour Chriſt was betraied, and brought into the
High Prieſts Hall, <hi>Peter</hi> following him, ſtood by the fire, and
warmed himſelfe; the reaſon is there yéelded, becauſe it was
cold. And the memoriall néereof we obſerue in March or Aprill.
We being there at the ſame ſeaſon of the yéere, found it excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hot, &amp; hotter than it is vſually at midſommer in England:
It ſeemed ſtrange vnto me, how it ſhould then be ſo cold, that
<hi>Peter</hi> ſhould créepe to the fire, and now (at the ſame ſeaſon) ſo
hot that we could not endure the heat of the Sunne. And on
the ſudden I knew not whether the ſeaſon were altered, or the
paſſion of Chriſt might be referred to ſome colder ſeaſon of the
yéere. But after I had béene there a few daies, the very place
reſolued that doubt: For there fall great dewes, and before the
Sunne haue dried it vp, it is cold, and in the night ſeaſon (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that time of the yéere) ſomewhat cold, as I felt by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
when I ſlept in the fields all night. And <hi>Peter</hi> hauing
watched with Chriſt in the night, might well be cold in the
morning, before the heat of the Sunne had expelled cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:2104:74"/>
And yet another reaſon (in my iudgement) more effectuall
than the former,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note> may be yéelded for this matter, taken <hi>à ſimili,</hi>
that as the ſame night that Chriſt was borne, there was great
light at midnight, in token of comfort; And at the time of his
death, great darkneſſe at noone day, in token of ſorrow (for
the Sunne put on his mourning garment, and was aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to looke vpon that cruelty which the ſonnes of men were
not afraid to commit) So at the time of his betraying there
might be extraordinary cold wether, in that an extraordinarie
perſon ſuffered, and an extraordinary worke was in hand. And
extraordinary things happened about the time of his paſſion, as
we read in the Goſpell, <hi>viz.</hi> How the graues did open: The dead
bodies of Saints (which ſlept) aroſe: The veile of the Temple
did rent in twaine from the top of the bottome: The earth did
tremble, and the ſtones did cleaue aſunder. Theſe things decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that a notable perſon ſuffered. The like alteration might
be in the coldneſſe of the aire, and alteration of wether. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we read it not in expreſſe words, yet (ſince I haue
ſéene <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>) it ſéemeth to me, that it may be gathered from
that place of the Goſpell, where it is ſaid, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> warmed
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>For (if we truly calculate the time) the ſeaſon of the yéere
was hot ordinarily; and <hi>Simon Peter</hi> at that ſeaſon of the yéere
was ſo cold, that he was driuen to the fire, and therefore it
ſhould ſéeme to be vnſeaſonable wether, and extraordinarily
cold. Theſe conſiderations haue ſatiſfied my ſelfe (howeuer
they ſatiſfie others) vntill I heare or read ſome more ſufficient
reaſon.</p>

themſelues in their ſinnes, and cried, <hi>Templum Domini, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum
Domini, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of thy Lord.</hi>
But through their prophanation, they made the Temple of the

did not his will on whom they cried. For ſwéet grapes, they
yeelded ſowre; for hearty and ſincere ſeruice, hypocriticall and
painted ſhewes of Religion. Their glory was in the externall
beauty of their materiall Temple: They wondred at the ſtones
and goodly buildings, at the gorgeous furniture and pretious
gifts, wherewith it was both outwardly and inwardly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and enriched. Whereupon our Sauiour (to take away the
cauſe of this vaine hope, and fooliſh ioy) tooke occaſion thus to
Prophecie of that glorious Temple: <hi>Are theſe the things that
you looke vpon? The daies will come wherein there ſhall not be
left a ſtone vpon a ſtone, which ſhall not bee deſtroied.</hi> This
Prophecie was as euidently accompliſhed as it was made: for

they cry of thoſe crucifiers, <hi>His blood be vpon our heads, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Yea the violence of the <hi>Romans</hi> procéeded further, and pulled

that (according to the expreſſe words of our Sauiours Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie)
they left not one ſtone vpon another. The <hi>Iewes</hi> ſundry

the potters field bought with the thirtie pieces of ſiluer which
<hi>Iudas</hi> had for betraying his maſter Chriſt; called <hi>Acheldama:</hi>
which to this day is a place to bury ſtrangers in.</p>
               <p>Aſcending vp <hi>Acheldama,</hi> we entred into a porch, and looked
downe into a vault, where wee ſaw many dead bodies; couered
onely with their winding ſheet knit at the head and foot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

they call the Sepulcher of the Kings.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they brought vs to mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> to the place where
Chriſt was crucified, ouer which there is now erected a ſtately
building with many Iles, Chancels, or little Chapels, in it for
ſundry Nations, which were al there at that preſent time as we
were, and lodged there on Saterday at night before Palme
Sunday.</p>
               <p>We entred into this Temple to ſée the Sepulcher on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
after dinner, and came not foorth vntill Monday about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of the clocke, for there are lodgings adioining vnto it, into
which we entred through the higheſt Chancell or Chappell.</p>
               <p>Before wee were admitted hereunto, euery man paied nine
Shekines to ſee the Sepulcher, which money the <hi>Syniacke:</hi>
or chiefe Ruler of the citie hath, who is a Turke. Into the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
we went but one at a time with our guide; the entrance
thereinto is lowe and narrow. The place it ſelfe is but the
length of an ordinary Sepulcher, it is now as high as an Altar
or table, of faire marble ſtone, and there are lampes continually
burning night and day.</p>
               <p>That this Sepulcher ſtandeth in the ſame place as the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
did wherein the bodie of our Sauiour Chriſt was laid, wée
made no doubt, becauſe it was agréeable to the circumſtances of
Scripture whereby the place is deſcribed.</p>
               <p>But I aſked our guide whether any part of the ſelfeſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
wherein the bleſſed bodie of our Sauiour was laid,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2104:77"/>
were to be ſéene there? Hee anſwered me, that ſome part of it
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome other part of it lay incloſed vnder that
Altar; but not to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>And further he told me, that at the firſt, after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Sauiour Chriſt, all the whole Sepulcher was to bee
ſeene for many yeeres ſpace, vntill ſtrangers (who came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
it) began to breake off péeces and to cary them away: then
it was incloſed with barres, and to be ſéene through the barres,
but not to bée touched, as ſome Sepulchers in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church in <hi>London</hi> are.</p>
               <p>Yet they ſaw inconueniences héerein, in that many vſed to
caſt into it the firſt haire of their children, and ſome candles, and
other things as an offering thereunto; ſo that the place could
not be kéep neate. Wherefore Quéene <hi>Helena</hi> cauſed it to bée
incloſed in ſuch ſort as it now is, and couered it with Marble.</p>
               <p>But whether any part of the ſelfe ſame Sepulcher were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the ſame or not; it gaue me content that I had ſeene
the ſelfe ſame place where the Sepulcher of our bleſſed Sauiour
was; as I in heart did then, and do ſtill perſwade my ſelfe it is.</p>

reſt of the Friers were at their <hi>Altum ſilentium,</hi> giuing eare to
the fables read out of their <hi>Legende;</hi> we were at the third part
of our meale, <hi>viz. Rumor gentium;</hi> talking both of forraine and
domeſticall matters.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> on mount <hi>Caluarie</hi> in the houſe erected ouer the
Sepulcher, they ſhew vnto ſtrangers a marble piller where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
they ſay, our Sauiour was bound when hee was whipt
for our ſakes: but who is ſo ſimple to thinke that there was any
marble piller erected without the Citie for ſuch a purpoſe to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
offendors (as they accounted our Sauiour Chriſt) at that
day?</p>
               <p>Or who knoweth the particular place where he was impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at this day? Yet, ſay they, this is the place where Chriſt
was impriſoned whiles they were making his Croſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:2104:80"/>
And this is the place where (the Croſſe being laid a long) our
Sauiour was faſtened or nailed vnto it.</p>
               <p>And this is the place where the Croſſe ſtoode: and haue made
there two holes in ſigne of it, as though the nether parte of his
Croſſe conſiſted of two parts or pillers.</p>
               <p>And néere vnto the tower of <hi>Sylo</hi> they ſhew a water comming
from vnder a rocke, which they call the poole <hi>Syloam:</hi> and there
(ſay they) did the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> waſh the childs clouts.</p>
               <p>And neere vnto the Sepulcher there is a great ſtone, clouen
with hammers, and ſet one piece a foot from another: and this
(ſay they) is the vayle of the Temple which rent in ſunder at
the time of Chriſts ſuffering, which is moſt rediculous.</p>
               <p>And although it be true (as we read <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 29. 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that
Chriſt rode on that Aſſe which his two Diſciples brought from
the village ouer againſt mount Oliuet, called <hi>Bethania</hi> or <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phage,</hi>
(for they are both together) and as hee rode from the
mount of Oliues to Ieruſalem, the people cried <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and
ſpread their garments in the way, and cut down branches from
the trées, and ſtrawed them in the way.</p>
               <p>Yet it is a rediculous matter, and a ſuperſtitious cuſtome
for their chiefe Frier called <hi>Padre Guardian,</hi> euery Palme Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in the morning to ſend two of his Friers from the mount of
Oliues to <hi>Betha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(in an apiſh imitation of Chriſt) the great one rideth on the litle
one towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the reſt ſpread their garment on the
Aſſe, and in the way; and cut downe branches from the trees,
and ſtraw them in the way.</p>
               <p>Wiſer are the Turkes herein then they, who although they
ſuffer them to come with their Aſſe to the gates of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> yet
admit them not to enter into the gates in ſuch manner.</p>
               <p>And that Turke was to be commended, who (when the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
followed their <hi>Guardian</hi> in ſuch ſort riding on an Aſſe) ſeeing
a ſimple Chriſtian woman ſtrip her ſelfe ſo farre, as in modeſty
ſhe might, and ſpread her garments in the way; tooke a cudgel
and all to belabored her therewith, ſaying, Thou foole, art thou
ſo mad to thinke that this is Chriſt?</p>
               <p>I, with the reſt of my companions was at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2104:81"/>
Palme Sunday, but neither ſaw this, no heard of it vntill it
was done; for it ſéemed that they were aſhamed that any man
of knowledge ſhould behold ſuch an abſurd ſight. But the
Frenchmen and Dutchmen, and many others of other nations
followed them, but not one Engliſhman, who could not pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
endure to ſee their Sauiour Chriſt ſo diſhonoured.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bethania</hi> and <hi>Bethphage</hi> are many fig-trées growing, and
on this fig trée (ſay they) <hi>Zacheus</hi> (being a man of worſhip in a
famous Citie) like a boy climed vp to ſee Chriſt as he paſſed by.
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>And at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> they take vpon them to ſhewe the place
where Chriſt made the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> &amp; where the Apoſtles made
the <hi>Creed,</hi> and where S. <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned, and where <hi>Iudas</hi>
hanged himſelfe. <hi>Pilats</hi> houſe. <hi>Peters</hi> priſon. The garden
where he was betrayed. Where the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> was in an
agony. Where Chriſt ſaid to his mother, <hi>Ecce homo,</hi> and ſhee
ſaid vnto him, <hi>Ecce mulier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On mount Oliuet there is a litle Chappell, and therein a ſtone,
whereon (ſay they) our Sauiour Chriſt trode when he aſcended
into heauen; and the print of his toes remaine to be ſéene in that
ſtone to this day. There is indéed a dint in a ſtone, like vnto the
former part of a mans foote, but that it is the print or impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Sauiours féet, who will beléeue that he trode ſo hard
to leaue any impreſſion of his foot, or tipping of his toes behind?</p>
               <p>At the foot of mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> they ſhewed vs the valley of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſapha;</hi>
and there (ſay they) ſhall bee ſet a throne at the day
of Iudgement, wherein Chriſt ſhall ſit and kéepe his laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all nations ſhall appeare before him, euen in this very
place, ſay they: as though any man could demonſtrate the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular place.</p>
               <p>The ground of this opinion they fetch from <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 2. where
God ſaith, <hi>I will g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into the valley of Iehoſaphat, &amp;c.</hi> which place they doe not, or
will not vnderſtand. For it is to be vnderſtood, either by the
way of alluding, as hauing regard to the valley where God mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
ſlew the enemies of <hi>Jehoſaphat:</hi> and ſo it may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the valley of deſtruction prepared for the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:2104:81"/>
Or the Lord hath reſpect vnto the word <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> which
ſignifieth pleading or iudgement: becauſe God would in the
day of Chriſt iudge the enemies of the Church, as then hee
did in the valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat.</hi> Wherefore, it is not to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the materiall <hi>Joſaphat,</hi> but of <hi>Joſaphat</hi> ſo tearmed,
becauſe the iudgement which heere ſhall bee pronounced, ſhall
reſemble that which there was executed vpon the <hi>Moabites</hi>
and <hi>Amonites</hi> and the inhabitants of <hi>Seir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what is <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> (if you interpret it) but the iudgement
of the Lord? And what is the valley, but the depth of that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Into which <hi>Solomon</hi> doth aſſure the yoong man, that
God will bring him after all the iollity of his youth, after hée
hath chéered himſelfe in the daies of his youth, and walked in
the way of his heart, and in his ſight, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
               <p>After conference had with their <hi>Padre Vicatio</hi> (who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the beſt learned amongſt them) hauing told him thus
much in effect as I haue héere written, he aſked me a reaſon
why the Prophet ſhould ſpecifie this place, if he meant not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to teach the Church, that héere this Iudge was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected?</p>
               <p>My anſwer was: Two reaſons had he to make choice of it,
by alluſion to which he might ſhadow to the <hi>Iewes</hi> the day of
Iudgement.</p>
               <p>One was the freſhneſſe of that famous deliuerances memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
which the Lord had wrought in it for them.</p>
               <p>Another, the great reſemblance that will be betwéene the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and that particular iudgement of his.</p>
               <p>For from the time of this Prophet, yet had there not a mans
age paſſed, ſince (without ſtroke of theirs) the Lord had in this
valley, within the ſight of this City, diſpatched thrée whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which had ioined forces to beleager them: And further,
in ſuch ſort, as in that generall iudgement he will diſpatch the
wicked. For as héere, though the <hi>Moabite,</hi> the <hi>Amonite,</hi> and
the inhabitant of <hi>Seir,</hi> bound themſelues againſt <hi>Iuda,</hi> and yet
could not preuaile; ſo there, though the Moabitiſh fleſh, the
Amonitiſh world, the ſauage inhabitant of <hi>Seir</hi> the Deuill, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a league againſt the elect, yet ſhall they haue no hand at
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2104:82"/>
them. As theirs had, ſo ſhall theſe and their complices haue,
ſwords of their owne conſciences accuſing them, to turne into
their owne bowels.</p>
               <p>And as the ſame place was to them a valley of iudgement,
which to the <hi>Iewes</hi> was a valley of bleſſing; ſo ſhall that great
day be to the wicked a day of iudgement, for they ſhall receiue
that heauy doome, <hi>Goe you curſed;</hi> which to the godly ſhall be
a day of bleſſing, for they ſhall heare that ioifull voice, <hi>Come
you bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Frier was not ſatiſfied with this anſwer, but perſiſted
obſtinate in his errour, and therefore I leaft him as I found
him, referring him to the triall thereof at the day of iudgement.</p>
               <p>They ſay alſo, that the ſtaires of the High Prieſts Hall,
whereupon our Sauiour trod when he went to be iudged, are
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the nailes which nailed him to his Croſſe. But
the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory reporteth, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made of
thoſe nailes, when his mother had found them in the Mount
where Chriſt was crucified, a bridle and an helmet for his
owne vſe. So bigge were the nailes, and ſuch wide wounds
they made in his bleſſed hands and féet, that they were rather
digged than pierced: which alſo <hi>Dauid</hi> foreſhewed by theſe
words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>Foderunt manus meas &amp; pedes meos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the way from that which they call the High Prieſts
Hall, or the iudgement Hall, towards <hi>Mount Caluery,</hi> at the
end of the Lane, on the right hand: Héere (ſay they) they met
<hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyren,</hi> and compelled him to helpe Chriſt to beare his
Croſſe when he fainted.</p>
               <p>And going downe another Lane on the left hand, they poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto an houſe, and ſaid, Héere the rich glutton dwelt,
who refuſed to reléeue <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which is a Parable, and not
an Hiſtory. And though it were a true Hiſtory, yet who can
point with the finger at the particular place where the houſe
ſtood, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> hauing béene ſo often altered and tranſformed?</p>
               <p>From thence turning vp towards Mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> on the

them) the houſe where a woman called <hi>Veronica</hi> dwelt, who
ſéeing our Sauiour Chriſt paſſe by her doore towards Mount

                  <hi>Caluarie,</hi> and all in a ſweat, ſhe brought foorth a <hi>Sudarium,</hi> that
is, a napkin or handkerchiefe to wipe his face, which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and hauing wipt his face therewith, gaue it to her againe:
and therein (ſay they) remained the print of his face, and is to
be ſéene at <hi>S. Peters</hi> houſe at <hi>Rome</hi> to this preſent day.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a City in <hi>Spaine</hi> which braggeth of the ſame

<pb facs="tcp:2104:84"/>
ſoone as we had paſſed that dore, we crept very lowe, as it were
into an Ouen mouth, euery man with a Candle in his hand; and
ſo came into a darke roome foure ſquare, with Benches round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of ſtone, hollow, like vnto Mangers, and therin (they ſay)
ſome of the noble famely of the Kings and Quéenes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
<hi>Iudah</hi> were buried.</p>
               <p>From thence they brought vs into another roome of like ſort,
and for like vſe; &amp; ſo from one to another, that (without a guide)
it was impoſſible to find the way out. How many ſuch roomes
there are, I know not: but wee were in ſix or ſeuen, and they
offered to bring vs into more, but being almoſt ſtifled for want
of light and aire, we deſired to returne.</p>
               <p>I make no quſtion, but they were places of buriall; for in the
hollow benches of ſtone wee ſawe bones of men: but whether
they were the ſepulchers of the kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> or not,
is my doubt.</p>
               <p>At the entrance in the Temple where the Sepulcher is to bee
ſéene, the firſt thing which they ſhew vnto ſtrangers, is a faire
marble ſtone, euen with the ground; and there (ſay they) the
bodie of our Sauiour Chriſt was laid (when it was taken down
from the Croſſe) whiles it was preparing to be laid in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher.
And heere I ſaw many ſimple people (both men and
women) knéeling round about that ſtone, wringing their hands
wéeping, and crying, as if they had ſéene the dead bodie of our
Sauiour Chriſt there preſent before their eies. And they all to
be-kiſſed that ſtone. Yea, more then kiſſed it, for ſome of them
rubbed their lips vp and downe vpon that ſtone very often, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they had rubbed off the ſkin and made their lips bléed. And
ſome of them rubbed their beads vpon it, that ſome inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
might come out of that ſtone, and reſt vpon their beads.
I cenſure this ſuperſtition of theirs ouer fauourably, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
this ſtone among doubtfull things, which I might rather
haue reckoned amongſt manifeſt vntruts. For if there had béen
any ſuch ſtone, it would haue béen either caried away by pieces,
or remoued whole to <hi>Rome</hi> as other reliques haue béene. But
this ſtone is too new to be of any ſuch Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bethania</hi> they brought vs into a Celler vnder the ground,<note place="margin">Bethania.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2104:84"/>
ouer which there was no houſe, where <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay dead when
Chriſt raiſed him vp to life.</p>
               <p>And at <hi>Bethphage</hi> they ſhewed vs the ruines of <hi>Simon</hi> the<note place="margin">Bethphage.</note>
Phariſeis houſe, where Chriſt ſitting at dinner, <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi>
came and powred ointment on his head, and waſhed his
féete with her teares, and dried them with the haire of her head.
For although no man denieth but that ſuch things were done,
yet a man may make doubt whether thoſe were the particular
places where they were done.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> they ſhewed vs <hi>Porta aurea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Porta aurea.</note> that is, <hi>The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
gate;</hi> (or place where it ſtood) called in former times, <hi>The
beautifull gate of the Temple:</hi> which the Turkes haue walled
vp with ſtones, becauſe of a prophecie, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Citie was
once wonne there, and ſhall be againe wonne at the ſame place.</p>
               <p>Walking betwixt the valley of <hi>Gehinnom</hi> and the walles of
the Citie, our guide ſhewed vs a darke Chappell vnder the
ground without windowes, wherein (he told vs) the idolatrous
Iewes did offer &amp; ſacrifice their children vnto a braſen Image,
called <hi>Moloch,</hi> which, being made hote, they incloſed them in
the hollowneſſe thereof, and ſo ſlew them. And leſt their crying
ſhould moue any to compaſſion towards them, they made a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
noiſe with Tabrets and Drums. Whereupon the place
was called <hi>Tophet. Iere.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
               <p>On the top of mount Oliuet,<note place="margin">Sodome.</note> they ſhewed vs thirtie miles off
the lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which vnto vs appeared to bee very neere.
And they told vs thereof many ſtrange matters. Not onely that
which the wiſeman <hi>Solomon</hi> reported of it in his daies. <hi>Wiſd.</hi>
10. 7. that it ſmoaketh, (as if hell had there found a chinmey
whereout to vent his ſmoake) and that the trées beare fruit that
neuer commeth to ripeneſſe: but further, that it neither bréedeth
nor preſerueth any liuing creature. It is commonly called
<hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> that is, <hi>The dead ſea;</hi> being ſo contagious, as
if a bird but flie ouer it, ſhe is preſently dampt, and falleth down
dead into it. And as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith: <hi>If by the ſwelling of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
the fiſhes but flow ouer into it, they die ſtraight and flote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, they further reported vnto vs of their owne knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:2104:85"/>
hauing (as ſhey ſaid) ſéene the ſame, that it caſteth out continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
filthy vapours, by whoſe ſtinches and breath the mountaines
and valleys many miles about, are (as it were) ſcorched, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and made vtterly barren: beſides many vgly ſhapes and
ſhewes of terrour in it: beſides apples of goodly colour grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by it, which being touched turne all to ſmoake and aſhes.</p>
               <p>They alſo tolde vs that the piller of ſalt whereinto <hi>Lots</hi> wif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was turned is yet ſtanding.</p>
               <p>But of theſe and many other things which they ſhewed vs,
and told vs, I make doubt; either becauſe I haue not ſéene them
my ſelfe, or hauing ſéene them, doe not beléeue them.</p>
               <p>When I ſhall with mine eyes behold them, I will more
boldly make report of them, and of other matters which offer
themſelues vnto my ſight in my returne, but which way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
we haue not yet determined.</p>
               <p>And thus being loth to interrupt your ſerious domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
affaires with forraigne and friuolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I humbly take my leaue: and
