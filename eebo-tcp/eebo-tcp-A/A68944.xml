         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of all that ≈øaw it, who craued copies thereof, by
which meanes at length it came to my hands: which I
thorowly peru≈øing; and finding therein mention made
of former Letters, concerning other voyages by one of
the≈øe fiue trauellers formerly performed, directed to the
≈øaid Gentleman <hi>Bezaliel Biddulph:</hi> I could not ≈øatisfie my
≈øelfe vntill (by the meanes of friends) I came to the ≈øight
of the re≈øt al≈øo, which were many in number, at lea≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:2104:4"/>
twenty letters, be≈øides the voyage to <hi>Ieru≈øalem,</hi> all dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vnto one man: Some by the Preacher aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
mai≈øter <hi>William Biddulph:</hi> and ≈øome by his brother
<hi>Peter Biddulph</hi> Lapidarie and Diamond cutter in tho≈øe
Countries. Out of all which Letters I haue gathered the
matter therein contained, (leauing out onely ≈øome ≈øalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and priuate matters) and haue thought good (for
the helpe of Trauellers and delight of others) to make
one body of them, and (without the con≈øent of either of
them) to put them in print. For the one of the≈øe two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
is yet beyond the Seas; the other (after ten yeeres
trauell) is lately arriued into England, and hath ≈øundrie
times beene reque≈øted (by diuers of his good friends) to
publi≈øh his trauels, but he could neuer be per≈øwaded ≈øo
to doe, but an≈øwered<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that he knew how to ≈øpend his time
better, and that he was not ignorant of the incredulitie
of others in ≈øuch ca≈øes, who wil hardly beleeue any thing
but that which they them≈øelues haue ≈øeene; and when
they heare any thing that ≈øeemeth ≈øtrange vnto them,
they reply, that trauellers may lie by authority: but they
are liers them≈øelues which ≈øay ≈øo; for trauellers haue no
more authority to lie than others, neither will they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
vnto them≈øelues more liberty to lie than others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially
being men that feare God, as they (of all others)
≈øhould be, who goe downe to the Sea in ≈øhips, and ≈øee
the workes of the Lord both by Sea and by Land, and
his wonders in the deepe.</p>
            <p>In regard whereof, hee hath beene ≈øo farre from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his trauels, that he (being a very mode≈øt man) taketh
no delight to ≈øpeake thereof, except it be vnto ≈øome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friend. But for that old acquaintance which I
haue had with him (hauing beene his ≈øchollar) and that
<pb facs="tcp:2104:5"/>
mutuall loue betwixt vs of long continuance; I was ≈øo
bold to make knowen vnto him, that I had ≈øeene all the
letters which both he and his brother <hi>Peter Biddulph</hi> had
written to their friend <hi>Bezaliel Biddulph,</hi> (wherein they
di≈øcour≈øed of all their trauels) and what paines I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to gather them together for mine owne delight, and
direction in my trauels, which I purpo≈øed ≈øhortly to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.
Whereupon he reque≈øted mee to keepe them
≈øecret to my ≈øelfe, which I told him I had done, fora≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I had read in one of his letters to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bezaliel
Biddulph,</hi> the like reque≈øt, which hee made vnto him in
the≈øe words: <hi>I pray you keepe my Letters to your ≈øelfe, lest
whiles to giue content vnto you in writing what you would, I
receiue di≈øcontent my ≈øelfe in hearing what I would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heereby I found him very affable, and willing to
conferre with me of his trauels, and to giue me direction
for mine, and to re≈øolue me in any thing I de≈øired, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
my purpo≈øe of imprinting them, when (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with him and other trauellers into tho≈øe parts)
I had perfected them. Yet, fora≈ømuch as a publike good
is to be preferred before a priuate, I could not but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
vnto others that which I my ≈øelfe had learned of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
For that which <hi>Per≈øius</hi> ≈øpeaketh interrogatiuely,
in this ca≈øe I vnder≈øtand po≈øitiuely:</p>
            <q>Scire tuum nihil e≈øt, ni≈øi te ≈øcire hoc ≈øciat alter:</q>
            <p>That is,</p>
            <q>
               <l>It is nothing for thee a good thing to know,</l>
               <l>Vnle≈ø≈øe thou impart it toothers al≈øo.</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:2104:5"/>
And who knoweth what good may redounde vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by reading of this di≈øcour≈øe of other Countries?
For hereby all men may ≈øee how God hath ble≈ø≈øed our
Countrie aboue others, and be ≈øtirred vp to thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Hereby ≈øubiects may learne to loue, honour, and obey
their good and gratious King, when they ≈øhall reade of
the tyrannous gouernement of other Countries, and of
the mercifull gouernement of theirs.</p>
            <p>Heereby hearers may learne to loue and reuerence
their Pa≈øtors, and to thank God for the ine≈øtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the preaching of the word among≈øt them; when
they ≈øhall reade in what blindne≈ø≈øe and palpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
other nations liue, not knowing the right hand
from the left in matters that concerne the kingdome of
Heauen, and yet reuerence and honour their blind guids
and ≈øuper≈øtitious Church-men like Angels, and prouide
for their maintenance roially.</p>
            <p>Heere wiues may learne to loue their husbands, when
they ≈øhal read in what ≈ølauery women liue in other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and in what awe and ≈øubiection to their husbands,
and what libertie and freedome they them≈øelues enioy.</p>
            <p>Heereby ≈øeruants may bee taught to be faithfull and
dutifull to their Ma≈øters, when they ≈øhall read of the
bruti≈øh and barbarous immanitie in other Countries of
ma≈øters towards their ≈øeruants; who not only beat them
like dogs, but ≈øell them at their plea≈øure, and ≈øometimes
kill them for ≈ømall offences.</p>
            <p>Heere rich men may learne to be thankefull to God,
not onely for their libertie and freedome of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience
and per≈øons; but of their goods al≈øo: when they
≈øhall read, how in other contries no man is ma≈øter of his
<pb facs="tcp:2104:6"/>
owne, but as the fatte≈øt oxe is neere≈øt vnto the ≈ølaughter,
≈øo the riche≈øt men are neere≈øt vnto death.</p>
            <p>Here poore men may learne to be thankefull to God
for their benefactors, and not to be repining and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
beggers (as many of them are) when they ≈øhal read
how in other countries the poore liue like brute bea≈øtes,
on gra≈ø≈øe and water, the rich hauing no more mercie on
them, then the rich glutton had of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere they that trauell in England may learne what a
benefit it is to haue the refuge of Innes in their trauell,
and bee content to pay well for it, where they are well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed:
wheras in other countries they lodge without dores
all night and carie their proui≈øion with them.</p>
            <p>And the publi≈øhing hereof without the Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent
may perhaps bee an inducement vnto him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
this di≈øcour≈øe, by adding thereunto the diuer≈øities
of Religions in tho≈øe countries, and what conference and
di≈øputation he hath had with Iewes, Ie≈øuites, and people
of ≈øundry other countries: and by perfiting any thing
which herein ≈øhall be thought imperfect.</p>
            <p>And yet I haue had conference with one of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and ≈øhewed his Letters vnto many other trauellers
of good iudgement, who haue beene in tho≈øe parts, and
all of them ≈øub≈øcribe vnto the trueth of euery thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained. And of my ≈øelfe I haue ≈øet downe nothing
but what I either haue found in the Letters of the≈øe two
brethren (ma≈øter <hi>William Biddulph,</hi> and <hi>Peter Biddulph</hi>)
or el≈øe (by conference with one of them and ≈øundry other
trauellers of credit) heard ≈øpoken and deliuered for truth.</p>
            <p>Onely in two things (I confe≈ø≈øe) I haue beene ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bold with mine Authors. Fir≈øt, in the number of
their: letters for whereas they wrote very many letters,
<pb facs="tcp:2104:6"/>
and his companions went thither onely as trauellers to
≈øee the Holy Land.</p>
            <p>Againe, if it were his owne doing, he being both wi≈øe
and Religious (as hee is accounted) would neuer bee ≈øo
≈øimple to publi≈øh his owne di≈øgrace in Printe, in going
to Ma≈ø≈øe, and ob≈øeruing many other ceremonies as are
mentioned in that booke which goeth foorth vnder his
name.</p>
            <p>In the voiage of the fiue Engli≈øhmen from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi>
(which is the la≈øt letter) I haue written only of their
trauels thither, and ≈øuch things as they ≈øaw there, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their returne, for I could not meet with any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wherein my Authour had written thereof, neither
could I learne it of him by conference with him, for
when I ≈øpake vnto him thereof, de≈øiring him to ≈øet it
downe in writing for my further direction, I could haue
no other an≈øwere of him but this which <hi>Aeneas</hi> ≈øpake to

            </q>
            <p>Whereby I perceiued he tooke no plea≈øure to talke of
it, and le≈ø≈øe to write of it. The rea≈øon, I vnder≈øtood by
others; becau≈øe it was more dangerous, trouble≈øome,
and tedious to him then all the re≈øt of his voiage: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
nights they ≈ølept in the open fields, when it rained all
night exceeding fa≈øt, and in the day time they were often
<pb facs="tcp:2104:7"/>
dangered by theeues, and oftentimes in the night they
were glad to hire a guard to watch whiles they ≈ølept, for
feare le≈øt their throats ≈øhould be cut whiles they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øleepe:
and many other mi≈øeries they were ≈øubiect vnto,
as hunger and thir≈øt, heate in the day, cold (being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borles)
in the night.</p>
            <p>And be≈øides many mi≈øeries which hee hath indured
by land; he hath very narrowly e≈øcaped many extreame
dangers by Sea, whereof I will mention only one, which
I haue heard, not only from his owne mouth (with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
memorie vnto God for his miraculous and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
pre≈øeruation) but al≈øo from others who were in the

from <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> to <hi>Zante</hi> (for want of an Engli≈øh ≈øhip)
imbarked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues in a <hi>Raguzean</hi> ≈øhip which was bound

the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> or the 53. Iles in the Arches, where
they were a while becalmed ouer again≈øt <hi>Milo,</hi> where
they were minded to touch.</p>
            <p>But ≈øuddenly this calme was turned to a ≈øtorme, which
≈øpeedily droue them out of the ≈øight of <hi>Milo,</hi> and <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milo,</hi>
and ≈øo confounded the <hi>Raguzean</hi> Mariners (being
no skilfull Nauigators) that they knew not where they
were, (an vncomfortable ca≈øe in ≈øuch a dangerous place,
among≈øt ≈øo many Ilands ≈øo thicke together.) Before them
they ≈øawe land in three places, yet none of them knew
whether it were the maine land, or ≈øome Iland, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:2104:7"/>
were ignorant what cour≈øe to take. The prouidence
of God ≈øo directed, that they pa≈ø≈øed ≈øo neere the Ile <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigotta,</hi>
as ≈øeldome or neuer any ≈øhip did, and not ru≈øh
vpon the rockes.</p>
            <p>When they were pa≈øt this Iland, they were out of the
Arches or <hi>Cyclades,</hi> and had ≈øea-roome inough, which
was ≈øome comfort.</p>
            <p>But the ignorance of the Mariners, The violence of
the ≈øtorme, The weaknes of the ≈øhip, and the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe
of the company with whom he was ≈øhipped, were
great cau≈øes of di≈øcomfort.</p>
            <p>The Mariners were ignorant, not accu≈øtomed to ≈øaile
by compas or cunding of the ≈øhip, but by the eie and
view, and to be ≈øtill in ≈øight of land, The ≈øtorme ≈øtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed
more vehemently, and continued three daies and
three nights together; during which time, they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eate nor drinke, nor ≈øleepe. The ≈øhip was weake and
halfe full of water, ready to be ≈øplit in pieces with euery
bla≈øt of wind, or to bee deuoured by euery waue of the
Sea.</p>
            <p>The boat which the ≈øhip towed after her, was cut off,
and let goe at randome without hope of euer ≈øeeing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
le≈øt it ≈øhould be full of water, and ≈øinke, and draw
the ≈øhip al≈øo vnder water. The companie as they were

in their trouble, and he brought them out of their di≈øtre≈ø≈øe.
He turned the ≈øtorme to calme, ≈øo that the waues thereof were
≈øtill.</hi> And ≈øo (at length) by the prouidence of God, they
came all ≈øafely to their de≈øired Port, where they heard
of many ≈øhips (as ≈øome reported, fiftie) which were ca≈øt
away in that ≈øtorme, out of which they were deliuered.
Many ≈øuch de≈øperate plunges hath he e≈øcaped in his ten
yeeres trauell, which I haue heard of, but forbeare (for
breuities ≈øake) to ≈øpeake of.</p>
            <p>The≈øe things con≈øidered, I thought it not meet to pre≈ø≈øe
him any further therewith, le≈øt the remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
mi≈øeries, ≈øhould be a cau≈øe of fre≈øh ≈øorowes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he hath indured much hardne≈ø≈øe both by ≈øea and

incredible that ≈øuch a ≈øpare leane man, and of ≈øuch a

his continuall dangers both by ≈øea and by land, hee
hath continued ≈øtill to preach the Go≈øpel con≈øtantly and
boldly (in Heathen countries) both by ≈øea and by land;
receiued great honour among≈øt them; and is now at
length (by the prouidence of God) returned into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
countrie in health and ≈øafety to preach the Go≈øpell
where≈øoeuer it ≈øhall plea≈øe God to call him: and is at this
<pb facs="tcp:2104:9"/>
day the greate≈øt traueller (of a man of his calling, that I
know) in all England both by ≈øea and land.</p>
            <p>By land, he hath trauelled further then <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the
≈øame way that <hi>Iacob</hi> did from <hi>Hebron</hi> to <hi>Padan Aram,</hi>
and hath had as hard lodging in his trauell as <hi>Iacob</hi> had,
viz. the ground to his bed, a ≈øtone for his pillow, the skie
for his couering, and ≈øometimes the aire for his ≈øupper.</p>
            <p>By Sea, farther then S. <hi>Paul,</hi> then <hi>Aeneas,</hi> or <hi>Vly≈ø≈øes</hi>

            <p>Wherefore (gentle Reader) if thou take in good part
the≈øe his trauels, and my paines and labour in collecting

<hi>Greekes,</hi> but gouerned by the Signiory of <hi>Venice,</hi> who every
third y√©ere ≈øend <hi>Prouidores</hi> with other Officers to rule there.
They are both very fruitfull Ilands, y√©elding great ≈øtore of
currance, oliues, pomecitrons, oringes, and lemmons, but
≈ømall ≈øtore of corne, which they continually fetch from other
Countries. If through extremity of wether, or danger of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
or cur≈øares, corne be not duly brought vnto them, in
≈øhort time they are ready to fami≈øh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zephalonia</hi> was of old called <hi>Ithaca,</hi> where <hi>Vly≈ø≈øes</hi> the ≈øonne
of <hi>Laertes</hi> was King, who excelled all other <hi>Greeks</hi> in eloquence
and ≈øubtilty of wit. He is commended by ancient Writers, for
a famous Traueller: but if he were liuing in the≈øe daies, his
trauels would be counted nothing, in re≈øpect of the trauels of
many other now liuing: for he trauelled but betwixt <hi>Venice</hi>
and <hi>Egypt</hi> which is now a common voyage.</p>

Ile in the ≈øea <hi>Ionium,</hi> on the We≈øt of <hi>Pelopone≈øus.</hi> But there
is now very little wood in it. It is hilly round about, but the
middle of it is a plaine and fruitfull valley, y√©elding great ≈øtore
of Currance, which are brought from thence into <hi>England.</hi> The
<hi>Greekes</hi> wonder what we v≈øe to doe with ≈øo many Currance,
and a≈øke ≈øometimes whether we v≈øe to dye with them, or feed
Hogges with them. They were a very poore kind of people,
when our Engli≈øh Marchants v≈øed traffique there fir≈øt: but
now they are growen rich and proud.</p>
            <p>There is al≈øo a citie in that Ile called <hi>Zante</hi> by the name of the
Iland, which citie was built by <hi>Zacynthus</hi> ≈øonne to <hi>Dardanus,</hi>
who raigned there. We ≈øtaied ten dayes in the rode of this city
before we could get Pratticke, that is: leaue to come among≈øt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2104:13"/>
them, or to v≈øe traffique with them, for their cu≈øtome is not to
giue pre≈øent Pratticke vnto any ≈øtrangers, vnle≈ø≈øe they bring a
letter of health from the place whence they come, which we had
not. And therefore ≈øome of our companie who had bu≈øine≈ø≈øe
there, we ≈øent to the <hi>Lazaretta,</hi> which is a place like vnto the pe≈øt
hou≈øe in More-fields, where, though they be in health, yet there
they mu≈øt ≈øtay ≈øo long as it plea≈øeth the Signiors of health,
which is ≈øometime twenty, and ≈øometimes forty dayes: and
in the meane time, if any of their companie fall ≈øicke, though it
be at the end of fortie daies, yet mu≈øt they ≈øtay forty daies lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
So long as they are kept without Pratticke, they haue a
Guardian ≈øet to watch them that they come into no companie,
neither any man into theirs: yet may their friends come to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øit
them, and ≈øtanding farre off, may ≈øpeake with them, but if
they come too neere them, the Guardian will cry out vnto them,
<hi>Alargo, alargo,</hi> that is: Stand backe. And who≈øoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth
≈øo n√©ere them as to touch them, loo≈øeth his owne Pratticke, and

they bring any letters for any Merchants in the Citie, the Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
wil open them &amp; aire them at the fice before he wil deliuer
them. But if the letter be ≈øowed (or if there bee any thread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them) they mu≈øt not be deliuered vntill they that brought
them haue Prattick. And this they doe vnder pretence of auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
≈øickne≈ø≈øe: but they haue a further meaning therein, <hi>viz.</hi>
partly to get money and bribes; and partly to bee acquainted
with the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of all commers, and what commodities they
bring. And who≈øoeuer pre≈øumeth to come on ≈øhoare without
Pratticke, is in danger of hanging, or hauing the ≈øtrappado. And
though they haue a certificate that there is health in the place
from whence they came, yet mu≈øt they not come on ≈øhoare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haue ≈øhewed their <hi>Fede,</hi> or <hi>Neate patent</hi> vnto three
officers, called Signiors of health.</p>
            <p>

an <hi>Italian</hi> ≈øhip being in great di≈øtre≈ø≈øe by extremity of wether in

will offer vnto thee (if I come ≈øafely to Gazopo) a candle as bigge

plucked him by the ≈øhoulders, and ≈øaid, O ma≈øter, what doe
you meane to dally with our ble≈ø≈øed Lady in this extremitie?
For it is impo≈ø≈øible you ≈øhould performe it. Whereunto he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
Hold thy peace foole, it concerneth vs to ≈øpeake faire now
we are in danger, and to make large promi≈øes: but if ≈øhe deliuer
vs, I will make her content with a candle of ≈øeuen or eight in

whom I haue heard of, who in a dangerous ≈øtorme, ≈ø√©eing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to thee before; and if it plea≈øe thee to deliuer me this once, I will
neuer pray to thee againe as long as I liue.</hi> So true is that old

            <p>From <hi>Madonna de Gazopo</hi> we ≈øailed along by <hi>Albania,</hi> and

            <p>The ≈øtrength of <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> con≈øi≈øtet chiefly in the≈øe

they came, and whither they would: and there they are to

were battered down, <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> and all the countrey there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts

Some hold opinion that it was built by <hi>Caius Caligula.</hi> And

the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy</hi> lying about it.</p>
            <p>The Emperours then being farre off, and (by rea≈øon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
warres with <hi>Saracens</hi> and enemies in the Ea≈øt) notable
to maintaine their own right in the We≈øt, the Popes incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon them too far, and v≈øurped ≈øo much authoritie, that they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2104:20"/>
di≈øcarded them cleane in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at their plea≈øure ≈øet vp other
Emperours in the We≈øt, but ≈øuch as would take an oath to b√©e
≈øubiect to the Apo≈øtolike S√©e of <hi>Rome,</hi> and acknowledge the
Popes to be vniuer≈øall Bi≈øhops. So the hinderance was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away when <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> remooued to <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> and
Antichri≈øt was manife≈øtly di≈øclo≈øed not long after when <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
the third obtained the title of Vniuer≈øall Bi≈øhop, which
was 900. y√©eres agoe, for (as <hi>Gregorie</hi> ≈øaith) none but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øt
would a≈ø≈øume vnto him ≈øuch a title.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> had no regard to any prophecie, when
h√©e remooued at fir≈øt from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and there ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Emperiall pallace: but he re≈øpected onely a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
gouernement of tho≈øe matters and kingdomes of his
that lay Ea≈øtward, which at that time were mi≈øerably di≈øquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Per≈øians.</hi> For <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> did ≈ø√©em
to be ≈øo ≈øituated (whereas otherwi≈øe <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> had once
thought to haue ≈øetled el≈øewhere) as that it was (as you would
≈øay,) the nauel or midde≈øt vnto the whole <hi>Romane</hi> iuri≈ødiction,
which, as we know, ≈øpread it ≈øelfe farre and n√©ere: and yet it
could not po≈ø≈øibly otherwi≈øe fall out, becau≈øe that ≈øo the <hi>Romane</hi>
Empire might become double headed, &amp; haue tho≈øe two horns
which God before had reuealed. So the prouidence of God gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this whole enterpri≈øe of <hi>Con≈øtantine,</hi> and ≈øo fulfilled what
him≈øelfe had decr√©ed.</p>
            <p>Hereby you may perceiue two cau≈øes wherefore <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi>
remoued from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The fir≈øt more ≈øecret in the prouidence of God, that the

Daniell, chap. 7. 7. <hi>which is very notable, and agr√©eth e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnto the time when this impiety and tyranny did beginne.</hi>
After this (<hi>≈øaith</hi> Daniel) I ≈øaw in the vi≈øions by night, and behold,
the fourth bea≈øt was fearefull, and terrible, and very ≈øtrong. It
had great iron teeth; It deuoured, and brake in peeces, and ≈øtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the re≈øidue vnder his feet; and it was vnlike to the bea≈øts that
were before it, for it had ten hornes. <hi>Hitherto ≈øpake</hi> Daniel <hi>of

the ≈øame, and of the ten Kings in ≈øubiection thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now followeth the Prophecie of the Turki≈øh Kingdome, in
the≈øe words,</hi> Dan. 7. 8. As I con≈øidered the hornes, behold, there
came vp among them another little horne, before whom there
were three of the fir≈øt hornes pluckt away. And behold, in this
horne were eies like the eies of a man, and a mouth ≈øpeaking pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumptuous
things.</p>
            <p>And afterwards, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 23. <hi>The fourth bea≈øt ≈øhall be the fourth
Kingdome in the earth, which ≈øhall bee vnlike to all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,

called <hi>Itraripia.</hi> His parents were of diuers Nations, and
different in Religion. His father <hi>Abdallas</hi> was an <hi>Arabian:</hi>
His mother <hi>Cadige</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> both by birth and profe≈ø≈øion. His pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage
(according to mo≈øt Hi≈øtories) was ≈øo meane and ba≈øe,
that both his birth and infancie remained ob≈øcure, and of no
reckoning, till that his riper y√©eres (bewraying in him a mo≈øt
≈øubtill and crafty nature and di≈øpo≈øition) did argue ≈øome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that the ≈øharpne≈ø≈øe and dexterity of his wit would in time
aboli≈øh the ba≈øene≈ø≈øe and ob≈øcurity of his birth. And ≈øoone did
he make ≈øhew and proofe thereof: for being trained vp of a boy
in the ≈øeruice of a rich and wealthy Merchant, by his great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2104:36"/>
and diligence, he ≈øo in≈øinuated and wrought him≈øelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the good fauour and liking both of his ma≈øter and mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe,
that when his ma≈øter died, and had leaft all his wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vnto his wife, ≈øhe made choi≈øe of her ≈øeruant <hi>Mahomet</hi>
for her hu≈øband, making him Lord and Ma≈øter both of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,
and of her ≈øub≈øtance. The man being thus rai≈øed from
ba≈øe and low degr√©e, to great wealth and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a working and a≈øpiring head, did from thencefoorth plot
and imagine how he might rai≈øe him≈øelfe in honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
pre≈øuming that the greatne≈ø≈øe of his wealth would b√©e
a fit meane to worke his higher fortunes. Neither was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in the expectation of his hope: For con≈øorting him≈øelfe
with one <hi>Sergius</hi> a fugitiue Monke, a notable Heretike of the
<hi>Arrian</hi> Sect (whom he had made bounden vnto him by his
great liberalitie) there grew ≈øo ≈øtrict a league of amity and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
familiarity betw√©ene them, that they had many times pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
conference, how and by what meanes <hi>Mahomet</hi> might
make him≈øelfe way to ri≈øe in honour and e≈øtimation. After
much con≈øulting and debating of the matter, the be≈øt cour≈øe
which they conceiued to effect their purpo≈øe, was to coine a new
kinde of Doctrine and Religion, vnder colour whereof (the
times then being trouble≈øome, the people full of ≈øimplicitie and
ignorance, Religion al≈øo waring cold, and neglected) they
thought it an ea≈øie matter to draw many followers vnto them,
and by that meanes to grow great in the eie and opinion of the
world. H√©ereupon the≈øe two helhounds (one of them being an

            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> in his youth, by rea≈øon of his pouertie, liued by
theft and robberie. Afterward hauing heaped much riches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
he was a ≈øouldier among his countrie men the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
vnder <hi>Heraclius.</hi> In the warre he found occa≈øion of principality
and power. For when the <hi>Arabians</hi> being offended with <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi>
for denying them their pay, and for his religion had ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them≈øelues from him, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ioyned him≈øelfe to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gried
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2104:37"/>
≈øouldiers, and ≈øtirred vp their minds again≈øt their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and encouraged them in their defection. Whereupon,
by a certaine company of Souldiers, he was cho≈øen to bee their
Captaine (as they commonly are extolled in euery commotion,
which fauour the wicked enterpri≈øe of the rebellious people, and
≈øet vpon the mightie, and gouernours.)</p>
            <p>In this new Captaine many could not abide the ba≈øene≈ø≈øe of
his birth, nor the odiou≈øne≈ø≈øe of his former life, e≈øpecially, they
loathed him for a di≈øea≈øe he had, which was the falling ≈øicknes.
He therefore to redeeme him≈øelfe from this contempt (which is
an ea≈øie matter among the fooli≈øh common people) pretended a
diuinitie in his doings, faining him≈øelf to enter communication
with God, and ≈øo when he talked with him, to be raui≈øhed out
of him≈øelfe, and ≈ø√©emed like vnto one afflicted with the falling
≈øickene≈ø≈øe. And therefore he ≈øaid plainely (but vntruely) how
he was no more a Captaine, and Prince elected through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of Souldiers, but a Prophet, and a me≈ø≈øenger of Almighty
God, that vnder the ≈øhew of Diuinitie, hee might haue all men
the more obedient vnto his words.</p>
            <p>But, for as much as he was rude altogether and vnlearned,
hee adioyned vnto him≈øelfe two ma≈øters and coun≈øellers that

his ≈øeuerall ≈øect.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing that hee ≈øhould not onely
gratifie his companions, but al≈øo the more ea≈øily allure all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vnto him≈øelfe, receiued all, that is: The pertinacie of <hi>Arius,</hi>
the errour of <hi>Ne≈øtorius,</hi> and the vaine inuentions of the <hi>Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øt.</hi>
And therefore he receiued from the Iew Circumci≈øion;
from the Chri≈øtians ≈øundry wa≈øhings, as it were Bapti≈ømes.

               <p>AND for the better broaching abroad of his deuili≈øh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
hee hath pre≈øcribed certaine lawes or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and fortified the ≈øame by Policie.</p>
               <p>His lawes are in number eight, which are partly Politicall
and party Ceremoniall.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt, concerning God: which is this.</p>
               <p>1. God is a great God, and one onely God, and Mahomet is
the Prophet of God.</p>
               <p>In this Commandement they acknowledge a God; and al≈øo
Chri≈øt they acknowledge to be a great Prophet: but deny him
to be the Sonne of God, for God (≈øay they) had no wife, and
therefore could haue no ≈øonne. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> they hold to bee
a greater Prophet then Chri≈øt, and the la≈øt Prophet of all.</p>
               <p>For it is a common ≈øaying among≈øt them, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was
the friend of God, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> the me≈ø≈øenger of God, Chri≈øt the
breath of God, and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was the Prophet of God.
They ≈øpeake reuerently of them all foure, and puni≈øh as well
tho≈øe that bla≈øpheme Chri≈øt, as tho≈øe that ≈øpeake euill of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
Yea, they acknowledge Chri≈øt to be the Sonne of the
Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> but not to haue beene borne according to the
common cour≈øe of nature, but to haue proc√©eded from her
brea≈øts. And as for his conception by the holy Gho≈øt, they
know not what it meaneth; neither doe they know whether
there be any holy Gho≈øt or not. But in their praiers they often
reiterate the≈øe words together, <hi>hu, hu, hu,</hi> that is: he, he, he. In
de≈øpite of all the Chri≈øtians there is but one God; he, he, he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is God. For they hold, becau≈øe we acknowledge thr√©e
per≈øons, that therefore wee wor≈øhip thr√©e Gods, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
but one God, and are altogether ignorant of the
Trinitie in <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nitie, and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nitie in Trinitie.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond Commandement is, concerning their duety
toward their Parents, in the≈øe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:2104:38"/>
2. Obey thy parents, and doe nothing to di≈øplea≈øe them, either
in word or deed.</p>
               <p>How badly this duty is performed among them, I know by
experience: for I did neuer read or heare of more di≈øobedient
children to their parents, either in word or d√©ed.</p>
               <p>The third is concerning their Neighbours, which is this:</p>
               <p>3. Doe vnto others as thou woulde≈øt be done vnto thy ≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>Some of them are iu≈øt in their dealings one with another:
but mo≈øt of them vniu≈øt &amp; deceitfull in their proc√©edings with
≈øtrangers, ≈øome few ≈øhopk√©epers only excepted.</p>
               <p>The fourth is concerning praier, wherein is required,</p>
               <p>4. That euery man fiue times a day repaire to their Churches, to
make publike praier vnto Mahomet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> haue no bels, but very faire Churches, and high
Steeples; and at the houres of their publike praier they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to Church by the voice of Criers, who goe vp into their ≈øt√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and cry with a loud voice, <hi>Come now and wor≈øhip the
great God.</hi> And ≈øometimes al≈øo thus: <hi>La Illa Eillala, Mahomet
Re≈øullala:</hi> that is, <hi>God is a great God, and Mahomet is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
And ≈øometimes no more but thus: <hi>Ollah hethbar:</hi> that is,
<hi>God is alone:</hi> that is, <hi>There is but one God.</hi> And oftentimes
there is but one Crier in one ≈øt√©eple. But on their Sabboth
day (which is friday) and at ≈øundry other times, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men crying and bauling in euery ≈øt√©eple, like a kennell of
hounds when they haue ≈øtarted their game.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt m√©eting at publike praier euery day, is before the
ri≈øing of the ≈øunne.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond is about noone or midday, and on their Sabboth
day two houres ≈øooner, and againe at noone, ≈øo that they pray
fiue times euery day, and on their Sabboth day, ≈øix times.</p>
               <p>The third time for publike praier euery day, is at the tenth
houre of the day, called by the <hi>Turkes, Kindi;</hi> by the <hi>Moores, A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øera,</hi>
about thr√©e or foure of the clocke after noone.</p>
               <p>The fourth m√©eting is about ≈øunne ≈øetting.</p>
               <p>The fifth and la≈øt houre of praier, is two houres within
night, before they goe to ≈øl√©epe.</p>
               <p>Before they come to praier, they prepare them≈øelues thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2104:39"/>
by outward wa≈øhings of them≈øelues, in token of reuerence,
and ≈øuffer no women to come to their Churches, le≈øt the ≈øight
of them ≈øhould with-draw their mindes from praier. And
though they doe not come to Church, yet when they heare the
voice of the Criers, they will pray where≈øoeuer they be, and fall
downe and ki≈ø≈øe the ground thr√©e times.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes al≈øo the≈øe Criers walke about the ≈øt√©eples in the
euenings, and ≈øing (after their rude manner) <hi>Dauids</hi> P≈øalmes
in the Arabicke tongue. And when rich men heare them ≈øing
well, and with cl√©ere voices, they are ≈øo delighted therewith,
that they v≈øe to ≈øend them money.</p>
               <p>Their fifth Commandement is concerning fa≈øting, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That one Moone in the yeere, euery one (of any rea≈øonable
age) ≈øpend the whole time in fa≈øting.</p>
               <p>They haue but one Lent in the y√©ere, and then they fa≈øt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
in this manner: When the new moone changeth, which
they call <hi>Romadan,</hi> then during all that moone, they fa≈øt all the
day long betwixt ≈øunne ri≈øing and ≈øunne ≈øetting, and neither
eat nor drinke any thing at all. But when the ≈øunne ≈øetteth,
then the crier calleth them to Church, and after they haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then they may eat what kinde of meat they will (≈øauing
≈øwines fle≈øh, which is forbidden by their Law) and as oft as
they will, vntill ≈øunne ri≈øing: ≈øo that their Lent is but a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of day into night. During this moone <hi>Romadan,</hi> they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue
this kinde of ab≈øtinence very ≈øtrictly. And ≈øo ≈øoone as the
next moone changeth, which they call <hi>Byram,</hi> then their Lent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
and they hold a fea≈øt for thr√©e daies ≈øpace together. At
which time (they ≈øay) <hi>Mahomet</hi> deliuered vnto them their law.</p>
               <p>Their ≈øixth Commandement is concerning Alme≈ød√©eds.</p>
               <p>6. Let euery man, out of his ≈øtore, giue vnto the poore, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
freely, and voluntarily.</p>
               <p>Their Almes is either publike or priuate.</p>
               <p>Their publike Almes is a ≈øacrifice or offering of ≈øome bea≈øt
for a ≈øacrifice vnto <hi>Mahomet</hi> once euery y√©ere: which being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
it is cut into ≈ømall p√©eces, and giuen all to the poore.</p>
               <p>Their priuate Almes (notwith≈øtanding their Law) is much
neglected; for I haue heard of many poore people who haue died
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2104:39"/>
among≈øt them for want of rel√©efe: and in the way as I haue
trauelled, I haue found ≈øome dead for hunger and cold. And
though a man be neuer ≈øo poore, yet if he be not able to pay his
Head money to the King y√©erely, they are beaten, and their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and children ≈øold to pay it. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

poore were h√©ere but a ≈øhort time, they would learne to bee
more thankfull to God and man, and how to e≈øt√©eme of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
be≈øtowed on them, and not cur≈øe and reuile (as many of
them doe) if any one that pa≈ø≈øeth by them doe not giue vnto
them. The <hi>Turkes</hi> are more mercifull to birds, cats, and dogs,
than to the poore.</p>
               <p>Their ≈øeuenth Commandement is concerning Marriage.</p>
               <p>7. That euery man mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øitie marry, to encrea≈øe and
multiply the Sect and Religion of Mahomet.</p>
               <p>Their cu≈øtome is to buy their wiues of their parents, and
neuer to ≈ø√©e them vntil they come to be married: and their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is nothing but enrolling in the <hi>Cadies</hi> booke. And it is
lawfull for them to take as many wiues as they will, or as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as they are able to k√©epe. And when≈øoeuer he di≈øliketh any
one of them, it is their v≈øe to ≈øell them or giue them to any of
their men-≈ølaues. And although they loue their women neuer ≈øo
well, yet they neuer ≈øit at table with men, no not with their
husbands, but wait at table and ≈øerue him, and when he hath
dined, they dine in ≈øecret by them≈øelues, admitting no man or
mankinde among≈øt them, if he be aboue twelue y√©eres of age.
And they neuer goe abroad without leaue of their husbands,
which is very ≈øeldome, except it be either to the <hi>Bannio</hi> or hot
Bath, or once a w√©eke to w√©epe at the graues of the dead, which
is v≈øually on Thur≈øday, being the Ene before their Sabboth,
which is Friday, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabboth on Saturday, and the
Chri≈øtians on Sunday, thr√©e Sabboth daies together in one
Country. If their hu≈øbands haue b√©ene abroad, at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the hou≈øe, if any one of their women be ≈øitting on a
≈øtoole, ≈øhe ri≈øeth vp, and boweth her≈øelfe to her hu≈øband, and
ki≈ø≈øeth his hand, and ≈øetteth the ≈øame ≈øtoole for him, whereon
they ≈øate, and ≈øtand ≈øo long as he is in pre≈øence.</p>
               <p>If the like order were in England, women would be more
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2104:40"/>
dutifull and faithfull to their hu≈øbands than many of them are:
and e≈øpecially, if there were the like puni≈øhment for whores,
there would be le≈ø≈øe whoredome: for there, if a man haue an
hundred women, if any one of them pro≈øtitute her≈øelfe to any
man but her owne hu≈øband, he hath authoritie to binde her,
hands and feet, and ca≈øt her into the riuer with a ≈øtone about
her necke, and drowne her. And this is a common puni≈øhment
among≈øt them; but it is v≈øually done in the night. And the
man, if he be taken, is di≈ømembred.</p>
               <p>But the daughters and ≈øi≈øters of the great <hi>Turke</hi> are more
fr√©e than all other men and women. For when their brethren
die, they liue: and when they come to y√©eres of marriage, their
father (if he be liuing) or brother (if he be King) will giue vnto
them, for their hu≈øbands, the greate≈øt <hi>Ba≈øhawes</hi> or <hi>Viziers</hi>
whom they ≈øhall affect, and ≈øay vnto them, Daughter, or ≈øi≈øter,
I giue th√©e this man to be thy ≈ølaue and bedfellow: and if he be
not louing, dutifull, and obedient vnto th√©e, h√©ere, I giue th√©e
a <hi>Canzhare</hi> (that is, a dagger) to cut off his head. And alwaies
after, tho≈øe daughters or ≈øi≈øters of the King weare a broad and
≈øharpe dagger: and when≈øoeuer their hu≈øbands (which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto them by the King to be their ≈ølaues) di≈øplea≈øe them,
they may and doe cut off their heads.</p>
               <p>They exempt no calling from marriage, but hold it a ble≈ø≈øing
from God to haue many children: and the de≈øire of many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                  <hi>SVLTAN Mahomet</hi> (this great Turkes father) when he

               <p>Other Turkes haue thr√©e wiues, and haue as many women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaues

The manner of their mariage is this. Fir≈øt, if a man like
a yong woman, he buyeth her of her father, and giueth a great ≈øummne of money for her, and then enrolleth her in the <hi>Cadies</hi>
booke, that hee hath bought her of her Father for his wife, and
then the friends fea≈øt and banket together, and this is all they
performe in mariage. Onely the father of the yong woman gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
great ≈øtore of hou≈øhold-≈øtuffe with her, and this is caried
openly by particulars through the ≈øtr√©etes of the citie on hor≈øes
or Cammels, and ≈øometime by men and women, the parties
newly maried going before with mu≈øicke playing before them.</p>
               <p>Their eight Commandement is the ≈øame with our ≈øixt.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not kill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their <hi>Alcoran</hi> it is written that God hateth murther. And
they ≈øay, that it is the ≈øecond ≈øinne which crept into the world
after the creation, being fir≈øt committed by cur≈øed <hi>Cain,</hi> who
killed his brother <hi>Abel.</hi> And their beliefe is, that this ≈øinne of
wilfull murther is impardonable. But if it be by m√©ere chance,
or in their owne defence, or el≈øe in lawfull wars, or in ca≈øes of
iu≈øtice by the Maie≈øtrate they hold it lawfull.</p>
               <p>Often haue I heard Turkes brawle one with another, and
in words mo≈øt vilely reuile one another; but neuer did I ≈ø√©e
or heare of two Turkes in their priuate quarrels ≈øtrike one
another, neither dare they ≈øtrike one another, for if they do, they
are pre≈øently brought before the Maie≈øtrate, and ≈øeuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed.
Yea, if one doe but lift vp his hand to ≈øtrike another, h√©e
is ca≈øt into pri≈øon, and kept in irons, vntill he haue payed ≈øome
great fine, or receiued ≈øome other puni≈øhment. But they will
≈øtrike Iewes and Chri≈øtians oftentimes, who dare not ≈øtrike
them againe. If a man in ≈øecret be killed and found dead, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
openly in the ≈øtr√©ete, or priuately in an hou≈øe, the ma≈øter of
the hou≈øe, or the pari≈øh where hee dwelleth mu≈øt find out the
murtherer, otherwi≈øe hee him≈øelfe ≈øhall be accu≈øed of murther,
and both he, and the whole <hi>Contrado</hi> where hee dwelleth mu≈øt
pay vnto the <hi>Subba≈øhaw</hi> ≈øo many hundred Dollers as ≈øhall be
required at their hands.</p>
               <p>And therefore the <hi>Subba≈øhaws</hi> oftentimes being wicked men,
doe hire ≈øome de≈øperate per≈øon to kill a man in the night, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2104:41"/>
thereby he may take occa≈øion to eat of the whole <hi>Contrado.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">William Matrin. Anno Dom. 1603. Sept. 18.</note> We

               <p>The≈øe are the eight Commandements of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the two chiefe≈øt points forbidden in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> are, the
eating of ≈øwines fle≈øh, and the drinking of wine. Yet many
of them drinke wine vntill they be drunken: but I neuer heard
of any Turkes would eate ≈øwines fle≈øh.</p>
               <p>The things con≈øidered, being ≈øo fond and rediculous, it
may ≈ø√©eme ≈øtrange, that men of courage in Turkey, doe not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake
this deceiuer and deluder of mankind.</p>
               <p>But it is the le≈ø≈øe ≈øtrange if we con≈øider how he hath fortified
his law with foure bulwarks or ≈øtrong defences.</p>
               <p>1. Fir≈øt, h√©e commandeth to kill them which ≈øpeake again≈øt
the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> And therefore no man dare gaine≈øay or deny any
thing contained in their <hi>Alcoran:</hi> but who≈øoeuer ≈øhall dare
either to di≈øpute again≈øt that booke, or to doubt of any Article
therein written, he ≈øhall be ≈øure, either to haue his tongue pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of his head, or els his bodie to be burnt and con≈øumed
with fire.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, he forbiddeth conference to be had with men of
a contrary ≈øect or religion.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, he forbiddeth credit to be giuen to any be≈øide the
<hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, hee commandeth them to ≈øeparate them≈øelues
altogether from other men, and to ≈øay, <hi>Let me haue my law, and
take you yours: ye are free from, that which I doe, and I likewi≈øe
from that which you doe.</hi> And herein I hold it better for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and other Chri≈øtians to ≈øoiourne and to v≈øe trade and
trafficke among≈øt Turkes then Papi≈øts; for, the Turke giueth
libertie of con≈øcience to all men, and liketh well of euery man
that is forward and zealous in his owne religion.</p>

13. 17.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, to driue away all feare of damnation from the
mindes of his Di≈øciples, <hi>Mahomet</hi> telleth them, that euery man
≈øhall be ≈øaued by his owne Religion (he only excepted which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolteth
from the <hi>Alchoran</hi> vnto another Law) The <hi>lewes</hi> by the

ro≈øted Buckones, (that is, ≈ømall bits or mor≈øels of fle≈øh.) Their

are made of pa≈øte like a great round Pa≈øtie with varietie of

Muclebite is a di≈øh made of Egs and hearbs. Their ≈ømaller
Sambou≈øes are more common, not ≈øo big as a mans hand, like

of Helloway, that is, ≈øw√©et meats compounded in ≈øuch ≈øort

               <p>Other compound drinkes they haue called <hi>Sherbet,</hi> made of

for although the countrie bee hote, yet they k√©epe ≈ønow all the

               <p>It is accounted a great curte≈øie among≈øt them to giue vnto
their frends when they come to vi≈øit them, a Fin-ion or Scudel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la

               <p>Some of our Merchants haue weighed their water and ours
in England when they haue come home, and haue found their
water lighter then ours by foure ounces in the pound; and the
lighter the water is, the more plea≈øant it is to drinke, and goeth
downe more delectably, as if it were milke rather than water.</p>
               <p>In great Cities where the fountaines are either farre off, or
not ≈øo plentifull, there are certaine poore men which goe about
the ≈øtr√©etes from morning to night with a Beares ≈økinne full of

two by the armes, for feare of a ≈øtab, by which meanes one of
their Grand Signiors was once killed, and when they returne,
they goe backwards; for it is accounted a di≈øgrace to turne their

≈øo long as they talke with a <hi>Ba≈øhaw</hi> they ≈øtand with their hands
on their bre≈øt maiden-like, and bow low at their departure,

head <hi>Vizier</hi> being their enemy) they are con≈øtrained to weare
hatts of blewe cloth, becau≈øe red was accounted too ≈øtately
and princelike a colour for them to weare.</p>
               <p>They are called by three names, which were giuen to them of
old. Fir≈øt, they are called <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> (as ≈øome ≈øuppo≈øe) of <hi>Heber</hi>
the fourth from <hi>Noah,</hi> in whom the hebrew tongue remained
at the confu≈øion of tongues, whence he had his name. But S.
<hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> and other fathers affirme, that they were fir≈øt called
<hi>Hebreweof Abraham,</hi> with the alteration of a fewe letters, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei
qua≈øi Abrahaei,</hi> that is, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> as it were <hi>Abrahites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly they were called I≈øraelites from <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øurnamed <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
who≈øe grandfathers <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they were called <hi>Iewes,</hi> after that <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
(which for the vnity of minds were (as it were one <hi>Tribe</hi>)
following <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Solomon</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi>
made the kingdome of Iuda. The other ten betaking them to
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ≈øet vp the kingdome of the
<hi>Ephramites</hi> or <hi>I≈ørael.</hi> And what became of tho≈øe ten tribes, the
Iewes acknowledge them≈øelues to be ignorant. Only ≈øome of
their <hi>Rabbies</hi> thinke them to bee in <hi>Tarracia:</hi> the onely rea≈øon

they often vnder≈øtand by <hi>Tartarians</hi> who came from
thence to v≈øe marchandi≈øe in <hi>Aleppo</hi> and el≈øe where, that there
are many among≈øt them called by <hi>Hebrew</hi> names to this day.
Of the≈øe thr√©e names whereby they are knowne, the mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
name whereby they are called at this day is, the name of
<hi>Iewes.</hi> One and the ≈øame people thrice changed their names, &amp;
often the place of their abode: And to this day they haue no

are contemptible and of ba≈øe account,<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 25.</note> according to the cry of
tho≈øe crucifiers. <hi>His blood bee vpon vs and our children,</hi> which
is fulfilled this day in our eares and eies. They are of more
vile account in the ≈øight of <hi>Turkes</hi> then <hi>Chri≈øtians;</hi> in ≈øo much
that if a Iewe would turne Turke, he mu≈øt fir≈øt turne <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
before they will admit him to be a <hi>Turke.</hi> Yea, it is a word

and as all of them mu≈øt be that ≈øhall bee ≈øaued. And the
poore <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> ≈øoiourning and dwelling in the≈øe partes doe
hate them very vncharitably and irreligiou≈øly: (in that we read
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. many arguments prouing that they ≈øhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
againe.) for on good fryday in many places (e≈øpecially
at <hi>Zante</hi>) they throw ≈øtones at them, in≈øomuch that they dare
not come out of their hou≈øes all that day, and yet are ≈øcar≈øe in
≈øafety in their hou≈øes, for they v≈øe to throw ≈øtones at their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
and dores, and on the roofe of their hou≈øes. On thru≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
about noone, the Iewes begin to k√©epe within dores, and
continue there with their dores ≈øhut vntil ≈øaturday about noone,
for if they come forth before that time they are ≈øure to be ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but after noone on Ea≈øter eue if they come abroad, they
may pa≈ø≈øe as quietly as euer they did. The≈øe in their blinde
zeale thinke to be reuenged on them for whom Chri≈øt prayed
≈øaying, <hi>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they
doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ≈øome ignorant Chri≈øtians refu≈øe to eat of their meat or
bread: their rea≈øon is, becau≈øe the <hi>Iewes</hi> refu≈øe to eat or drinke
with Chri≈øtians to this day, or to eat any meat that Chri≈øtians
kill. But it is not vnu≈øuall among≈øt Chri≈øtians of better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to eat of the <hi>Jewes</hi> meat, which ordinarily they buy of
them: for the <hi>Iewes</hi> to this day eat not of the hinderpart of any

bea≈øt, but only of the former parts, and ≈øell the hinder quarters
of their b√©efe, mutton, kids, goats, &amp;c. to Chri≈øtians.</p>
               <p>They ob≈øerue ≈øtill all their old Ceremonies and fea≈øts, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
only excepted, which the <hi>Turkes</hi> will not ≈øuffer them to
doe: for they were wont among≈øt them to ≈øacrifice children,
but dare not now for feare of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> Yet ≈øome of them
haue confe≈ø≈øed, that their Phy≈øitians kill ≈øome Chri≈øtian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
or other, whom they haue vnder their hands at that time,
in ≈øtead of a ≈øacrifice.</p>
               <p>If a man die without children, the next brother taketh his
wife, and rai≈øeth vp ≈ø√©ed vnto his brother: and they ≈øtill marry
in their owne kindred. Many of them are rich Merchants:
≈øome of them Drogomen, and ≈øome Brokers. Mo≈øt of them
are very crafty and deceitfull people. They haue no beggers
among≈øt them, but many th√©eues, and ≈øome who ≈øteale for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity,
becau≈øe they dare not begge.</p>
               <p>They are al≈øo very great V≈øurers, and therein the <hi>Turkes</hi>
ecell them: for although there be V≈øurers among≈øt them, yet
they allow it not: for if a Chri≈øtian or any man borrow money
of a <hi>Turke</hi> (though he promi≈øe him intere≈øt) yet if he pay the
principall, he dares not mole≈øt him for intere≈øt, nor complaine
of him, being again≈øt their law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> Sabboth is on Saturday, which they ob≈øerue ≈øo
≈øtrictly, that they will not trauell vpon any occa≈øion on that
day, nor receiue money, nor handle a pen to write, (as I haue
knowen by experience in a Doctor of Phy≈øicke:) but on the
morrow he would take double f√©es of his Patient.</p>
               <p>They read their law in the Hebrue tongue, written in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacteries
or long roles of parchment. And the Old Te≈øtament
is al≈øo read in the Hebrue. But their Cakams and Cohens
preach in the Spani≈øh tongue. All matters of controuer≈øie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them≈øelues are brought before their Cakam to decide,
who is their chiefe Churchman. <hi>Cakam</hi> in Hebrue is as much
as <hi>Sapiens</hi> in Latine, that is, a wi≈øe man: and <hi>Cohen</hi> in Hebrue
is as much as <hi>Sacerdos</hi> in Latine, that is, a Prie≈øt.</p>
               <p>Mo≈øt of the <hi>Iewes</hi> can read Hebrue, but few of them ≈øpeake
it, except it be in two places in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and that is at <hi>Salonica,</hi>

but not ≈ø√©e one another, vntill the <hi>Ca≈ø≈øies</hi> bid the yoong man put
his hand thorow an hole in the wall, and take his wife by the

maketh it bl√©ed. And if he let her hand goe when he f√©eleth his

But if he hold fa≈øt (notwith≈øtanding the ≈ømart) and wring her
hard by the hand vntill ≈øhe cry, rather than he will once ≈øhrinke,

not vnlikely that ≈øome one of the≈øe thr√©e might haue dwelt at

            <p>On the fift√©enth day of March we went from <hi>Hus</hi> towards

but gouerned by <hi>Turks</hi> only. There is but one Church in the
Towne, which is dedicated to <hi>S. Nicolas,</hi> by the Chri≈øtians,
who fir≈øt builded it. But both Chri≈øtians and Turkes pray
therein: the Chri≈øtians on the one ≈øide or Ile of the Church, and
the Turkes on the other. But the Chri≈øtians are ouer ruled
by the Turkes, and con≈øtrained to finde them oile to their lamps
in the Church. For the Turkes not only burne lamps in their
Churches euery night, but during the whole time of their Lent
they be≈øet the battlements of their ≈øteeples round about with
lampes. But when their Lent is ended, they burne lampes in
their ≈øt√©eples onely once a w√©eke, and that is on Thur≈øday at
night, which is the Eue before their Sabboth. After we had
refre≈øhed our ≈øelues h√©ere, halfe the day being not yet ≈øpent, we

often times ≈øtucke fa≈øt in the puddles and miry places, and
≈øometimes ready to breake their owne legs, and their Riders
necks among rocks and ≈øtones. It was neither plea≈øant go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on foot, nor riding this way, for there was no path nor euen
ground, but huge ≈øtones and rocks ≈øo n√©ere together, that our
hor≈øes could goe but a foot pace, and often times met with ≈øuch
mari≈øhes and quagmires, that we were con≈øtrained to goe
farre about before we could finde better waies to pa≈ø≈øe ouer.
It is al≈øo exceeding cold in this place alwaies (in re≈øpect of other

nor high hils to keepe away the violence and force of the winds.
The Carauans that trauel v≈øually that way betwixt <hi>Dama≈øcus</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> ≈øay that this daies iourney troubleth them more
than all the re≈øt, and that they neuer pa≈ø≈øe by that way, but
they leaue two or three of their Cammels behinde them, ≈øome

places this way, the carca≈øes of many dead cammels which

came ≈øafely that day to <hi>Conetra,</hi> where we lodged in a good
Cane, di≈øtant from <hi>Sa≈ø≈øa</hi> 28. miles.</p>
               <p>After our tedious trauell to <hi>Conetra,</hi> finding the place plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant
at our comming thither, we walked about to ≈øolace our
≈øelues in beholding the gr√©ene pa≈øtures and running riuers nere
vnto it, and in viewing the order of ≈øundry Nations there a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled
together from ≈øundry places. Some comming from
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and bound to <hi>Dama≈øcus,</hi> pitched their tents without the

and bound to <hi>Ieru≈øalem,</hi> accommodated them≈øelues (in ≈øuch
≈øort as they could) within the Cane. But e≈øpecially in a Bazar
(like vnto a cloi≈øter) adioining to the Cane, wee tooke plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure
to walke vp and downe ≈øome few turns, which the Turks
beholding, wondred at vs: (for it is not their cu≈øtome in tho≈øe

but to ≈øit ≈øtill on the ground like brute bea≈øts) and one of
them came vnto vs, and a≈øked vs what we meant to walke vp
and downe in ≈øuch ≈øort, and whether we were out of our way,
or out of our wits. If your way (≈øaid he) lieth toward the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end of the cloi≈øter, why come you downwards? And if at
the netherend, why goe you backe againe? We an≈øwered him,
For our plea≈øure. He replied, that it was greater plea≈øure to
≈øit ≈øtill, than to walke vp and downe when we n√©ed not. But
their bruti≈øh ≈øitting ≈øtil on the ground was as ≈øtrange vnto vs,
as our walking vp and downe was to them.</p>
               <p>It ≈ø√©emed no le≈ø≈øe ≈øtrange vnto them to ≈ø√©e a Chri≈øtian with
a cut dublet: and they called him foole, and a≈øked him what h√©e
meant to make holes in his coat: for they neither cut nor pinke
any of their garments, but weare them all plaine, ≈øparing for
no co≈øt to guard them with lace of ≈øiluer and gold if they be able.</p>
               <p>And ≈øuch as weare long haire on their heads, the Turkes
call ≈ølouens, and account them ≈øauage bea≈øts; for they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues
weare no haire on their heads at all, but ≈øhaue them eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>But if a man haue a faire long beard, they reuerence him,
and ≈øay he is a wi≈øe man, and an honourable per≈øonage. But
if they haue no beards at all, they call them (if they be yoong)

               <p>March 23. We had a more plea≈øant way; for the fir≈øt ten
miles w√©e rode thorow the fields and a very plea≈øant Parke.
But when w√©e came out of this Parke or Fore≈øt, wee were
≈øomewhat troubled, partly by rea≈øon of the bad way, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by bad people in the way. The way was ≈øtony and rockie
(as the former daies iourney was) but yet dry, and not long,
for it was but the de≈øcending downe a rockie hill, where though
the way were dangerous vnder our f√©et, yet it was plea≈øant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our faces, for w√©e beheld the pro≈øpect of part of the holy
Land, <hi>viz. Galile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at our de≈øending downe this mountaine, the people did
more trouble vs then the way; for there ≈øate among≈øt the rocks
in our way many <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabs,</hi> with maces of Iron and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weapons, who ≈øtaied vs and demanded <hi>Caphar</hi> or tole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
we were glad to giue them content that w√©e might pa≈ø≈øe
≈øafely by them, as <hi>Iacob</hi> was glad to ≈øend his brother <hi>E≈øau</hi> gifts,
for a <hi>Ne noceat</hi> (as the Lawyers ≈øpeake) that is, for feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Carauan</hi> of Chri≈øtians, who came after vs, though
they were many hundreds, yet ≈øome of them being not able,
≈øome not willing to pay ≈øo much mony as they demanded, were
≈øhrewdly beaten with their iron ma≈øes. There was a <hi>Ie≈øuite</hi>
in their company, who e≈øcaped not without ≈øtripes, whereat
(as I haue heard) he reioiced, and counted it meritorious, in
that he ≈øuffered ≈øuch mi≈øery in ≈øo holy a voyage. And in my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
at <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> one of his companions told him, that he meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
much to ≈øu≈øteine ≈øuch trauell and labour, and be at ≈øo great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2104:63"/>
co≈øt and charges, and ≈øuffer ≈øo many ≈øtripes for Chri≈øts ≈øake:
But I know, had it not b√©ene more for loue of his pur≈øe than for
loue of Chri≈øt, he might haue e≈øcaped without ≈øtripes, yea
with the≈øe kinde ≈øpeeches, <hi>Marhabbah Ianum,</hi> that is, <hi>Welcome

               </p>
               <p>At another place in my trauels I heard a Friar bragging of
his good workes, and ≈øaying, that h√©e had done ≈øo many good
workes, that if he ≈øhould kill thr√©e men, his good works would
make ≈øati≈øfaction, and merit remi≈ø≈øion for them all. To whom
one in my company an≈øwered, that by his murder he might

to trauell into Turkey, how to behaue them≈øelues. If
they be ≈øet vpon by th√©eues, they may defend them≈øelues in
their trauels, if they be ≈øtrong enough; but if they be poling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
(as the≈øe were) they mu≈øt not be contradicted. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their Cities, nor in their trauels, may they ≈øtrike againe
though they be abu≈øed and beaten by any man (except they be
th√©eues and robbers) for if they doe, they ≈øhall either be put to
death, or haue their hand cut off. Neither if a man receiue a
box on the eare at any of their hands, mu≈øt he giue one bad
word, or looke frowningly vpon him that ≈ømote him: for then
he will ≈øtrike him againe, and ≈øay, What, <hi>Goure?</hi> Doe≈øt thou
cur≈øe me, and wi≈øh that the Deuill had me? But he mu≈øt ki≈ø≈øe
his beard, or the ≈økirt of his garment, and ≈ømile vpon him, and

               <p>Wherefore, trauellers into tho≈øe parts mu≈øt looke vpon the

thereby they may learne how to behaue them≈øelues in trauell.</p>
               <p>I read, that of old they were wont to paint the picture of a

               <p>Mo≈øt of the≈øe qualities are required in Trauellers. In diet
they mu≈øt not be dainty, but eat what they can get. Their

were entred into <hi>Galile</hi> about 2. miles from the bridge, our <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øarie</hi>
a≈øked vs whether we would go vp to a mountaine, and
≈øo to <hi>Saphetta</hi> neere vnto mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> which is a place of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for Iewes; or keepe the lower way, and goe by the ≈øea of
<hi>Galile,</hi> which is the plea≈øanter way: and thereof we made choi≈øe;
and tooke <hi>Saphetta</hi> in our way afterwards.</p>
               <p>About ≈øeuen miles from <hi>Iacobs</hi> bridge, our guide brought
vs to a well, adorned with marble pillers, and couered with
≈øtone, which he ≈øaid to haue beene the pit whereinto <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> was
put when his brethren ≈øold him to the <hi>I≈øhmalites.</hi> But it ≈øeemed
to vs incredible: fir≈øt, becau≈øe that was a dry pit, and this is ful
of ≈øweet water.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Iacob</hi> dwelt at <hi>Hebron</hi> twelue miles beyond <hi>Ieru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and his ≈øonnes kept ≈øh√©epe in <hi>Shechem.</hi> And that dry pit
whereinto they put <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> was at <hi>Dothan</hi> (which we ≈øaw after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
And this pit which they ≈øhewed vs with marble pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
was in <hi>Galile;</hi> not n√©ere <hi>Dothan</hi> nor <hi>Shechem</hi> where <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øephs</hi>
brethren kept their fathers ≈øheepe.</p>
               <p>But by others of better iudgement wee vnder≈øtood that
this al≈øo was called <hi>Io≈øeps</hi> pit, or well, becau≈øe it was built by
one <hi>Io≈øph,</hi> not <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Iacob,</hi> but ≈øome other. But
the ignorant people which trauell that way, are apt to beleeue
any things that is told them. About ten miles from this well,
we came to a Cane called by the Moores <hi>Minium,</hi> but by the
Turkes <hi>Mi≈ø≈øia,</hi> hard by the ≈øea of <hi>Galile,</hi> where we lodged all
night, hauing trauelled that day by computation 36. miles.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth of March we rode along by the Sea
of <hi>Galile,</hi> which, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 1. is called by two mames, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sea
of <hi>Galile</hi> or <hi>Tiberias. Galile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galile.</note> becau≈øe it is in <hi>Galile:</hi> and <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi>
becau≈øe the City <hi>Tiberias</hi> was built by it, and <hi>Beth≈øaida</hi>
an other ancient City; of both which we ≈øaw ≈øome ruinous
Wals. And it is ≈øaid in that Chapter (<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 1.) that Ie≈øus
went ouer the Sea of <hi>Galile:</hi> and in an other place that he went
beyond the Lake. And <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 10. It is ≈øaid, that h√©e went
into a ≈ølitary place, neere vnto a Citie called <hi>Beth≈øaida,</hi> which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2104:65"/>
place of <hi>Iohn</hi> I learned to vnder≈øtand better by ≈øeeing it, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I could before by reading of it. For, ≈ø√©eing that <hi>Tiberias</hi>
and <hi>Beth≈øaida</hi> were both Cities on the ≈øame ≈øide of the Sea, and
Chri≈øt went from <hi>Tiberias</hi> too, or neere vnto <hi>Beth≈øaida;</hi> I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thereby that our Sauiour Chri≈øt went not ouer the length
or breadth of that Sea; but ouer ≈øome Arme, bo≈øome or reach
thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> ≈øo farre as <hi>Tiberias</hi> was di≈øtant from <hi>Beth≈øaida;</hi>
which is al≈øo confirmed in that it is ≈øaid el≈øwhere, <hi>A great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
followed him on foot thither;</hi> which they could not haue
done if he had gone quite ouer the Sea, to the other ≈øide among
the <hi>Gergelens,</hi> which is out of the holy Land. And therfore this
Sea of <hi>Galile,</hi> is al≈øo called the Lake of <hi>Gene≈øereth,</hi> becau≈øe the
Countrey of the <hi>Cerge≈øens</hi> is on the other ≈øide the Lake, from
whence the Swine ran headlong into the Sea and were choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
therein: and as that place was out of the holy Land; ≈øo the
people which then inhabited it, were as far from holines, when
they reque≈øted our ≈øauiour Chri≈øt to depart out of their Coa≈øts.
And ≈øuch like holy people inhabite there ≈øtill, <hi>viz.</hi> wild <hi>Arabs,</hi>
and <hi>Turks, &amp;c.</hi> We ≈øawe al≈øo (neere vnto this Sea) the place
where that Towne (mentioned <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 1. called <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile</hi>
≈øtood, where our Sauiour Chri≈øt at a mariage turned water
into wine; in place whereof there ≈øtandeth now a poore village
inhabited by <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ≈øea of <hi>Galile</hi> is (by computation) in length 8. leagues,
and in breadth 5. leagues, and euery league is thr√©e miles; and
then it enclo≈øeth it ≈øelfe into a narrowe compa≈ø≈øe, carrying but
the breadth of an ordinarie riuer vntill it come to <hi>Sodome,</hi>
where it endeth, which is called <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> that is, The
dead Sea.</p>
               <p>After we had rode about ≈øeuen miles by the ≈øea of <hi>Galile,</hi> we
left it on our left hand, and a≈øcended vp a mountaine on the
right hand.</p>
               <p>This mountaine was not very ≈øt√©epie, but exc√©eding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant
and fertile, for (being the ≈øpringtime) it was ≈øo be≈øet with
≈øuch varietie of flowers among the greene gra≈ø≈øe, that they ≈ø√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to flire in our faces, and to <hi>laugh and ≈øing</hi> (as the P≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øt

formerly to haue b√©ene Merchants of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> what they meant
to leaue their trade and to liue there: They an≈øwered, they
were now olde and came thither to die, that they might b√©e
n√©erer to heauen: wee told them, that how≈øoeuer they might
≈øeeme there to bee n√©erer to heauen whiles they lined, becau≈øe
they dwelt on an high mountaine, yet that they ≈øhould not bee
n√©erer vnto heauen when they died, vnle≈ø≈øe they repented and
bel√©eued in Chri≈øt, &amp;c. The Iewes haue here more libertie then
in any part of the holy land. They dare not come to <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi>
for feare le≈øt the Chri≈øtians there dwelling, ≈øtone them.</p>
               <p>Whiles wee were at <hi>Saphetta,</hi> many Turkes departed from
thence towards <hi>Mecha</hi> in <hi>Arabia.</hi> And the ≈øame morning they
went, we ≈øaw many women playing with Tymbrels as they
went along the ≈øtr√©ete, and made a yelling or ≈øcriking noi≈øe as
though they cryed. We a≈øked what they meant in ≈øo doing?
It was an≈øwered vs, that they mourned for the departure of
their hu≈øbands, who were gone that morning on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Mecha,</hi> and they feared that they ≈øhould neuer ≈ø√©e them again,
becau≈øe it was a long way and dangerous, and many died there
euery y√©ere. It ≈ø√©emed ≈øtrange to vs, that they ≈øhould mourne
with mu≈øicke about the ≈øtr√©etes, for mu≈øicke is v≈øed in other
places at times of mirth, and not at times of mourning. But
they did it but <hi>Paruae con≈øuetudmis cau≈øa.</hi> For a litle cu≈øtomes
≈øake. And I doubt not but many of them were glad for their
departure, and would be glader if they would neuer come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they v≈øe them ≈øo kindly.</p>
               <p>And vnder pretence of deuotion, many trauell to <hi>Mecha</hi> to

vnder≈øtanding that it was very dangerous by rea≈øon of wilde
<hi>Arabs</hi> which lodged in caues and rockes and bu≈øhes about the
mountaine,<note place="margin">Mount Tabor</note> we hired ≈øome of the principall <hi>Arabs</hi> to goe with vs
and guard vs from the re≈øt. And as we went, we beheld the

but not very high (in re≈øpect of ≈øome other mountaines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about)
nor very large, but a comely round mountaine, be≈øet

               <p>One of our <hi>Arabs</hi> went vp before vs, as fa≈øt as if it had been

knew not the names thereof, for the Turkes inhabiting tho≈øe

the plea≈øante≈øt daies iourney we had in our whole trauell. I

becau≈øe (the <hi>Turkes Romadan,</hi> which is their Lent, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)

very de≈øperat, with their bowes and arrowes ready drawen,
but me≈ø≈øengers al≈øo ≈øent to rai≈øe vp all the whole rabblement
thereabout vpon vs: he told vs we were be≈øt giue them content
or el≈øe we were all but dead men: wherefore to auoid further

               <p>About ten miles from them we rode through a wood, (a very

in <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and were glad of our company thither. And ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after we had di≈øcharged euery man his peece, we ≈øaw a great
company of <hi>Arabs</hi> on an high mountaine neere vnto our way,
yet out of the reach of our ≈øhot, who perceiuing vs to be too
≈øtrong for them, dur≈øt not ≈øet vpon vs.</p>
               <p>And ≈øo (by the prouidence of God) we came that night to an

               <p>From <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well we went into the City, and lodged in a
very ancient &amp; ≈øtately Cane, but very badly kept. It had b√©ene
better for vs to haue ≈ølept by <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well, as others did; for here
we ≈ølept on the hard ≈øtones n√©ere vnto a Chapel in the middle of
the Cane, vnder two or thr√©e great figge trees and mulberry
tr√©es, where we were ≈øcarce ≈øafe from theeues; for we had ≈øome
things ≈øtollen from vs in the night, whiles we ≈ølept vnder the

               <p>The fir≈øt part of this daies iourney was ≈øomewhat plea≈øant;
but, the n√©erer we came to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> the more barren and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
our way was. About ten of the clock wee came to a great
forre≈øt or wildernes full of tr√©es and mountaines. When w√©e
were on the top of this mountaine, w√©e ≈øaw the maine ≈øea on
our right hand, and ≈ømall Ships ≈øayling towards <hi>Ioppa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About thr√©e or foure of the clocke, we came to a ruinous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Beere,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beere,</note> but of old (as it is reported) <hi>Beer≈øheba,</hi> which
in former times was a great Citie: And it is ≈øaid to be the place
where <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> comming from <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> (the fea≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended) mi≈ø≈øed the child <hi>Ie≈øus,</hi> and ≈øought him ≈øorrowing; and
returning to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> found him in the Temple amid≈øt the
Doctors, hearing them and po≈øing them. Our purpo≈øe was to
lodge here all night, being all of vs weary and hungry, and all
our proui≈øion ≈øpent. But finding nothing here to bee had for
money either for man or hor≈øe; and vnder≈øtanding that <hi>Ieru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
was but ten miles off, we went on in our way ≈øomewhat
<pb facs="tcp:2104:71"/>
faintly fiue or ≈øixe miles,<note place="margin">Ieru≈øalem.</note> and then beholding the pro≈øpect of the
Citie, wee were ≈øomewhat cheered and reuiued, and ≈øolaced our
≈øelues with ≈øinging of P≈øalmes, vntill we came neere vnto the
Citie.</p>
               <p>Many Gr√©ekes dwelling in <hi>Ieru≈øalem,</hi> ≈øeeing vs a farre off,
came to meet vs, ≈øuppo≈øing their Patriarch had been in our
companie, who came two or thr√©e daies after vs.</p>
               <p>Wee di≈ømounted from our hor≈øes at the we≈øt gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">Ioppa gate.</note>
called <hi>Ioppa</hi> gate, or the Ca≈øtle gate; which is a very ≈øtrong
gate of iron, with thirteen pieces of bra≈ø≈øe ordinance planted on
the wall about the gate. Wee ≈øtaied in the porch of this gate,
and might not be admitted into the Citie, vntill we were ≈øear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by an officer (as the maner is.) In the meane time there
came to vs two Italian Friers, <hi>viz. Padre Angelo,</hi> and <hi>Padre
Aurel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o</hi> and ki≈ø≈øed our hands, and bade vs welcome, and told vs
that two other Engli≈øhmen were at their hou≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> ma≈øter
<hi>Timberley,</hi> and ma≈øter <hi>Borell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we were ≈øearched without the gate by a Turki≈øh offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
and deliuered vp our weapons to the porter to k√©epe for vs
in the gate-hou≈øe vntill our returne (becau≈øe no Chri≈øtian may
enter into <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> with weapons) the≈øe two <hi>Padres</hi> led vs
to their Mona≈øterie; at the gate whereof wee were ≈øearched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by another Turki≈øh officer before wee might enter into
the hou≈øe. For the office of the former ≈øearcher at the gate of
the Citie was onely to receiue the weapons of all Chri≈øtians,
and deliuer them ≈øafe to them againe at their departure. But
this ≈øearcher went further and ≈øearched all our cariage which he
cau≈øed to be opened, to ≈øee whether we had any gun-powder or
any other engins there. For they are very ≈øu≈øpicious of all
Chri≈øtians, fearing, le≈øt for deuotion to the place, they ≈øhould
worke trea≈øon; therefore they ≈øuffer not Chri≈øtians to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City weaponed, le≈øt they make in≈øurrection again≈øt them
when they are many together, and conquer the Citie, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haue done,</p>
               <p>To this end al≈øo is the Citie walled about with ≈øtrong wals,
and fortified with foure ≈øtrong gates and a Ca≈øtle, (built by
<hi>Sultan Soliman</hi>) and euery gate well planted with ordinance for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2104:72"/>
feare of Chri≈øtians. And partly for hope haue they enuironed
this City with ≈øuch ≈øtrong wals, that Chri≈øtians for deuotion to
the place, might come and build within the wals and be ≈øubiect to
the Turke. For though their walles bee large and ≈øtrong, yet
there is great roome within the wals to build more hou≈øes then
are there, for there are fields of Corne within the walles of the
Citie; and the hou≈øes ≈øtand very thin, ≈øcattered, and di≈øper≈øed,
h√©ere one and there two or three together; there is not one
faire ≈øtr√©et in all <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> as it now is.</p>
               <p>After they had thus narrowly ≈øearched al our cariage, euen to
our Ca≈øes of Bottles, we were admitted into the Mona≈øtery; at
the entrance whereinto, met vs ma≈øter <hi>Timberley</hi> and ma≈øter
<hi>Boreel,</hi> and then <hi>Signior Franci≈øcus Mannerba</hi> the <hi>Padre Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
of the mona≈øtery, and all the re≈øt in order, and bade vs wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and led vs into a faire parler and ≈øet good ch√©ere before vs,
and ≈øerued vs them≈øelues.</p>
               <p>After ≈øupper wee deliuered them our letters which wee had
brought from the <hi>Venice</hi> Con≈øull of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi>
Merchants there in our behalfe. Which when they had read,
the Guardian ≈øaid, our cu≈øtome is, when ≈øtangers come to vs,
to call them the fir≈øt night to Ma≈ø≈øe, and to Confe≈ø≈øion, and to
giue euery man a candle to hold in his hand at Ma≈ø≈øe time; and
at night to wa≈øh their feete and to bring them to bed, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other ceremonies during the whole time of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
there.</p>
               <p>But as for vs, they vnder≈øtood by letters what we were; and
told vs that wee were ≈øo highly commended by their Patrones
and Benefactors, the <hi>Venice</hi> Con≈øul, and Merchants of <hi>Aleppo,</hi>
that if they ≈øhould ≈øhew vs halfe the fauour which was required
at their hands, they ≈øhould them≈øelues lie without doores, and
≈øuffer vs to rule and <hi>dominier</hi> at our plea≈øures. And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would not vrge vs to any thing again≈øt our con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but giue fr√©e libertie both of per≈øons and con≈øciences as if
we were in <hi>England,</hi> or in our own hou≈øes el≈øewhere: &amp; ≈øo much
the rather becau≈øe they vnder≈øtood our Merchants were rich, and
hoped to gaine by vs. In regard wherof, although it were Lent,
wherein they eate no fle≈øh, yet offered vs Hens, Egs, Milke:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2104:72"/>
any thing that was there to bee had for money, they reque≈øted
vs to command it.</p>
               <p>And during the time of our continuance there, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one <hi>Padre Aurelio</hi> to attend vpon vs, and ≈ø√©e that we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing; and another of his brethren, one <hi>Padre Angelo,</hi> to
be our guide abroad and to ≈øhew vs al ancient Monuments and
places worth ≈ø√©eing either in the Citie or out of the Citie.</p>
               <p>The≈øe kind ≈øpeeches being v≈øed, they brought vs to our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
where we ≈øhould lodge all night, &amp; prouided for uery man
≈øeuerally a good neate bed with faire ≈øh√©etes and all things very
hole≈øome and hand≈øome, where we ≈ølept ≈øw√©etly, and refre≈øhed
our wearied bodies all that night very comfortably.</p>
               <p>But although they dealt thus kindly with vs (at the in≈øtance
of their benefactors) in giuing vs liberty of con≈øcience, yet they
deale not ≈øo with others. For ≈øome I doe know who haue b√©en

view the City, not inquiring of any place what it was, becau≈øe
on the morrow after, and euery day during our continuance,
(which was about fourt√©ene daies) our guide either walked on
foot,<note place="margin">Re≈øolution of a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters warming him≈øelfe in the high Prie≈øts hall.</note> or rode with vs, to ≈ø√©e all things worthy ob≈øeruation. Only
one thing I ob≈øerued and duly con≈øidered the fir≈øt day I came,
which was this; that where as we read in the Go≈øpell, that
when our Sauiour Chri≈øt was betraied, and brought into the
High Prie≈øts Hall, <hi>Peter</hi> following him, ≈øtood by the fire, and
warmed him≈øelfe; the rea≈øon is there y√©elded, becau≈øe it was
cold. And the memoriall n√©ereof we ob≈øerue in March or Aprill.
We being there at the ≈øame ≈øea≈øon of the y√©ere, found it exc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hot, &amp; hotter than it is v≈øually at mid≈øommer in England:
It ≈øeemed ≈øtrange vnto me, how it ≈øhould then be ≈øo cold, that
<hi>Peter</hi> ≈øhould cr√©epe to the fire, and now (at the ≈øame ≈øea≈øon) ≈øo
hot that we could not endure the heat of the Sunne. And on
the ≈øudden I knew not whether the ≈øea≈øon were altered, or the
pa≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt might be referred to ≈øome colder ≈øea≈øon of the
y√©ere. But after I had b√©ene there a few daies, the very place
re≈øolued that doubt: For there fall great dewes, and before the

when I ≈ølept in the fields all night. And <hi>Peter</hi> hauing
watched with Chri≈øt in the night, might well be cold in the

And yet another rea≈øon (in my iudgement) more effectuall
than the former,<note place="margin">2. Rea≈øon.</note> may be y√©elded for this matter, taken <hi>√† ≈øimili,</hi>
that as the ≈øame night that Chri≈øt was borne, there was great
light at midnight, in token of comfort; And at the time of his
death, great darkne≈ø≈øe at noone day, in token of ≈øorrow (for
the Sunne put on his mourning garment, and was a≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to looke vpon that cruelty which the ≈øonnes of men were
not afraid to commit) So at the time of his betraying there
might be extraordinary cold wether, in that an extraordinarie
per≈øon ≈øuffered, and an extraordinary worke was in hand. And
extraordinary things happened about the time of his pa≈ø≈øion, as
we read in the Go≈øpell, <hi>viz.</hi> How the graues did open: The dead
bodies of Saints (which ≈ølept) aro≈øe: The veile of the Temple
did rent in twaine from the top of the bottome: The earth did
tremble, and the ≈øtones did cleaue a≈øunder. The≈øe things decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that a notable per≈øon ≈øuffered. The like alteration might
be in the coldne≈ø≈øe of the aire, and alteration of wether. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we read it not in expre≈ø≈øe words, yet (≈øince I haue
≈ø√©ene <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi>) it ≈ø√©emeth to me, that it may be gathered from
that place of the Go≈øpell, where it is ≈øaid, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> warmed
him≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>For (if we truly calculate the time) the ≈øea≈øon of the y√©ere
was hot ordinarily; and <hi>Simon Peter</hi> at that ≈øea≈øon of the y√©ere
was ≈øo cold, that he was driuen to the fire, and therefore it
≈øhould ≈ø√©eme to be vn≈øea≈øonable wether, and extraordinarily
cold. The≈øe con≈øiderations haue ≈øati≈øfied my ≈øelfe (howeuer

them≈øelues in their ≈øinnes, and cried, <hi>Templum Domini, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum

But through their prophanation, they made the Temple of the

beauty of their materiall Temple: They wondred at the ≈øtones

               <p>Yea the violence of the <hi>Romans</hi> proc√©eded further, and pulled

Or the Lord hath re≈øpect vnto the word <hi>Ieho≈øaphat,</hi> which
≈øignifieth pleading or iudgement: becau≈øe God would in the

Into which <hi>Solomon</hi> doth a≈ø≈øure the yoong man, that

               <p>After conference had with their <hi>Padre Vicatio</hi> (who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the be≈øt learned among≈øt them) hauing told him thus
much in effect as I haue h√©ere written, he a≈øked me a rea≈øon
why the Prophet ≈øhould ≈øpecifie this place, if he meant not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

               <p>My an≈øwer was: Two rea≈øons had he to make choice of it,
by allu≈øion to which he might ≈øhadow to the <hi>Iewes</hi> the day of

               <p>One was the fre≈øhne≈ø≈øe of that famous deliuerances memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

               <p>Another, the great re≈øemblance that will be betw√©ene the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,

               <p>For from the time of this Prophet, yet had there not a mans
age pa≈ø≈øed, ≈øince (without ≈øtroke of theirs) the Lord had in this
valley, within the ≈øight of this City, di≈øpatched thr√©e whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which had ioined forces to beleager them: And further,
in ≈øuch ≈øort, as in that generall iudgement he will di≈øpatch the
wicked. For as h√©ere, though the <hi>Moabite,</hi> the <hi>Amonite,</hi> and
the inhabitant of <hi>Seir,</hi> bound them≈øelues again≈øt <hi>Iuda,</hi> and yet
could not preuaile; ≈øo there, though the Moabiti≈øh fle≈øh, the

               <p>And as the ≈øame place was to them a valley of iudgement,
which to the <hi>Iewes</hi> was a valley of ble≈ø≈øing; ≈øo ≈øhall that great
day be to the wicked a day of iudgement, for they ≈øhall receiue
that heauy doome, <hi>Goe you cur≈øed;</hi> which to the godly ≈øhall be

               <p>This Frier was not ≈øati≈øfied with this an≈øwer, but per≈øi≈øted

<hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyren,</hi> and compelled him to helpe Chri≈øt to beare his

<pb facs="tcp:2104:84"/>
≈øoone as we had pa≈ø≈øed that dore, we crept very lowe, as it were
into an Ouen mouth, euery man with a Candle in his hand; and
≈øo came into a darke roome foure ≈øquare, with Benches round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
of ≈øtone, hollow, like vnto Mangers, and therin (they ≈øay)
≈øome of the noble famely of the Kings and Qu√©enes of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> and
<hi>Iudah</hi> were buried.</p>
               <p>From thence they brought vs into another roome of like ≈øort,
and for like v≈øe; &amp; ≈øo from one to another, that (without a guide)
it was impo≈ø≈øible to find the way out. How many ≈øuch roomes
there are, I know not: but wee were in ≈øix or ≈øeuen, and they
offered to bring vs into more, but being almo≈øt ≈øtifled for want
of light and aire, we de≈øired to returne.</p>
               <p>I make no qu≈øtion, but they were places of buriall; for in the
hollow benches of ≈øtone wee ≈øawe bones of men: but whether
they were the ≈øepulchers of the kings of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> or not,
is my doubt.</p>
               <p>At the entrance in the Temple where the Sepulcher is to bee
≈ø√©ene, the fir≈øt thing which they ≈øhew vnto ≈øtrangers, is a faire
marble ≈øtone, euen with the ground; and there (≈øay they) the
bodie of our Sauiour Chri≈øt was laid (when it was taken down
from the Cro≈ø≈øe) whiles it was preparing to be laid in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher.
And heere I ≈øaw many ≈øimple people (both men and
women) kn√©eling round about that ≈øtone, wringing their hands
w√©eping, and crying, as if they had ≈ø√©ene the dead bodie of our
Sauiour Chri≈øt there pre≈øent before their eies. And they all to
be-ki≈ø≈øed that ≈øtone. Yea, more then ki≈ø≈øed it, for ≈øome of them
rubbed their lips vp and downe vpon that ≈øtone very often, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they had rubbed off the ≈økin and made their lips bl√©ed. And
≈øome of them rubbed their beads vpon it, that ≈øome inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe
might come out of that ≈øtone, and re≈øt vpon their beads.
I cen≈øure this ≈øuper≈øtition of theirs ouer fauourably, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
this ≈øtone among doubtfull things, which I might rather
haue reckoned among≈øt manife≈øt vntruts. For if there had b√©en
any ≈øuch ≈øtone, it would haue b√©en either caried away by pieces,
or remoued whole to <hi>Rome</hi> as other reliques haue b√©ene. But
this ≈øtone is too new to be of any ≈øuch Antiquitie.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bethania</hi> they brought vs into a Celler vnder the ground,<note place="margin">Bethania.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2104:84"/>
ouer which there was no hou≈øe, where <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay dead when
Chri≈øt rai≈øed him vp to life.</p>
               <p>And at <hi>Bethphage</hi> they ≈øhewed vs the ruines of <hi>Simon</hi> the<note place="margin">Bethphage.</note>
Phari≈øeis hou≈øe, where Chri≈øt ≈øitting at dinner, <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene</hi>
came and powred ointment on his head, and wa≈øhed his
f√©ete with her teares, and dried them with the haire of her head.
For although no man denieth but that ≈øuch things were done,
yet a man may make doubt whether tho≈øe were the particular
places where they were done.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> they ≈øhewed vs <hi>Porta aurea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Porta aurea.</note> that is, <hi>The gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
gate;</hi> (or place where it ≈øtood) called in former times, <hi>The
beautifull gate of the Temple:</hi> which the Turkes haue walled
vp with ≈øtones, becau≈øe of a prophecie, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Citie was
once wonne there, and ≈øhall be againe wonne at the ≈øame place.</p>
               <p>Walking betwixt the valley of <hi>Gehinnom</hi> and the walles of
the Citie, our guide ≈øhewed vs a darke Chappell vnder the
ground without windowes, wherein (he told vs) the idolatrous
Iewes did offer &amp; ≈øacrifice their children vnto a bra≈øen Image,
called <hi>Moloch,</hi> which, being made hote, they inclo≈øed them in
the hollowne≈ø≈øe thereof, and ≈øo ≈ølew them. And le≈øt their crying
≈øhould moue any to compa≈ø≈øion towards them, they made a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
noi≈øe with Tabrets and Drums. Whereupon the place
was called <hi>Tophet. Iere.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
               <p>On the top of mount Oliuet,<note place="margin">Sodome.</note> they ≈øhewed vs thirtie miles off
the lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which vnto vs appeared to bee very neere.
And they told vs thereof many ≈øtrange matters. Not onely that
which the wi≈øeman <hi>Solomon</hi> reported of it in his daies. <hi>Wi≈ød.</hi>
10. 7. that it ≈ømoaketh, (as if hell had there found a chinmey
whereout to vent his ≈ømoake) and that the tr√©es beare fruit that
neuer commeth to ripene≈ø≈øe: but further, that it neither br√©edeth
nor pre≈øerueth any liuing creature. It is commonly called
<hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> that is, <hi>The dead ≈øea;</hi> being ≈øo contagious, as
if a bird but flie ouer it, ≈øhe is pre≈øently dampt, and falleth down
dead into it. And as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øaith: <hi>If by the ≈øwelling of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
the fi≈øhes but flow ouer into it, they die ≈øtraight and flote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

               </p>
               <p>Yea, they further reported vnto vs of their owne knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:2104:85"/>
hauing (as ≈øhey ≈øaid) ≈ø√©ene the ≈øame, that it ca≈øteth out continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

               <p>But of the≈øe and many other things which they ≈øhewed vs,

               <p>When I ≈øhall with mine eyes behold them, I will more
