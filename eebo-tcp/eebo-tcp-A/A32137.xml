            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

SPEAKERS Speech at the presenting thereof, 22. June 1641.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat policy, most gracious and dread Soveraigne, which weighs the Prerogative of the King and property of the Subject in the same Scales, and increases the plenty of the Crowne and government of the people; the even poysing of this Beame enables both, the one being ordained for the preservation of the other.</p>
            <p>This principle is so riveted into the hearts of your Subjects by the acts of their Ancestors, and traditions of their fore-fathers, that it hath created a beliefe in them, that their wills are bound to a due allegiance, and their fortunes and estates, as well as their duty and subjection, must bend to the commands of that Soveraigne power with which God hath invested your sacred Majesty.</p>
            <p>Compulsary obedience, advanced by the transcendent power of Prerogative, is too weake to support the right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: It is the affections and estates of your people, tyed with the threads of obedience, by the rules of Law, that fastens safety and prosperity to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>The experiment of elder times, in the raignes of the most valiant puissant Princes, hath concluded this the soveraigne preservative against the diseases of distraction and confusion, and makes it manifest to the world, that the honour and glory of this Throne is to command the hearts of free-men.</p>
            <p>This admitted, the permission of the least diminution, or any eclypsed interposition betweene the honour and plenty of the Crowne, contracts a scorne upon the Nation.</p>
            <p>Severall Parliaments in former times have stampt the Caracter of a free gift upon the fore-front of this ayd, still offered by the people as a sacrifice of thankesgiving to the Crowne, for the safe conduct of your Merchants, and provision of the Navie, to strengthen your undoubted Dominion over the seas, which hath protected your Allyes, and is a terrour to your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Our hopes were long since to have settled this for the measure and the time, and with this to have presented to your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty the triumphant palme of Tranquillity in all your Kingdomes: But, as a ship floating upon a rough sea, wee have beene cast upon the rocke of feare and dangers, and tossed on the billowes of distraction and distrust of Church and Common-wealth, where we yet remaine hopelesse ever to passe through that narrow channell which leads to the Haven of peace, unlesse we be speedily steered on by the hand of your sacred wisedome, care and providence.</p>
            <p>In the midst of all these troubles, and the severall opinions which have beene amongst us, no division had power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract any one of us from the care and duty wee owe to your sacred person.</p>
            <p>And, to that end am I now sent by the Commons of England, to present this as a Marke onely, whereby your sacred Majesty may view the inward duties of our hearts, untill time and opportunity will give leave for a further expression of our duties and affections. The acceptation of this gift will glad the hearts of your people, and the approbation by the royall assent of this Bill (being the largest for the measure which was ever given) will joyne wings to our desires and hopes, which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returne without that Olive-leafe, which may declare that the waters are abated, and your sacred Majesty may have full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the faith and loyalty of your subjects.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doe very willingly accept your offer made at this time, as a testimony of your love, and beginning of your duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affections unto mee; And I no way doubt, but that you will performe that which you have intimated unto me, and that in due time you will performe the rest, when you have leisure.</p>
            <p>I doe not doubt likewise, but that in passing this Bill you will see a testimony of the trust and confidence I have in your affections, as also that I omit no occasion whereby I may shew that affection to my people, that I desire my people would shew to me, as in this Parliament hitherto no body can say but that I have sought occasions both to shew my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto them, and to remove disputes.</p>
            <p>And therefore in this particular Bill I hope you will know that I do freely and frankly give over the right which my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours have ever challenged unto them (though I confesse disputed, but yet they did never yeeld in their times;) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will understand this but a marke of my confidence to put my selfe wholly upon the love and affection of my people for my subsistence; And therefore I hope that in prosecution of this, you will go on as you have said, and that, though you have rumors of jealousies and suspitions, by flying and idle discourses, that have come to my eares, concerning the ordinary way, I confesse I never understood otherwise then as having relation to the Scotish army, and preventing insurrection; which vanished as soone as they were borne.</p>
            <p>And therefore now you see my clearnesse, I will leave that to you, and will not meddle with it one way or other, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had other designe but to win the affections of my people by my Justice in my Government.</p>
