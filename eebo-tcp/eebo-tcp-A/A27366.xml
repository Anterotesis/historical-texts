            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT's the Glorious Title the Great Founder of Christianity hath given You that walk therein, when he said, <hi>Whilst ye have the Light, walk in the Light, that ye may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Children of the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Consideration of Your great Industry and Diligence in all Affairs of this Life, Your great Charity in Relieving Your own Poor, and Others also, as Occasions offer, Your great Morality acknowledged by All, and Your Religious Sincerity, known to the L'ord; Hath induced me to Dedicate these following Proposals to Your serious Consideration, whilst I think You a very regular Body, willing and capable of such an Undertaking; Your Poor being less Vicious than other Poor are, (Debauchery being the Bane of Industry) it will be the easier to put them into a good Method, as a Pattern and Example to the rest of the Nation, by which you may shew forth the more the Christianity of your Faith, by the Vertuous Works that come from it, of which Love and Charity is the Chief. In which You have been very Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in the Worst of Times, and of greatest Sufferings: How have You Relieved and Succoured the Afflicted, not suffering a Beggar among You! By which Love one to another, Your Master and Great Doctor of the Christian Religion, said, <hi>All Men should know such were his Disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47217:3"/>Now a Day of Rest, in a good measure, is upon You, and You more at Liberty to provide for Your Families, than in some of the former Days, in which You could not so well provide for Your Poor, the following Method, I think, will open You a Way of a plentiful Provision for them; and not only them, but for many others; for which may hope You will find Encouragement from the Government, if desire it, to set forward so good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Work for the Publick, as well as to them as shall be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned.</p>
            <p>As a Husbandman hath several sorts of Works, according to the time of the Year and Season; and as you haue Variety of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, you have Variety of Works: A Father expects from a Son or Servant, as they grow in strength, they should increase in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; so doth Your God and Father expect from You an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Honour, upon every Talent He hath given You, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visible or invisible; and that You use it to his Honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its kind.</p>
            <p>I often having thought of the Misery of the Poor of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at the same time have reckoned them the Treasure of it, the Labour of the Poor being the Mines of the Rich, and beyond all that <hi>Spain</hi> is Master of; and many Thoughts have run through me how then it comes that the <hi>Poor</hi> should be such a Burthen, and so miserable, and how it might be prevented; whilst I think it as much more Charity to put the <hi>Poor</hi> in a way to live by honest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, than to maintain them Idle, as it would be to set a Mans broken Leg, that he might go himself, rather than always to carry him.</p>

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT's the Interest of the Rich to take Care of the Poor, and their Education, by which they will take Care of their own Heirs: For as Kingdoms and Nations are subject to Revolutions and Changes, much more (and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commoner) than for private Families to do so; and who knows how soon it may be his own Lot, or his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, to fall poor? Is there any poor now, that some of their Ancestors have not been rich? Or any rich now, that some of their Ancestors have not been poor?</p>
            <p>View the Cities, Towns, and Counties in this Nation, and see what alterations come in two or three Generations in most Families. Were above one in ten of the Men now House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers in <hi>London,</hi> born there? And but few (in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Multitude) that have gone out with Estates: And what better is it with Gentlemens younger Children, and the Eldest also, many times.</p>
            <p>There is Three Things I am at: First, Profit for the Rich, (which will be Life to the rest.) Secondly, A plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Living for the Poor, without difficulty. Thirdly, A good Education for Youth, that may tend to prepare their Souls into the Nature of the good Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47217:4"/>However prevalent Arguments of Charity may be to some, when Profit is joyned with it, it will raise most Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, provide for most People, hold longest, and do most good: For what Sap is to a Tree, that Profit is to all Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by increasing and keeping it alive; so employing the Poor, excells the barren keeping them; in the first, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Poor is no Burthen, (but Advantage) because their Conveniencies increase with them; but in the latter, there is no strength or relief but what they have from others, who possibly may sometimes think they have little enough for themselves.</p>
            <p>As a good and plentiful Living, must be the Poor's Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; so their Increase, the Advantage of the Rich: Without them, they cannot be Rich; for if one had a hundred thousand Acres of Land, and as many Pounds in Money, and as many Cattle, without a Labourer, what would the Rich-Man be, but a Labourer? And as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers make Men rich, so the more Labourers, there will be the more rich Men, (where there is Land to employ and provide for them.) Therefore I think it the Interest of the Rich to encourage the honest Labourers Marrying at full Age; but by the want of it, it seems to me the World is out of Frame, and not understanding its own Interest.</p>
            <p>For is it not strange to consider how industrious the World is, to raise Corn and Cattle, which only serves Men, and how negligent of (or rather careful to hinder) the increase of Men, who are a thousand times better (than Beasts) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to serve God? Do not Men greatly reproach their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as if he had chosen the uselessest part of the Creation to serve him, whilst Men think them the least worth their while to raise?</p>
            <p>But they that provide Food for the Poor, lend to the Lord, who is the best Pay-Master; and if an industrious raising of Corn and Cattle (mean things) is commendable in a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47217:4"/>
Husbandman, how much more is the putting Mankind into a comfortable way of living, which will be instrumental in Gods hand in finishing his Creation (Man being the Head of it) by providing for the increase of their Posterity, which joyned with a good Education, they may prove in the Ages to come, both Good and Great in this World, and as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in the Next: For as Ground that bringeth forth the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Weeds, may by good Culture and Seed, bring forth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Corn, so we may hope as great a Change may be made by good Instruction and Example among the worst of Men, at least of their Stock.</p>
            <p>Therefore how prudent is it to provide a good Education and Employ for the Poor, considering how many, for want of it, comes to be Miserable and Vagabonds, and continue so for many Generations, from Father to Son?</p>
            <p>This Colledge-Fellowship will make Labour, and not Money, the Standard to value all Necessaries by; and tho' Money hath its Conveniencies, in the common way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it being a Pledge among Men for want of Credit; yet not without its Mischiefs; and call'd by our Saviour <hi>The Mammon of Unrighteousness;</hi> most Cheats and Robberies would go but slowly on, if it were not for Money: And when People have their whole Dependance of Trading by Money, if that fails, or is corrupted, they are next door to ruine; and the Poor stand still, because the Rich have no Money to employ them, tho' they have the same Land and Hands to provide Victuals and Cloaths, as ever they had; which is the true Riches of a Nation, and not the Money in it; except we may reckon Beads and Pin-dust so, because we may have Gold at <hi>Guiney</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>Money in the Body Politick, is what a Crutch is to the Natural Body, cripled; but when the Body is sound, the Crutch is but troublesome: So when the particular Interest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47217:5"/>
s made a publick Interest, in such a Colledge Money will be of little Use there.</p>
            <p>Tho' it's not so Natural for the Old and Rich to live with a Common Stock, yet more Natural with the Young and Poor, witness the several Hospitals of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland:</hi> Old People are like Earthen Vessels, not so easily to be new moulded; yet Children are more like Clay out of the Pit, and easie to take any Form they are put into.</p>
            <p>The variety of Tempers, and the idle Expectations of some of the first Workmen, may make the Undertaking difficult; and therefore the more Excellent will be the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And if the <hi>Poor</hi> at first prove brittle, let the <hi>Rich</hi> keep Patience; seven or fourteen years may bring up Young Ones that Life will be more Natural to: And if the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Method, would be a Blessing to the People, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it's worth more than a little Labour to Accomplish it. When by the good Rules thereof may be removed, in great measure, the Prophaneness of Swearing, Drunkenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the Idleness and Penury of many in the Nation; Which evil Qualities of the <hi>Poor,</hi> are an Objection with some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Undertaking, tho' with others a great Reason for it: For the worse they are, the more need of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mend them; and why not by this Method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till a better is offered.</p>

            <p>And that this Computation is not much out of the way, for 200 providing all Necessaries for 300, may appear</p>
            <p>First, From a View of the Nation, where I suppose not above Two Thirds, if One half of the Nation, are Useful Workers; and yet all have a Living.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There will be several Advantages to the Land:<list>
                  <item>1. There will be all the Soil of the Tradesmen, besides the Husbandmans, for improving it.</item>

                  <item>3. Now much Land is Unimproved, to what it might be, because the Landlord or Tenant are not able, or not willing to do it for the other: The Colledge, I conceive, will have neither of them Difficulties.</item>
                  <item>4. All the Mechanicks will be ready at Harvest, to help in with it, in a quarter of the time others do it, which when wet, may be of great Advantage: which change of work, as it will be acceptable to many, so for the health of such as are used to sitting much.</item>

            <p>FIrst, Tho' the Example be put of Renting Land and House at 600 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> the better to shew how the Profit will arise by such an Undertaking, all Charges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted; yet I propose the raising</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By which means the trouble of raising Money to pay Rent, will be saved, and the Founders may have the more Goods from the Colledge, if desired, and the Undertaking will not be so apt to miscarry in its infancy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47217:7"/>Secondly, The Stock to be valued every year, and the Profit to be divided; that such as desire to draw their Profit out, may have it yearly; but such as desire to continue it in the Colledge, may have it added as Principal, and that Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobbing (which will ruine any good thing) may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If any have a mind to sell their Interest, the rest of the Proprietors shall have the Liberty to bring in a Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser by Majority of Votes, at the Value as last cast up.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The first Founders the more the better; and if some of every Useful Trade, the better; and then every Trade will be the better managed, and every Mans Days Work better understood.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, None to Subscribe less then <hi>25l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Every <hi>50l.</hi> to have a Vote in making By-Laws and choosing Officers, but no one to have above Five Votes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Once a Year, Twelve or more of the Proprietors to be chosen a Committee, as Visitors to Inspect, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors for Advice for the Governours and Workmen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to, as there may be occasion.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Governours nor under Officers not to have any Sallary, but only all the Reasonable Conveniences the Colledge can afford them.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Because the whole Success (under the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God) will lye in a Right Beginning (for though an Acorn doth Naturally produce an Oak, yet how many little Accidents may prevents its ever being one? So any Great Undertaking, however Rational and Natural in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, may easily be spoiled) therefore let the Nation be looked through for the First Workmen, if can find but Three or Four in a County (the rest may be Prentices) of good Lives and Tempers, it will be a leven to Influence their Successors, and it will be such a Pattern of Plentiful Living, that many of the Poor will readily submit to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47217:8"/>
Rules to partake of it; and to the Children bred Prentices in the Colledge, it will be their Element.</p>

            <head>Some Advantages to the Founders, and Rich, by such a Colledge.</head>
            <p>FIrst, If the Living in this Affair, will make their own Eyes and Hands their Executors and Overseers, and deposit that now they are Alive, which they intend to give when Dead, it may be that and much more Money saved to themselves and their Heirs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Founders of the Colledge from thence may have for themselves and Families, (in part of their first Cost) Yearly a certain quantity of Woolen and Linnen Cloth, Shooes, Stockings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though the Computation be but 300 in a Colledge; there may be 3000, or more, and such a one may be at</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colchester,</hi> where are made <hi>Bayes</hi> and <hi>Perpetuanoes.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, which Manufacture having One Third more than will be used by the Colledge, it may be Employed,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In being Divided among the Founders.</item>
               <item>2. In Providing for more People in the Colledge, which is best Profit.</item>
               <item>3. In Buying and Improving of Land.</item>
               <item>4. In Building.</item>
               <item>5. In fetching Forreign Commodities.</item>
               <item>6. In Selling for Money, which will be of least use in the Colledge.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fifthly, Any that have Estates in Land or Money, doing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47217:8"/>
the Colledge Business, and Living under the Colledge Rules; may have the Colledge-Allowance, and lay up the Profit of their own Estates.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Any giving <hi>15l.</hi> a Year Land, or <hi>300l.</hi> in Money, to the Colledge, or what other sum may be thought reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able according to the County its in; may have the right of keeping one Person in the Colledge (without Work) with Colledge Allowance, and under Colledge Rules, or but half the Money, and do half the Work, or any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; which is a good Expedient for an Indigent Child, for the Father to buy it a Colledge Commons; Reserving liberty to the Colledge, in case of Exorbitancy, to Expel him the house, Returning his Money, or handing him Colledge-Allowance abroad.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, An Estate Setled thus in a Colledge, is not so lyable to be Lost or Spent, as most other Estates; for if the Heir be simple there is enough of the rest to look after it, and being joyned with good Company, he will not be so ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be a Spend-Thrift; and if he should, the Colledge for his Labour will Entertain him and his Posterity; so that he and his, may reap Benefit from his Fathers Estate, after he hath Spent it; and here a Parent may Entail it upon the Colledge, and then the Heir cannot well Sell it.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Here Peoples Children of Estates may be Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Educated in all Useful Learning, who seeing others Work, at spare times, instead of Playing, would be Learning some Trade, Work not being more Labour than Play; and seeing others Work, to imitate them, would be as much Diversion to the Children as Play, which would the more Inure them to Business when grown up, the want of which hath Ruined many a hopeful Plant, who will be doing, if not of Good, of Evil; an Idle Learning being little better then the Learning of Idleness.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, A Hundred Pound a Year in such a Colledge, I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47217:9"/>
suppose will maintain Ten times as many People as a 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year in Alms-houses, because the Provision and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture raised from a 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year Land, is worth Ten times the Rent, as the Farmer raiseth yearly Three times his Rent, and the Mechanicks makes their Work worth Three or Four times what it was in the Farmers Hands.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Some of the Advantages the Poor Collegians will have.</head>
            <p n="1">1. FRom being Poor they will be made Rich, by enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things needful in Health or Sickness, Single or Married, Wife and Children; and if Parents die, their Children well Educated, and preserved from Misery, and their Marrying incourag'd, which is now generally discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the World now lives, every Man is under a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Care, besides his Bodily Labour, First, To provide for himself and Family. Secondly, To guard against the Intrigues of his Neighbours over-reaching him, both in Buying of, and Selling to him; which in such a Colledge will be reduced to this single Point, of doing only an easie Days Work, and then instead of every bodies endeavouring to get from him, every body is working for him, and they will have more Conveniences in the Colledge than out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the common way of Living and Trade, Men, their Wives or Children often lose half what they get, either by Dear Bargains, Bad Debts, or Law-suits, of which there will be neither in the Colledge; and if the Earth gives but forth its Fruit, and the Workmen do but their parts, they will have plenty; whereas often now the Husbandman and Mechanicks both are ruined, tho' the first have a great Crop,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47217:9"/>
and the second industriously maketh much Manufacture; Money, and not Labour, being made the Standard, the Husbandman paying the same Rent and Wages, as when his Crop yielded double the Price; it being no better with the Mechanicks, where it's not who wants his Commodity, but who can give him Money for it, (will keep him) and so often he must take half the Value in Money another could give him in Labour, that hath no Money.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That as they grow in Years in the Colledge, they shall abate an Hour in a Day of their Work, and when come to Sixty Years old (if Merit prefer them not sooner) they shall be made Overseers, which for ease and pleasant Life, will equal what the Hoards of a private Purse can give; and excel, in so much as it hath less care and danger of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And if we may compute by the Parable of the Sower, that one third of the People lose Heaven by the Cares of this Life, may not a Collegiate way of Living be the occasion of saving Many by preventing them Cares; and for Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Labour, it's a Primitive Constitution of God, it should Earn its Bread in the sweat of its Brows, Labour being as proper for the Bodies Health, as eating is for its living; for what pains a Man saves by Ease, he will find in Disease; and less Labour will provide for a Man in the Colledge than out.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Regular Life in the Colledge, with abatement of Worldly Cares, with an easie honest Labour, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Instructions, may make it a Nursery, and School of Vertue.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Poor thus in a Colledge will be a Community something like the Example of Primitive Christianity, that lived in common, and the Power that did attend it, bespeaks its excellency; but considering the Constitution of Mankind that have Estates (but it's not so with the Poor) it was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47217:10"/>
none of the least Miracles of that Age, and so abated as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracles did.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Colledge thus Constituted cannot so easily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done whatever Changes comes (except the People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed) for if plundred, Twelve Months time will recruit again; like the Grass new Mowed, the next Year supplies again; Labour bringing a supply as the Ground doth, and when together they assist one another, but when scattered are useless, if not preying upon one another.</p>

            <head>A few Rules for Governing the Colledge Workmen.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ALL the Colledges and Hospitals of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> should be visited to see what Rules and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they have for Governing their Societies, that may be useful in this Colledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It should be called a Colledge rather than a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, because a Name more grateful; and besides all sorts of useful Learning may be taught there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Members of the Colledge may be distinguished in Caps and Cloaths, as the Master-workmen from the Prentices, and Women from Girls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A certain number of the Boys and Girls should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed weekly to wait at Table upon the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at Meals, that as much as may be, the Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may live better in the Colledge than any where else.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There should be several Wards.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. For Young Men and Boys.</item>

            <p n="6">

            <p n="7">7. The Men shall be Prentices till Twenty Four Years old, and Women till Twenty One Years, or Marry, (as the Law allows) and then shall have liberty to go out of the Colledge or stay in, and Marry if they will.</p>

            <head>Of the Education of Children, and Teaching them Languages.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THo' Rules, as well as Words, must be understood to make a compleat Scholar, yet considering Words lies in the Memory, and Rules in the Understanding, and that Children have first Memory before Understanding; by that Nature shews Memory is to be first used, and that in the Learning of Language, Words should be first Learned, and afterwards Rules to put them together; Children learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Words of their Mother Tongue, and then Sentences; but to understand what Rules their Language hath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a ripeness of Judgment; and the putting of Rules up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Children before, cripples their Understandings; when Boys of Twelve Years old are as long again at School learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Language by Rules, as a Child of Three Years old without Rules.</p>
            <p>And therefore I think Vocabulary and Dictionary is to be learnt before Accidence and Grammar; and Childrens read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and discoursing one to another, gives a deeper Impression than reading to themselves, we remembring a Man's Voice longer than his Face; a sound upon the Ear penetrating the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47217:11"/>
Spirits, more than a silent Seeing, where the Spirits are not affected with the Subject, as few Children are with their Books.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Four Hours in a Morning, and Four in an Afternoon, is too long to tye a Child to his Book; it's hard for a Man to be tyed upon one Subject so long, much more is it toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to Children, whose Natures are weak, and love change; it hurts their Spirits, makes them out of love with their Books, and loseth much time; the Children might be imployed to more profit; a Labouring-man will hold longer at Work, than a Thinking-man in his Study: Men will grow strong with working, but not with thinking; who have stronger Bodies than Labourers, and weaker Bodies than great Students? Labour adds Oyl to the Lamp of Life, when Thinking Inflames it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where People of Estates are willing to qualifie their Children, with what Learning they will take; or where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appear of ready and pregnant Understandings, it may be worth incouraging to the furthest degree; yet beyond Reading and Writing, further Learning will not be so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to most among us as among other People, whilst many of them expect to get their Living by it, as Priests, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Tho' Learning may be useful, yet a Vertuous Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tends more to Happiness here and hereafter; and what is a great Impediment in the common Education, is the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Children imploy themselves without Directions, which is a loss several ways, First, To their Bodies and present Condition. Secondly, To their Spirits and future Being; for at Four or Five Years old, besides Reading, Boys and Girls might be taught to Knit and Spin, and bigger Boys Turning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and beginning Young they would make the best Artists; and being upon Business, tho' slight, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves their Reasons by sensible Demonstration, (which is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47217:11"/>
sooner learn'd than any Rational Demonstration without it; as a Child at three years old by Feeling knows Fire will burn, much better than one of Thirteen from the most Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Discourse without Feeling) whereas a childish silly Employ, leaves their Minds silly. And the Will being the greatest Enemy a Man hath, when it is not subject to the Will of God; How valuable is it then, for a Child's Will to be kept under anothers Direction than its own? It will be the less difficult to submit it to the Will of God, when grown a Man, especially if seasoned with Religious Lessons of Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the hand employ'd brings Profit, the Reason used in it makes wise, and the Will subdued makes them good.</p>
            <p>For tho' Men should be guided more by Reason than Sense, yet Children are guided more by Sense than Reason; and therefore must be hedged from Evil more by wise Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement than Discourse; as we see Colts are tamed more by it than words.</p>
            <p>All which considered, there is less wonder any prove Ill; but that any prove good, from such an Idle Education as the common Breeding of Children, where the Mind is at leisure to receive all the evil Impressions their several Ages are capable of.</p>
            <p>A good Education, tho' with but a little Estate, makes a happier Man, than a great Estate without it; for the first not only supports the Name of his Family, but raiseth a Name and Family to himself; whereas the latter, many times the more Rich, the more VVicked; and only pleased when at once he is making an End of Body, Estate, and Name together.</p>
            <p>Such Parents as have also a sence of a Future State, and the Happiness or Unhappiness their Children are capable of, will think there is no comparison between a Good and an Evil Education.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47217:12"/>And I think such a Colledge-Education, under good Rules, beyond any Private one, having several Advantages the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate will want.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There will be all sorts of Employs and Tools for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age and Capacity to be employed with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Languages and Learning may be learn'd there, by having some of all Nations (Tradesmen) who may teach their Mother Tongue to the Youth, as they teach it their own Children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men and Children submit easier to Rules and Laws they see others submit to as well as themselves, than if they were alone; as Children in a School, and Soldiers in an Army, are more regular, and in subjection, than when scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered asunder.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They will be more under the Eye-sight of one Master or another, than in a private Family; and consequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of more Folly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Company being the delight of all Creatures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men or Beast, and the World being so corrupted, makes its Company a great Snare to Youth; but the Colledge ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving company sufficient, will prevent the Temptation of going abroad; and being well govern'd, will much prevent the Evils that are learn'd abroad.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There may be a Library of Books, a Physick-Garden for understanding of Herbs, and a Laboratory for preparing of Medicines.</p>
            <p>And tho' Ships and Boats cann't swim in the Colledge, the Men that manage them may be of the Colledge-Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and have their Conveniencies thence, as well as return their Profit or <hi>Cargoes</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>In short, As it may be an Epitomy of the World, by a Collection of all the useful Trades in it; so it may afford all the Conveniencies and Comforts a Man can want, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian use.</p>

            <head>Answers to several Objections.</head>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>THo' the Work be very Good and Excellent, if it could be Accomplished, yet there will be so much Difficulty, Laebour and Care, in the doing it, there will not be found Men that will undertake the Toil of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This Objection would have prevented any good Work, if Difficulty would have prevented the doing it.</p>
            <p>2. If the Act be but good, we may hope God will raise Instruments; for tho' some Men have taken up a Rest in their Estates, and seek only a Provision and Diversions in it for their own Families, yet there is many have a touch of a more Universal Love.</p>
            <p>3. Tho' it would be Toilsome for any one Man, or a few, yet 'tis easily done by a greater Number; as one Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and ten Men must strain, to lift a Tun weight, yet one hundred Men can do it only by the strength of a Finger of each of them.</p>
            <p>4. As this will be a greater Charity than most Gifts, by the great good it will do to the Poor, so it will be as certain Profit to the Founders as most Trades, and consequently worth some of their time, as well as any other Trade.</p>
            <p>5. If evil men corrupt and debauch their fellow Creatures by the Influence and Opportunities their Estates give them; Is there not the greatest Reason &amp; Prudence for good Men to place their Estates, at least some of it, so as it may influence many to Vertue, especially when it will bring Profit with it.</p>
            <p>And whether some may not be raised to an Estate, (as Queen <hi>Hester</hi> was to a Crown) for to be Instruments in such a work; and then will it not add to the difficulty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up their account at the last day, if they neglect so great an Opportunity of doing Good, when it was in their hands?</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>The Times being troublesome, and Trade dull, it's not seasonable to set such a thing a foot; and if we should have the Calamity of War, (or any other) among us, the Undertaking would be Ruined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47217:13"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is the chiefest time when Trading's dull, because now the Poor cannot so easily get work, they will the readier accept of new Masters and Terms; whereas when Trade comes quick, the best VVorkmen will be fix'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rheir Old Masters, and only the worser sort want work.</p>
            <p>2. If Calamities should come of any sort, the Poor in a Body would subsist better than if single; because when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, their Labour would provide Conveniencies one for another, which single Persons could do little at.</p>
            <p>3. VVhatever Calamities would ruine a Colledge, will much easier ruine single Persons; and therefore if danger of losing all, its best for the Rich to do some good whilst they have it; for if they should lose their Estates, it would be out of their power to do it. And besides if the Poor be put in a good Method, they may be able to help their old Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, when the Rich may have nothing to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor cannot work for want of use.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>But if there should happen a Scarcity or Famine in the Land, how will the People be provided for then?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If more vertuous than the rest of the Nation, they may hope to scape better, but not else.</p>
            <p>2. But as there is hopes, by good Orders, of a more Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous way of living in the Colledge than elsewhere, so by more Wisdom, of better Provision in a Scarcity, by Stores laid up. For the Nation is commonly sick of a great Plenty, that if Corn is cheap, care not where they send it away for Money, tho they may want it next year.</p>
            <p>3. But the Colledge, not wanting Money, will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Temptation of Selling it, nor extravagantly wasting it, but will keep it till they may want it at home. And there hath seldom been any years of Scarcity, but years of Plenty have been first.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. <hi>Why propose to get by the Poor's Labour, and not let them have all the Profit, and then will need raise less Money, as</hi> 1500 l. <hi>instead of</hi> 15000 l.?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47217:13"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because the Rich have no otherway of living, but by the Labour of others; as the Landlord by the Labour of his Tenants, and the Merchants and Tradesmen by the Labour of the Mechanicks.</p>
            <p>2. A thousand pound is easier raised where there is Profit, than one hundred pound only upon Charity; People readily employing all their Estates where there is Profit, when they will not give a Tenth of it to the Poor.</p>
            <p>3. The more valuable the Fund, and the more Men is concerned in it, the better will it be looked after, and the more People will be provided for.</p>
            <p>4. T'is not proposed only for Relieving the Poor, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so how the Rich may employ their Estates with Profit to themselves, and prevent any from being poor; a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able living in the Colledge to the Industrious Labourer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rich Mans Debt, and not their Charity to them; Labour giving the Labourer as good a Right to a living there, as the Rich Mens Estates do them.</p>
            <p>5. This Method is a greater Security to the Poor (than the common way of living) who here must be provided for, according to the constitution of the Colledge-Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rich can have any thing; the Rich being only to have what the Colledge don't spend. Whereas the Poor now are at great uncertainty, (at least difficulty) of getting a living, because the Tradesmen are endeavouring to get one from another what they can; so they are all straining the Necessity of the Mechanick, not regarding how little he gets, but to get as much as they can for themselves.</p>
            <p>6. Considering it's either by Losses, or being out-witted and cheated, or the Idleness and Extravagancy of the Poor, that makes most want Charity from others: If by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge-Rules may be removed these four Evils, few will then want the Gift of Charity?</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>If take not in Aged and Decriped People into this Colledge; what Charity, to take in People that can live out of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47217:14"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> All Living Growing Bodies, whether Natural or Politick, must be Suckled and Nurst before come to their Strength; for how Helpless or Useless is the Body of Man new Born, and how much Tendence do they want, that with good looking after grow in time to be Strong Men, and not only able to serve themselves, but their Parents that Bred them?</p>
            <p>So this Body Politick of the Colledge, by the many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties at first it will meet with, must only take in Useful hands to Strengthen and Support it, that in time may grow to be able to bear all the <hi>Poor</hi> could reasonably be put upon it.</p>
            <p>Object. 6. <hi>May it be supposed, That any that can get more than will keep them, will come work in the Colledge only for Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and Cloaths?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Suppose not; but besides their own keeping, there is laid up in the Colledge Stores, sufficient for their Young Children, as born.</p>
            <p>2. For themselves when Sick or Aged, and better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for than most Mechanicks.</p>
            <p>3. If they Dye, and leave Wife and Young Children, they will be kept from Misery, added to the Uncertainty of a Mans Life, whether he may Live to make so good a Provision for his Wife and Children as the Colledge.</p>
            <p>4. But where good Workmen at first are not to be had otherwise, they may be allowed some Wages to Instruct the Youth.</p>
            <p>5. What they get more than their Task, will be their own, and if can get enough, may put it into the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if they will.</p>
            <p>6. The Advantage from the Prentices will be Sufficient to the Founders, if no more.</p>
            <p>7. Though some young men may be in hopes of better preferment, yet not all; and also many that have tried the world, and find the difficulty of living in it, would be glad of so certain a Provision as the Colledge. The vanity of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47217:14"/>
Beggar doth not attend all Poor, who when an English Merchant would have taken her Son and provided for him, refused his offer, saying, <hi>Her Son might come to be King of Spain for ought she knew, and therefore should not be his Servant:</hi> For tho' some Poor get Estates, how many more become miserable?</p>
            <p>Object. 7. <hi>The People will not bear the Confinement of the Colledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Neither would the Poor work, if there were not greater Inconveniencies; that is, Starving, or Robbing, and that's hanging.</p>
            <p>2. The Confinement will not be more, if so much, as the best govern'd Prentices are under in <hi>London,</hi> and many other places.</p>
            <p>3. It's not intended the Confinement should be more than's absolutely needful for the good Government of the Colledge.</p>
            <p>4. I suppose the Plenty and Conveniencies in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will sufficiently allay the hardness of the Colledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Rules.</p>
            <p>Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>Why the Name Colledge, and not a Community, or Workhouse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A Workhouse bespeaks too much of Servitude, for People of Estates to send their Children for Education; and too much of <hi>Bridewel,</hi> for honest Tradesmen to like it; and the Name <hi>Community</hi> implies a greater Unity in Spirit, than Colledge doth; and therefore not so proper to be used to such a mixt multitude of Men and Boys; the word <hi>Colledge</hi> more relates to an outward Fellowship than an inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and therefore better suits the Subject.</p>
            <p>Object. 9. <hi>What Reason is there for a Difference in Apparel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Apparel mentioned in the Proposals, is not meant any Religious or Scholastick Habit, but only such as may keep the Men and Boys from a Level, and to distinguish their different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; as well as good Husbandry: For what Master will cloath his Servant as himself?</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:47217:15"/>
            <p>Object. 10. <hi>There have been several Manufactures set a Foot at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, and many of them have not turned to Profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans</hi> 1. If a man have never so much Clothing and no Food, he may dye with hunger, which is the Case of several Manufactures. The Raisers of Food are so far scattered asunder from the Manufactures, that it's endless to seek their Custom.</p>
            <p>2. To sell it to Shop keepers it must be cheap, because they must be kept out of it, if not raise Estates; which will leave little Profit to the Undertakers, if not starve the Workmen.</p>
            <p>3. Stock jobbing hath helped to ruine some of them; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever well laid the first Undertaking might be, and understood by the first Undertakers, yet being bid beyond the real worth, by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Brokers for foolish Buyers, the first Beginners s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
