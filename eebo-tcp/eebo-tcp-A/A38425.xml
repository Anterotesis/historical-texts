         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Deſign of the Papiſts in this PLOT was, to put it off themſelves, and lay it upon the Presbyterians: making them the Deſigners of the Change of Government, and the Murderers of his Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <l>EXperience ſhews whilſt <hi>Godfrey</hi> lived here,</l>
            <l>No formidable PLOT durſt 'ere appear,</l>
            <l>But what was quel'd as ſoon as well begun,</l>
            <l>And made apparent unto every one,</l>
            <l>In ſuch clear Demonſtration, that 'tis plain</l>
            <l>He was the Coach-man to great <hi>Charles his Wain.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And ſafely did ſecure from Popiſh Plots</l>
            <l>All poor diſtreſſed threatned <hi>Hugonots:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Since whoſe inhumane Murder, Our great God</l>
            <l>Hath rais'd our Foes, full, as ſevere a Rod;</l>
            <l>A man whoſe ſharp prodig'ous piercing Eye,</l>
            <l>Can plainly ſee their utmoſt Treachery.</l>
            <l>And knows full well with ſuch great Knaves to deal,</l>
            <l>Witneſs the Papers found in Tubs of Meal.</l>
            <l>That <hi>Roman</hi> ſcarlet <hi>Whore,</hi> he now will maul her,</l>
            <l>This we expect from good S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Waller.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>A PLOT contriv'd 'gainſt <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Blood,</l>

            <l>This is a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Devil of a <hi>PLOT.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But thanks to GOD, ô KING, and <hi>Wallers</hi> care,</l>
            <l>Their hidden Engines now diſcovered are,</l>
            <l>For what they on this City would have lay'd,</l>
            <l>Is by his Circumſpection betrayed;</l>
            <l>GOD'S Providence, and <hi>Wallers</hi> ſtudious care</l>

            <l>And ſhews their Plot's of ſo deform'd a hew,</l>
            <l>As none dare own, but the bold <hi>Roman</hi> Crew.</l>
            <l>Who neither fear their GOD, Honour their KING,</l>
            <l>Their <hi>Romiſh</hi> Principles teach no ſuch thing,</l>
            <l>Slaughter and Murder are the only Books,</l>
            <l>In which each <hi>Romaniſt</hi> devoutly looks,</l>
            <l>And nothing is by them more underſtood</l>
            <l>Than ſhedding <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (though <hi>Princely</hi>) Blood.</l>
            <l>Though thanks to God their <hi>Deviliſh Romiſh</hi> Sport</l>
            <l>Hath not as yet prevail'd upon the Court:</l>
            <l>All Sovereign Princes are e'n Sacred things,</l>
            <l>Tis Dang'rous medling with the Thrones of Kings.</l>
            <l>And we ſtill hope, whilſt <hi>Waller</hi> lives we may</l>
            <l>Find out thoſe Drifts deſigned to betray</l>
            <l>Both KING and Kingdom, I, and Nation too,</l>
            <l>At one Blood-thirſty and revengeful Blow.</l>
            <l>And not inferior is great LONDON'S Mayer,</l>
            <l>Who to detect the ſame took no leſs Care,</l>
            <lg>
               <l>When once the 'Curſt Diſcovery began,</l>
               <l>And his great Wiſdom did each Matter ſcan,</l>
               <l>Nothing like this e'r reach'd the Heart of Man.</l>
            </lg>
            <l>It did appear ſo foul, none preſent knew</l>
            <l>How to believe the things, there ſworn were true;</l>
            <l>Until their <hi>Dangerfield</hi> declared, He</l>

            <lg>
               <l>All that remains is only fervent Pray'r</l>
               <l>For his Majeſties proſperous well-fare,</l>

            </lg>
            <l>We praiſe our God, though <hi>Papiſts</hi> did deſign</l>
            <l>On <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to caſt this Diſmal Crime.</l>
            <l>So good hath our GOD been, to turn the Story</l>

            </l>
            <l>Let therefore ENGLAND now once more rebound</l>

            <l>In Memory of his Great Mercy ſhown,</l>
