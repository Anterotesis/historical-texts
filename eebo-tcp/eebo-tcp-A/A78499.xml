            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Certain <hi>Quaeres,</hi> which are deſired may bee ſpeedily Anſwered by the <hi>Common-Councell,</hi> and <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> for the ſatisfaction of the Citizens and other Jnhabitants of the ſaid City, concerning their own, and the Cities ſafety, againſt all Oppoſers of the Publique Peace and Happineſſe of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. TO What end ſo many Souldiers have been privatly Lifted by Major-Generall <hi>Skippon,</hi> before he had Authority for it? And why the City ſhould not have a Major-Generall who hath a viſible eſtate within the City, that will be cordially faithfull in defence thereof upon all of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions? And act nothing in Military-matters, without approbation of the Common-Councell and Militia.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In caſe an enemy without or within the Citie ſhould Act in a hoſtile way, againſt it: what Armes or Amunition are in readineſſe, to make reſiſtance?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the Citie bee in a ſufficient poſture of defence to withſtand any ſuch Enemie; and whether there bee faithfull and valiant Commanders, and Officers, elected in all the Regiments of the, <hi>Train'd Bands,</hi> and <hi>Auxiliaries,</hi> whom the Soldiers will willingly adhere to, upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How the Citie is furniſhed with victualls, to hold out, if it ſhould bee Beſieged: And what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made to quench ſuddaine Fires, if any attempt ſhould bee made in that kinde?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Why thoſe Aldermen, and Common-Councell men, ſhould not bee made uncapable of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with any Councell of the City; and that ſuch Commanders ſhould not bee diſplaced, who either hold Intelligence with the Army; or have beene in the Leaguer before <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> not being ſent by the Common Councell, or Militia, or that have beene Actors in, or abettors of the laſt petition; which was not ſent from the Common Councell; ſeeing there was an Order of both Houſes of Parliament, <hi>That no Petition ſhould bee preſented unto them, without conſent of the Common-Councell;</hi> or any ſuch as either have beene, are, or ſhall bee known to frequent either or both houſes of Parliament, or <hi>Darby</hi> Houſe to diſcover the ſecrets of the Common Councell, or the Militia of <hi>London?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Why the Perſonall Treaty with his Majeſty in <hi>London,</hi> ſhould not be preſſed ſpeedily to goe on ſeeing the Committee of the City have given ſatisfactory Anſwers to the objections made by the Committee of Parliament againſt their laſt Petition, concerning the ſaid Treaty; which are confirmed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell, and approved of by the ſubſcriptions of ſo many thouſands? Or whether the Tenet of <hi>Darby</hi> houſe ſhall bee verified, <hi>viz. That the Citie and Common-Councell of</hi> London, <hi>are hot in their propoſitions at firſt: but if they bee let alone they will coole by degrees.</hi> Which if they doe in this caſe of the Treaty; another Quaere will neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether the Citie will not bee the object of ſcorne to the whole Kingdome, and the Nations round about, and incurre the farther juſt diſpleaſure of his Majeſty, and his Poſterity, and conſequently bee the Cauſe of their owne ruine and deſtruction, without the Aid or Pitty of any?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Why thoſe Common-Councell-men and Commanders ſhould not be queſtioned and diſplaced; who have not either called the Inhabitants within their reſpective Precincts and Commands, or have not gone from houſe to houſe, to receive their Concurrence to the late engagement, by ſubſcription of their names, according to the Order of Common-Councell: Dated <hi>Iuly</hi> 12. 1648.</p>
            <p>It is deſired, againe and againe, That theſe Quaeres bee taken into ſpeedie and ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, it is to bee feared that if our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> were converſant on earth; at this time, he would weepe and ſay to this City, as once hee did to <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
