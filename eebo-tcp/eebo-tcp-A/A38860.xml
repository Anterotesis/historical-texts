            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>William Hone,</hi> who was yesterday Arraigned being set to the Bar, &amp; the Indictment read, desired that the Plea which he tendred yes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday might be accepted, which was that he was guilty of conspire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of the King, but not guilty of providing Arms, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of raising a Rebellion; Sr. <hi>George Gefferyes</hi> said the confession was not directly to the Indictment; therefore they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to give their Evidence, he pleading not guilty as to the whole Indictment, the <hi>Jury</hi> was then sworn, being the same that passed the day before, Between the King and Capt. <hi>Walcot,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>West</hi> was first Sworn, who Witnessed that the 2d. of <hi>March 25, Caroli Secondi,</hi> at the Parish of St. <hi>Michael Bishshaw</hi> in the Ward of <hi>Bishshaw</hi> in the City of <hi>London,</hi> with <hi>Rumbold Burton, Ferguson, Holliway, Roe, Francis Goodenough,</hi> and <hi>Richard Goodenough,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther false Traytors, he Conspier'd the Death of the King, and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> to Subvert the Government, and alter the Religion both in Church and State, and the Prisoner was one of the persons to be Employed in that wicked Act.</p>

            <p>Then the <hi>Lord Russell</hi> was brought in his Coach into the yard, being attended by the <hi>Livetenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower.</hi> Being brought into Court before the Bar, the Indictment was read, that with <hi>Iames Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth, Ford</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sr. <hi>Thomas Armstrong,</hi> and <hi>Robert Ferguson,</hi> conspired the death of the King, the Raising Arms to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Goverment, to alter the Religeon &amp;c. He pleaded not guilty, and desired that the Tryal may be put of for a longer time, but being told that the Kings Councel insisted on it now, the Court could not put it it off. He then desired a coppy of the Pannel of the <hi>Iury'</hi> which was told him was matter of favour but such as was never denyed, and that it was alwayes ready for him. And being duly Examined, it appeared that he had a List of all the <hi>Iuries</hi> that were returned five or six dayes since. Then they proceeded to call the <hi>Iury</hi> to be Sworn. <hi>Iohn Martin,</hi> being called' The <hi>Lord Russell,</hi> asked him if he had any Free-Hold in <hi>London,</hi> he answered no. Then he Challenged him, for that cause, and desired that <hi>Council</hi> might be allowed him, which was grantd; (Viz.) Mr. <hi>Pollexfen'</hi> Mr. <hi>Holt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ward'</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing: Argued very Streamously, that the Statutes concerning Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls in <hi>London,</hi> by such as are not Free-Holders extended not to crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all causes, but in only Civill. But it was answered by the <hi>Attorney Generall,</hi> and Sr. <hi>George Gefferys,</hi> and Answered by the whole Court, that Satutes extend to both cases, and it was lately so resolved in the case of Worcester. Then the <hi>Iury</hi> was Sworn he Challenging Thirty two. Mr. <hi>Roger North</hi> opened the Indictment Sr. <hi>Georg Geffery</hi> casting the Evidence</p>

Collonal <hi>Rumsey</hi> was Sworn, witnessed that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> told him, that the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> and several others were met in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult about an Insurrection; and that he should go to them to know what Readiness they were in for it, who returned Answer, that they were not yet ready, being failed of their Expectations in the West-County, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> at <hi>Taunton,</hi> therefore they defer'd it untill the 17th. of <hi>November,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeths Birth Day.</hi> Then the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> asked if he spoke any thing, or conscented to the Answer, and Collonal <hi>Rumsey</hi> said yes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> Sworn, witnessed that he being a Vintner <hi>Ferguson</hi> came to his house, and told him that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> were coming to his House, which in a short time they did, privately in Hackney Coaches, and being come, desired to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private, and that none be permitted to come into the Room, all the Servants being sent away, he himself waited on them.

            <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Escreek</hi> then was Sworn, who made a very large Speech, as to the Plot, or Conspiering in the General, that the Lord <hi>Shafesbury</hi> contrived it, and sent <hi>Rumsey</hi> to the Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and several others, to know what readdiness they were in, for an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and what Resolution they come to, relateing to <hi>Taunton</hi> that their answer was, they were failed in the <hi>West,</hi> and that they had always told him they could not be ready at that time, but defer'd it untill the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
