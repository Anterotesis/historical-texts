         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HAving receiv'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Your Majesty's
Commands to Translate the
History of the <hi>League,</hi> I have
apply'd my self with my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
diligence to Obey them:
First by a thorough understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of my Authour, in which
I was assisted by my former
knowledge of the <hi>French</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
in general, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of those very Transactions,
which he has so Faithfully and
<pb facs="tcp:42159:5"/>
Judiciously related: Then by
giving his Thoughts the same
Beauty in our Language which
they had in the Original; and
which I most of all endeavour'd,
the same force and perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
Both of which I hope I
have perform'd with some
Exactness, and without any
Considerable Mistake. But of
this Your Majesty is the truest
Judge, who are so great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Original, and who
having read this piece when
it first was publish'd, can easily
find out my Failings, but to
my Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ort can more easily
forgive them: I confess I cou'd
never have laid hold on that
Vertue of Your Royal Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
at a more unseasonable
time; when your Enemies have
so far abus'd it, that Pardons
<pb facs="tcp:42159:5"/>
are grown dangerous to Your
Safety, and consequently to
the Welfare of Your Loyal
Subjects: But frequent forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is their Encouragement,
they have the Sanctuary in
their Eye before they attempt
the Crime, and take all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Security, either not to
need a Pardon, if they strike the
Blow, or to have it granted if
they fail: Upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Your Majesty is not upon
equal Terms with them, You
are still forgiving, and they
still designing against Your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Life; Your principle is
Mercy, theirs inveterate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
when one onely Wards,
and the other Strikes, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is sad on the defensive
side. <hi>Hercules</hi> as the Poets tell
us had no advantage on <hi>Anteus</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42159:6"/>
by his often throwing him on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he ground: for he laid him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nely in his Mothers Lap, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n effect was but doubling his
Strength to renew the Combat.
These Sons of Earth are never
to be trusted in their Mother
Element: They must be hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
into the Air and Strangled.
If the Experiment of Clemency
were new, if it had not been
often try'd without Effect, or
rather with Effects quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the intentions of Your
Goodness, your Loyal Subjects
are generous enough to pity
their Countrey-men, though
Offenders: But when that pity
has been always found to draw
into example of greater Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs;
when they continually
behold both Your Majesty and
themselves expos'd to Dangers,
<pb facs="tcp:42159:6"/>
the Church, the Government,
the Succession still threatned,
Ingratitude so far from being
Converted by gentle means,
that it is turn'd at last into the
nature of the damn'd, desirous
of Revenge, and harden'd in
Impenitence; 'Tis time at
length, for self preservation to
cry out for Justice, and to lay
by Mildness when it ceases to
be a Vertue. Almighty God
has hitherto Miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
You; but who knows
how long the Miracle will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue?
His Ordinary Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are by second Causes, and
then Reason will conclude that
to be preserv'd, we ought to
use the lawfull means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
If on the other
side it be thus Argu'd, that
of many Attempts one may
<pb facs="tcp:42159:7"/>
possibly take place, if preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Justice be not employ'd
against Offenders; What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
but that we implore the
Divine Assistance to Avert that
Judgment: which is no more
than to desire of God to work
another, and another, and in
Conclusion a whole <hi>Series</hi> of
Miracles. This, Sir, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
voice of all true <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
I might call it the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Address of three Nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
solicitous of Your Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which includes their own
Prosperity. 'Tis indeed an high
presumption for a man so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
as I am to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it, but Zeal, and dutifull
Affection in an Affair of this
Importance, will make every
good Subject a Counsellor:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Tis (in my Opinion) the Test
<pb facs="tcp:42159:7"/>
of Loyalty, and to be either a
Friend or Foe to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
needs no other distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
than to declare at this
time, either for Remisness, or
Justice. I said at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I look not on the Storm
as Overblown. 'Tis still a gusty
kind of Weather: there is a
kind of Sickness in the Air; it
seems indeed to be clear'd up
for some few hours; but the
Wind still blowing from the
same Corner; and when new
matter is gather'd into a body,
it will not fail to bring it round
and pour upon us a second
Tempest. I shall be glad to
be found a false Prophet; but
he was certainly Inspir'd, who
when he saw a little Cloud ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the Sea, and that no
bigger than a hand, gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb facs="tcp:42159:8"/>
notice to the King,
that he might mount the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
before he was overtaken
by the Storm. If so much
Care was taken of an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
King, an Usurper, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour,
and a Tyrant, how
much more vigilant ought we
to be in the Concernments of
a Lawfull Prince, a Father of
his Countrey, and a Defender
of the Faith, who stands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by his too much Mercy
to the unwearied and endless
Conspiracies of Paricides? He
was a better Prince than the
former whom I mention'd out
of the Sacred History, and the
Allusion comes yet more close,
who stopp'd his hand after
the third Arrow: Three Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were indeed obtain'd, but
the effect of often shooting had
<pb facs="tcp:42159:8"/>
been the total Destruction of
his Enemies. To come yet
nearer, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, Your
Royal Grandfather, whose Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
and the Subversion of
the <hi>League,</hi> are the main Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of this History, was a
Prince most Clement in his
Nature, he forgave his Rebels,
and receiv'd them all into
Mercy, and some of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Favour, but it was not till
he had fully vanquish'd them:
they were sensible of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
they submitted, and his
Clemency was not extorted
from him, it was his Free-gift,
and it was seasonably given.
I wish the Case were here the
same, I confess it was not much
unlike it at Your Majesty's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Restauration, yet so much
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f the parallel was then want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:42159:9"/>
that the Amnesty you
gave, produc'd not all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
Effects. For our Sects,
are of a more obstinate Nature
than were those <hi>Leaguing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,</hi>
who were always for
a King, and yet more, the
<hi>major</hi> part of them wou'd have
him of the Royal Stem: But
our <hi>Associators</hi> and Sectaries are
men of Commonwealth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and though their first
stroke was onely aim'd at the
immediate Succession, it was
most manifest that it wou'd not
there have ended; for at the
same time they were hewing
at your Royal Prerogatives:
So that the next Successor, if
there had been any, must
have been a precarious Prince,
and depended on them for the
necessaries of Life. But of these
<pb facs="tcp:42159:9"/>
and more Outragious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
your Majesty has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn your self justly
sensible in Your Declaration,
after the Dissolution of the last
Parliament, which put an end
to the Arbitrary Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Popular Faction:
Since which time it has pleas'd
Almighty God so to prosper
Your Affairs, that without
searching into the secrets of
Divine Providence, 'tis evident
Your Magnanimity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
next under him, have
been the immediate Cause of
Your Safety and our present
Happiness. By weathering of
which Storm, may I presume
to say it without Flattery, You
have perform'd a Greater and
more Glorious work than all
the Conquests of Your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
<pb facs="tcp:42159:10"/>
For 'tis not difficult fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
a Great Monarchy well united,
and making use of Advantages,
to extend its Limits; but to
be press'd with wants, surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with dangers, Your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
undermined in Popular
Assemblies, Your Sacred Life
attempted by a Conspiracy,
Your Royal Brother forc'd
from Your Arms, in one word
to Govern a Kingdom which
was either possess'd, or turn'd
into a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and yet in the
midst of ruine to stand firm,
undaunted, and resolv'd, and
at last to break through all
these difficulties, and dispell
them, this is indeed an Action
which is worthy the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all this violence of Your
Enemies Your Majesty has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

themselves will acknowledge
that You have not urg'd the
Law against them, but have
been press'd and constrain'd by
it to inflict punishments in Your
own defence, and in the mean

them to the roots, if these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous

it will be a sad Comfort to say
they have been ungratefull,
when 'tis Evident to Mankind
that Ingratitude is their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
That sort of pity which
is proper for them, and may
be of use to their Conversion
is to make them sensible of

was rais'd in it by two fatal
Leagues of Rebels: the one in
the middle, and the other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:42159:14"/>
the latter end of the last
Age.</p>
                  <p>Heresie produc'd the first, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the true Religion: Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
under the Masque of Zeal
gave birth to the second, with
pretence of maintaining what
the other wou'd have ruin'd: and
both of them, though implacable
Enemies to each other, yet agreed
in this, that each of them at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times, set up the Standard
of Rebellion against our Kings.</p>
                  <p>The crimes of the former I have
set forth in the History of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinism,
which made that impious
<hi>League</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> against the
Lord and his Anointed; and I
discover the Wickedness of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in this Work, which I present
to your Majesty, as the fruit of
my exact Obedience to those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
with which you have been
<pb facs="tcp:42159:14"/>
pleas'd to honour me. I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to perform them, with so
much the greater satisfaction to
my self, because I believ'd that in
reading this History, the falsehood
of some advantages which the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> and <hi>Huguenots</hi> have
ascrib'd to themselves, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discern'd. These by boasting
as they frequently do, even at this
day, that they set the Crown on
the Head of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth; those that their <hi>League</hi>
was the cause of his conversion.
I hope the world will soon be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus'd
of those mistakes; and
that it will be clearly seen, that
they were the <hi>Catholiques</hi> of the
Royal Party, who next under
God, produc'd those two effects,
so advantageous to <hi>France.</hi> We
are owing for neither of them
to those two unhappy <hi>Leagues,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42159:15"/>
which were the most dangerous
Enemies to the prosperity of the
Kingdom: And 'tis manifest at
this present time, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of triumphing over both of
them, was reserv'd by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, to our Kings
of the Imperial Stem of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth subdued and
reduc'd the <hi>League</hi> of the false
Zealots, by the invincible Force
of his Arms, and by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
attractions of his Clemency;
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Iust disarm'd that
of the <hi>Calvinists</hi> by the taking
of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and other places,
which those Heretiques had moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into a kind of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
And <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great,
without employing other Arms

<pb facs="tcp:42159:15"/>
and incomparable Zeal
for the Conversion of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>

it to that low condition, that
we have reason to believe, we
shall behold its ruine, by the
repentance of those, who being
deluded and held back by their

erroneous belief, rather through
ignorance than malice. And
this is it, which when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd

            <head>THE
AUTHOUR'S
Advertisement to the
READER.</head>
            <p>SInce perhaps there are some, who
may think themselves concern'd
in this History, because they are the
Grand-children or Descendants of those
who are here mention'd, I desire them
to consider, that Writing like a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Historian, I am oblig'd sincerely
to relate either the good or ill, which
they have done. If they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
offended, they must take their
satisfaction on those who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
the Laws of History: let them
give an account of their own rules;
for Historians are indispensably bound
to follow them; and the sum of our
<pb facs="tcp:42159:18"/>
reputation consists in a punctual exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of their orders.</p>
            <p>Thus as I pretend not to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
their thanks in speaking well of
their Relations, so I may reasonably
conclude, that they ought not to wish
me ill, when I say what is not much
to their advantage. I faithfully relate,
what I find written in good Authours,
or in particular Memories, which I
take for good, after I have throughly
examin'd them.</p>
            <p>I do yet more; for considering that
no man is bound to believe, when I
say in general that I have had the use
of good Manuscripts, on whose credit
I give you what is not otherwhere to
be had; I sincerely and particularly
point out the originals from whence I
drew these truths; and am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
that every Historian, who
hopes to gain the belief of his Reader,
ought to transact in the same manner.
For if there were no more to be done,
than barely to say, I have found such
or such an extraordinary passag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in
an authentique Manuscript, without
giving a more particular account of
it under pretence of being bound to
<pb facs="tcp:42159:18"/>
Secrecy, there is no kind of Fable
which by this means might not be
slurr'd upon the Reader for a truth.
An Authour might tell many a lusty
lye, but a Reader, who were not a
very credulous fool, or a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant
Gentleman, wou'd have a
care of believing him. 'Tis for this
reason that I have always mark'd in
my margents, the Books, Relations,
and Memoires, whether Printed or
Manuscripts, from whence I take the
substance of my Relations.</p>
            <p>One of those Writers, of whom I
have made most use, is Monsieur <hi>Peter
Victor Cayet;</hi> in his Nine years Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
containing the History of the
Wars of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. Because
he having always follow'd that Prince,
since he was plac'd in his service to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Monsieur <hi>de la Gaucherie</hi>
(who was his Preceptor) 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
probable, that he was better
inform'd of the passages of those
times, of which he was an eye witness,
than others who had not that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>For what else concerns him, he
was one of the most Learned and
<pb facs="tcp:42159:19"/>
able Ministers which our <hi>Protestants</hi>
have ever had: and in that quality
serv'd Madam <hi>Catharine</hi> the King's
Sister, till about two years after the
Conversion of that great Prince, he
acknowledg'd the true <hi>Catholique</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and made his Solemn abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Heresie at <hi>Paris.</hi> He also
publish'd the motives of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
in a Learned Treatise, which
was receiv'd with great applause both
in <hi>France</hi> and in Foreign Countries;
and his example, fortifi'd with the
strong reasons of a man so able as he
was, to which no solid answer was
ever given, was immediately follow'd
by the Conversion of a great number
of <hi>Protestants,</hi> who by his means
came to understand the falshood
of their Religion pretendedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
            <p>This action so infinitely netled his
former Brotherhood of Ministers, that
they grew outrageous against him.
They ran down his reputation with
full cry, and endeavour'd to blacken
it with a thousand horrible calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
with which they stuff'd their
Libels, and amongst others, that
<pb facs="tcp:42159:19"/>
which they have inserted into the
Memoires of the <hi>League,</hi> with the
greatest villany imaginable, taking
no notice of the solid and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
answers he made them. Which
proceeding of theirs is sufficient to
discover the falsity of all they
have Written to Defame him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Libelling <hi>genius</hi> of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, of all Heretiques, none have
been more cruel, or more foul-mouth'd
than the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> none have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
themselves of their pretended
Enemies more barbarously, either by
open Arms, or private mischiefs,
when the power was in their hands;
or more impudently with their Pens,
and by their Libels, when they had
no other way to shew their malice;
murthering their reputations with all
sorts of injuries and impostures, who
have once declar'd themselves against
their Party.</p>
            <p>In effect, what have they not said
to defame the memory of Monsieur
<hi>de Sponde,</hi> Lieutenant General in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle,</hi>
of <hi>Salette</hi> Counsellour to the
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> of <hi>Morlas</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour
<pb facs="tcp:42159:20"/>
of State and Superintendant of
the Magazines of <hi>France,</hi> as also of <hi>Du
Fay, Clairville, Rohan,</hi> and a hundred
others of their most celebrated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
who after having been esteem'd
amongst them for good men, and
look'd on as the Leaders of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory,
are by a strange sort of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis,</hi>
become on the sudden,
Profligate Wretches, and the most
infamous of mankind, onely for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<hi>Calvinism?</hi> By how many
Forgeries and Calumnies have they
endeavour'd to ruine the repute of all
such <hi>Catholiques</hi> as have the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
oppos'd their Heresie? Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
will furnish us with abundant
proofs: and we have but too many in
the Fragments which Monsieur <hi>Le
Laboreur</hi> has given us of their inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Satyrs, where they spare not
the most inviolable and Sacred things
on Earth; not even their anointed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns.</p>
            <p>For which Reason, that Writer in a
certain Chapter of his Book, wherein
he mentions but a small parcel of
those Libels, after he has said, that
the most venomous Satyrists, and the
<pb facs="tcp:42159:20"/>
greatest Libertines, were those of the
<hi>Huguenot</hi> party, adds these memorable
words. <q>I should have been asham'd
to have read all those Libels, for the
Blasphemies and Impieties with which
they are fill'd, if that very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had not been ayding to confirm
me in the belief, that there was more
wickedness, than either errour or
blindness in their Doctrine; and that
their Morals were even more corrupt
than their opinions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He assures us in another place, that
these new Evangelists, have made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Volumes of railing, of which he
has seen above forty Manuscripts, and
that there needed no other arguments
to decide the difference betwixt the
two Religions, and to elude the fair
pretences of these reforming Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
            <p>So, that all they have scribbled,
with so much (I will not say violence
but) madness against the <hi>Sieur Cayet,</hi>
immediately upon his Conversion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe him the least manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
no more than their ridiculous
prediction wherein they foretold, that
it wou'd not be long before he wou'd
<pb facs="tcp:42159:21"/>
be neither <hi>Huguenot</hi> nor <hi>Catholique</hi>
but that he wou'd set up a third party
betwixt the two Religions. For he
ever continu'd to live so well amongst
the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> that after he had given
on all occasions large proofs, both of
his Virtue and of his Faith, he was
thought worthy to receive the order of
Priesthood, and the Degree of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in Divinity, and was Reader
and Professour Royal of the Oriental
Tongues.</p>
            <p>Now seeing in the year 1605, ten
years after his Conversion, he had
publish'd his Septenary Chronology,
of the Peace which was made at <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi>
in the year 1598. Some of the
greatest Lords at Court, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
his Merit and had seen him with
the King, (by whom he had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be well known and much
esteem'd,) oblig'd him to add to the
History of the Peace, that of the War,
which that great Prince made during
Nine years after his coming to the
Crown, till the Peace of <hi>Vervins:</hi>
which he perform'd in the three Tomes
of his Nine years Chronology, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year 1608; in
<pb facs="tcp:42159:21"/>
which before he proceeds to the Reign
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, he makes an
abridgment of the most considerable
passages in the <hi>League,</hi> to the death
of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. And 'tis partly
from this Authour, and partly from
such others, as were Eye-witnesses of
what they wrote, whether in Printed
Books, or particular Memoires, that
I have drawn those things, which
are related by me in this History. I
am not therefore my self the witness,
nor as an Historian do I take upon
me to decide the Merit of these acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether they are blameable or
praise-worthy; I am onely the Relater
of them; and since in that quality, I
pretend not to be believ'd on my own
bare word, and that I quote my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
who are my Warrantees, as I
have done in all my Histories, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
my self to stand exempted from
any just reproaches, which can be
fasten'd on me for my writing.</p>
            <p>On which Subject I think it may
be truly said, that if instead of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
matters of Fact, and enquiring
whether they are truly or falsely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
that consideration be
<pb facs="tcp:42159:22"/>
laid aside, and the question taken up,
whether such or such actions were
good or bad, and matter of right plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whether they deserv'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
or prais'd; it wou'd be but
loss of time in unprofitable discourses,
in which an Historian is no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.
For in conclusion, he is onely
answerable for such things as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
on the credit of those from
whom he had them; taking from
each of them some particulars, of
which the rest are silent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling
out of all of them a new body
of History, which is of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Mould and fashion, from any of
the Authours who have written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him.</p>
            <p>And 'tis this, in which consists a
great part of the delicacy and beauty
of these kinds of Works, and which
produces this effect; that keeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in the most exact limits of truth,
yet an Authour may lawfully pretend
to the glory of the invention, having
the satisfaction of setting forth a new
History, though Writing onely the
passages of a former Age, he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
almost nothing, but what has
<pb facs="tcp:42159:22"/>
been written formerly, either in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Books, or Manuscripts; which
though kept up in private and little
known, are notwithstanding, not
the Work of him who writes the
History.</p>
            <p>As to what remains, none ought
to wonder, that I make but one single
Volume on this Subject, though the
matter of it is of vast extent. I take
not upon me to tell all that has been
done, on occasion of the <hi>League,</hi> in
all the Provinces, nor to describe all
the Sieges; the taking and surprising
of so many places, which were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the King, and at other times
for the <hi>League;</hi> or all those petty
Skirmishes which have drawn, (if I
may have liberty so to express my
self) such deluges of Bloud from the
veins of <hi>France.</hi> All these particulars
ought to be the ingredients of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
History of this Nation, under
the Reigns of the two last <hi>Henries,</hi>
which may be read in many famous
Historians; and principally in the last
Tome of the late <hi>Monsieur de Mezeray,</hi>
who has surpass'd himself, in that part
of his great work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42159:23"/>
I confine my undertaking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compass of what is most
essential in the particular History of
the <hi>League,</hi> and have onely appli'd
my self to the discovery of its true
Origine, to unriddle its intrigues and
artifices, and find out the most secret
motives, by which the Heads of that
Conspiracy have acted, to which the
magnificent Title of the <hi>Holy Vnion,</hi>
has been given with so much injustice:
and in consequence of this, to make
an exact description of the principal
actions, and the greatest and most
signal events, which decided the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the <hi>League;</hi> and this in short
is the Model of my Work.</p>
            <p>As for the end which I propos'd to
my self, in conceiving it, I may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that it was to give a plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to all such, as shall read
this History, that all sorts of Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are form'd against lawfull
Soveraigns, particularly when the
Conspiratours endeavour to disguise
them, under the specious pretence of
Religion and Piety, as did the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
and <hi>Leaguers,</hi> are at all times most
criminal in the sight of God, and most
<pb facs="tcp:42159:23"/>
commonly of unhappy and fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to those, who are either
the Authours or Accomplices of the
Crime.</p>

            <head>THE
HISTORY
OF THE
LEAGUE.</head>
            <head type="sub">LIB. I.</head>
            <p>THough this work which I have
undertaken is the natural se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of the History of <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
'tis yet most certain that the
Subject which I treat has no relation to
that Heresie. For it was not the desire
of preserving the Catholique faith in
<hi>France,</hi> nor any true motive of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which gave birth to the <hi>League,</hi>
as the common people who have not
been able to penetrate into the secret of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42159:34"/>
that accursed Cabal, have always been
persuaded. It was derived from two
passions which in all ages have produc'd
most tragical Effects, I mean Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Hatred. 'Tis true, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and above all the Church-men,
who believ'd they had occasion to be
alarm'd in matters of Religion, if he
who was call'd to the Crown by the
fundamental Laws of the Kingdom,
shou'd obtain it, these I say were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
by that specious appearance of
true Zeal, which seem'd to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soul and Foundation of the <hi>League.</hi>
But it will not be difficult to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the process of this History, that
the Authours of that Conspiracy made
use of those pretences of Religion, to
abuse the credulity, and even the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of the People; and to make them
impious, without their perceiving it,
by animating and arming them against
their Kings, to root out (if they had
been able) the last remaining Stem of
the Royal Stock; and to plant on its
Foundations, the dominion of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</p>
            <p>And as none are able to execute an
unjust Enterprise, but by means as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42159:34"/>
and execrable as the end it self
which they propose, so will there be
manifest in the sequel and progress of
the <hi>League,</hi> even yet more disorders
and mischiefs than ever <hi>Calvinism</hi> it
self produc'd; against which alone it
seem'd to have been arm'd: Yet in this
particular, most resembling that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
party which was rais'd against
the Catholique Church, that, being
blasted as the Heresie had been by the
Lord of Hosts, it was always unsucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the Battels which it strooke
against the lawfull power; And at
length overwhelm'd with the same
Engines which it had rais'd for the
destruction of the Government.</p>
            <p>Truly, 'tis a surprising thing to find
both in the design and sequel of the
<hi>League,</hi> by a miraculous order of the
divine providence, revolutions altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrary to those which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
On the one side the majesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for ruine, gloriously rais'd to
that supreme degree of power in which
we now behold it flourishing, to the
wonder of the World; and on the
other side, that of two eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42159:35"/>
which endeavour'd their own
advancement by its destruction, the
one is already debas'd to the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and the other almost reduc'd to
nothing. So different are the designs
of God, from those of men; and so
little is there to be built on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of humane policy and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
when men have onely passion
for their guides, under the counterfeit
names of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p>'Tis what I shall make evident,
by unravelling the secrets and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
couch'd under the <hi>League,</hi> by
exposing its criminal and ill manag'd
undertakings, which were almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
unsuccessfull; and by shewing
in the close the issue it had, entirely
opposite to its designs, by the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those whom it endeavour'd to
oppress. But is will be first neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to consider in what condition
<hi>France</hi> then was, when this dangerous
Association was first form'd, against
the supreme Authority of our Kings.</p>

               </gap>ury of the Civil Wars which
had laid the Kingdom desolate under
the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth seem'd
to have almost wholly been extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42159:35"/>
after the fourth Edict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which was made at the Siege
of <hi>Rochell;</hi> and if the State was not
altogether in a Calm, yet at least it
was not toss'd in any violence of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
when after the decease of the said
King, his Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> then King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> return'd to <hi>France,</hi> and took
possession of a Crown devolv'd on him
by the right of Inheritance. He was a
Prince, who being then betwixt the
years of 23, and 24, was endu'd with
all Qualities and perfections capable of
rendring him one of the greatest and
most accomplish'd Monarchs in the
World. For besides that his person
was admirably shap'd, that he was tall
of Stature, majestique in his Carriage,
that the sound of his Voice, his Eyes,
and all the features of his Face, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
sweet; that he had a solid
Judgment, a most happy Memory, a
clear and discerning Understanding;
that in his behaviour he had all the
winning Graces which are requir'd in
a Prince, to attract the love and respect
of Subjects; 'Tis also certain, that no
man cou'd possibly be more Liberal,
more Magnificent, more Valiant,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42159:36"/>
more Courteous, more addicted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or more Eloquent than he
was naturally and without Art. To
sum up all, he had wanted nothing to
make himself and his Kingdom happy,
had he followed those wholsome
Counsels which were first given him;
and had he still retain'd the noble am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of continuing at least what he
was formerly, under the glorious
name of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> which he
had render'd so renown'd by a thousand
gallant actions, and particularly by
the famous Victories of <hi>Iarnac</hi> and
<hi>Montcontour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The world was fill'd with those high
<hi>Ideas,</hi> which it had conceiv'd of his
rare merit, expecting from him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of the Monarchy in its
ancient splendour, and nothing was
capable of weakning that hope, but
onely the cruel Massacre of St. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew,</hi>
whereof he had been one of the
most principal Authours, which had
render'd him extremely odious to the
Protestants. And therefore in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from <hi>Poland,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximilian</hi>
the Second, who rul'd the

Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the most judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
members of that august Senate,
which is every where renown'd for

               </hi> and <hi>du Mesnil,</hi> and generally,
all those who were most passionate for
his greatness, and the good of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
advis'd him to give peace to his
Subjects of the Religion pretendedly
Reform'd, to heal and cement that
gaping wound, which had run so
much bloud, in that fatal day of St.
<hi>Bartholomew,</hi> and not to replunge his
Kingdom in that gulf of miseries,
wherein it was almost ready to have
perish'd.</p>
            <p>But the Chancellour <hi>de Birague,</hi> the
Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and his Nephew
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> (who at that time
had no little part in the esteem and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his Master,) and above all, the
Queen Mother, <hi>Catharine de Medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dar'd no longer to trust the Protestants.
These I say, ingag'd him in the War
which he immediately made against
them, and which was unsuccessfull to
him. So that after he had been shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
repuls'd, from before an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Town in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> they took
Arms in all places, becoming more

and <hi>Poitou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which render'd them so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
(which otherwise they had not
been,) was a party of Malecontents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> who were
call'd the <hi>Politiques,</hi> because without
touching on Religion, they pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tested
that they took Arms onely for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good; for the relief and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the people; and to reform those
grievances and disorders, which were
apparent in the State: A ground, which
has always serv'd for a pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to those men, who have rais'd
themselves in opposition to their Kings
and Masters, whom God commands
us to obey, though they shou'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even abuse that power which he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42159:37"/>
has given them, not to destroy, or to
demollish, as he speaks in his holy
Scriptures, but to edify, that is to say,
to procure the good, and to establish
the happiness of their Subjects.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Politiques</hi> then joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> according to
the resolution which they had taken
at the Assembly held at <hi>Montpellier,</hi>
in the month of <hi>November,</hi> and year
of our Lord, 1574. <hi>Henry de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy</hi>
Marshal of <hi>Damville,</hi> and
Governour of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who to
maintain himself in that rich Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which he was design'd to be
bereft, first form'd this party of the
<hi>Politiques,</hi> into which he drew great
numbers of the Nobles, his partisans
and Friends; and principally the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neurs
<hi>de Thore,</hi> and <hi>de Meru-Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy</hi>
his Brothers, the Count <hi>de Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadour</hi>
his Brother in Law, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Henry de la Tour d' Auvergn,</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>de Turenne</hi> his Nephew, who

But that,<note place="margin">Ann. 1575.</note> which made their power
so formidable in the last result of things,
was that <hi>Monsieur,</hi> (the Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanson,</hi>
onely Brother of the King)
and the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> detain'd at
Court, and not very favourably trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
having made their escape; the
first of them, who, besides his own
followers, was joyn'd by a considerable
part of <hi>Damville's</hi> Troops, put himself
at the head of the Protestant Army,
which was at the same time reinforc'd
by the conjunction of great Succours
of <hi>Reyters</hi> and <hi>Lansquenets,</hi> whom the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had brought from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
under the conduct of <hi>Iohn Casi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi>
second Son to <hi>Frederick</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
<hi>Palatine.</hi> So that in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Muster which was made of them
near <hi>Moulins</hi> in <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were found to consist of thirty five
thousand experienc'd Souldiers, which
power 'tis most certain, the King was
in no condition to resist, in that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Estate, to which he had reduc'd
himself, by the prodigious change he
had made, in his conduct and his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
immediately after his succeeding
to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42159:38"/>
He was no longer that Victorious
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who had gain'd in the
world so high a reputation, by so many
gallant actions perform'd by him, in
commanding the Armies of the King
his Brother, in quality of his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but as if in assuming the Crown
of the first and most ancient Monarchy
of Christendom, he had despoil'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the same moment, by some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
enchantment, of his Royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
he plung'd himself into all
the delights of a most ignominious
idleness, with his favourites and
Minions, who were the Bloud-suckers,
the Harpyes, and the scandal of all
<hi>France,</hi> which he seem'd to have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
to their pillage by the immens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his prodigality. After this he
render'd himself equally odious and
contemptible to his Subjects, both of
the one Religion and the other, by his
inconstant, and fantastique manner of
procedure. For he ran sometimes
from the extremity of debauchery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a fit of Religion, with processions
and exercises of Penance, which were
taken for Hypocrisie, and then again,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42159:39"/>
from Devotion into Debauchery, as the
present humour carried him away, and
busied himself in a thousand mean em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
unworthy, I say, not of a King
but of a man of common sense. All which
<hi>Davila</hi> the Historian, after his manner
of drawing every thing into design
and Mystery, though at the expence
of Truth, has endeavour'd to pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, for so many effects of a subtile,
and over-refin'd policy. In conclusion,
to discharge himself of the burthen of
Royalty, which was grown wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
to him in that lazy effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
sort of Life, he relinquish'd all
the cares of Government to the Queen
his Mother, who to continue him in
that humour, and by consequence to
make her self absolute Mistress of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
(which was always her predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
passion,) fail'd not to furnish
him from time to time with new baits
and allurements of voluptuousness, and
all that was needfull for the shipwrack
of vertue and honour, in a Court the
most dissolute which had ever been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since it therefore pleas'd the Queen
that War shou'd be made against the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42159:39"/>
               <hi>Huguenots,</hi> to infeeble them as much
as was possible, that they might give
no trouble to her management of Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
So also when she saw them
strengthen'd with so formidable an
Army, and her Son <hi>Alanson</hi> at their
head, she began immediately to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
that at length, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters, they might degrade
her from that Authority, which she
was so ambitious to retain, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
means, and consequently she
resolv'd to make a peace, for the same
reasons, for which she undertook the
War. And as she was undoubtedly
the most subtile Woman of her time,
and had so great an Ascendant over all
her Children, that they were not able
to withstand her, or to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against her artifices, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
wou'd spare for nothing to compass
her designs; she manag'd so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
the minds of the Princes, and
cheif Officers of their Army, in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them with ease extraordinary
Conditions, even such as were beyond
their hope; that she conjur'd down
the Tempest which was about to have
been powr'd upon her head, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42159:40"/>
shelter'd her self at the cost of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by the fifth Edict of Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was as advantageous to
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> as they cou'd desire. To
whom, amongst other privileges was
allow'd the free exercise of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Religion in all the Cities of the
Kingdom, and in all other places, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
onely the Court and <hi>Paris,</hi> and
the compass of two Leagues about that
City. This peace was infinitely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastefull
to the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> because it
serv'd for a pretence, and gave a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
occasion to the birth of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
long time before premeditated,
and hatch'd by him, who was the first
Authour of that <hi>League</hi> whose History
I write; and who began to lay the
Foundations of it, precisely at this point
of time, in that manner as shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be related.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the first persons
who were thus Associated,<note place="margin">Ann. 1576.</note> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Religion against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns
were the Protestants: Then
when the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
their conceal'd head at the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of <hi>Amboise;</hi> and afterwards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly
declar'd himself in beginning
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42159:40"/>
the first troubles by the surprise of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans.</hi>
That League, (which always
was maintain'd by force of Arms, by
places of caution and security, which
upon constraint were granted to the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> and by the treasonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
they held with Strangers,
even till the time wherein it was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
extinguish'd by the taking of
<hi>Rochell,</hi> and of their other Cities, and
fortified places, under the Reign of the
late King of glorious memory,) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
some <hi>Catholiques</hi> oftentimes, to
unite themselves without the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the King in certain Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
as particularly, in <hi>Languedoc,
Guyenne,</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi> not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>end
themselves against the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> but also to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
them, and to exterminate them,
if they had been able, from all those
places, of which they had possess'd
themselves in those Provinces. But
he who employ'd his thoughts at the
utmost stretch in that affair, and
was the first who invented the project
of a General League amongst the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,</hi>
under another Head than
the King, was the Cardinal of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42159:41"/>
at that time assisting at the
Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Prince, whose name is so well
known in History, and who had a
most prompt and most piercing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
fiery by nature, impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and violent, endu'd with a rare,
natural eloquence, more learning than
cou'd reasonably be expected from a
Person of his Quality, and which his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence
made appear to be much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it was; the boldest of any
man alive in Councils, Cabals, and in
Contrivance of daring and vast designs,
was also the most pusillanimous and
weakest man imaginable, when it
came to the point of Execution, and
that he saw there was danger in the
undertaking. But above all, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, that through the whole
series of his Life, he had a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
passion for the greatness of
his Family. Insomuch, that when he
saw the great Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
at the highest point of glory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> where it might
be said that he was the safeguard of
our Religion, which depended on that
day's success, and that all the Council
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42159:41"/>
was fill'd with the applause of that <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi>
for so memorable a Victory, which
he had in a manner gain'd singly, after
the defeat and taking of the Constable;
he believ'd he had found the favourable
occasion he so ardently desir'd, to
satisfie his ambition to the full, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Brother to that degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
in which he might enjoy a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
and Independent Authority,
equal to the power of the greatest
Kings.</p>
            <p>To this effect he was not wanting
to represent to the Heads of that Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and by them to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that
for the support of Religion, against
which the <hi>Heretiques</hi> made so cruel
War, particularly in <hi>France,</hi> there
was no better means, than to make a
League into which shou'd enter all the
Princes and great men whom they
cou'd procure, and above all the rest
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and so zealous for the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Faith. He added, that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for the <hi>Pope,</hi> to declare himself
the Protectour of it, and to elect a
Head of it in the Kingdom, on whose
Piety, Prudence, Valour and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42159:42"/>
all things might safely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
and whom all <hi>Catholiques</hi> shou'd
be under an obligation to obey, till
they had totally extirpated the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots.</hi>
This proposal was receiv'd
with great applause; and as their
minds in that juncture of time were
wholly prepossess'd with a high cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the wise conduct, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
felicity, and heroique vertues of
the Victorious Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> there
was not the least scruple remaining
for them to conclude, that he alone
was fit to be the Head of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o glorious
an Undertaking. But the sad news of
his Death, arriving in the very upshot
of that project, made this great design
to vanish; which the Cardinal, who
never lost the imagination of it, nor
the hope to make it succeed at some
other time, was not able to bring in
play again till about ten or eleven
years after that accident: And then
sound the young Duke of <hi>Guise, Henry</hi>
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> his Nephew, both of age
and of capacity, and intirely dispos'd
to its accomplishment. For at that
time he propos'd warmly the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the King of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42159:42"/>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> who both enter'd without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
into his opinion; though upon
motives very different: The <hi>Pope,</hi> out
of the ardent desire he had to see
Heresie altogether exterminated from
this most Christian Kingdom, and the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> out of a longing appetite
to make his advantage of our divisions,
and those great disorders, which he
foresaw the League must inevitably
cause in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke also, on his side, who
had much more ambition, and much
less affection to the publique good,
than his Father, embrac'd with all his
Soul so fair an occasion as was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
put into his hand, of raising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
immediately to so high a degree of
Power and Authority, in becoming
Head of a Party, which in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
wou'd ruine all the others, and
give Law universally to <hi>France.</hi> But
the Death of his Uncle the Cardinal,
which happen'd at the same time,
broke once more the measures of his
ambitious design, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he never did forsake, as being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resolv'd to put it into execution, on
the first opportunity which shou'd be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42159:43"/>
offer'd. This he cou'd not find, till
two years afterwards, when <hi>Don Iohn</hi>
of <hi>Austria</hi> pass'd through <hi>France,</hi> to
take possession of his government of
the Low Countries. That Prince who
travell'd <hi>incognito,</hi> and had already
made a secret correspondence with the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> saw him at <hi>Ioinville,</hi>
where after some conferences which
they had together, without other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than <hi>Iohn d' Escovedo,</hi> Secretary
to <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> they made a Treaty of
alliance, offensive and defensive, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to assist each other to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Abilities, with their Friends,
their Power, and Forces, to render
themselves absolute; the first in his
government of the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> the
second in that party, which he always
hop'd to form in <hi>France,</hi> according to
the project of his Uncle, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of maintaining the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Religion in <hi>France</hi> against the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Historians are silent of this
Treaty, I suppose, notwithstanding,
that it is undoubtedly true, considering
what Monsieur <hi>de Peiresc,</hi> (a name
so celebrated by the learned) has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42159:43"/>
concerning it in his memoires;
which was grounded on what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him by Monsieur <hi>du Vair,</hi>
who had it from <hi>Antonio Perez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that famous Confident of the
Amours betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> the second, and
the fair Princess of <hi>Eboli,</hi> acknowledg'd
freely to President <hi>du Vair,</hi> that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himself of unfortunate <hi>Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedo,</hi>
who at his return to <hi>Spain</hi> wou'd
have ruin'd him in the favour of the
King, he gave him so well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that this Secretary of <hi>Don Iohn</hi>
was intrusted with all his most secret
designs against the State, and that
having discover'd the love of the King
his Master, he travers'd his amorous
intrigue, to serve the Prince of <hi>Eboli,</hi>
on whom he had dependance, that
<hi>Philip</hi> who made not the least scruple
to rid himself of any one whom he
suspected (as having not spar'd even
his Son <hi>Don Carlos</hi>) made him be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinated.
After which, having seiz'd
his Papers, he there found this private
Treaty, together with the memoires
and instructions, containing the whole
foundation, and all the minutes of this
project, with the means which the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42159:44"/>
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> intended to make use of,
to make his Enterprise succeed; of
which that King, who made advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of every thing, most dexterously
serv'd himself long time after, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Duke so deeply in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
that he was never able to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
himself, as the sequel will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
But in the mean time, that
Peace so advantageous to the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
being made in the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mention'd; the Duke beleiv'd,
he had now a fair occasion to begin
(by making use of the discontents of
the <hi>Catholiques,</hi>) the forming of that
<hi>League,</hi> of which he intended a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to declare himself the Head.
How he manag'd that affair, is next
to be related.</p>
            <p>Amongst the secret Articles of that
Peace, so favourable to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
there was one, by which the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> had granted to him the full
possession of the Government of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy;</hi>
and besides it, for his farther
security, the important City of <hi>Peron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
the Garrison of which, shou'd be
maintain'd at the King's expence. The
Governour of <hi>Peronne,</hi> at that time,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42159:44"/>
was <hi>Iaques,</hi> Lord of <hi>Humieres, Encre,
Bray,</hi> and many other places, who by
other large possessions of his own, and
the Governments of <hi>Roye,</hi> and of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didier,</hi>
added to <hi>Peronne,</hi> was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dispute the most considerable, the
wealthiest, and most powerfull Lord
of all <hi>Picardy.</hi> Besides, that being of
an illustrious Birth, and Son of the
Wise and Valiant <hi>Iohn d' Humieres,</hi>
(who had been Lieutenant of the King
in <hi>Piemont,</hi> and Governour to King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second,) he was respected,
lov'd and obey'd in that Province,
where he was in a manner absolute,
both by the great Authority of his own
merit, and that which was deriv'd to
him from his Father.</p>
            <p>This Nobleman, having formerly
been ill us'd by the Lords of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi>
then in power; and having
been hinder'd by them, from entring
into possession of a fair Inheritance,
which he claim'd, as rightfully belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, had put himself into the
interests of the former great Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> a declar'd Enemy of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>
And that Prince, to bind more
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irmly to his party, to the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42159:45"/>
and to his Family, a Person so
considerable, had procur'd him to be
Knight of the order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> at
that famous promotion which was
made by <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, on the
Feast of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in the year 1560.
Insomuch that the young Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> doubted not, that the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which this Lord had to maintain
himself in the Government of <hi>Peronne,</hi>
join'd in the present posture of affairs
with zeal, either true or apparent, for
Religion, and the particular obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he had to the House of <hi>Guise,</hi>
would render him capable to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of absolutely, in the execution
of that high enterprise, on which he
was himself resolv'd; it seeming to
him that he cou'd never expect a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opportunity, and that all things
were conspiring in his favour.</p>
            <p>In effect there was nothing wanting
that cou'd possibly concur, either of
good or ill, to make that succeed,
which he had resolv'd so firmly for
two years together; and which in
process of time was capable of raising
him to a higher pitch of greatness,
than at present he cou'd possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42159:45"/>
how vast soever those <hi>idea's</hi> of
power and authority were, with which
he flatter'd his ambitious imagination.
He was a Prince, at that time, in the
flower and vigour of his age, which
was about thirty years; furnish'd with
all those admirable qualities and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
both of Soul and Body, which
are most capable of charming the
Hearts, and acquiring an absolute em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
over the Souls of the people, who
were even enchanted with his graces,
and almost idoliz'd his person. For he
was tall of Stature, excellently well
proportion'd, altogether resembling
what is commonly attributed to <hi>Heroes;</hi>
having the features of his face of a
Masculine Beauty, his Eyes sparkling
and full of Fire, but whose lively and
piercing motion was temper'd with a
certain kind of sweetness. His fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
large, smooth, and at all times
serene, accompanied with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
smile of his mouth, which charm'd
even more than those obliging words,
of which he was not sparing to those
who press'd about him; his complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
lively, white and red; and which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42159:46"/>
the wound he had receiv'd by a Pistol
Bullet on his left Cheek, (when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
a party of the <hi>Reiters</hi> of <hi>Casimir,</hi>
which <hi>William de Montmorency,</hi> Sieur
<hi>de Thore,</hi> conducted to the Duke of
<hi>Alanson,</hi>) heightn'd to much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
than all the ornaments which
the vanity of Women has invented to
add a lustre to their Beauty. His walk
was grave and stately; yet neither Pride
nor affectation appear'd in it. In all
his Garb there was a certain inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
air of heroique greatness, which
was made up of sweetness, audacity
and a noble haughtiness, without any
thing of shocking, or ungracefull in
his whole composition. Which, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
inspir'd a mixture of love, of
awe, and of respect into his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>This admirable outside was anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with an inside yet more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
by reason of those excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
which he possess'd, of a Soul that
was truly great; being liberal, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
in all things, sparing nothing
to make Dependents, and to gain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all sorts of conditions; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
the Nobility, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42159:46"/>
civil, obliging, popular, always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to doe good to those who address'd
themselves to him; generous, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
not to be mov'd to injure any
man; no not to hurt even his greatest
Enemies, but by honourable ways; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
persuasive in discourse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising
his thoughts, when he appear'd
most open; wise and prudent in his
Counsells, bold, prompt and valiant
in the execution of them, chearfully
enduring all the hardships of War, in
common with the meanest Soldier,
exposing his person, and contemning
the greatest dangers, to compass what
he had once determin'd. But that
which gave the greatest lustre to so
many noble qualities, was the quite
contrary of all these, in the person of
the King; who, by his ill conduct,
rather than his ill fortune, had lost the
affection of the greatest part of <hi>France,</hi>
and chiefly of the <hi>Parisians,</hi> which by
the highest disorder, that cou'd possibly
happen in a State, was already trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to him, who, from his subject
began openly to appear his Rival, in
the thing of the World, whereof Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
are, and ought to be, most jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But as there is no Mine of Gold,
where the pretious Metal is so wholly
pure, as to be found unmix'd with
common Earth, so were these great
natural endowments of the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> debas'd by the mixture of
many imperfections and vices; of
which the principal was the insatiable
desire of greatness and of glory, and
that vast Ambition, to which he made
all other things subservient. Besides
which, he was rash, presumptuous,
self-conceited, wedded to his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and despising the advice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(though that more covertly,)
subtile, unsincere, no true friend, but
centring all things in his own interest;
though he appear'd the most obliging
and the most officious of all men, yet
the good he did, was onely in order
to himself, always covering his
vast designs, by the specious pretence
of publique good, and the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the true Religion: too much
confiding in his own good fortune,
loosing and hoodwincking himself
in his prosperity, which gave him
such a gust of the present pleasure,
that he cou'd not think of taking his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42159:47"/>
precautions for the future; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
giving up himself too much
to the love of Women, of whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
without their being able
to divert him from the care he took
of his great concern, he dextrously
made use to advance it by their means
and without their knowing that they
were his Instruments. Yet in spight
of all these vices, which were indeed
most subtly manag'd, or disguis'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the most fair appearances, and
veil'd with a profound dissimulation,
his vertues at the same time glittering,
and blazing over all the World, he
was universally ador'd and lov'd, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by the <hi>Parisians;</hi> and even
they, who knowing him at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
cou'd not love him, yet cou'd not
hinder themselves from admiring him;
which doubtless is a most uncommon
thing, that a man shou'd be able at
the same time, to deserve and gain
the peoples love, and the admiration
of those who were so clear sighted, as
to discover his imperfections and
vices.</p>
            <p>Such was the famous Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>

Bullet, which as I said he receiv'd
in defeating some Troops of <hi>Calvinists</hi>
and Rebels, caus'd to be surnam'd,
<hi>THE SCARR'D.</hi> And who, in
those times, of which I Write, found
all things sufficiently dispos'd to the
execution of his enterprise. For he
found the <hi>Catholiques</hi> provok'd to his
hand, by those advantages which
newly were granted to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
the people dissatisfi'd, and weary of
the Government, not able to endure,
that the wealth of the Nation shou'd
be squander'd on the King's Favourites,
whom they called the Minions: the
<hi>genius</hi> of Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> pleas'd
with troubles, and even procuring
them to render her self necessary, to
the end that recourse might be had to
her for Remedies; the Princes of the
bloud become suspected and odious to
the three orders of the Kingdom, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for favouring the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> or
for being publiquely declar'd <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
thereby renouncing the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
faith, as the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had openly
done; the King faln into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his Subjects, after having
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42159:48"/>
lost their love; himself, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
lov'd and ador'd by the people,
worship'd by the <hi>Parisians,</hi> follow'd
by the Nobility, indear'd to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
having in his Interests all the
Princes of his Family, powerfull in
Offices and Governments, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his Creatures, whom his own
generosity, and that of his Father,
had acquir'd him; the favour of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> the assistance of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
ready at hand to bear him up, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the seeming Justice of his cause,
which he industriously made known
to all the world, to be that of Religion
alone, whereof, in the general opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he was the Protectour and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and for the maintenance of which
it was believ'd, that he had devoted
himself against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who
had enterpriz'd to abolish it in the
Kingdom. But the last motive which
fix'd his resolution, was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
rancour he had against the King,
one of whose intimate Confidents he
had been formerly, and who had now
abandon'd him, by changing on the
sudden the whole manner of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and giving himself entirely up
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42159:49"/>
to his Minions, who omitted no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of using the Duke unworthily:
For disdain, which is capable of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
to the last extremities the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Souls, and the most sensible in
point of Honour, made hatred to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
his first inclinations against him
whom already he despis'd; and hatred
and contempt being joyn'd with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
incessantly push'd him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to make himself the head of a
Party so powerfull as that of the
<hi>League,</hi> which pass'd for Holy in the
minds of the people, and to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of so fair an opportunity to form
it.</p>
            <p>For this effect, he immediately caus'd
a project to be formally drawn, which
his Emissaries shou'd endeavour to
spread about the Kingdom amongst
those <hi>Catholiques</hi> who appear'd the
most zealous and most simple, and
those who were known to be the most
addicted to the House of <hi>Guise:</hi> in
this Breviate which they were oblig'd
to subscribe, they promis'd by Oath,
to obey him who shou'd be elected
head of that holy Confederacy, which
was made for maintaining of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42159:49"/>
Religion, to cause due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be render'd to the King and his
Successours, yet without prejudice to
what shou'd be ordain'd by the three
Estates, and to restore the Kingdom
to its original Liberties, which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
under the Reign of <hi>Clovis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the first there were found few
Persons of Quality, and substantial
Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> who wou'd venture
to subscribe to that Association, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was not precisely known, who
wou'd dare to declare himself the Head
of it: besides, that by the vigilance
of the first President <hi>Christopher de
Thou,</hi> it was first discover'd, then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated,
and at last dissolv'd with ease,
with all those secret Assemblies, which
were already held in several quarters
of the Town for entring such persons
into that infant <hi>League,</hi> whom either
their Malice, their false Zeal, or their
Simplicity cou'd ingage. But the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> having sent his project to the
<hi>Sieur d' Humieres,</hi> of whom he held
himself assur'd, that Lord, (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his obligation to the House of
<hi>Guise,</hi> had also his particular interest,
and that of no less Consequence than
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42159:50"/>
the maintaining himself in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Peronne;</hi> which was taken
from him by the Edict of <hi>May,</hi> and that
important place, order'd to be put into
the hands of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
the affair so well, by the credit
he had in that Province, that, as the
<hi>Picards</hi> have always been zealous for
the ancient Religion, he ingag'd almost
all the Towns, and all the Nobility
of <hi>Picardy</hi> to declare openly, that they
wou'd not receive the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
because as it was urg'd in the <hi>Manifesto,</hi>
which was publish'd to justifie their
refusal of him, that they certainly
knew he was resolv'd to abolish the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Faith, and establish <hi>Calvinism</hi>
throughout all <hi>Picardy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis most certain that they wou'd
never be induc'd to receive that Prince
into <hi>Peronne,</hi> or any other part of that
Government; and that to maintain
themselves against all those who wou'd
undertake to oblige them by force, to
observe that Article of the Peace, which
they never wou'd accept, the <hi>Picards</hi>
were the first to receive, by common
agreement, and to publish in <hi>Peronne</hi>
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Treaty of the League, in twelve
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42159:50"/>
Articles, in which the most prudent
of the <hi>Catholiques</hi> themselves, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Illustrious President <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher
de Thou,</hi> observ'd many things
which directly shock'd the most Holy
Laws both Divine and Humane.</p>
            <p>For 'tis obvious in the first Article,
that the Catholique Princes, Lords and
Gentlemen, invoking the name of the
Holy Trinity, make an Association
and League, offensive and defensive,
betwixt themselves, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
privity, or consent of their
King, and a King who was a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
as well as they; which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite to the Law of God, who
ordains that Subjects should submit
themselves, and be united to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
as members to their Head:
even though he shou'd exceed his
bounds and be a Tyrant, provided
that there be no manifest sin, in what
they are commanded to obey.</p>
            <p>In the second, they refuse to render
obedience to the King, unless it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Articles which shall be
presented to him by the States, which it
shall not be lawfull for him to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;
or to act any thing in prejudice
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42159:51"/>
of them. 'Tis evident that this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the constitution of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
to establish in its place a certain
kind of Aristocracy, against one of
our fundamental Laws, which ordains
that the States shou'd have onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative
voice for the drawing up of
their Petitions into Bills, and then to
present them with all humility to the
King, who examines them in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and afterwards passes what he finds
to be just and reasonable. They give
not Law to him, who is their Master,
and their Head, as the Electours of the
Empire, by certain capitulations do to
the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> who are
indeed the Heads, but not the Masters
of the Empire; but, on the contrary
they receive it from their King, to
whom they onely make most humble
Addresses, in the Bills which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to him.</p>
            <p>In the third Article the Associates
assume to themselves, to be Masters
of the State, while under pretence of
reforming it, they ridiculously take
upon them to abrogate the Laws ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by our Ancestours, in the second
and third race of our Kings, and wou'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42159:51"/>
establish the customes and u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ances,
which were practis'd in the time of
<hi>Clovis:</hi> which is just the same thing
that certain Enthusiasts sometimes have
attempted in the Church, who under
the specious names of the Reform'd
and Primitive Church, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to revive some ancient Canons,
which now for many ages have not
been observ'd; and gave themselves
the liberty to condemn the practices,
and customes authoriz'd by the Church,
of remisness, and abuse; since it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
onely to the Church, according
to the diversity of times, and of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to make new regulations, in its
Government and Discipline, without
touching the capital points, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Essentials of Religion.</p>
            <p>To conclude, from the fourth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to the twelfth, there are visible
all the marks, and the foulest characters
of a Rebellion, form'd and undertaken
against their Prince, particularly where
there is promis'd an exact obedience
in all things, to the Head, whom they
shall elect; and that they will employ
their lives and fortunes in his service;
that in all Provinces they will levy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42159:52"/>
Souldiers,<note place="margin">Anno 1577.</note> and raise money, for the
support of the common cause; and
that all those who shall declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the League, shall be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
prosecuted by the Associates,
who shall revenge themselves without
exception of person; which in the
true meaning, is no other thing, than
the setting up a second King in <hi>France</hi>
in opposition to the first; against whom
they engag'd themselves to take Arms
in these terrible words, <hi>without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of person,</hi> in case he should go
about to hinder so criminal an usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Royal Authority.</p>
            <p>Such was the Copy of the League,
in those twelve Articles which were
Printed and dispers'd through all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
as we are inform'd by an
Authour who was contemporary to it;
and has given it at large, in his History
of the War under <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth:
But being conceiv'd in certain terms
which are too bold, and which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
shock the Royal Majesty, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
d' Humieres</hi> a prudent man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them into a form, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
less odious, in which preserving
the Essentials of the League, of which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42159:52"/>
he was Head in <hi>Picardy,</hi> he appears, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
to do nothing, but by
the authority, and for the service of
the King.</p>
            <p>Now as it is extremely important
to understand throughly this Treaty of
<hi>Peronne,</hi> from which the League had
its beginning, which is not to be found
in any of our Authours, and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of which I have, as it was sign'd
by almost two hundred Gentlemen,
and after them, by the Magistrates,
and Officers of <hi>Peronne;</hi> I thought I
shou'd gratifie my Readers by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
to them a piece so rare and so
Authentique, which has luckily fallen
into my hands. They will be glad to
see in it the <hi>Genius,</hi> the reach, and
the policy of that dextrous Governour,
and Lieutenant to the King, who in
declaring himself Head of the League
in his Province, and procuring it to
be sign'd by so great a number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
took so much care to make
it manifest, at least in appearance, that
he intended always to give to <hi>Caesar</hi>
what belong'd to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that
the Imperial rights should be invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
preserv'd in that Treaty. For
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42159:53"/>
they protest in all their Articles, and
that with all manner of respect in the
most formal terms, that nothing shall
be done, but with his good liking, and
by his Orders, though in pursuance
of this, all things were manag'd
to a quite contrary end. But it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
happens that men engage
themselves with an honest meaning, and
are led by motives of true zeal, in some
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fairs, whereof they foresee not the
dangerous consequences, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
such pernicious effects, as never
enter'd into their first imagination.</p>
            <p>Behold then, this Treaty in eighteen
Articles, together with the subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Gentlemen and Officers,
whereof some are written in such awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Characters, and so little legible,
that I could never have unriddled them,
without the assistence of a person very
skilfull in that difficult art of deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all sorts of ancient writing. I
mean <hi>Don Iohn Hericart</hi> an ancient

by permission from my Lord Bishop of

in the Treasury of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
and in the famous Library of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
Royal of St. <hi>Victor</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> where
he has found wherewithall to exercise
the talent of the most knowing, on
a great number of Titles, of more than
six hundred years standing, and above
three thousand Manuscripts, of the
rarest and most Ancient sort, which
compose the most pretious part of that
excellent and renowned Library. 'Tis
then to this man's industry that I am
owing for this piece; and to deal sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
so as not to pass my conjectures
on the Reader for solid truths, I have
left Blanks for two of their names,

            <p>Whatsoever Resolution was taken to
keep this Treaty secret, it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be long conceal'd being sign'd
by so many men who were desirous
to have Copies of it. Accordingly,
there were found some both amongst
the <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> who
were not wanting to answer it publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely,
endeavouring to make appear
in their Writings, the injustice which
they said was couch'd under those fair
and specious protestations which they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42159:62"/>
demonstrate, particularly in this, that
without the King's privity, there was
made a Confederation and Association
of many persons of all the Orders of
the States, who combine themselves
to reform the Abuses of it: That ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Head of it was chosen, and not
the King. That they bind themselves
by a new invented Oath to that Head,
and that they take upon them to make
Levies of men and money. 'Tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all manner of dispute, they say,
that this directly strikes at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Monarchy, if done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the express permission of the King,
to whom onely it belongs to give out
those orders which he judges to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the safety of the State, and
the well being of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>Moreover as great evils are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
contagious, and that a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conspiracy is like Poison, which
beginning from any little part, if
Sword and Fire and violent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
be not immediately apply'd,
and if the Scorpion be not crush'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place which he has envenom'd,
spreads it self swiftly through the whole
body: thus the example of the <hi>Picards</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:42159:62"/>
for want of immediate acting with
force and vigour, against the Authours
of that tendency to Rebellion, was
quickly follow'd in all the Provinces
of the Kingdom, by many persons of
all ranks and conditions, who under
the fair pretence of Religion, inroll'd
themselves covertly in the <hi>League.</hi>
But he who most openly declar'd for
it, was the Lord <hi>Louis de Trimoüille</hi>
who was afterwards Governour of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou,</hi>
and the <hi>Païs d' Aunis.</hi> For as he
was most extremely incens'd against
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who because he was
not favourable to them, took all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of revenge upon him, and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
inrodes, had made spoil of his
Estate, and was on very ill terms with
the Count <hi>de Lude,</hi> Governour of that
Province, and a faithfull Servant of
the King; He fail'd not to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the occasion which was offer'd
him, to be head of a powerfull par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
against them, and to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for the <hi>League,</hi> into which he caus'd
a great part of the Towns and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
both of <hi>Touraine</hi> and of <hi>Poitou,</hi> to
enter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42159:63"/>
Thus was the <hi>League</hi> fram'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
in a short time exceeding power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
while the King who cou'd not
possibly be ignorant of the designs
and practices, or the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of it, either durst not,
or wou'd not oppose it: whether
it were that fatal drowsiness which
oppress'd him, plung'd as he was in
his delights, or the laziness of an
unactive ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eminate way of living, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from labour, and application to
business; or were it that the Queen
Mother who at that time was no other
ways link'd to the <hi>Guises,</hi> than by her
hatred to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to ruine her, made the King
believe that he ought to serve himself
of that <hi>League,</hi> to infeeble and abase
them, by taking from them all those
great advantages, which they had not
obtain'd but through compulsion in
the last Peace, so odious and insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to the <hi>Catholiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis what was driven at and done
in the first Estates, which were held
at <hi>Bloys;</hi> which began in the month
of <hi>November</hi> the same year, 1576.
The Protestants had importunately
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42159:63"/>
demanded them, when the last Treaty
was concluded; not at all doubting
as they were in conjunction with the
<hi>Politiques,</hi> but that they should be the
strongest, and that consequently they
shou'd procure the Edict of <hi>May</hi> to be
confirm'd, which was so favourable to
them. But they were deceiv'd in their
expectations, for it was found that by
the management of the Queen Mother
and the <hi>Guises,</hi> and by the Money
which was distributed in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Assemblies of the Provinces, not
onely that almost all the Deputies
were <hi>Catholiques,</hi> but that also the
greatest part of them were of the
<hi>League.</hi> Insomuch that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the protestations of the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
against the States; and after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal,
which those two Princes, and
the Marshal <hi>d' Amville,</hi> Head of the
<hi>Politiques</hi> had made, to assist in them,
to which they had vigorously been
solicited by a solemn deputation; the
Edict of <hi>May</hi> was finally revok'd, and
prohibition made to all exercise of the
pretended Reformation, and all the
Ministers, and Directours were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42159:64"/>
out of the Realm by a new
Edict, till such time as they shou'd
be converted. Behold in what
manner the Protestants, who as
yet were not apprehensive of the
<hi>League,</hi> found by experience that it
was stronger than their party in the
Estates according as the King had hop'd
it wou'd be.</p>
            <p>But on the otherside that Prince,
immediately perceiv'd that it acted
not with less artifice and vigour, to
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aken his own authority, than to
pull down the party of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>
For they had the impudence to
demand of him that the Articles which
shou'd be approv'd by the three
Estates, shou'd pass into inviolable
Laws, which it shou'd not be in his
power to alter, and that for other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
concerning which the States
cou'd not agree amongst themselves;
his Majesty might be permitted to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
conformably to what shou'd be
found just and reasonable, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Princes of the bloud, and
twelve of the Deputies. Which to
speak properly, was to devest the King
of his Sovereign Power in making Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42159:64"/>
and Laws, and to transfer it
to the States, according to the project
of the <hi>League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This undoubtedly surpriz'd the
King, but he was yet much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
when at the same time, there
was shewn him the Memoires of one
<hi>David</hi> an Advocate, which contain'd
certain propositions the most villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and detestable that can possibly
be imagin'd.</p>
            <p>For that Fellow who was onely a
pitifull wretched Advocate, a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the worst Causes, and such as
were given for quite lost, lays down
at the first for an undoubted Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<q>That the Benediction of <hi>Popes,</hi>
and principally that of <hi>Stephen</hi> the
Second, was bestow'd on the Race
of <hi>Charlemain</hi> alone, and not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to that of <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper
of the Crown; And that on
the contrary, he by that Usurpation
has drawn on his Descendants those
Curses, the deplorable effects of
which have been seen in so many
Heresies; and above all others, in
that of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> who have
laid waste the Kingdom by Civil
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42159:65"/>
Wars, which after the fruitless Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
gain'd against them, have been
succeeded by a Peace, most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to those Heretiques: that,
this notwithstanding, God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whose property it is to draw
good out of evil, has made use of
that extreme horrour which all good
<hi>Catholiques</hi> have conceiv'd for that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Peace, to restore the Princes of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> to their rights, who are as that
Advocate pretends, and as the people
were made to believe, the true Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Charlemain.</hi>
               </q> After this he
makes a fulsome panegyrique of them,
extolling them infinitely above the
Princes of the Bloud, against whom
he most satyrically declaims. Farther,
he proposes the means which ought to
be employ'd, to animate the people
against them, and to oppress them in
the States, as well as the <hi>Huguenots;</hi>
advising that the King shou'd be
oblig'd to declare War against them,
and to give the command of his Arms
to the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> Then adds,
that when the Duke, who will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have suppress'd and rooted out the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> shall have made himself
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42159:65"/>
Master of the principal Towns of the
Kingdom; and that all things shall
bend under the power of the <hi>League;</hi>
he shall cause the process of <hi>Monsieur,</hi>
the King's Brother to be made, as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
abetter of the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> and
after having shav'd the King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
him to a Covent, he shall receive
the Crown, with the benediction of
the <hi>Pope;</hi> shall make the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> to be receiv'd, shall subject the
<hi>French,</hi> without any restriction to the
obedience of the Holy See, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
all the pretended liberties of the
<hi>Gallicane</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>It must be acknowledg'd with all
ingenuity, that it is not credible as
some have vainly imagin'd, that the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> forg'd those horrible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires,
and caus'd them to be printed,
to blacken and make odious the name
of the <hi>League</hi> amongst all good <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</hi>
For 'tis most certain that this
Advocate, who hated mortally the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> by whom he had been ill
us'd, and upon that account had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
devoted himself to the <hi>League,</hi>
undertook of his own head a Voyage
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to carry thither those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42159:66"/>
and to present them to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> in hopes to ingage him in that
party; and that having been kill'd by
some accident in his Journey, those pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
were found in his Portmantue.
Besides, that the Lord <hi>Iohn de Vivonne,</hi>
the King's Ambassadour in <hi>Spain,</hi> sent
him a copy of them, assuring him that
they had been shewn to King <hi>Philip.</hi>
But in plain truth, there is great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
that those Memoires were
onely the product of the foolish crack'd
brain'd Advocate, who being discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by his passion discharg'd upon
the paper all his furious imaginations
and chimerique dreams, in forming
this ridiculous project, which no man
can reade, without discovering at the
same time all the signs of a distracted
mind.</p>
            <p>The Duke though full of ambition,
was not so weak to fall into the Snare
of those extravagances; and if he were
so haughty, as to soare in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the possession of a Crown,
it was not till of a long time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
and when he saw that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
being dead, and the King without
appearance of having any Children,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42159:66"/>
the succession was of course to fall on
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom the Duke
under pretence that the said King was
a relaps'd <hi>Heretique,</hi> believ'd that he
might easily cause to be excluded from
the Crown, and that in his place he
might himself obtain it.</p>
            <p>What I may lay down for a certain
truth is, that there was never any
piece so black, so malicious, and so
gross as was that of a certain Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Writer, who has compil'd the
Memoires of the <hi>League,</hi> and who
wou'd have it, that those Articles
which are contain'd in the miserable
Writings of <hi>David</hi> the Advocate, were
onely the extract of a secret Council
held at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Consistory, by
<hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the Royal race, and to set the
Princes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> upon the Throne.
For it is so false, that this <hi>Pope</hi> who
was always very prudent and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
shou'd doe any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he constantly persisted in
refusing to approve the <hi>League,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
instance was made to him;
though it was promis'd him, to ingage
him by his interest, that they wou'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42159:67"/>
begin the execution of this great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
by chasing the <hi>Huguenots</hi> out
of the County of <hi>Avignon</hi> and <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi>
to take from them all means
of troubling the possessions of the
Church, and of passing into <hi>Italy:</hi> Nay
farther, he repli'd to those who were
plying him incessantly, and proposing
the welfare and security of Religion,
thereby to make him countenance the
<hi>League,</hi> that it was in his opinion but
a pretext, and that those who made it
had other secret designs, which they
had no mind to publish in the Articles
of their Association.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, those pernicious
Memoires, with those impudent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of the <hi>Associators,</hi> induc'd
the King to a strong apprehension, that
the <hi>League</hi> was not form'd more against
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> than it was for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of his Authority. And, as he
wanted magnanimity of to take
up a bold and generous resolution, of
oppressing so dangerous a Faction in its
infancy, which he might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
so to deliver himself from that
formidable danger, he took indirect
courses, and much unworthy of a King,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42159:67"/>
following the timorous Counsels of the
<hi>Sieur de Morvillier.</hi> That famous
<hi>Iohn de Morvillier,</hi> who was Bishop
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Garde de</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ld. Keeper.</note> 
               <hi>Sceaux</hi> of <hi>France</hi> after the disgrace
and retirement of the Chancellour <hi>de
l' Hospital,</hi> was undoubtedly one of
the greatest men of those times; and
he who had the greatest credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in Council; generally valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and belov'd, for his excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and above all for the mildness of
his temper, and his rare moderation,
joyn'd with an exact prudence, and
large capacity, not onely in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of affairs, but also in all sorts
of Sciences, proper for a man of his
profession, and even in the studies of
Humanity, Poetry and Eloquence.</p>
            <p>This he frequently made appear, in
those excellent Speeches which he drew
up for our Kings, and principally that
which <hi>Henry</hi> the third pronounc'd
with so much applause, in the first
Estates, at <hi>Blois.</hi> For this reason he
was extremely importun'd to write the
History of his times, because it was
the general belief that no man cou'd
acquit himself of so noble an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42159:68"/>
with so much eloquence, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and politeness as himself. But,
as that Subject was not very favourable
to the two last Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the
Ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> under whom he
liv'd, that on the one side, he was too
generous, and too gratefull to write
any thing, which might dishonour and
blast the memory of those two Princes
his Benefactours, and that on the other
side, he was too sincere, and too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to betray and suppress the truth,
with any shamefull baseness, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and corrupt it with mean flatteries,
altogether unworthy of the majesty,
and noble freedom of History, he said
pleasantly to his friends, in excusing
himself from their solicitations, that he
was too much a Servant of the Kings
his good Masters, to undertake the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of their Lives. A notable saying; the
sense of which examin'd to the bottom
ought to oblige great Princes to doe
great things, thereby to furnish a sincere
Historian with materials, whereby to
render their Memory immortal, and
to fill the World with the glory of their
names. But on the otherside it gives an
Historian to understand, that when he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42159:68"/>
is oblig'd to write a History, neither
fear, nor hope, nor threatnings, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nor hatred, nor love, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
nor prejudice to any person,
ought to turn him one single step out
of the direct road of truth, for which
he is accountable to his Reader, if he
intends not to draw upon himself the
contempt and indignation of poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which will never fail to condemn
him for an Impostor and a publick
poisoner.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the Character of
this great Man; in whom nothing
cou'd be censur'd, but that he was
somewhat too timorous, and that he
had not firmness and resolution enough
to give generous and bold advice in
pressing emergencies, so to have cut
up by the root those great evils which
threatned the Government. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when he saw the King, (who
was yet more fearfull than himself,)
amaz'd at the audaciousness of the <hi>Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators;</hi>
And likewise was of opinion,
that if he wou'd have ventur'd, it was
not in his power to have suppress'd the
<hi>League,</hi> knowing also full well that,
the Queen Mother who was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42159:69"/>
Oracle, and who underhand sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
the <hi>League,</hi> would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that the ruine of it shou'd be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd,
and that, on the other side
he was very desirous to draw the King
out of this present plunge; betwixt
both, he took a <hi>trimming</hi> kind of
way, by which he thought he shou'd
be able to preserve the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without the destruction of the
<hi>League.</hi> To this effect, not doubting
but that in case it were not prevented,
they wou'd chuse a Head, who had
power to turn it against the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he advis'd him to declare in that
Assembly, that far from opposing the
<hi>League</hi> of the <hi>Cath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liques</hi> against the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> he was resolv'd to make
himself the Head of it, which they
dar'd not to refuse him, and by that
means wou'd make himself the disposer
of it, and provide that nothing shou'd
be enterpris'd against him.</p>
            <p>And truly this was no ill expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
to check, and give a stop for
some time to the execution of those
vast designs, which were form'd by
the Authours of the <hi>League.</hi> But it
must also be confess'd, that by signing,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42159:69"/>
this, and causing it to be sign'd by
others, as he did, when he declared
himself the Head of it, he authoris'd
those very Articles, which manifestly
shock'd his Royal Authority; put the
<hi>League</hi> in condition, and even gave
it a lawfull right, according to that
Treaty which he approv'd, to act
against himself, in case he shou'd disturb
it, or finally break with it, which was
impossible not to happen in some time;
he infring'd the Peace which he had
given his Subjects by the Edict of
Pacification granted to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
and precipitated <hi>France</hi> into that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless
gulf of miseries, that are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from a Civil War, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
renew'd, and which was of small
advantage to him.</p>
            <p>I shall not describe the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it, because they belong to the
History of <hi>France,</hi> and have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>League,</hi> which on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
acted not, on its own account,
against the Authority of the King.
By whose orders two Armies, the one
commanded by the Duke <hi>d' Alanson,</hi>
the other by the Duke <hi>de Mayenne,</hi>
attacqu'd the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> from whom
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42159:70"/>
they took <hi>La Charite, Issoite, Broüage</hi>
and some other places of less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
I shall onely say, that the King
quickly growing weary of the Cares
of War, which were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uitable to
his humour, loving, as he passionately
did, his ease and pleasures, A new
Peace ensued, which was granted to
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> at the end of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
in the same year, by the Edict of
<hi>Poitiers,</hi> little different from that of
<hi>May,</hi> onely with this reservation, that
the exercise of <hi>Calvinism</hi> was restrain'd
within the limits of the former pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and that it was forbidden, in
the Marquisate of <hi>Salusses,</hi> and the
County of <hi>Avignon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther,<note place="margin">Anno 1579.</note> it was during this interval
of Peace, which was highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> that the King
to strengthen himself against the
<hi>League,</hi> by making himself Creatures,
who shou'd inviolably be ingag'd to
his Service by an Oath, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and more solemn, than that which
universally oblig'd his Subjects; esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
and solemnis'd his new Order
of the Holy Ghost, which is even at
this day, and after the entire revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42159:70"/>
of an Age, one of the most illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
marks of Honour, wherewith
our Kings are accustom'd to reward
the merit and service of the Princes,
and the most signaliz'd Nobility. It
has been for a long time believ'd, that
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, was the Institutour
and Founder of this Order; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
us'd whatever means he cou'd, to
have this opinion establish'd in the
World: But at length the truth is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, which with whatever arts
it is suppress'd can never fail, either
sooner or later, to exert it self, and to
render to a man's person or his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
the blame or praise that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves.</p>
            <p>For it has been found out by a way,
which cannot be suspected of forgery,
and which leaves no farther doubt
concerning this Subject, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this Order is to be referr'd
to another Prince of the Imperial bloud
of <hi>France,</hi> I mean <hi>Louis d' Anjou</hi> styl'd
of <hi>Tarento,</hi> King of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
who in the year, one thousand
three hundred fifty two, instituted in
the Castle <hi>Del Vovo</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Knights of the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42159:71"/>
on the precise day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> by its
constitution containing 25 chapters,
and which, in the style of those times,
thus begins.</p>
            <p>We <hi>Lewis,</hi> by the Grace of God,
King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> to the
Honour of the Holy Ghost, on whose
day we were by Grace, Crown'd King
of our Realms, for the exaltation of
Chivalry, and increase of Honour,
have ordaind, to make a Society of
Knights, who shall be call'd the
Knights of the Holy Ghost, of right
intention; and the said Knights shall
be to the Number of three hundred,
of which we, as beginner and founder
of that said Order, shall be Prince,
as also ought to be all our Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But seeing he died without Children
by Queen <hi>Iane</hi> the first, his Wife, and
that after his death there happen'd
strange revolutions in that Kingdom,
that order so far perish'd with him,
that the memory of it had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
if the Original of that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> had not by some
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42159:71"/>
accident fallen into the possession
of the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> who
made a present of it to <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, at his return from <hi>Poland,</hi> as of
a piece that was very rare, and which
coming from a Prince of the bloud
Royal, of our Kings deserv'd well
to be preserv'd in the Archives of
<hi>France,</hi> which was not the intention
of King <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For finding this Order to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and besides, that it was exactly
calculated for him, because being born
on <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> he had been Crown'd
afterwards on the same day King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> and some time after King of
<hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Tarento,</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his two Crowns of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
and <hi>Sicily,</hi> on the like day before, he
took a fancy to renew that Order, four
years after his Coronation. But desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be esteem'd the Authour of it, he
chang'd the Collar, where he plac'd
certain Ciphers, to which has been
substituted in following times, the
Coat of Arms in manner of a Trophy,
as it is at present to be seen. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had transcrib'd, what best pleas'd
him, from the Statutes of that Order,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42159:72"/>
he commanded <hi>Monsieur de Chiverny</hi>
to burn the Original, thereby totally
to extinguish the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mory of it.</p>
            <p>But that Minister though most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to his Master, believing not that
he was bound to be the Executioner
of that Order, this rare piece descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Bishop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> his Son;
from whom by succession of time, it
fell into the hands of the late Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>de Maisons,</hi> as it is related by
<hi>Monsieur le Laboreur,</hi> who has given
us the Copy at large, in the second
Tome of his Additions to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires
of <hi>Monsieur de Castelnau.</hi> In
this manner, this famous Order was
rather restor'd than instituted, by King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to combine a new
<hi>Militia</hi> of Knights, which he might
oppose against the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who
were much dissatisfi'd with the
Peace, which he had given to the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless this Peace was not so
well observ'd, but that from time to
time they created new disturbances,
which two or three years afterwards
kindled the seventh War, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
they had made, to surrender those
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42159:72"/>
cautionary Towns which had been
granted them for a certain time,
which was then expir'd, and by their
surprisal of some other places. But
this War was ended in the second
year after the conferences of <hi>Nerac,</hi>
and <hi>Fleix,</hi> by a peace which lasted
four or five years till the <hi>League,</hi>
which from the time wherein the King
had made himself their Head, had not
dar'd to attempt any thing, all on
the sudden declar'd it self against him,
under another, the occasion of which
I am going to relate.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the peace was
made, the <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
whom the Civil War had arm'd against
each other, joyn'd themselves to serve
in the Army of the Duke <hi>d' Alanson,</hi>
who being declar'd Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi>
by the States of the United Provinces
of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> entred as it
were in Triumph into <hi>Cambray,</hi> after
he had rais'd the Seige, which the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had laid to it. And
after having been proclam'd a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
at <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Ghent,</hi> in the
same quality, he continued the War,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42159:73"/>
assisted underhand by Succours
from <hi>France,</hi> and openly by the
Queen of <hi>England,</hi> that he might
drive the <hi>Spaniard</hi> out of all the Low-Countries.
On the other side, the
Queen Mother, who had pretentions
to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had also
sent a gallant Navy to the <hi>Tercera
Islands,</hi> under the Command of her
Kinsman <hi>Philip Strozzi,</hi> and openly
protected <hi>Don Antonio;</hi> who after
having lost the Battail before <hi>Lisbonne,</hi>
was fled for refuge into <hi>France,</hi> and
yet ceas'd not to dispute that Crown
against King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> For
which reason that Prince, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Steps of his Father, and of
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his great Grandfather by
the Mother's side, in this as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, thought of nothing more
than how to greaten himself at our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
and appli'd himself with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
vigour, to foment new divisions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, to hinder us from giving
him trouble in his own Estates.</p>
            <p>To this effect he us'd his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and employ'd all his arts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
who after the death of his elder
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42159:73"/>
Brother,<note place="margin">Ann. 1581.</note> was now Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy,</hi>
to break the peace, and renew
the War in favour of the <hi>Huguenots;</hi>
making not the least scruple on that
occasion, to act against the true inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of Religion, at the same time
when he upbraided for the same thing,
those who in reality made the war in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> out of no other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the relief of an oppress'd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of which even the greatest part
were <hi>Catholiques.</hi> But seeing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his cou'd not possibly succeed,
for certain reasons which belong not to
this History, he turn'd his thoughts
towards the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and gave
orders to his Ambassadour <hi>Mendoza,</hi>
to omit nothing which might oblige
him, to make the <hi>League</hi> take Arms,
which was already exceeding power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and of which he might absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispose, as being the principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
and the very Soul of it.</p>
            <p>The Duke who was intrepid, and
bold even to rashness, when he had once
resolv'd upon his Business, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
very subtile, and clear-sighted,
wary, and prudent enough
to take just measures, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42159:74"/>
in any Enterprise, of which he
was not as much assur'd as man cou'd
be, to have all the means of making
it succeed. From thence it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he resisted for a long time
the temptation of great Sums that
were offer'd him, and held out against
the threatnings of the Ambassadour,
to discover the secret treaty he had
made with <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> the
Original of which was in the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s possession; nay even against
the pressing solicitations of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the rest of the Princes of
his House, who being more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and less discerning than he,
thought every minute an age till he
declar'd himself. But at last arriv'd
the fatal moment, in which, after
having well examin'd all matters, he
thought that every thing concurr'd
not onely to favour the design he had
always had, to make himself Head
of the <hi>Catholique League,</hi> but also to
carry his hopes much farther than
his ambition, vast as it was, had yet
led him to imagine.</p>
            <p>In Effect, on the one side, the King
was reduc'd to a lower condition than
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42159:74"/>
he ever was before:<note place="margin">Ann. 1582.</note> his immense pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality

into another, from retirement and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
to a City life, from Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
into Devotion, and such a Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as pass'd in the peoples minds for
a mere Mummery, into those Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Penitents, habited in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
of several colours, where he
walk'd himself with his disciplining

of a Nation, which loves to serve God
in spirit and in truth; these and a
thousand such like things wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our customs, and to the use
of his Predecessours, had drawn upon
him such a detestation, and so great a
contempt from the greatest part of his
Subjects, that against the ordinary
practice of the <hi>French,</hi> who adore
their Kings, there were given a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
publique marks, and principally
in <hi>Paris,</hi> of the aversion which they
had for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:42159:75"/>On the other side, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
in favour of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
to raise him to that high degree of
power, which seem'd to equal him
with the King himself, who in effect
already look'd on him as his Rival;
and as such hated him, without daring
as yet to enterprise ought against him
to prevent his designs, or to shelter
himself against the mischief which he
apprehended from him. The people
united themselves to him, as to their
Protectour, and the pillar of Religion.</p>
            <p>Most of the great men at Court,
discontented at the Government,
threw themselves into his party; the
Ladies, from whom the Minions cou'd
hold nothing, disclos'd to him all the
secrets of the Cabinet, to revenge
themselves of the King whom they
hated mortally, for certain reasons not
so fit to be divulg'd. He was offer'd
to have the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>

            <p>These were indeed strong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to a Prince of his humour, and
who was inclin'd to throw at all. But
that which gave the last stroke to his
determination, was the death of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
the King's onely Brother: who
after his unsuccessfull Enterprise on
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> having been constrain'd to
return dishonourably into <hi>France,</hi> dy'd

or as the common report was of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For about that time it was, that
believing the King wou'd have no
Children, and that the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
might be excluded with ease
from the succession, for more than one
reason, (which he hop'd to make au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique
rather by force of Arms, than
by the Writings of the Doctours of
his Faction) and that the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who hated her Son-in-Law <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
had the same inclination to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him, thereby to advance her
Grand-Child the Prince of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to
the Kingdom, he rais'd his imagination
to higher hopes than what he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42159:76"/>
conceiv'd, when first the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Uncle, had drawn the
platform of a <hi>Catholique League,</hi>
whereof he might make himself the
Head. And on these grounds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
farther balancing the matter, he
resolv'd to take up Arms, and to make
War against the King. But to make
so criminal an enterprise more plausible,
there was yet wanting a pretence,
which in some sort might justifie his
actions to the World; And fortune
produc'd it for him to as much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
as he cou'd desire, almost at the
same time when he had taken up so
strange a resolution.</p>
            <p>As it was impossible that so great a
Conspiracy shou'd be manag'd with
such secrecy, that the King shou'd not
be advertis'd of it, (which in effect
he was from many hands.) That
Prince (who had suffer'd his natural
courage to be made effeminate by the
laziness of a voluptuous retir'd Life,
was become exceeding timorous, and
incapable of coming to any resolution
within himself, to stifle in its birth so
horrible a mischief by some generous
action, and some Master stroke,) had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42159:76"/>
a desire to have near him his Brother-in-Law
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom
he acknowledg'd according to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
Law, for the Heir presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Crown, and knew him to
be the man, who was most capable of
breaking all the measures of the Duke
of <hi>Guise.</hi> But foreseeing that in order
to this, it was necessary that he who
was Head of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> shou'd
first renounce his Heresie, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, he
dispatch'd the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> to him
in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> to perswade him to a thing
of so much consequence, to the ree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablishment
of his fortune, and his
true interest both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.
As that Prince had always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
with much sincerity, that he was
of no obstinate disposition, and that he
was most ready to embrace the truth,
when once it were made to appear
such to him, he receiv'd the Duke
with exceeding kindness; to whom
he gave a private audience in his Clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
in presence of the Lord of <hi>Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laure</hi>
his Confident, of a Minister of
his own Religion, and of the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Ferrier</hi> his Chancellour; who
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42159:77"/>
had always lean'd to the opinion of the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> of which at last he made
profession in his extreme old age, and
some little time before his death.</p>
            <p>In plain terms, that Conference was
not manag'd very regularly, nor with
extraordinary sincerity; for <hi>Espernon</hi>
and <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> who were no great
Doctours, propos'd nothing but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
reasons for his Conversion; and
alledg'd no stronger arguments, than
what were drawn from the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> which they preferr'd incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
beyond the Psalms of <hi>Marot,</hi> the
Lords Supper, and all the Sermons of
the Ministers. But on the other side, the
Minister and the President, who were
much better vers'd in disputation than
the two Courtiers, to destroy those
weak reasons of secular interest, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
no motives, but what they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
to be altogether spiritual and
Soul saving, and the word of God,
which they expounded to their own
meaning, to which those Noble Lords
who understood nothing of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
had not the least syllable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
Insomuch that the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
who piqu'd himself extremely
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42159:77"/>
upon the point of generosity, looking
on it as a most honourable action, for
him to undervalue so great a Crown
at the rate of selling his Conscience
and Religion for it; the Duke was
constrain'd to return as he came,
without having obtain'd any thing
toward the satisfaction of the King.
But what was yet more displeasing in
that affair, was that <hi>Monsieur du Ples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
Mornay,</hi> a Gentleman of an ancient
and illustrious Family, a great wit,
whose Learning was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for a man of his Quality, and who
besides made use of his Pen, as well
as of his Sword; but above all, a most
zealous Protestant, put this conference
into writing, which he also publish'd;
in which having expos'd what was
urg'd on both sides, he pretends to
manifest the advantage which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
had against the <hi>Catholique,</hi> and
that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
convinc'd of the weakness of
our cause, was thereby more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
confirm'd in his own opinion.</p>
            <p>This was the reason why the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> who were
heated with a false Zeal, began to fly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42159:78"/>
out immoderately against the King,
whom they charg'd with a thousand
horrible calumnies, publishing in all
places that he kept Correspondence
with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to whom
he had sent <hi>Espernon,</hi> not with intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of converting him, but rather of
confirming him in his Errours, as it
appear'd sufficiently by the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of that conference, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was urg'd to the advantage of
Religion, but on the contrary, all
things in favour of <hi>Huguenotism.</hi> And
it hapning almost at the same time,
that the King (in order to hinder the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> from resuming their Arms
against the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
them by committing many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
against them without punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
thought himself oblig'd to
grant them that prolongation which
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> demanded, of the
term prescrib'd them for the surrender
of those cautionary places which they
had allow'd them for their security
by the last Edict of Peace: upon
this pretence, the Factious cast off all
manner of respect to him. They cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
publiquely on all occasions,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42159:78"/>
the Preachers from their Pulpits, the
Curats from their Desks, the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
from their Seats, the Professours
in their Lectures, and the Doctours in
their Resolutions which they gave,
that they were oblig'd to oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with all their power against the
King, who supported the <hi>Navarrois,</hi>
and resolv'd, that Heretical and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
as he was, he shou'd nevertheless
succeed to the Crown, which ought
never to be suffer'd, they being assur'd
that this Prince, if ever he shou'd
mount the Throne, wou'd abolish the
<hi>Catholique</hi> Religion in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was that terrible machine, of
which they made use to stir up the
people; over whom there is nothing
has so great a power as the motive of
Religion, when once they are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it will be forceably taken from
them; And to bind them inseparably to
the interests and party of the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> whom they believ'd to have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aim in all his undertakings, than the
maintenance and defence of it against
Heretiques, and the favourers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
But because that Prince, who was
extremely dextrous, had no mind that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42159:79"/>
it shou'd be perceiv'd he acted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
under so specious a pretence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that he believ'd not that it was
safe for him, as yet to attempt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the other Princes of the bloud
from the Succession, they being good
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> he endeavour'd to draw
subtilely into his party, the good old
Man <hi>Charles,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>
And indeed having with great Presents
gain'd the <hi>Sieur de Rubempre</hi> who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
govern'd him; he perswaded
him without much trouble, that he
being by one degree of kindred nearer to
the King, than was the King of <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
his Nephew, it was to him that the
Kingdom belong'd of right, in case
the King shou'd dye without Children,
and that the whole <hi>Catholique League</hi>
wou'd stand by him in his claim with
all their power, were it onely to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an <hi>Huguenot</hi> Prince from succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Crown.</p>
            <p>There needed not more to shake a
Soul, so weak as was that of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>de Bourbon;</hi> who devout as he
was, yet suffer'd himself to be seduc'd
with the vain hopes of Reigning. He
was so much dazled with the false glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42159:79"/>
of an imaginary Crown, that
without considering he had already
one of Cardinalship, that threescore and
ten came fast upon him, and that the
King was not yet thirty five, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Habit of Cardinal, and appear'd
in publique, like the General of an
Army; which gave men occasion to
believe, that his great age had at least
craz'd his understanding, if it had not
quite destroy'd it. Yet this opinion
of the world hinder'd him not, from
calling himself the Heir presumptive
of the Crown, nor from declaring
himself openly the Head of the <hi>League,</hi>
against his Nephew the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre;</hi>
especially when he saw that
party, in which he thought himself
already so firmly rooted, become eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day more powerfull and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
by the conjunction of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>League</hi> of the <hi>Parisians,</hi> which
caus'd such furious disorders, under
the famous name of the <hi>sixteen;</hi>
and which was fram'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> about
this time, in that manner which I am

            <p>After that, by the vigilance of the

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:42159:80"/>
and some other Magistrates, the course
of the League was stopp'd at <hi>Paris,</hi>
where it had begun to make some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
after it had been sign'd by
the <hi>Picards,</hi> all things were in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition there, none daring to
hold any secret Cabals against the
State; till such time as on occasion
of the Conference betwixt the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Duke <hi>d' Espernon</hi>
in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> a malicious report was
rais'd, that the King protected the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi>
who so soon as their Head
should mount the Throne, which he
pretended to be his right, wou'd not
fail to abolish the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion
in <hi>France.</hi> For then it was, that a
mean Citizen of <hi>Paris</hi> call'd <hi>La Roche
Blond,</hi> a man rather weak and silly,
than wicked, prejudic'd by the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which the factious publish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, got it into his head,
through a false zeal of Religion, that
the good <hi>Catholiques</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> shou'd
unite themselves together, and oppose
with all their force the King's designs,
(who, as it was imagin'd, favour'd
the Heretiques) and hinder the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> from his Succession to the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42159:80"/>
Crown. To this purpose, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd
himself immediately to one
Mr. <hi>Matthew de Launoy,</hi> who having
first been a Priest was afterwards the
Minister of <hi>Sedan,</hi> from whence he
had escap'd in his own defence, being
there taken in Adultery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
renouncing his <hi>Calvinism,</hi> was
made Canon of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and at
that time preach'd at <hi>Paris.</hi> He also
communicated his design to two noted
Doctours, and Curats; the one of
Saint <hi>Severin,</hi> nam'd <hi>Iohn Prevost,</hi>
and the other of Saint <hi>Benet,</hi> who was
the famous Mr. <hi>Iohn Boucher,</hi> one of
the most follow'd Preachers of <hi>Paris;</hi>
but whose talent chiefly consisted in
his extreme boldness, which stretch'd
even to impudence, a man more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as it appear'd, to raise a great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
by his violent and furious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
than to preach the Gospel
of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which inspires onely
humility, obedience, and submission to
the higher Powers.</p>
            <p>These men being united all four
in the same opinion, which the Spirit
of Division and Rebellion, disguis'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the specious appearance of Zeal,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42159:81"/>
inspir'd into them, communicated to
each other the names of all their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
acquaintance in <hi>Paris,</hi> who were
most proper to enter into Society with
them, and to lay the foundations of
an Holy Union of <hi>Catholiques</hi> in that
great City; which without farther
deliberation they coucluded to be of
absolute necessity, to preserve Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>France,</hi> and to extinguish Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
for by that name it was that
those factious <hi>Bygots</hi> took the licence
to call the Government. But for fear
of being too soon discover'd by their
multitude, as it had happen'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Paris,</hi> when the project of the
<hi>League</hi> was first broach'd, they agreed
each of them to name two Associats,
of the most con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iding men they knew,
to whom they shou'd communicate
the whole secret of their enterprise.
Upon which, <hi>La roche Blond</hi> chose
the <hi>Sieur Lewis d' Orleans,</hi> a famous
Advocate, and the <hi>Sieur Acarie,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Accompts, who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
ironically call'd the <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quay</hi>
of the <hi>League,</hi> because, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lame, he was one of those who
went and came, and acted with most
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42159:81"/>
earnestness, for the interest of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
The same man, who was Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to that pious <hi>Mary</hi> of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
of whose good example he
profited so ill. The Curat of St. <hi>Benet,</hi>
nam'd <hi>Mignager,</hi> an Advocate, and
<hi>Crucè</hi> a Procureur of Parlament. He
of St. <hi>Severin,</hi> gave his voice for the
<hi>Sieur de Caumont</hi> an Advocate, and a
Merchant, call'd <hi>Compan. Matthew
de Launoy,</hi> who was not yet so well
acquainted in <hi>Paris,</hi> cou'd name but
one, which was the <hi>Sieur de Manaevre,</hi>
Treasurer of <hi>France,</hi> of the House <hi>des
Hennequins.</hi> But to complete the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of eight, they Associated with him
the <hi>Sieur d' Essiat,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,</hi>
who was very well known to
the Curat of St. <hi>Severin,</hi> who made
himself answerable for him.</p>
            <p>These twelve (as I may call them)
false Apostles, were the Founders of
the <hi>League</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> who admirably
counterfeiting zeal for the publick
good, and discoursing of nothing else
amongst their friends in private, but
of the oppressions of the people, of the
avarice and insolence of the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
the correspondence which the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42159:82"/>
King held with the Head of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi>
and the manifest danger in
which they were of losing their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
had immediately made many
Churchmen Proselytes of their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as also Lawyers, and Shop-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as for example, <hi>Iohn Pelletier,</hi>
Curat of St. <hi>Iaques de la Boucherie,
Guincestre</hi> Curat of St. <hi>Gervase, La
Morliere</hi> a Notary, <hi>Rolland</hi> a Collector
of the King's Revenue, the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<hi>Louchard,</hi> the Procureurs, <hi>Emmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
and <hi>La Chapelle,</hi> and <hi>Bussy Le
Clerc,</hi> the most Factious of all the
<hi>Leaguers,</hi> besides many others whose
names are of little consequence to the
History, and who wou'd doe their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
but small credit to be mention'd.</p>
            <p>But to maintain at least some kind
of order, in a design which tended to
the confusion and ruine of the State,
and to take care that their Conspiracy
might take no vent, there was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
establish'd a Council of Ten,
who were selected out of that great
number, to meet together, sometimes
at one man's house, sometimes at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
very secretly; but most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they met at his lodgings who
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42159:82"/>
was the most desperate of them all,
and who during the greatest part of
that time was the leading man in all
deliberations, I mean the Curat of St.
<hi>Benet,</hi> in his chamber at the College
of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and afterwards at the
College of <hi>Forteret,</hi> whither he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
and which afterwards on that
account was call'd the Cradle of the
<hi>League.</hi> Out of these Ten, there were
appointed Six, which were, <hi>La Roche
Blond, Compan, Cruce, Louchart, La
Chapelle</hi> and <hi>Bussy,</hi> amongst whom
the sixteen Wards of <hi>Paris</hi> were distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted,
for them to observe in their
respective Divisions, all that occurr'd,
either to the furtherance, or the
disadvantage of their Plot, and to pick
up those, whom they cou'd draw into
their Faction with most ease: as also
there to put in execution, by their
Accomplices, whatsoever they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
in their Cabal; which not long
after was inlarg'd to the number of
Forty Men, the most considerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. 'Tis upon this account
that the first Union of the <hi>Parisians,</hi>
was call'd the Sixteen, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
not of the persons but of the
Wards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42159:83"/>And, since nothing spreads with so
much ease, and so suddenly, especially
amongst the Common-people, as that
disease which is taken by contagion;
so by the conversation, which these
men, infected with the Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
had by themselves and their
Emissaries, with the false Zealots, the
simple, the Malecontents, the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the greatest part of the populace,
and the meanest sort of Citizens, that
evil, which was infinitely contagious,
was multipli'd with ease, and spread it
self in little time through all the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Town. And it encrea'sd
with so much vigour, that those Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers,
who at their beginning durst
not openly appear, but held their
meetings as privately as they cou'd,
out of their fear to be discover'd, now
believ'd themselves so formidably
strong, and so very numerous, that
none wou'd dare to make head against
them.</p>
            <p>They had even the boldness to send
their Deputies into all the Provinces, to
invite into their new <hi>Association</hi> those
who had declar'd for that of <hi>Peronne,</hi>
who sign'd at this time to a Paper more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42159:83"/>
pernicious than the first. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the other, they promis'd by their
second Article to employ their lives
and fortunes for defence of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third, in his Authority, and to
cause due obedience to be render'd to
him; They swear in this other, that
they enter into the Union with the
<hi>Parisians,</hi> not onely to exterminate the
Heretiques, but also to destroy Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
and Tyranny, that is to say, in
their execrable meaning, to pull down
the Authority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
whom they accus'd of those two crimes
with all injustice imaginable. This
is that, which was call'd the <hi>League</hi> of
Sixteen, which after the former <hi>League</hi>
was joyn'd to it, by its secret Agents
residing in <hi>Paris,</hi> acknowledg'd in
reality the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> for their
Head, and the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in appearance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, that Duke finding
himself to be so powerfully supported,
and all things well dispos'd for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,
as he cou'd possibly desire,
resolv'd at last on execution. To this
effect, being retir'd from Court into
his Government of <hi>Champaign,</hi> under
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42159:84"/>
pretence of some discontent, he went
to <hi>Ioinville,</hi> where (as matters had
been laid before) there met him, at
the same time, the Envoyes of the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and those of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who had taken on
himself the quality of first Prince of
the Bloud, and Heir presumptive of
the Crown. And there, (the Duke act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for himself, and for the Princes
his Confederates,) was concluded a
perpetual <hi>League,</hi> both Offensive and
Defensive, for them, their Allies, and
their Descendants; by which it was
covenanted, That to preserve in <hi>France</hi>
the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion, the Cardinal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> in case the King shou'd
die without Children, shou'd succeed
him, as nearest Heir to the Crown,
from which all the Heretique Princes,
shou'd for ever stand excluded; as also
such of them as were favourers of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques,
and above all, those who
were relaps'd, so that any of them,
who had ever made profession of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
or who had onely given tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to it, shou'd never be judg'd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Reigning. That the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
when King, shou'd banish out
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42159:84"/>
of the Realm all those Heretiques;
shou'd cause all the Decrees of the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be observ'd, and
shou'd solemnly renounce the Alliance
made with the <hi>Turk.</hi> That the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> shou'd furnish every month
fifty thousand Pistoles, for the charges
of the War, which by obligation was
to be made against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and
against the King himself, in case he
shou'd not abandon them. That also
the Cardinal, and the other Princes of
the <hi>League,</hi> shou'd mutually assist His
Catholique Majesty with all their
Forces, in reducing his Rebellious
Subjects of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> under
his obedience, and cause the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Cambray</hi> to be punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
            <p>After this, the Duke receiving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
payment of one half of the
money stipulated for his Pension, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
some levies of <hi>Swisses,</hi> and <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
to be made by the Colonels <hi>Phif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>
and <hi>Christopher de Bassompierre,</hi>
who were entirely at his Devotion.
But before he cou'd draw those Forces
together, the Deputies from the States
of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> about the same
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42159:85"/>
time, coming to make tender of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the King, and pressing him
extremely on behalf of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
to accept the Sovereignty of
those Provinces; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
that fatal blow, and to hinder
him from sending a powerfull Army
into <hi>Flanders</hi> against them, resolving
to make a present diversion, oblig'd
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who by reason of
his ingagement cou'd refuse them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
to begin the War against the
King.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he began it with the
surprise of <hi>Toul,</hi> and of <hi>Verdun,</hi> and
possessing himself of <hi>Chaälon</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zieres,</hi>
of the most considerable Towns
of <hi>Picardy</hi> by his Cousin the Duke <hi>d'
Aumale,</hi> of <hi>Dijon</hi> and the greatest part
of <hi>Bourgogne</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
his Brother, of <hi>Orleans</hi> by the <hi>Sieur
d' Entragues,</hi> of many other places by
his Dependants, and of the City of
<hi>Lyons</hi> it self, by the Souldiers of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Le Passage,</hi> whom the Duke of
<hi>Espernon</hi> had plac'd there, and who
being corrupted by the Emissaries of
the <hi>Guises,</hi> turn'd out their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
who held the Citadel which they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42159:85"/>
themselves demolish'd, and declar'd
openly for the <hi>League,</hi> saying malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in their own excuse, what they
had been taught by the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> that
they wou'd not be damn'd for serving
the King, who was a favourer of
Heretiques, and adding falsely, that
the <hi>Iesuits</hi> whom they had consulted
upon that point, had absolv'd them
from the Oath which they had made
him.</p>
            <p>Now as all the Favourites, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<hi>Espernon,</hi> were as generally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd,
as the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
those two passions love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
joyn'd with hopes of raising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by Civil Wars, ingag'd a great
number of the most considerable and
bravest of the Court, to take part
with the <hi>Leaguers;</hi> And amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Charles de Cosse,</hi> Count, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Duke of <hi>Brissac,</hi> Son to the
great Marshal <hi>de Brissac</hi> Viceroy of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and Brother to the brave
<hi>Timoleon,</hi> Colonel of the <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry,
<hi>Claude de la Chastre,</hi> Bailiff
of <hi>Berry, Francis d' Espinay de Saint
Luc,</hi> the Count of <hi>Randan,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
of <hi>Bois Dauphin,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42159:86"/>
Rane, Claude de Baufremont</hi> Baron of
<hi>Senecey,</hi> who allur'd into it <hi>Anthony
de Brichanteau, Beavais Nangis</hi> his
Brother-in-Law; Son to the Valiant
Marquis <hi>de Nangis, Nicholas de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanteau,</hi>
Knight of the Order, who
died of his wounds receiv'd at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Dreux,</hi> bravely fighting for his
King and his Religion; This generous
Son of his having serv'd the King very
gallantly, both in <hi>Poland</hi> and in
<hi>France,</hi> having also been esteem'd by
him, and admitted into the favour of
his Confidence, was retir'd from Court,
because the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> after
he had carri'd from him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Colonel of the <hi>French</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which had been promis'd him by
the King, caus'd also to be taken from
him that of <hi>Maistre de Camp,</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Guards: in the just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which injury, he was not able
to resist the pressing solicitations of those
two Lords, <hi>de Rane,</hi> and <hi>de Senecey,</hi> who
to draw him along with them into the
Duke of <hi>Guise's</hi> party, made him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
from the Duke, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perform'd to him, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that no
peace shou'd be concluded but upon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42159:86"/>
condition, that <hi>Espernon</hi> his Enemy
shou'd be turn'd out of Court, and that
his charge of Colonel of the <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
shou'd be restor'd; farther assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, that he shou'd exercise the same
Command in the Army of the <hi>League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it may be seen how much the
haughty and injurious proceeding of
that Favourite, was advantageous to the
Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> Therefore whenone of
his Captains, who had heard him make
great complaints of the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
offer'd himself to murther him, as
he pass'd through <hi>Chaälons</hi> in his return
from <hi>Metz,</hi> by no means (reply'd he)
I shou'd be very sorry he were dead; for
he gives us many gallant men, who
wou'd never ingage in our party, if the
desire of revenging so many intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
affronts, as are daily put on the
worthiest of the Court, by that little
Cadet of <hi>Gascony,</hi> did not bring them
over to us.</p>
            <p>In this manner the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
made himself every day more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
both by the peoples love to him,
and their hatred to the Favourites.
Insomuch that the King seeing so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
a party arm'd against him,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42159:87"/>
was forc'd to answer the <hi>Low Country</hi>
Deputies, with tears in his Eyes, that
in his present condition, he was not
able to accept their offers, as he wou'd
certainly have done in a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
conjuncture, which never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
befell him. Observe now the
first Exploit of the <hi>League,</hi> which if
it had never occasion'd any other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
than this to have hinder'd the
reuniting of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> to us,
which were the first Conquest of our
Crown, and the most ancient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our Kings, 'tis most certain that
for this onely reason, it ought to be had
in detestation by all good <hi>Frenchmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which ought to render it
yet more odious, is that they did not
onely take up Arms in manifest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against their King, but also
tim'd it so unluckily and mischievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that far from exterminating the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> which they made a show
to desire, they hinder'd by that War
the ruine of <hi>Huguenotism,</hi> which was
mouldring insensibly by the Peace.
And truly all things were dispos'd in
such a manner, that had they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
never so little longer in that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42159:87"/>
peaceable Estate they then enjoy'd,
there is hardly any doubt to be made,
but that Heresie which grew every
day weaker, wou'd in the end have
crumbled into nothing. Most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the King who mortally hated the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi>
which appear'd but too visibly
in the Massacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> and
who was not able to destroy them by
force, had taken his measures so surely,
by changing that manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that he had infallibly compass'd
his ends by the Peace he gave them,
had it continu'd a while longer.</p>
            <p>For at that very time, when the
Duke who was so long in demurring,
e'er he came to a resolution, at last
took Arms, under pretence of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
Heresie in <hi>France;</hi> 'tis well
known, that there were not remaining
above twenty Ministers in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
on this side the <hi>Loire:</hi> none of
them writ any thing against the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi>
Religion, neither was there
any <hi>Huguenot</hi> in Office or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who
was Head of that Party, at that time
was desirous of nothing more, than to
return into the King's favour, and that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42159:88"/>
he might deserve that Honour, he
had not long before advertis'd him,
that the same <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
who affected to appear with so much
ostentation, the great Defender of the
<hi>Catholique</hi> Faith against the Protestants,
had proffer'd him large Sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and promis'd to assist him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<hi>Guyenne</hi> under his Command,
on condition that he wou'd break the
Peace, which the King had given to
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and cause them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
their Arms, to which he wou'd
never give consent. In like manner
the King, who held himself assur'd of
him, fail'd not to advise him, that he
shou'd beware of some secret practices
amongst the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who began to be
suspicious of his conduct, and that by no
means he shou'd permit any other but
himself to be Head and Protectour of
that Party. Thus it was to have been
hop'd, that under favour of this Peace
which had disarm'd the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
they wou'd have been reduc'd insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
if the <hi>Leaguers</hi> by taking up
Arms to force the King, as in effect
they did, to break the Peace which he
had given them, had not necessitated
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42159:88"/>
them to recommence the War, which
in the progress of it was favourable to
them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, amidst the many
good Fortunes which happen'd to the
<hi>League</hi> in the overture of the War,
they had the displeasure of failing in
their endeavours to possess themselves
of two very considerable Cities in the
Kingdom; and such as had render'd
them absolute Masters of <hi>Provence</hi> and
<hi>Guyenne.</hi> The one was <hi>Marseilles,</hi>
which the second Consul, feigning to
have receiv'd Orders from the King
to invade the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> had put into
commotion, and was just ready to
have deliver'd it into the hands of the
<hi>Guisards;</hi> but being circumvented and
taken, by some honest Citizens who
had discover'd his Treason, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
hang'd, and appeas'd by his
death the Sedition, which he had rais'd
to have betray'd them. <hi>Lodowick de
Gonzaga</hi> Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> was accus'd
as Authour of that Enterprise, in hope
to have seis'd the Government of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi>
but he most constantly deni'd
it. And as about that time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
the <hi>League;</hi> the Duke of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42159:89"/>
               <hi>Guise</hi> his Brother-in-Law upbraided
him, that he had never done it, but
out of shame and vexation to have
miss'd his blow. He on the other side
protested, that he chang'd Parties one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the satisfaction of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which oblig'd him so to doe. On
which Subject to justifie his procedure,
he affirm'd, that he had never enter'd
into the <hi>League,</hi> but that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
told him, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had
licens'd and approv'd of it; But that
having some reasons to suspect the
contrary, he had sent three several
times to <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the thirteenth,
to be satisfi'd of his doubts, and nam'd
the Messenger, who was Father <hi>Claude
Matthew</hi> a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> call'd the Post of
the <hi>League,</hi> because he was in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
motion betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi>
employ'd in the Business of the Holy
Union, of which he was a most ardent
and zealous Factour. And that Duke
positively affirm'd, that after all, he
cou'd never draw from the <hi>Pope</hi> any
kind of approbation, not so much as
by word of mouth, much less in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for he always answer'd, that he
cou'd never see into the depth of that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42159:89"/>
affair,<note place="margin">Ann. 1585.</note> and therefore wou'd not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in it.</p>
            <p>The other Town which the <hi>League</hi>
miss'd of surprizing was <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
where the most zealous <hi>Catholiques,</hi>
who were enrag'd against the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
endeavour'd to have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters for the <hi>League,</hi> and had
already advanc'd their Barricades to
the very Lodgings of Marshal <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon</hi>
their Governour, a faithfull
Servant to the King, and a declar'd
Enemy to the <hi>Guises:</hi> But that Lord,
equally Wise, Valiant and Resolute,
knew so well by address to manage
the minds of those Citizens, that ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for himself a passage through the
Barricades, without other Arms than
a Sword by his side, and a riding Rod
in his hand, he seiz'd on one of the
Gates, through which causing some
of his Troops to enter, who were not
far from thence, he not onely assur'd
himself of the Town, but also got pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of <hi>Chateau Trompette,</hi> after
having seiz'd the Governour, who was
suspected by him, and who was so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
silly, to come out of the Castle and
take part of an Entertainment, to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42159:90"/>
which the Marshal had invited the
chiefest of the Town.</p>
            <p>To proceed, at the same time when
the <hi>League</hi> took Arms, and began the
War, with surprizing by Strategem,
or taking by force so many places from
the King, they publish'd their Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
under the name of the Cardinal
<hi>de Bourbon,</hi> who by the most caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
weakness that can be imagin'd,
had got into his head, at the Age of
threescore and so many years, that he
shou'd succeed a King, who was yet
in the flower of his Youth. That
Cardinal in that paper, having bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the King, and the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
with all the venom, which
the factious ordinarily threw upon
those two Princes, to make them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to the people, concludes that
his party had taken Arms, onely to
preserve Religion, exterminate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
to Banish from the Court those
who abus'd the King's Authority,
and to restore the three Orders of
the Realm, to their primitive Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
            <p>The Proclamation of a King against
his rebellious Subjects, ought to be no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42159:90"/>
other but a good Army, which he may
have in a readiness long before them,
and reduce them to reason e'er they
have time and means to gather Forces
sufficient to oppose their Sovereign.
This was what the King was advis'd
to have done, by his best Servants,
and especially by the Lord <hi>Iohn d'
Aumont,</hi> Count of <hi>Chateau-Rou,</hi> and
Marshal of <hi>France:</hi> He, whose invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
fidelity in the Service of the
Kings his Masters, and his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Courage, tri'd in so many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
joyn'd with a perfect knowledge
of all that belongs to a great Captain,
have render'd him one of the most illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious
persons of that Age. This faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Servant, not able to endure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the insolence of the Rebels, or
the too great mild<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ess of his Master,
advis'd him resolutely, that with his
Guards, and the old Regiments which
he might suddenly form into
an Army, he shou'd immediately
March into <hi>Champaign,</hi> and there fall
upon the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who were yet in
no condition to oppose him.</p>
            <p>And truly it appear'd but too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that this was the Counsell which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42159:91"/>
ought to have been follow'd. For at
the beginning of this first War of the
<hi>League,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> (to whom
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after such magnificent
promises of so many thousand Pistoles,
had not yet paid one besides his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,)
was not able with all his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and his cunning, to raise above
five thousand men, the greatest part
of which were of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Troops, who
came stragling in by a File at a time,
and whom the King, had there yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
alive in his Soul but one spark
of that Fire, which once so Nobly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
him, when being Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi>
he perform'd so many gallant actions,
might have easily dispers'd with his
Household Troops, and such of the
Nobility as were about him, who had
been immediately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow'd by the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of the Nation, had they once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him but on Horseback.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, <hi>Beavais Nangis,</hi>
who was infinitely surpris'd to find
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> at <hi>Chaälons,</hi> so
thinly attended by his Troops, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded of him what were his
intentions, in case the King shou'd fall
upon him before he had assembled
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42159:91"/>
greater Forces, he answer'd him coldly,
that then he had no other way to take,
but to retire into <hi>Germany</hi> with what
speed he cou'd. But the Queen Mother,
who held a Correspondence at that time
with the <hi>Guises,</hi> and that fatal love which
the King had to a lazy quiet life, which
he cou'd not quit without extreme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance,
and which immediately
replung'd him into his pleasant dreams,
wherein he seem'd to be enchanted,
render'd fruitless so wholsome an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Insomuch that he satisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with making a feeble and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Declaration, wherein answering
the Conspiratours in a kind of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfull
way, as if he fear'd to give
them any manner of offence, he seem'd
rather to plead his Innocence before
his Judges, than to speak awfully to
his Rebels like a King; and in the mean
time gave leisure to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
to form a Body of Ten or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and about Twelve hundred
Horse.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> at whom the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> particularly aim'd, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
make his Declaration, which he
address'd to the King, and to all the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42159:92"/>
Princes and Potentates of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but he made it in a manner,
which was worthy of the greatness of
his courage, by the masculine and
eloquent Pen of <hi>Du Plessis Mornay;</hi>
who particularly understood how to
serve his Master according to his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
For, after having generously refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the calumnies, with which the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
charg'd him, he made protestation
that he was no ways an Enemy to the
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> nor to their Religion, which
he was most ready to embrace, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he shou'd be instructed by
another method, than what was us'd
to him after St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Dagger to his Throat. After
which, he declar'd, that all those who
had the malice, or the impudence,
to say that he was an Enemy to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and to the State, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to oppress either of them, by
an imaginary <hi>League,</hi> which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppos'd to have been made to that
intent at <hi>Madgburg,</hi> with respect to
the King's Honour, Lyed in their
throats, and above all others the Duke
of <hi>Guise;</hi> and humbly begg'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
permission, without regard to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42159:92"/>
his being first Prince of the bloud, that
for once he might levell himself to an
equality with him, to the end that they
might decide their quarrel, by the
way of Arms, singly betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or by a Duel, two to two, ten
to ten, or twenty against twenty, to
spare the effusion of so much bloud, as
must inevitably be shed in a Civil War.</p>
            <p>But though he did his uttermost to
excite in the King a generous resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Arming himself against his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
though he offer'd to Combat
them in his own person, and with all
his Forces, in conjunction with those
<hi>Catholiques</hi> who were Enemies to the
<hi>League,</hi> and that he assur'd him of
powerfull Succours from <hi>England</hi> and
from <hi>Germany,</hi> which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
yet cou'd he never strike more
fire out of that irresolute soul, than
onely some faint sparks of a languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and impotent anger, which his
fear and effeminacy soon quench'd;
like those weak motions which men
seem to make in frightfull dreams,
when they rowze themselves a little
but immediately yield to the force
of sleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:42159:93"/>
'Tis acknowledg'd that he made E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
against them, injoyning them to
lay down Arms, and commanding all
his Subjects to ring the Larum Bells
against them, and to cut them in pieces
if they disobey'd. He summon'd the
Nobility, and Princes of the bloud to
attend him: he gave Commissions,
and issued out Orders, to make a great
Levy of <hi>Reiters</hi> and <hi>Swisses,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Guards to be in a readiness
to march to the rendesvouz, which
shou'd be appointed them. But after
all, the insuperable passion which he
had for quiet and the soft pleasures of
the Cabinet, and the fear of the <hi>League</hi>
with which he was possess'd by the
Queen Mother, who held intelligence
with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
his Forces incomparably beyond
the life, together with the advice of
some of his Council, who had rather
he shou'd arm against the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
his faithfull Subject, than against
<hi>Catholiques</hi> though Rebels, brought
the matter to that pass at length, that
he grew colder than ever, and left all
things to the management of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom he gave full power of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42159:93"/>
treating with the Associated Princes,
and even of concluding as soon as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
she cou'd with them, on what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
she shou'd please.</p>
            <p>Thus, after a Conference begun at
<hi>Epernay,</hi> and afterwards finish'd at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
on the Seventh of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1585.
a Peace was concluded with the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi>
granting them whatsoever they
cou'd demand, either for Religion,
or for themselves.</p>
            <p>For what concern'd Religion, an
Edict was made, by which revoking
all those that had formerly been
granted in favour of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
all exercise of the pretendedly reform'd
Religion was prohibited: The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
were all commanded to depart
the Kingdom a month after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of the Edict, and all the
King's Subjects enjoyn'd to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
profession of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith
within Six months, on pain of banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And, for the interest of the
Confederate Princes, who affected
above all things to have it believ'd,
that their principal aim was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, a
ratification was made of all which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42159:94"/>
they had done, as onely undertaken
for the maintenance of Religion, and
service of the King: and besides, there
was a promise made them, that they
shou'd command the Armies which
were to put this Edict in Execution;
and to make War against the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
in case they refus'd submission to
it. And for places of Caution, besides
<hi>Thoul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> of which they had
possess'd themselves at first, there
were granted them three Towns in
<hi>Champaign, Rheims, Chaälons</hi> and St.
<hi>Dizier; Ruë</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> besides those
of which they were already Masters
in that Province, which had declared
first of all others for the <hi>League. Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
in the Isle of <hi>France:</hi> in <hi>Bretagne
Dinan,</hi> and <hi>Concarneau;</hi> and <hi>Dijon</hi> and
<hi>Beaune</hi> in <hi>Bourgogne.</hi> Yet more, there
was money given them to pay the
Souldiers they had Levied; and to the
Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> to the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> his two Brothers, and their
Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns the Dukes of <hi>Mercaeur,</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi>
and of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> to each of them
a Company of <hi>Arquebusiers</hi> (or Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons)
on Horseback, maintain'd for
their Guard, as if they resolv'd by so
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42159:94"/>
glaring a mark of honour to make
ostentation of their triumph over the
King, against whom they had newly
gain'd so great a victory without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
onely by the terrour of their
Arms; which contrary to the order
of Nature, made, of a Master and a
Sovereign, the Slave, and Executo rof
the good will and pleasure of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>Such was the Edict of <hi>Iuly,</hi> which
was extorted from the weakness of the
King; who immediately perceiv'd, that
instead of securing Religion, and his own
repose, by granting all things to the
<hi>League,</hi> as he was made to believe he
shou'd, he had plung'd himself into a
furious War, which might have been
extremely dangerous to Religion, if the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> had overcome the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.</hi>
'Tis what he himself took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of when amidst the acclamations
and cries of <hi>Vive le Roy,</hi> which resoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from every part, when he went in
Person to the Parliament, to cause the
Edict to be inroll'd, he was not able to
hold from saying to some about him,
with a sigh, I much fear, that in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about to destroy the Preachments,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42159:95"/>
we shall hazard the Mass; which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he repeated more than once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
several occasions.</p>
            <p>And truly as he had foretold, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon the publication of the
Edict, the War was kindled through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all <hi>France.</hi> For, when the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> had notice that the King
had verified the Edict, which was in
reality a solemn declaration of War
against him, he united himself more
firmly than ever with the Prince of
<hi>Condè</hi> and the whole <hi>Huguenot</hi> Party,
in an Assembly which was held for that
purpose, at <hi>Bergerac.</hi> And these two
Princes going from <hi>Guyenne</hi> into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,</hi>
to the Marshal Duke of <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy,</hi>
who was Governour of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
gave him so well to understand,
that it was not onely his particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to oppose the <hi>Guises,</hi> who lov'd
him not, but also for the service of
the King, whose Authority was struck
at, and for the preservation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
whose foundations the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi>
were undermining, by open
breach of the <hi>Salique</hi> Law, that they
brought him over into their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
with the whole party of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42159:95"/>
who had ever acknowledg'd
him their Head.</p>
            <p>Thus, instead of the <hi>Catholiques</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> as
they had always been, during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Reigns under <hi>Henry</hi> the Third
and his Successour, they were divided
into two parties; whereof one was
the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> and the other the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques;</hi>
who by another name were
call'd the Royalists. And at that time
it was manifestly visible, that the War
had no reference to Religion, as those
of the <hi>League</hi> pretended, but was a
War purely of State Interest; since the
Duke of <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> Head of those
<hi>Catholiques</hi> who were united with the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> to maintain the Authority
of the King, and the Royal Family, as
was declar'd in their Manifest of the
Tenth of <hi>August,</hi> shew'd himself on all
occasions a most zealous Defender of
Religion; therein following the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Great Constable his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that he protected it so
well in his Government, that the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> cou'd scarcely bring the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> to confide in him; because he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42159:96"/>
always oppos'd the progress of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in that Province. He also exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Zeal into the County of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and hinder'd Heresie there from
taking root: For which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the
thirteenth, thought fit to make him
great acknowledgments in many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
It was not therefore with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of ruining Religion that the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as Head of the <hi>Huguenots</hi>
being united with one part of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,</hi>
made that War; but for
preservation of the King and State,
which the <hi>League</hi> endeavour'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press;
as the King himself understood
it to be, not long time after, declaring
that he had not a better servant than
the <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>Montmorancy.</hi> And
such indeed did he always continue,
so firm to the interest of that Prince,
and of his Successour the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
that the latter of them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
him as a Father, by which
name he first call'd him, and afterwards
being King of <hi>France,</hi> made him
Constable in recompence of his great
deserts and service to the State: And
from that time forward, that he
might treat him with the same kindness
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42159:96"/>
which <hi>Henry</hi> the Second used to <hi>Anne
de Montmorancy,</hi> the Father of this
Duke, he never call'd him by any
other name, than that of Partner.
Thus, by the joyning of those Forces
which so great a Man brought over
with him to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that
generous Prince was in a condition to
defend himself at least against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>League;</hi> who were not onely
countenanc'd by the authority of the
King, whom they had as it were dragg'd
into that War, but also drew great
advantages from those Spiritual thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
which the Pope darted the
same year against the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those of the <hi>League</hi> had more than
once already employed their utmost
interest with Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
to obtain of him, that he
wou'd approve the Treaty of their <hi>Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation;</hi>
a thing they passionately desir'd:
And being on the point of declaring
themselves more openly than they had
yet done, and to take Arms, after
the death of the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> they
renew'd their solicitations to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
more earnestly than ever, to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42159:97"/>
obtain from him that Declaration,
thereby to authorize their attempts,
and insinuate themselves the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hearts of those people, who were
obedient to the Holy See. To this
effect they dispatch'd once more to
<hi>Rome,</hi> Father <hi>Claude Matthew,</hi> who,
according to his custome, fail'd not
to apply himself to the Cardinal of
<hi>Pellevè,</hi> the most stiff Partisan which
the <hi>League</hi> ever had, and the Eternal
Solicitour of their Cause in the Court of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cardinal was descended of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and illustrious house in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
(as 'tis deliver'd to us by the <hi>Sieur de
Brantome</hi>) from whence are issued the
Marquesses <hi>de Beury,</hi> and the <hi>Counts de
Flers.</hi> Which ought to mortifie those
hot Writers, who in hatred to the
<hi>League,</hi> have traduc'd him as a man of
mean Parentage, who from a Scullion
of a College, came to be a Servitour,
or Sizer, to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
'Tis true indeed, that because there
was not much to be had out of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
which was to be divided in
shares amongst eight Brothers, he put
himself into the service of that Cardinal,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42159:97"/>
who made him Steward of his House.
But it is not to be inferr'd from thence
as some have maliciously done,
that he was of low Extraction; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it to be denied, that he had
many good qualities, which being
supported by the credit of the House
of <hi>Guise,</hi> to which he was entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted,
gain'd him the esteem of <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second, who made him Master
of Requests, and bestow'd on him the
Bishoprick of <hi>Amiens,</hi> from whence,
sometime after, he was translated to
the Archbishoprick of <hi>Sens,</hi> by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of <hi>Lewis</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> who
also procur'd the Hat for him. So
many benefits receiv'd from that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull
family, bound him so firmly,
and with so blind a passion to the
interest of the <hi>Guises,</hi> that he us'd his
utmost endeavours, in favour of the
<hi>League</hi> against <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, even
after the conversion of that Prince;
till seeing at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he then
resided, the entry of that victorious
King, to the incredible joy of all the
<hi>Parisians,</hi> he di'd of anguish and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42159:98"/>
Now this Cardinal and Father <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
well hop'd, that his Holiness
seeing the <hi>League</hi> become so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that it was in a condition of
making War, wou'd declare for it,
at that time. On this expectation,
they renewed with great warmth the
Solicitations which they had often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made to him; and continued
to ply him till his death; which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
the same year, without their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
from him any part of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions.</p>
            <p>He had for Successour that famous
Cordelier, <hi>Felix Peretti,</hi> Cardinal of
<hi>Montalto,</hi> when he was created Pope,
call'd <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth. He who from
the most miserable way of living, to
which he was reduc'd by the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
meanness of his birth, as being
no better than a Hogherd in his
Youth, rais'd himself step by step,
by his merit and his industry, to the
Triple Crown; which he wore more
haughtily during the five years of his
Pontificate, than his Predecessours had
done for many Ages. As he had
been a great Inquisitour, and one of
the most severe who had ever exercis'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42159:98"/>
that office, those Agents of the <hi>League,</hi>
in conjunction with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
they shou'd easily obtain his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and that joyning his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Arms with their Temporal, he
wou'd thunder out his <hi>Anathema</hi> against
the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they mistook the Man with
whom they had to deal: for as he
was of an humour extremely fierce,
haughty, imperious, and inflexible,
and wou'd give the World to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that he was govern'd by no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
but his own, and least of any by
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom he hated, he
immediately took up an air of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in his discourse with them, which
made them find to their cost, that he
suffer'd not himself to be deluded with
appearances, and that he was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
as discerning as he was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.
In effect, they were infinitely
surpriz'd to find they had not the least
power upon a Soul, which they then
understood to be of quite another
make, than what he formerly appear'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so moderate, so humble, so soft and
so complying, when he was Cardinal,
with his head stooping towards the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42159:99"/>
earth, and looking there (as he own'd
afterwards himself) for the Popedom,
which finally he found.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, as on the other
side he thought he had a fair occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to make an ostentatious shew of
the Supreme power of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which he coveted to make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to the whole World, by some
extraordinary manner of procedure,
he made a little time afterwards of
his own mere motion, and when no
body importun'd him, a most thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Bull against the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> For after he
had in it exalted infinitely the Power
and Authority Pontifical, above all
Kings and Potentates of the Earth, so
far as to affirm, that he cou'd over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
their Thrones, by pronouncing
irrevocable judgment upon them,
whensoever they shou'd be wanting
to their duty, and trample them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his feet as Ministers of Satan;
and after having rail'd at large, in the
rudest and most contemptuous words
he cou'd invent against those two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he deprives them at last of all
their Estates and Demeans, of which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42159:99"/>
they then stood possess'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
them incapable, both in their
own persons and in their posterity, for
ever to succeed to any Estate or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
whatsoever, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> absolves
from their Oath of Fidelity all their
Vassals and their Subjects, whom he
forbids most strictly to obey them;
and gives notice to the King of <hi>France</hi>
to assist in the execution of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.</p>
            <p>As much as this Bull, which was
sign'd by five and twenty Cardinals,
and sent by the <hi>Pope</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd
the party of the <hi>League,</hi> who
took care to publish it, so much did it
afflict those <hi>Catholiques</hi> and good
<hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who were opposite to
that Faction: They were not able to
endure, that the <hi>Popes</hi> (who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been in subjection to Kings and
Emperours, whom they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to obey, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Great protests to the Emperour
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urice,</hi> and the <hi>Popes Leo</hi> the fourth
and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to our Kings <hi>Lothaire</hi>
and <hi>Childebert,</hi>) shou'd now dare to
think of deposing them, and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42159:100"/>
their Subjects from their Oath of
Allegiance, against the declar'd Law
of God, which enjoyns Obedience in
so many places of the Scripture, even
when Kings shou'd be wanting to their
Duty.</p>
            <p>God, (said they) has so divided
those two Powers, the Temporal, and
the Spiritual, amongst Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on the one side; and on the other
betwixt the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> who are
Princes of the Church, that as it is
not lawfull for the secular Power to
interfere with that of the Spiritual, nor
to lay hands upon the Censer, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it lawfull for the Spiritual to
attempt any thing against the Secular,
by abusing that Ghostly Authority
which was bequeath'd to them by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> onely to exercise in those
affairs which are not of the World;
in the Government of which, they
have no manner of concernment, to
intermeddle either directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
much less have they the power of
deposing Princes, and of hindring (by
the censures, and fulminations of the
Church,) the due obedience of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to their Sovereigns. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42159:100"/>
that the Doctrine opposite to
this, sustain'd by some Writers on the
other side of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to flatter and
sooth the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had always
been condemn'd by the decisions of
the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, by the decrees
of Parliaments, and by the protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which our Kings have often
made against this Invasion of their
Prerogative, unheard of in the Church
of God, during more than eleven A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and never admitted in the <hi>French</hi>
Nation.</p>
            <p>And while I am writing this part
of my History, on this instant twenty
third day of <hi>March,</hi> I am inform'd
that there is a perpetual and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Edict enregister'd in the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
by which <hi>Louis the Great,</hi> who
well knows how to maintain with so
much power the rights of his Crown,
and with so much piety those of the
Church, ordains that the absolute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence
of Kings, in Temporal
affairs, (which no Authority whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shall presume to shock, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly on whatsoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,)
shall be maintain'd and taught
in his Dominions by the professours of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42159:101"/>
Divinity, Seculars and Regulars, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
to what the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Clergy, representing the
<hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, has solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
in expounding the opinion,
which both it self and we are bound
to receive on that Subject.</p>
            <p>To pursue our History, the Bull
of <hi>Sixtus</hi> no sooner appear'd in <hi>France,</hi>
through the care of the <hi>Leaguers</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
it, but a multitude of Writers
answer'd it, both of the one and the
other Religion, who agreed in one and
the same Doctrine, of the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Kings on any other power
but that of God alone in reference to
their Crowns: shewing the invalidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that pretended Authority of
<hi>Popes,</hi> some quietly contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the force of reason, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               </gap> the weakest and least knowing,

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42159:101"/>
But that Writer whoever he were, had
more strongly maintain'd the rights of
Sovereigns, had he written with a
more moderate Zeal, without giving
the reins to his passion against <hi>Popes,</hi>
towards whom, even when we blame
their failings in some particulars, we are
never permitted to be wanting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</p>
            <p>The Parliament which is always
vigorous in opposing such Attempts,
fail'd not to make their most humble
Remonstrations to the King, worthy
of the Wisedom, and Constancy,
which that August Body makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
on all occasions relating to the
defence of the rights of the Crown,
and the privileges of the Realm.
The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> added his own
to these, wherein he represents to the
King, that His Majesty was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
than he, not to suffer this inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and unmaintainable attempt of
<hi>Sixtus.</hi> And as he thought himself
oblig'd, by some extraordinary and
high manner of proceeding, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the affront which was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in that Bull, wherein he was
treated so unworthily, He both had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42159:102"/>
the courage, and found the means, of
fixing even upon the Gates of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican,</hi>
his solemn Protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. In which, after having
first appeal'd, as of an abuse, to the
Court of Peers, and to a general
Council, as superiour to a <hi>Pope,</hi> he
protests the Nullity of all <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure:
And farther adds, That as the
Princes and Kings his Predecessours
have well known how to repress <hi>Popes,</hi>
when they forgot themselves, and
pass'd beyond the bounds of their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
by confounding Temporals
with Spirituals, so he Hopes that God
will inable him to revenge upon <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
the injury which is done in his
Person to the whole House of <hi>France,</hi>
imploring for this purpose the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and assistance of all the Kings,
and Princes, and Republiques of
Christendom, who as well as himself
are assaulted in that Bull.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Pope Sixtus,</hi> following the
bent of his own temper, which was
naturally violent and inflexible, revok'd
not his Bull for this; nevertheless,
as he had a Soul that was truly great,
he cou'd not but acknowledge that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42159:102"/>
this action was extremely generous;
nor cou'd he hinder himself from tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, that he
wish'd the King his Master had as
much courage and resolution against
his real Enemies, as the <hi>Navarrois</hi>
had made appear against those who
hated his Heresie, but not his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>But that wish of his was very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
for that poor spirited Prince was
in such awe of the <hi>League,</hi> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Remonstrances were made him,
and though the example of the late
King his Brother was propos'd to him,
who had acted with much more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
on the like occasion, on behalf
of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom they
endeavour'd to have depos'd at <hi>Rome,</hi>
that he durst never permit any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to that Bull. Insomuch that
he contented himself barely, with
not allowing it to be judicially pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
in <hi>France,</hi> without so much as
once demanding of the <hi>Pope</hi> that he
wou'd revoke it, as <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth
had done, who by a manly protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
constrain'd <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the Fourth
to recall that Bull, which he had
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42159:103"/>
made against Queen <hi>Iane d' Albret.</hi>
This was the effect of that fear, so
unworthy of a King, which <hi>Henry</hi> the
Third had of the <hi>League;</hi> which take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advantage of his weakness, became
more arrogant and more audacious to
oblige him, as in effect it did, in spight
of his repugnance, to infringe that
Peace which he had given to <hi>France,</hi>
and to make War against the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who had at all times most
punctually obey'd him, even when he
forbad him to take Arms, and to March
in defence of him against the <hi>League.</hi>
All he cou'd obtain of that party was
by gaining a little time to keep matters
from coming to extremity, (the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence of which he
well foresaw.) And to this purpose
<hi>Messire Philip de Lenoncour,</hi> who was
afterwards Cardinal, and the President
<hi>Brulart,</hi> with some Doctours of the
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orbonne,</hi> were sent by him to the
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to persuade him to
return into the Communion of the
<hi>Catholique</hi> Church, and to suspend the
Exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> at least for the
space of six Months, during which,
some expedient might be found to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42159:103"/>
accommodate all things amicably.</p>
            <p>A better choice cou'd not possibly
be made, for the treating an Affair of
that importance, than was the person
of that famous <hi>Nicholas de Brulart,</hi>
Marquis of <hi>Sillery,</hi> whose approv'd fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
in the Service of our Kings,
and whose Wisedom and ripe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in the management of affairs,
were at length recompens'd by <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth, by conferring on him the
highest Honours of the Robe, in which
Office he gloriously ended his days,
under the Reign of the late King.
'Tis the distinguishing character of
that illustrious House, to have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of being able to reckon,
amongst the great men who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from it, two Chamberlains of
Kings, one Master of the Engines and
Machines, one Commandant of the
Cavalry, kill'd at the Battail of <hi>Agin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi>
in fighting for his Country,
one Procureur General, and three
Presidents of the Parlament of <hi>Paris,</hi>
two Premier Presidents of the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> and above all a
Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi> to consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the Honour of their House, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42159:104"/>
one of the most splendid titles of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
which the Sword or long Robe
can bestow.</p>
            <p>'Twas then this excellent Person,
who was joyn'd in Commission with the
<hi>Sieur</hi> of <hi>Lenoncour,</hi> for this important
Negotiation. Because it was hop'd from
his address, and the mildness of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
which was insinuating and
persuasive, that he above all others,
wou'd be able to win the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
to a compliance with his Majesties
desire, that he might not be constrain'd
against his own inclinations, to bring
a War upon him. But as that happy
hour was not yet come; And that it
was an ill expedient to procure the
Conversion of a Man, and especially
of a Great Prince, who has where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
to defend himself when he is
attacqu'd, to bring Faith to him with
threatning, like a Chalenge, and to
shew him the Arms which are in a
readiness to constrain him; he onely
answer'd that he had always been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
as he then was, to receive the
instructions which shou'd be given
him, according to the Decisions of
a free General Council, and not with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42159:104"/>
a Dagger at his Throat, which was
the Argument they us'd to him, after
the Massacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was therefore a necessity at
last of coming to a War, according to
the wishes of the <hi>League;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it was able to overwhelm at one
push, both that Prince and his whole
party, before he cou'd be recruited
with Foreign Forces: But it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
deceiv'd in that expectation.</p>
            <p>For of the two Armies, which the
King was oblig'd, according to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Nemours,</hi> to give to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of two <hi>Lorrain</hi> Princes, the one
to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in opposition to
the <hi>Germans,</hi> if they shou'd attempt
an entrance into <hi>France,</hi> to which
they had been solicited by the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
the other to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
for his expedition into <hi>Guyenne</hi> against
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whose defeat
and ruine the <hi>Leaguers</hi> concluded to
be inevitable; the last of the two, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Campaign of ten Months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
performance of any thing, but
onely the taking in some few places
of small importance, which afterwards
were easily retaken, was in a manner
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42159:105"/>
wholly ruin'd, and dissipated for want
of Money, of Provisions, and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
of a train of Artillery, and
other Supplies, which were always
promis'd them, but never sent them;
and especially by the ill intelligence,
which was betwixt the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi>
and the Marshals of <hi>Matignon</hi>
and <hi>Biron;</hi> the first Governour of
<hi>Guyenne,</hi> and the last Commander of
a little Army in <hi>Poitou,</hi> which was to
have cover'd that of the Duke.</p>
            <p>For those two faithfull Servants of
the King, well knowing the secret of
their Master, who was wholly averse
from the destruction of the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> for fear himself and the
whole Royal House shou'd be left at
the mercy of the <hi>League,</hi> which he
knew wou'd never spare them, artful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
broke all the measures of the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne;</hi> Insomuch that he found
himself constrain'd, to return to the
King without bringing along with him
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> Captive, as he
had boastingly promis'd him to doe,
and without performing any thing of
that, which the <hi>League</hi> expected from
his Zeal to the party. As for the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42159:105"/>
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> finding no <hi>Germans</hi>
upon the Frontires of <hi>Champagn</hi> to
combat, and besides not being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with any great Forces, his
whole expedition was terminated,
in taking <hi>Douzy</hi> and <hi>Raucour,</hi> two
small Towns belonging to the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> against whom the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> made War, concerning
which I shall say nothing, because it
has no relation to the History of the
<hi>League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, the <hi>Huguenots</hi>
manag'd their affairs not much better;
'Tis true, that the <hi>Sieur</hi> of <hi>Lesdigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres</hi>
had some advantage over the
<hi>League</hi> in <hi>Dau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hine,</hi> that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Master of certain places, and
amongst others of <hi>Montelimar</hi> with
the Castle, which he took by a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
form'd Siege, and <hi>Ambrun</hi> which
he surpris'd; and where the rich Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the Metropolitan Church,
were plundred by the Souldiers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
which, though he was a man
of strict Discipline, and moderate in
his Nature, he was no way able to
oppose. But, besides that, they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:42159:106"/>
roughly handled in other Provinces,
and that all which cou'd possibly be
done by the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who
had not yet drawn together all the
Troops which he expected, was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to stand upon the defensive; they
receiv'd a great blow, by the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
defeat which was given to the
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> who was like to have
perish'd, in that unhappy attempt
which he made upon the Castle of
<hi>Angers.</hi> That Prince who had made
up a little body of an Army about the
Skirts of St. <hi>Iean d' Angely,</hi> which he
held in stead of <hi>Peronne,</hi> had success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
begun his Campaign in <hi>Poitou;</hi>
having driven out of that Province
the Duke of <hi>Mercaeur,</hi> who was come
from his Government of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> to
the assistance of the <hi>League.</hi> And as
after that gallant action, he had re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
his Army, with Troops which
swarm'd to him, from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Provinces, upon the report of his
Victory, he undertook the Seige of
<hi>Broüage</hi> in favour of the <hi>Rochellers,</hi>
who suppli'd him with Money and
Amunition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42159:106"/>
He was accompanied with a great
number of brave Gentlemen, and
Lords of great Quality, amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by <hi>Rene</hi> Vicount of <hi>Rohan, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
Count of <hi>Rochefoucault, Montguion</hi>
Lieutenant to the Prince, <hi>George Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
d' Amboise, Loüis de</hi> St. <hi>Gelais,</hi>
and <hi>Claude de La Trimoüille</hi> who was
afterwards Duke of <hi>Thouers,</hi> and whose
Sister he then sought in Marriage,
whom he espous'd not long after; and
there is great appearance of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that it was rather on that account,
than any motive of Conscience and
Religion, that this young Lord, far
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollowing the example of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who declar'd himself Head of
the <hi>League</hi> at <hi>Poitou,</hi> gave into the
other extreme and turn'd <hi>Huguenot,</hi>
together with his Sister <hi>Charlotte Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine
de la Trimoüille</hi> to have the
Honour of being Married to the Prince
of <hi>Conde.</hi> How strong is the Power
of Ambition, over minds that are
dazled with the deceiptfull Splendour
of wordly Greatness, that it should be
able to oblige a Brother and Sister issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>Loüis de Trimoüille</hi> and <hi>Iane
de Montmorancy</hi> Daughter of the great
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42159:107"/>
Constable both of them firm <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi>
as were all their illustrious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours,
to turn <hi>Calvinists,</hi> one to be
Brother in Law to a Prince of the
Bloud, and the other to be his
Wife!</p>
            <p>From this Marriage there was Born
on the first of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year
1588, the late Prince <hi>Henry de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
who by a most happy Destiny,
directly opposite to that of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being issued from a Father and
Mother so obstinate in <hi>Calvinism,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
one of the most Zealous Princes
for the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cou'd ever boast, and he, who
declar'd himself the greatest Enemy
of <hi>Calvinism.</hi> So also has he left to
Posterity a most glorious remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his name, which shall never
perish amongst all good <hi>Frenchmen,</hi>
for having constantly defended Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with all his power, exercising
in that Holy and Divine Imployment,
both his Valour and his Wit, which
he had in perfection, as he made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
on all occasions, and principally
in the Counsel whereof he was cheif,
when he died of such a death, as the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42159:107"/>
Acts of all the most solid vertues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it was accompanied, render'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in the sight of God. I believe my
self oblig'd in point of gratitude to doe
justice in this little Panegyrique to the
great <hi>Merit</hi> of that Prince, who has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done me the Honour, on many
occasions, to give me particular marks
of his esteem and his affection; and
hope, that they who take the pains to
peruse this work, will not blame me for
this short Digression, taken occasionally
by writing of the Prince his Father, to
whose actions I now return.</p>
            <p>The Nobility who were come to
attend and serve him in that important
Siege of <hi>Broüage,</hi> had brought along
with them a considerable number of
<hi>Huguenot</hi> Gentlemen, as also some
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> who were Enemies to
the <hi>League.</hi> And with these Recruits
he had almost reduc'd the place to
terms of yielding, when changing his
design all on the sudden, like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd
Captain, he lost the fruit
of his former labours, and plung'd
himself into extreme danger. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
understood, that Captain <hi>Roche-Mort,</hi>
one of his best Officers had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42159:108"/>
the Castle of <hi>Angers,</hi> in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Count de Brisac,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made Governour of it after the
death of the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
himself for the <hi>League,</hi> he left
before <hi>Broüage</hi> the <hi>Sieur de la Roche
Baucour</hi> St. <hi>Meme</hi> with the Infantry,
to continue the Siege, and march'd
himself with all the Cavalry, consisting
of two thousand Horse, to relieve that
Captain, who with Seventeen or Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Souldiers onely held the Castle of
<hi>Angers</hi> against the Burghers who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
him. But the Prince setting
out somewhat of the latest, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
too slowly, when the fortune of
his Enterprize depended on celerity,
he had no sooner past the River of
<hi>Loyre</hi> in Boats, betwixt <hi>Saumur</hi> and
<hi>Angers,</hi> but he receiv'd advice that
<hi>Roche-Mort</hi> being kill'd with a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
shot, as he was looking through
a Casement, the Castle had been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd
two days since.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this Misfortune,
which the greatest part of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
wou'd not believe, having joyn'd
fifteen hundred men, whom <hi>Clermont
d' Amboise,</hi> a little before the Siege of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42159:108"/>
               <hi>Broüage,</hi> was gone to raise for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in <hi>Anjou,</hi> he took a resolution to
attaque the Suburbs: But was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
repuls'd by the good Troups
which the King had sent thither to
assist the Citizens, who had retrench'd
themselves against the Castle which
they held besieg'd. After which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to repass the River, he found
that not onely all the passages were
guarded, but that also he was ready
to be compass'd round by the Troups
of the King and of the <hi>League,</hi> who
were gathering together from all parts,
both on this side the <hi>Loyre</hi> and beyond
it, to inclose him. Insomuch that,
not being able either to advance or to
retreat, without being taken or cut in
pieces with all his men, they were at
length forc'd to disband, and dividing
themselves into small companies of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Eight, or Ten and Twelve
together, every man being willing to
save one, march'd onely by night
through bye passages out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Road, and through Woods for
fear of being met with, either by
Souldiers or Peasants, who kill'd as
many of them as they cou'd find, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42159:109"/>
pursued them, as they wou'd so many
Wolves, when they caught them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a Sheepfold. The Prince
himself had much adoe to escape, the
tenth man, and disguis'd, into the
Lower <hi>Normandy,</hi> from whence he
pass'd in a Fisher's Barque betwixt <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranche</hi>
and St. <hi>Malo</hi> into the Isle of
<hi>Guernsey,</hi> and from thence aboard an
<hi>English</hi> Vessel into <hi>England;</hi> where he
was very well receiv'd by Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
who sent him back to <hi>Rochelle</hi>
the Year following with a considerable
supply.</p>
            <p>In the mean time St. <hi>Mesme,</hi> (who
during this unhappy expedition of the
Prince, continued the Siege of <hi>Broüage,</hi>

<hi>Marshal de Matignon,</hi> who advanc'd
by order from the King, to force his
Retrenchments, with an Army of
experienc'd Souldiers,) truss'd up
his Baggage, and retir'd with what
speed he cou'd, but in so much fear
and disorder, that he lost great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his men in his hasty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where St. <hi>Luc,</hi> Governour of <hi>Broüage</hi>
who always shew'd himself as brave in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42159:109"/>
War, as he was agreeable at Court in
Peace, having charg'd him in the
Reer, cut it entirely off: Thus the
<hi>League,</hi> and the <hi>Calvinism,</hi> lost on
that occasion, the one the Castle of
<hi>Angers,</hi> wherein the King plac'd a
Governour, on whose fidelity he
might rely, and the other almost
all its Forces, which after that
shock, durst no longer keep the
Field.</p>
            <p>This furnish'd the King with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to publish new Ordinances,
by which he commanded the Good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Rebels to be seiz'd; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of those who had followed the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with promise never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
of restoring them, when they
shou'd return into the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Church, and give good security of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in it; Ordaining farther, in
execution of the Edict of <hi>Iuly,</hi> that all
such shou'd be forc'd to depart the
Realm, who refus'd to make abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> into the hands of the
Bishops; and it was enjoyn'd them to
make it according to the Form which
was compos'd by <hi>William Ruzè</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Angers.</hi> It was thus practis'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42159:110"/>
it had been observ'd, that the
greatest part of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> had
invented a trick, neither to lose their
Goods, nor to leave the Kingdom;
but thought it was lawfull for them
to accommodate themselves to the
times, and so deceive men by making
a false profession of Faith, onely for
form sake, and in external obedience
to the Edicts: which they express'd
by these words, <hi>Since it has so pleas'd
the King,</hi> with which they never fail'd
to preface the Oath of Abjuration
when they took it.</p>
            <p>Now this prudent Bishop having
observ'd that intolerable abuse, which
was follow'd by an infinite number of
Sacrileges, and most horrible profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sacraments, which those false
Converts made no scruple to receive,
betraying by that damnable imposture
both the one Religion and the other,
wou'd admit none into the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church, who had not first
made his profession of Faith according
to his form, which much resembled
that of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, and which from
that time forward was and is presented
to be sign'd by all those who abjure He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:42159:110"/>
'Tis most certain that these Edicts,
joyn'd with the extreme weakness in
which the <hi>Huguenot</hi> party then was,
made in a little time many more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
true or false, than had been
made by the Massacre of St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew.</hi>
But also on the other side, they
occasion'd the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi>
whom the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> cou'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
draw to his party against the
<hi>Leaguers,</hi> now to incline to his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
Two years were almost past
since that King, who desir'd to shelter
himself from the Conspiracy which the
<hi>League</hi> had made principally against
him, with purpose to exclude him
from the Crown, against the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law of the Realm, had solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those Princes, by the <hi>Sieur de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur
Pardaillan,</hi> and <hi>de Clervant</hi>
to raise an Army for his assistance;
and elsewhere by the intermission of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> he press'd the <hi>Protestant Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
of <hi>Swisserland,</hi> to make a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-League</hi>
with the <hi>Germans,</hi> for the
same purpose. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who
besides the interest of her <hi>Protestant</hi>
Religion, had a particular esteem and
love for that Prince, the Duke of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42159:111"/>
               <hi>Boüillon</hi> a declar'd Enemy of the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
Princes, and the <hi>Count de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliard,
Frederick de Wirtemburg,</hi> a
most zealous <hi>Calvinist,</hi> used their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
endeavours with those <hi>German
Protestants</hi> to stir them up: all which
notwithstanding, they were very
loath to resolve on a War with the
King of <hi>France</hi> their Allye; saying
always that they wou'd never engage
themselves in it, till it was clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that the War which was made
against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> was not a War
of the Government against its Rebels,
but purely, and onely against the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
Religion, which they intended
to extirpate. But when they saw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes those Edicts and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the King, who was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
resolv'd not to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er any other
Religion beside the <hi>Catholique</hi> in his
Kingdom, and that otherways they
had given them all the security they
cou'd desire for the payment of their
Army;<note place="margin">Ann. 1586.</note> then they took a Resolution
of Levying great Forces, and of assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> powerfully,
after sending a solemn Embassy to
the King, to demand of him the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42159:111"/>
of his Edicts, and an entire
liberty of Conscience for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Electors
of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> the
Prince Palatine <hi>Iohn Casimir,</hi> the
Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and
of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Hesse,</hi>
and <hi>Iohn Frederick,</hi> Administrator of
<hi>Magdeburg,</hi> were the Princes who
As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ociated themselves with the Towns
of <hi>Francford, Vlmes, Nuremberg,</hi> and
<hi>Strasburg,</hi> to send this Embassy to the
King; who, not being resolv'd what to
answer them, for fear of provoking
the <hi>League,</hi> in case he shou'd grant
them their demands, or of drawing on
himself the united Forces of almost all
the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> in case of
a refusal, to gain time, took a Progress
as far as <hi>Lyons,</hi> while the Deputies of
those Princes were at <hi>Paris:</hi> which
caus'd the Count of <hi>Montbeliard,</hi> and
the Count of <hi>Isembourg,</hi> who were the
chief of that Embassy, to return. But
so did not the rest, as being obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down to wait the King's return,
who was at last constrain'd, being
overcome by their extreme persistance,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42159:112"/>
whom he well hop'd to have tir'd
first, to give them the Audience
which they demanded. He who was
spokesman for the rest, loosing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of respect, made a blunt and
haughty Speech, reproching him in
certain terms which were but too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
that against his Conscience
and his Honour, he had violated his
faith so solemnly given to his most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Subjects of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to whom he had promis'd the
free exercise of it, they remaining,
as since that time they had always
done, in that perfect obedience, which
is due from Subjects to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</p>
            <p>That Prince, who at other times
was but too meek and patient, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too weak and timorous, was so
much offended at this brutal insolence,
that he was not able to curb himself
from breaking out into choler on this
occasion. For he repli'd smartly, to
them, with that air of Majesty and
fierceness, which he knew well to take
up, whensoever it pleas'd him, that
as he had not taken the liberty to
give Laws to their Masters of ruling
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42159:112"/>
their Estates according to their own
liking, and changing the Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
constitution of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so neither on his side wou'd
he suffer them to intermeddle in those
alterations which he thought fit to
make in his Edicts; according to the
diversity of times and of occasions, for
the good of his People, of whom
the greatest part depended on the true
<hi>Roman Catholique</hi> Religion, which the
most Christian Kings his Predecessours
had ever maintain'd in <hi>France,</hi> to the
exclusion of all others. Afterwards,
retiring into his Cabinet, where after
he had revolv'd in his mind, what had
been said on either part, he was of
opinion, that his Answer had not been
sharp enough, he sent them by one
of the Secretaries of State a Paper writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with his own hand, which was
read to them; and in which he gave
the Lie in formal terms to all those
who said he had done against his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or violated his Faith, in revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Edict of <hi>May,</hi> by that of <hi>Iuly;</hi>
after which it was told them from him,
that they had no more to doe, than to
return home; without expecting any
farther Audience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:42159:113"/>
This was certainly an Answer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a great Monarch, had he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
it by his actions as well as by
his words; and had he not shewn by
his after conduct, the fear he had of
this irruption of the <hi>Germans.</hi> For, in
order to prevent it, he seem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
too much from that high and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Majesty of a King, by treating
almost upon terms of equality with
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and offering him,
besides whatever advantages he cou'd
wish, in Honours and in Pensions, and
many Towns for his security, which
had made him a kind of Independant
Royalty in the Kingdome on this
onely condition, that he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and
give him leave to live in quiet; as if
it were the Duke, and not the King,
who had the power of giving Peace.</p>
            <p>Though these advantageous prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
were sufficient to have tempted
the Duke's ambition, nevertheless he
wou'd not accept them, because he
hop'd to satisfie it much better by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
the War in which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
the King; who was not able to
recall his promise: besides, he was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42159:113"/>
not willing to destroy the opinion
which the people had conceiv'd of
him, that he acted by no motive of
self-interest, but onely for the Cause
of God and of Religion. This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
of Peace therefore failing the
King, who had ardently desir'd it, he
employ'd another, which was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<hi>Q. Katharine de Medices,</hi> to
confer with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
her Son-in-Law; to try if by her usual
arts, she cou'd induce him to some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
which might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to the <hi>League,</hi> and stop the
<hi>Germans,</hi> of whose Succours, his peace
once made, that King wou'd have no
farther use. The Queen Mother,
who at that time desir'd the peace at
least as much as he, because she fear'd
to be left at the discretion of
either of the two parties, by whom
she was equally hated, willingly
accepted that Commission; groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her hopes on those tricks,
and artificial ways, by which she had
so often succeeded, on the like occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Having then advanc'd as far as
<hi>Champigny,</hi> a fair house belonging to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42159:114"/>
the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> she manag'd
the matter in such sort, by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of that Prince, who went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> from her,
that it was agreed there shou'd be a
Conference. After many difficulties
which were rais'd concerning it, and
which, with much canvasing, they
got over; the place was appointed to
be St. <hi>Brix,</hi> a Castle near <hi>Cognac,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Sieur de Fors,</hi> who was
of the King's party. She came thither
attended by the Dukes of <hi>Montpensier</hi>
and of <hi>Nevers,</hi> Marshal <hi>Biron,</hi> and
some other Lords, who were no friends
to the <hi>Guises</hi> or the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> to the
end that Conference might be the more
amicable. The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> came
also thither, with the Prince of <hi>Condè,
Vicount de Turenne,</hi> and some others
the most considerable of their Party.</p>
            <p>It appear'd manifestly at this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
that the Queen held no longer
that Authority, which had been yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to her in the former Conferences,
wherein she had carried all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her own desire, by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Ascendant, which she had over
their minds; And she understood,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42159:114"/>
but too well from the very beginning,
that she had to doe with such as were
distrustfull of her subtilties, and who
wou'd not suffer themselves to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
easily, as some of them had
been, on St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they had not yet worn out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.
For they wou'd never
adventure themselves all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Chamber appointed for the
Conference; when the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
was there, the Prince and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
well accompanied, made a guard
at the door; and when either of the
other two enter'd, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
and the other did the like for him: that
they might not put themselves unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into her hands, on whose word they
had no reason to rely; and who dar'd
not to arrest any of them singly, the
two remaining being at liberty, and
in condition to give themselves satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
on the Aggressours.</p>
            <p>Thus, being too suspicious, and
their minds too much embitter'd, to
act calmly and reasonably in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
it went off in three Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views;
which were made in resenting
terms, and mutual reproaches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42159:115"/>
coming to any amicable conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> according
to his lofty and severe humour, spoke
always more sharply than the other
two: rejecting all methods of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
and saying, with an air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
fierce, that there was no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to be given to those who had so
basely falsified their Faith, in violating
the Edicts of the King, to satisfie the
Seditious and the Rebels. The King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> of a temper much more
sweet and complaisant, though with
a becoming noble boldness, he gave
the Queen to understand that he had
no great reason to commend her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in reference to himself, yet
he never forgot the respect which was
due to her Character. And upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of her remonstrating to him,
that the peace of <hi>France</hi> depended on
his conversion; since the onely fear
of falling under the dominion of an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenot</hi>
Prince, had made and arm'd
the <hi>League,</hi> which had no quarrel to
His person, but onely to his Heresie:
his answer was no more than this;
That Religion was onely a pretence,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hich the Authours of the <hi>League</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:42159:115"/>
had taken up, to cover their ambition,
which manifestly design'd the total
ruine of the Royal family; and as to
his conversion, he was always dispos'd
to it, on condition he might be instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the truth by a free Council,
which he had oftentimes demanded;
and in the definitive judgment of
which, both he and his party would
wholly acquiesce. He consented even
to a Truce of twelve days, during
which, the King's good pleasure shou'd
be consulted, by proposing to him that
condition; though it was known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
that he wou'd never consent
to it. And in the mean time, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Turenne</hi> coming to wait on
the Queen at <hi>Fontenay,</hi> whither she
was retir'd, the Conference was resum'd
for the last time.</p>
            <p>For, after they had amplifi'd their
Forces on either side, and both had
set forth the advantages of their own
party, which cou'd not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some sharpness, and even menaces;
the Queen losing patience, and taking
up that air of haughtiness and Majesty,
which she had often assum'd at the
like Conferences in the Reigns prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42159:116"/>
and at the beginning of this,
said in an imperious tone, that there
was no more room left for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and that the King, who wou'd
be absolutely Master in his Realm, had
fix'd his positive resolution, to have
but one Religion in <hi>France:</hi> 'Tis well,
Madam, repli'd the Vicount, with a
disdainfull kind of smile, we joyn
issue with you in the same resolution;
Let there be but one Religion, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it be ours; if otherwise, we must
hack it out on both sides. On which,
without staying for a reply, he made
a low bow, and immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.
Thus the Conference was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to the extreme displeasure of the
King, who to gain covert from that
Tempest of the <hi>Germans,</hi> which he
foresaw to be powring upon <hi>France,</hi>
had passionately desir'd a Peace, which
he cou'd neither obtain from the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> nor even from the <hi>League,</hi>
in whose quarrel he was engag'd to
make War against that King.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> whose number
was prodigiously incr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as'd, especially
in <hi>Paris,</hi> grown jealous of those fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Treaties with the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42159:116"/>
let loose their tongues, more
brutally than ever against the King:
as if he had held a secret correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and play'd
booty with the <hi>League,</hi> by a counterfeit
shew of ruining its En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mies. There
are those who have gone so far as to
report, that at this very time they had
laid a terrible Plot against the King,
in which they engag'd the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> who had made himself their
Head, in the absence of his Brother;
and that the Conspirators had resolv'd
to put all the Guards of his Majesty
to the Sword; to seize his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and afterwards, either to confine
him to a Monastery, or to imprison
him in a Tower; to cut the throats of
the Chancellour, the first President,
and all the Principal Officers, to put
others in their places, and to create a
new Council consisting wholly of their
own party; to possess themselves of
the <hi>Bastille,</hi> the <hi>Arsenal,</hi> the <hi>Chastelets,</hi>
the Palace and the Temple; to give
entrance to the <hi>Spanish Armada,</hi> which
was then prepar'd against <hi>England,</hi>
by <hi>Boulogne;</hi> and a hundred other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cularities
of that Conspiracy, which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42159:117"/>
the President <hi>de Thou</hi> thought fit to
insert in his History, upon the credit
of one <hi>Nicholas Poulain,</hi> Lieutenant in
the Provostship of the Isle of <hi>France;</hi>
who having been of the Council of the
<hi>League,</hi> reveal'd, as he relates himself,
the whole secret to the Chancellor
<hi>de Chiverny, Monsieur Villeroy,</hi> chief
Secretary of State, and also to the
King. But, besides that no credit
ought in reason to be given to a man
of double dealing, who has betray'd
both sides, and who to set himself
right with that party he had forsaken,
may affirm a thousand things which
he cannot prove; which is a crime
that hath often brought the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
to the Gallows; there is nothing
of all this matter to be seen in those
Papers, which were written at that
time, either for or against the <hi>League;</hi>
especially in those of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
who wou'd be sure to omit nothing
that cou'd possibly make against their
Enemies, or for themselves, neither
in the Memoires of the Chancellour <hi>de
Chiverny,</hi> nor of <hi>Monsieur de Villeroy,</hi>
who in all probability, wou'd not have
forgotten a thing of that importance,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42159:117"/>
if they had had it from the mouth of
the Informer, or indeed if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it true.</p>
            <p>And certainly there are many
things so very improbable, in that
verbal process of <hi>Nicholas Poulain,</hi>
which I have most exactly read; and
even so many notorious falsities,
and those so opposite to the nature and
genius of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> that
it is a prodigious thing in <hi>Monsieur de
Thou,</hi> that he wou'd take the pains to
transcribe it almost word for word in
a History, so elegant and serious as
that of his. This in reason shou'd
give a caution to such as undertake
the writing of a History, not to trust
all sorts of Writers, and not ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to swell their Works with all
they find written in certain Unauthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Memoires, without giving
themselves the leisure to examine their
merit, and their quality. That which
is certain in that affair is, that the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> interpreting malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and in the worst sense, those
Negotiations and Conferences, which
were made with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
were not wanting to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42159:118"/>
understand, that the King held
intelligence with him, and protected
the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> It was also in order
to destroy that belief and false opinion
which ran of him to his disadvantage
among the people, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
with more apparent fervour
and solemnity, those extraordinary
devotions which he practiss'd from
time to time, and above all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of Penitents, which, far from
serving his design, render'd him yet
more despicably odious.</p>
            <p>As evil, by the abuse of the best
and most holy things, often proceeds
from that good which insensibly is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
into corruption; it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
also happens that good is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
out of evil, which is rectifi'd,
by taking from it that which is ill in
the practice of Devotion, and leaving
onely what is wholsome. This is
what has been observ'd in our present
Subject, the Brotherhood of Penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries.
More than four hundred years
agoe, a certain devout Hermit finding
himself to be strongly inspir'd from
God, to Preach in a Town of <hi>Italy,</hi>
as <hi>Ionas</hi> did at <hi>Nineveh,</hi> began to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42159:118"/>
threaten the Inhabitants, that in a
short time they shou'd be buried under
the Ruines of their Houses, which
shou'd fall upon their heads and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
them, if they appeas'd not the
wrath of God, by an immediate, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and publique penitence. His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours
after the example of the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
touch'd with so powerfull a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and fearing to feel the effects
of so terrible a threatning, cloath'd
themselves in Sackcloth, and arm'd
with Whips and Disciplines, walk'd
in procession through their Streets,
lashing themselves severely on their
Shoulders, to expiate their Crimes
by their tears, and by their Bloud.
This sort of Penance which sprung
out of a good principle, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
desire of appeasing the Divine
Justice, may be very laudable; and
was afterwards practis'd in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
particularly in <hi>Hungary,</hi> dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rage of a great Pestilence,
which made havock of that poor
Kingdom. But not long after, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
into the dangerous sect of
the <hi>Flagellants,</hi> who running in great
Troops naked to the middle, through
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42159:119"/>
most of the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> made
themselves all over bloudy, by the
vigorous handselling of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines,
saying, with horrible impiety,
that this new Baptism of bloud was
more available than that of Water, in
that it expiated for all their future Sins,
which from thence forward they might
commit with all impunity.</p>
            <p>There was much difficulty in abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
so pernicious an abuse; and
therefore with mild usage to reduce
those wandring Souls into a regular
Penance, it was permitted them to
retain what ever was good, in so au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere
a Practice. From thence are
sprung up the fraternities of Penitents,
which are at this present seen in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
in the Patrimony of the Church,
in the County of <hi>Avignon,</hi> and in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> who have their Chapels
where they assemble, and practise the
Exercises of their Devotions, and who
make their Processions where they
go, particularly on Holy Thursday,
cloath'd in Sackcloath, with Whips at
their Girdles, which nevertheless are
not for any great execution, but for
Ceremony, to mark out the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42159:119"/>
profession which they make of
being Penitentiaries, and the love they
have for Christian Penance.</p>
            <p>When therefore the King, who was
naturally inclin'd to Devotion, had in
his return from <hi>Poland,</hi> beheld the
Procession of the white Penitents of
<hi>Avignon,</hi> and was even then desirous
of shewing himself a zealous <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;</hi>
he commanded himself to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd
in that Fraternity, and about
seven or eight years after, he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
another of the same kind at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
in the Church of the <hi>Augustines,</hi>
under the title of the Annunciation of
our Lady. The most part of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and great men of the Court, and
the principal Officers were of it;
and all his Favorites never fail'd to
assist at those Processions, wherein
he went without his Guards, or any
mark whereby he might be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from the rest, Cloath'd in a long
white Habit of Holland, shap'd like
a Sack, reaching below his Feet, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large, with two long Sleeves,
and a Cowl or <hi>Monk's</hi> Hood over his
Head piqu'd on the Crown, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two great holes in it right against
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42159:120"/>
his Eyes, sow'd behind to the Collar,
and coming down before in a sharp
point, half a foot below the Girdle,
which was woven of the finest white
Thread, and little knots in it, hanging
down below the Knee; in the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
was hung a jolly little Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the same materials, nothing
proper to give the penitent a smarting
lash: On his left shoulder he had a
Cross of white Satten, upon a ground
of tawny Velvet, almost wholly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>For the rest, he made profession to
observe exactly the Rules and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of that Fraternity, which Fath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Edmond Auger</hi> a famous <hi>Iesuite,</hi> who
was then his Confessour and Chaplain,
had drawn up by his own Order.
That good Father entertain'd him with
great care, in these sorts of Devotions,
though not altogether so proper for
the practice of a great King, to whom
much more solid instructions shou'd be
given, of which the principal consists
in advising him to apply himself vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ously
to that charge of Government,
which God, to whom he must render
an Account, has committed to his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42159:120"/>
trust, as his Minister and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>To this purpose 'tis said (as <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bequius</hi>
writes from <hi>Paris,</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Rodolphus</hi> his Master) that the
Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Mother (seeing the prejudice
which this fantastique carriage did to
the reputation of the King her Son,
and to the State, the care of which
he abandon'd, to give himself up to
these cloysterly Processions,) spoke
sharply to the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> upbrayding
him, that he was an ill Guide to his
Penitent, and that of a King, as God
had made him, he made a Frier, to
the great prejudice of all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And for that very reason, time
and experience having made it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that much disorder had crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these Fraternities of white Penitents,
as well as those of the blew and black,
and that under pretence of practising
holy Exercises, most dangerous Plots
were hatch'd against the Government,
they were totally abolish'd at <hi>Paris,</hi>
about ten or twelve years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>It was especially that year 1586,
that the King willing to make appear,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42159:121"/>
that he had more zeal than ever for
the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, renew'd these
ostentatious Devotions of his Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
with so much fervour, that not
being satisfied with his ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
which he made in the Habit
of a Penitent, through the Streets of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
he made one very extraordinary,
going on foot in the same Habit, with
the greatest company he cou'd get to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of his most devout and fervent
Brothers, from the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> quite
to our Lady of <hi>Chartres;</hi> from whence
he return'd in the same manner, in
two days to <hi>Paris.</hi> In truth, 'tis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
that this proceeded from a great
Foundation of Piety in this Prince,
whose nature was infinitely sweet, if
he had not suffer'd it to be corrupted
by his pleasures. But as the <hi>Leaguers</hi>
were not throughly perswaded of this
truth, and that through the hatred
which they bore him, they interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his best actions in the worst Sense,
they decri'd this with all imaginable
spight; saying, it was nothing but
mere Hypocrisie, and a ridiculous
Mascarade which he had invented,
to mock God and deceive men, by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42159:121"/>
covering his Vices and his no Religion
with the veil of Piety.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Leaguers</hi> were not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, who were scandaliz'd at
these new forms of Processions, which
are not much to the humour of the
<hi>French.</hi> They were almost generally
blam'd by all the World, and those
who spoke the least harm of them,
cou'd not hold from open Laughter. The
most ridiculous part of them, and which
made a kind of Tragicomedy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there was matter of Mirth and
Mourning, was that the Lacquies of
these Courtiers, who in compliance
to the King, had inroll'd themselves
in this Brotherhood of Penitents, had
the insolence to mimick it, in derision
of their Masters, even in the Court of
the <hi>Louvre,</hi> making shew of lashing
themselves lustily, as if they had been
<hi>Flagellants</hi> in earnest. But the King
having heard of it, before the Farce
was quite play'd out, caus'd fourscore
of them to be seiz'd, whom they
drew into the <hi>Cour des Cuisines,</hi> where
they were so well belabour'd with
Whips, that they were left in a way
representing to the Life, that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42159:122"/>
into which the ancient <hi>Flagellants</hi>
put their bodies by their bloudy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>This, notwiths<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anding, hinder'd
not others, from doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
much more criminal, than the
poor Lacquies had attempted. For
some malicious Wits there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who had the
impudence to expose publiquely, a
Picture where the King was seen
cloath'd in his penitential Robes, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Honey combs out of an Hive,
saying these words, which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
over his Head, as the Motto of
the Embleme, <hi>Sic eorum aculeos evito,</hi>
'Tis thus I cover my self from their
Stings. As if they desir'd to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in this witty, but very spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expression, That as a man who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to rob a Hive, must cover his
Face and Hands to avoid Stinging
from the Bees, who Associate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the Thief: So the King,
who drew the vital nourishment of his
Kingdom to lavish it prodigally on
his Minions, and who endeavour'd to
ruine Religion, by the secret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
he held with the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42159:122"/>
and the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> disguis'd
himself in this Habit of a Penitent,
to cheat the <hi>League,</hi> and to shelter
himself from the just indignation of
the <hi>Catholiques</hi> united against him.
But they who were more clamorous
than all the rest, were certain Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the <hi>League,</hi> who profaneing
their Sacred Function of Preaching
the Gospel, by their Seditious Tongues,
and dealing out a thousand impostures
from the Chair of Truth, declaim'd
venemously against the Lord's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
all whose actions they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatter'd,
even those which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with the greatest Piety.</p>
            <p>Of all those Satyrists, he who
roar'd the most insolently against those
Devotions of the King, was Doctour
<hi>Poncet,</hi> Curate of St. <hi>Peter des Arsis,</hi>
who was accustom'd to relate blunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
in his Sermons, the sillyest
things, which the most violent <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi>
us'd to say, and preach'd them
without fear or wit to his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if they had been as true as
Gospel. 'Twas not that he wanted
good natural parts, as once he made
it sufficiently appear, when the Duke
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42159:123"/>
of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> the King's Favourite, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told him that he was glad to know
a man, who had so noble a Talent as
to divert the people, and set them on
the merry pin of Laughing at his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
He drily answer'd him, 'tis
but reasonable that I shou'd make them
laugh sometimes, since you have made
them cry so often, for the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Subsedies which were impos'd for
the defraying of the excessive charges
of your sweet Marriage. For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
went, that the King had expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on them more than twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crowns.</p>
            <p>Now this Seditious Preacher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
so outragiously against
those Processions, and told so many
scandalous lies of the King himself,
and the fraternity of Penitents, whom
he call'd the Brotherhood of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and Atheists, that the King
clap'd him up in Prison for some days,
after which he set him at liberty,
thinking that this light Correction
wou'd teach him better manners. But
it was to little purpose; for the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
having heard it reported, that he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> his note, after having
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42159:123"/>
smarted for it, had the impudence to
say publiquely in the Pulpit, that he
was no Parrot to be taught his Lesson;
and thereupon, he fell to his old trade
of railing more violently than ever.
Yet it was not long e'er he inflicted on
himself the punishment which he had
so well deserv'd.</p>
            <p>As the Licence of speaking evil of
the Higher Powers, was now become
the common practice of the <hi>Leaguers,</hi>
a certain Advocate of <hi>Poitiers</hi> call'd
<hi>Le Breton,</hi> who had lost his Suit at
<hi>Poitiers</hi> and at <hi>Paris,</hi> in pleading for
a Widow, enrag'd that the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>Mayenne,</hi> the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
and the King himself to whom
he had made his addresses, going from
one to the other, and making so many
fruitless Journies to complain of his
hard Usage, had always shaken him
off, and treated him like a Fool or
Madman, made a Libell full of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
reproaches and calumnies against
the King, and the Members of the
Parlament. The Writing having been
seiz'd together with the Authour, it
was thought fit to make an example
of him, to stop the fury of that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42159:124"/>
way of Writing and of Speaking.
Upon which, short work was made in
the process of this audacious Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
he had Justice roundly done
him, and was fairly hang'd before the
Steps of the Palace. None are so
wretchedly fearfull and cowardly at
the point of danger, as those who are
the most fool-hardy in railing, when
they believe they are out of reach:
When our noble Doctour <hi>Poncet</hi> was
told of this Execution on the Lawyer,
and that he saw by this terrible exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they were punish'd with death
who dar'd to affront the Sovereign
Majesty with Scandalous and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Invectives, he was taken so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
with a sudden fright and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
that it seiz'd on his Heart,
and stop'd the circulation of his Bloud;
he betook himself immediately to his
Bed, from whence this tongue Bravo
did never rise, for he died some few
days after of pure imagination, that
the same distributive Justice wou'd
reach him, which had overtaken the
miserable Advocate.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King who had
always earnestly desir'd to have peace
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42159:124"/>
in his Kingdom, made another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
though without Success, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
on one side the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to
accommodate matters with the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> on Conditions more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
than he had yet offer'd
him: and on the other side, to cause
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> to return into
the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, promising
him in case he wou'd, to declare him
Lieutenant General in all the Realm,
to impower him yet with more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than he himself had possess'd
when he Commanded the Armies of
the late King his Brother, to make
him President of the Council, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at last, (which that King most
passionately desir'd,) to Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olve his
Marriage with Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> and
to give him the Princess of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
Grand-Daughter to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was willing to consent to
this Marriage, which might one day
make that Princess Queen of <hi>France,</hi>
whom she always lov'd with so much
tenderness.</p>
            <p>These undoubtedly were most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
offers, and very capable of
tempting a man of that King's Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42159:125"/>
who to say the truth, was none
of the most bigotted <hi>Huguenots,</hi> nor
any bitter Enemy to the <hi>Catholiques.</hi>
But as he cou'd not believe after what
had been done against him, that he
had reason to rely on these fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
that he fear'd to fall to the
Ground betwixt two Stools; nay, if
once he was perceiv'd to Waver, to be
soon abandon'd by his party, which
already lean'd extremely towards the
Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> who was Known to
be a much better Protestant than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and moreover, that he thought
himself secure of great Succours
from the <hi>Germans,</hi> he wou'd not lend
an Ear to any of those Proposals, and
gave a quick dispatch to the King's
Envoys, with an answer worthy of
his ingenuity and of his Courage;
That his Enemies desir'd nothing less
than his Conversion, because they
took Arms for no other reason, than
to Exclude him from the Succession of
the Crown; and to cantonize the
Realm amongst themselves, under
pretence of preserving the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Religion, which he wou'd maintain in
it, much better than themselves; That
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42159:125"/>
he most humbly besought his Majesty,
to permit him to decide that Quarrel
with the Princes of the <hi>League,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Majesty's giving himself the
trouble to interpose in it; and in three
Months time he shou'd have Fifty
thousand Men, with which he hop'd
Almighty God wou'd do him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to reduce the <hi>Leaguers</hi> in a
short time to their Duty, and to bring
those Troublers of the publick Peace,
and those Rebels, to the terms of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
which they ow'd their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
            <p>This answer put the King into an
extreme Agony of Spirit, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where to fix his Resolutions, nor
which of the three Parties he shou'd
Espouse. For, in case he shou'd stand
Neuter betwixt the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
and the <hi>League,</hi> he ran the risque of
being at the disposal of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
if he rang'd himself with the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Party against the
<hi>League,</hi> (as some time after he was
constrain'd to do,) he fear'd to pass
for an Heretique, or for a favourer
of Heretiques, as the <hi>League</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
already to make it be believ'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42159:126"/>
by their Calumnies against him; and
in the sequel, to draw upon himself the
power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the Thunderbolts
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which in that conjuncture
he dreaded more than the <hi>League</hi> and
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> put together.<note place="margin">Ann. 1587.</note> Thus as he
believ'd not himself to be singly strong
enough, to force both parties to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that latter fear determin'd him
though contrary to his Inclinations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Party, as
judging it to be the juster, excepting
onely their Religion, which that Prince
had solemnly protested, was no ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
of the present Quarrel. Insomuch
that following the advice of the Queen
his Mother, and some few of his
Council, who out of their hatred to
Heresie, were favourable to the <hi>League;</hi>
he joyn'd himself with those whom he
regarded as his greatest Enemies, to
make War with his Brother-in-Law,
whose good intentions he well knew
for the publique wellfare. A War which
drew from both parties both much
Bloud, and many Tears: the various
events of which will be the Subject of
the following Book.</p>

and partly in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
his Fraternities, his Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and his Penances, among the
<hi>Feuillants,</hi> whom he had founded at
the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Honore,</hi> among the
<hi>Capuchins,</hi> and especially in his little
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42159:127"/>
Cells of the Monastery of <hi>Bois de Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes,</hi>
wherein he had plac'd the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimites</hi>
who were come from <hi>Spain,</hi>
and wherein afterwards were plac'd
the <hi>Minimes.</hi> But to his great grief,
at the beginning of the Spring, he was
forc'd to quit the Pleasures and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of that sort of Life, with which
he was infinitely satisfied, and rowze
up himself to make War in conjunction
with the <hi>League</hi> against the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were
coming to joyn their Forces with
him.</p>
            <p>To this effect, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
who till that time had been making
War with the young Duke of <hi>Bouillon
la Mark,</hi> without any considerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
return'd to the Court, which
was then at <hi>Meaux;</hi> and after having
assur'd the King that there was a great
Army of <hi>Germans</hi> in readiness to take
their March towards our Frontiers,
and demanded Forces which might be
capable of stopping them, he made
great complaints of the Breach which
he pretended to be made of some
Articles, in the Treaty of <hi>Nemours.</hi>
Those of the <hi>League</hi> maintain'd that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42159:127"/>
these complaints were just, the others
on the contrary made it evident, that
they were altogether unreasonable.</p>
            <p>He complain'd amongst other things,
that the Count of <hi>Brissac</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
to his Government of the Castle
of <hi>Angers.</hi> But to that it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that the King had retaken it
from the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Forces, by
whom <hi>Brissac,</hi> who held it for the
<hi>League</hi> against his Majesty's intentions,
had suffer'd it to be surpris'd. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that such as were his Dependants,
and in his interests, were not treated so
favourably at Court as others; as if
the King had been oblig'd not onely
to forgive, but also to bestow particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
favours on those who had taken
Arms against him, and to reward
them for having discharg'd their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
against his faithfull Servants, as
<hi>Francis de Balsac d' Entragues</hi> had
done against the Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi>
whom his Majesty had sent to <hi>Orleans.</hi>
In conclusion, he took it exceedingly
ill, that the temporal Estate of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Pellevè,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Sens</hi> had
been seiz'd into the King's hands; as
if the World were not satisfi'd that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42159:128"/>
this Prelate, a Pensioner of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
who was a declar'd Enemy to the
King, was not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> doeing
him all manner of ill Offices with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> eternally decrying his conduct,
and blasting him with his sinister
interpretations, and venemous asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the King had the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
not long time after, to grant him
Possession of his Revenues, and that
to gratifie His Holiness, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
it of him by his Nuncio <hi>Morosini,</hi>
but at the same time he desir'd the
<hi>Pope</hi> to admonish the Cardinal in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
that he shou'd beware of relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
into so hainous an Offence, which
if he shou'd, he then hop'd his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wou'd hold himself oblig'd to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with the same Severity, as
if the crime were committed against
his own person. For the present, he
was content to mollify the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> with a parcel of fair words, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
him that he wou'd take such
order, that he shou'd have reason to
be satisfi'd in all things. After which,
having again exhorted him to make
Peace with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42159:128"/>
finding him still obstinate in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
he took at last the resolution, to
dispose of the Forces he had already
on foot, and of those he expected from
the <hi>Catholique</hi> Cantons of <hi>Swisserland,</hi>
in such manner that he might find a
way to make himself Master of all,
by weakning the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and
the <hi>League,</hi> and by dispersing the
<hi>German</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>To this effect, he determin'd to
have three Armies; The first very
strong, under the Command of the
Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> against the
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was not yet in
a condition, as he believ'd, to oppose
him. The second in shew, and upon the
paper, at least as strong, but in reality
much weaker, under the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> against the <hi>Germans,</hi> by whom
considering their great Numbers, he
might reasonably hope the Duke might
be oppress'd, which he had occasion
enough to wish: And the third, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
stronger than the other
two, he was resolv'd to command in
person, to hinder the Strangers, who
by that time wou'd be harrass'd with
so long a March, from passing the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42159:129"/>
of <hi>Loire,</hi> and from joyning the
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and afterwards to
oblige them by Treaty to return into
their own Country; After which he
shou'd be in condition, easily to reduce
the two Parties to the obedience which
they ow'd him.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly this design was not
ill laid; but by the prudent Conduct
and Valour of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> on
the one side, and on the other of the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> this specious project
happen'd quite after another manner,
than he had imagin'd. And this is
my present Business to discover, by
describing exactly and in order, the
Exploits of these three Armies, which
had all of them such different Success.</p>
            <p>The first of them who was oblig'd
to take the Field, was the Duke of
<hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> to oppose the Progress which
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> began to make in
<hi>Guyenne</hi> and in <hi>Poitou.</hi> This Duke
was that famous Favourite, whom the
King, to comfort himself for the loss
of his other Minions <hi>Quelus</hi> and <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giron,</hi>
who were kill'd in Duel, and St.
<hi>Megrin</hi> who was Murther'd as he went
out of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> took pleasure to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42159:129"/>
raise to the highest Honours of the
Realm, so far as even to make him his
own Brother-in-Law by Marrying
him to <hi>Margaret</hi> Princess of <hi>Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
Sister to the Queen, and loading
him with Wealth and Favours, which
he lavish'd upon him with a full hand,
without Rule or Measure; Insomuch
that he seem'd as if he wou'd share the
Kingdom with him, and make him
equal to himself: which things are not
compatible with the Dignity, nor
consequently with the Friendship of a
King, as they are with that of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that amongst all that
Crowd of Favourites and Minions,
who made themselves insupportable
under this Reign, especially to the
Princes and the Nobility, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
of their Carriage, and abusing
the favour of their Prince, this man
was the least hated of the whole Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
for, besides that he was of a Birth
much more illustrious than any of the
rest, he was also without comparison
the most well-Natur'd, being Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Obliging, Civil, pleas'd with
doing good Offices, and above all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42159:130"/>
things Magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icent, even beyond what
can be express'd, as if he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to equalize the greatness of his
Fortune, by that of his Bounty, which
in a manner bore proportion with the
prodigality of the King his Master:
Insomuch that one day finding at his
Chamber-door the four Secretaries of
State, who had waited long for his
coming out, after having excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them with all manner of civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he presented them with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crowns, which just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had receiv'd from the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the King.</p>
            <p>But, as with all these good Qualities,
he was extremely vain, opinionated
of his own capacity for all things,
though as yet he had gain'd no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of experience; the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
his Rival, who endeavour'd to
make his advantage of the other's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from Court, and to get the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hand in the King's favour, infus'd
into him with great artifice the desire
of Commanding that Army, which
was to be sent into <hi>Guyenne</hi> against the
King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> In effect he sued
for it, and fail'd not to obtain it of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42159:130"/>
King, who was not able to refuse him,
though he had promis'd it before to
Marshal <hi>d' Aumont,</hi> who being endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Conduct, Valour, Experience
and Fidelity, had certainly acquitted
himself much better of that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>At first he had indifferent good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> in <hi>Givaudan,</hi> and
in <hi>Rouergue,</hi> which he had order to
cleanse of the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> from thence
to pass into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and afterwards
into <hi>Guyenne.</hi> He took some little
Places which were tolerably strong;
amongst others <hi>Maleziou, Marenghol,
La Peyre</hi> in <hi>Givaudan,</hi> and <hi>Salvagnac</hi>
in <hi>Rouergue;</hi> from whence he March'd,
and presented himself in <hi>Battaglia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Tholouse,</hi> intending thereby to
give notice to the Parlament, that he
was come to joyn himself with the
Marshal of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> his Father, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the King in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
that great Town, from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
neighbourhood of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi>
After which, his Army being
much diminish'd by Sickness, and by
the retiring of many Gentlemen to
their own Houses, he left there the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42159:131"/>
Marquis of <hi>Lavardin, Iohn de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manoir,</hi>
his Marshal de Camp, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
in Post to the Court, there to
pass the Winter.</p>
            <p>The year following he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the same Fortune; for as he
had been inform'd, that the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> who had taken the Field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made himself Master in <hi>Poitou</hi>
of <hi>Talmont, Chizay, Sasay,</hi> St. <hi>Maixant,
Fontenay</hi> and <hi>Mauleon,</hi> he return'd to
the Army with great speed, bringing
with him a recruit of six or seven
thousand Men, with whom he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
St. <hi>Maixant,</hi> possess'd himself
of <hi>Tonnay-Charente,</hi> and of <hi>Mallezays,</hi>
made incursions even to the Gates of
<hi>Rochelle,</hi> and cut in pieces two or
three Regiments of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
whom he forc'd in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
But, after two Months of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,
the Plague and the Deserters,
who were many, having extremely
weakn'd his Army, he the second time
return'd to Court, leaving his Army
as before, under the Command of the
Marquis of <hi>Lavardin,</hi> who had not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42159:131"/>
the good fortune to preserve it, so well
as he had done the year before.</p>
            <p>For the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was
March'd out of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> with all the
Forces he cou'd make, to distress the
Army of <hi>Lavardin,</hi> having heard that
he was making his Retreat towards
the River of <hi>Loire,</hi> follow'd him so
close, that on the twenty eighth, and
the twenty ninth of <hi>April</hi> he surpris'd
him, and cut in pieces one half of
his Cavalry, and even the Duke's Gens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darms,
consisting of threescore and ten
Horsemen, were all kill'd or taken,
together with his own Standard. All
that the Marquis of <hi>Lavardin</hi> cou'd
doe, after this defeat, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
at full speed to <hi>La Hay</hi> upon the
<hi>Creuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was before this place, which was
not assaulted for want of Cannon, that
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> receiv'd a Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
of six hundred Horse, and
two thousand Arquebusiers, which
the Vicount <hi>de Turenne</hi> brought him
from <hi>Perigord</hi> and <hi>Limousin;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
at the same time, the Prince of
<hi>Condè</hi> came to joyn him with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the Gentry from <hi>Saintonge.</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:42159:132"/>
And it being then reported, that the
young Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> (whom he
had drawn into his party by large
promises, as well as the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>
that Count's Brother,) was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to the <hi>Loire</hi> with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Gentlemen, and five hundred
Dragoons, he advanc'd as far as <hi>Monso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi>
upon that River, whither the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Turenne,</hi> who went to receive
him at <hi>Lude,</hi> with a convoy of seven
hundred Horse, brought him without
the loss of one single man.</p>
            <p>This being done, it was resolv'd in
their Council to pass no farther in the
direct way towards the <hi>Germans</hi> whom
they were to meet; because they were
not yet strong enough, and that they
shou'd have upon their hands both the
King's Army, and that of the Duke of
<hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> who wou'd certainly beat
them, which by consequence wou'd
prove the defeat of the Foreign Army.
For which reason they return'd into
<hi>Poitou</hi> with design to fetch a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and to gain the passage of the
River more upward toward <hi>Roan,</hi> and
afterwards to march into <hi>Bourgogne,</hi>
there to receive the <hi>German</hi> Army,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42159:132"/>
to whose principal Commanders the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> dispatch'd away <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
to desire them that they wou'd
take that way. But that King had
not the leisure to execute his intended
Enterprise, because he was follow'd
so hastily by the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi>
that there was a necessity of coming
to a Battel, which was given in the
manner that I am now going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>The news being already spread at
Court of the late successes of the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> to
whom the King had given a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
recruit of Souldiers, and who
was accompanied by all the young
Gallants and sprightly Noblemen of
the Court, who according to custome
attend the Favourite, receiv'd orders
to repair immediately to the Troups
he had left with the Marquis of <hi>Lavar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi>
to follow the <hi>Navarrois,</hi> which
way soever he bent, and to hinder his
conjunction with the <hi>Germans.</hi> In
order to this he came to <hi>Tours,</hi> where
having understood, that the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> being gone from <hi>Monsoreau,</hi>
was upon his retreat in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42159:133"/>
hasting into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> he pursued his
Army with so much speed, that he
got before it at <hi>Saintonge,</hi> insomuch,
that having pass'd the River of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente,</hi>
at <hi>Chasteauneuf,</hi> coasting always
on the left hand, he came by the way
of <hi>Barbesieux</hi> to <hi>Chalais,</hi> very near the
River <hi>Drogne,</hi> the same day, being the
Eighteenth of <hi>October,</hi> that the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who had taken more on
the right hand, by <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
at <hi>Monlieu,</hi> somewhat farther off
on this side the River, having receiv'd
some small recruits, and Cannon, which
he had from <hi>Rochelle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At some little distance from that
place, the small River of <hi>Drogne</hi> casts
it self into that of <hi>Lisle,</hi> which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
the larger of the two: The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
has its source in <hi>Limosin,</hi> near
St. <hi>Irier,</hi> and the former in <hi>Perigord</hi>
near <hi>Brantome;</hi> and after having been
mix'd for three or four <hi>Leagues,</hi> they
disembogue themselves into the <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogne,</hi>
overagainst <hi>Libourne.</hi> A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the place where these two Rivers
meet, is situate the <hi>Bourg</hi> of <hi>Guitre,</hi>
and somewhat above it that of <hi>Coutras,</hi>
with a reasonable strong Castle upon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42159:133"/>
the <hi>Drogne</hi> betwixt the two Rivers.
Now the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being
of necessity to pass them, that he
might follow his intended way to
<hi>Guyenne,</hi> the Marshal of <hi>Matignon,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of that Province, one of the
most faithfull, most valiant and most
prudent Captains which <hi>France</hi> has
ever had, and who had orders from
the King to assist <hi>Monsieur de Ioyeuse,</hi>
writ him word, that he advis'd him to
possess himself speedily of those two
<hi>Bourgs,</hi> and there to intrench, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him that he wou'd not fail to be
at <hi>Libourne,</hi> by the 22d day, with all
the Forces he could draw together from
<hi>Gascogne, Quercy, Perigord</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosin.</hi>
'Twas prudently consider'd
by him; for there was nothing more
wholsome than this counsel, because
in following it, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
had easily been stopp'd; without
daring to attempt the passage either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the conflux of those two Rivers
or below it; or in case he had attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
it, he had been shut up betwixt
two Armies, each of which cou'd not
be ingag'd with more than half of
his, when the other half had pass'd the
River of <hi>Lisle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:42159:134"/>
But the foresight, the celerity and
the resolution of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
on the one part, and on the other the
rashness, the presumption and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> broke
those just measures which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
of <hi>Matignon</hi> had taken. For the
next morning, <hi>Lavardin, Marshal de
Camp</hi> to <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> who had advanc'd
the night before with 120 light Horse
to possess himself of <hi>Coutras,</hi> found
that <hi>La Trimoüille</hi> had prevented him
an hour before, and seiz'd that Post,
with greater numbers than he had
with him. Insomuch that he was
forc'd to return to the Duke, who was
gone to pass the <hi>Drogne</hi> somewhat
higher at <hi>Roche Chalais;</hi> where he
lodg'd himself while the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
who had follow'd <hi>Trimoüille</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
close, pass'd over his Army at the
Ford of <hi>Coutras.</hi> Thus these two
Armies were inclos'd at the same time
betwixt the two Rivers, at the distance
of two short Leagues from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without any thing betwixt
them, that was capable of hindring
them to ingage, in case they were so
resolv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:42159:134"/>
'Tis true, that both parties had
strong reasons to avoid the Battel; for
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> if he shou'd lose
it, was irrecoverably ruin'd, because
he shou'd be left without any possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of recruiting, at the mercy of two
powerfull Armies, in pursuit of him;
and if he gain'd it, his affairs wou'd
not be in a much better posture than
they were already: because he had
yet upon his hands the Marshal of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon,</hi>
a General of much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
than <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> and the King had
three other Armies on foot, which
might unite themselves to get betwixt
him and the <hi>Germans,</hi> and to hinder his
conjunction with them.</p>
            <p>As for the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> he ought
to have consider'd, that he had to doe
with old Souldiers, more experienc'd,
and better disciplin'd than his own;
which consisted for the most part of
new rais'd men; that the young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
who accompanied him were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
men of Courage, but who had
gain'd no more experience than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
considering which, if he had acted
prudently, he shou'd have stay'd for
the Marshal of <hi>Matignon,</hi> who in four
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42159:135"/>
time at the farthest, wou'd have been
at <hi>Libourne,</hi> from whence he might
easily have joyn'd him. And if the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had endeavour'd to
have hinder'd it, he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
betwixt the two Armies, one
of which had charg'd him in the front,
and the other in the Rere: For thus
in all reasonable probability it must
have happen'd. But the Duke was
so blinded with his eagerness of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(as being infinitely desirous to
redeem his reputation at Court, and to
regain the advantage, which his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
had got over him in the King's
favour, by an eminent victory which
his vanity had assur'd him was indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table)
that his opinion of success hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him beyond those weighty reasons,
the rules of War, and even those of
common sense.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of this, he first of all
others having resolv'd upon the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and giving onely this for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that the Enemy, whom he held
inclos'd betwixt two Rivers, cou'd not
possibly escape, in case they march'd
directly to him before he had time to
get away, all the young Nobless who
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42159:135"/>
surrounded him, gave such loud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of his opinion, crying out,
Battel, Battel, that they drew the rest
into the same resolution; no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able, or daring to resist the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
And there was so much of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in this Council, which was
so hastily concluded, that the Duke,
as if he were assur'd of victory, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but that the Enemy shou'd
escape his hands, before he cou'd
come up to him, began, even before
midnight to march his Army towards
<hi>Coutras,</hi> that he might attack the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> at break of Day. But
that Prince being inform'd of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
by his Scouts, and foreseeing
that he shou'd be constrain'd to come
to a Battel, unless he wou'd incur
the manifest danger of being beaten,
if he shou'd make his retreat in the
face of the Enemy, was resolv'd, for
that reason, to march towards him,
and spare him the pains of half his
way.</p>
            <p>In effect, having heard the account
of a rough Skirmish, which happen'd
in the Night betwixt the Scouts and
the Light Horse of the two Armies,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42159:136"/>
without any considerable advantage
on either side; he got on Horseback
a little before Day, and advancing
towards the Enemy, he went to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
himself of the Place he had design'd
for the Field of Battel, which was a
Plain betwixt six and seven hundred
paces of Diameter, on the far
side of a little Wood, about half a
League distant from <hi>Coutras,</hi> having
that Town on his Back, on his left
hand the <hi>Drogne,</hi> which bounds the
Plain on that side, and on his right
hand a Warren, a Copse, lopp'd the
year before, a kind of little Park ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
towards the Enemy, and fenc'd
onely with an Hedge and Ditch.
There it was that he drew up his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Battalia, which consisted in the
whole of about four thousand five
hundred Foot, and two thousand five
hundred Horse.</p>
            <p>He plac'd on his right Wing, the
biggest of the two Battalions of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry,
made up of the Regiments of
<hi>Castelnau, Parabere, Salignac,</hi> and
some other Companies, who extended
themselves in the Warren, advancing
even to the Hedge and Ditch which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42159:136"/>
fenc'd the little Park that cover'd
them. These were sustain'd on their
left by the Squadron of Light Horse,
which had at their Head <hi>La Trimoü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ille,
Vivans, Arambure</hi> and <hi>Vignoles,</hi>
who Commanded them; and before
them an hundred and twenty <hi>Arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers</hi>
for their Forlorn Hope. There
follow'd them sloping always to the
left, the whole Gendarmery divided
into six Squadrons: the first, consisting
at most of two hundred Gentlemen,
almost all <hi>Gascons,</hi> Commanded by
the Vicount of <hi>Turenne,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Pardaillan, Fontrailles</hi> and
<hi>Choupes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There came after them at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of sixty Paces, the Squadron of
the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> who had with
him <hi>Louis de Saint Gelais,</hi> Marshal <hi>de
Camp, des Agueaux, Montaterre,</hi> the
Vicount of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> the Vidame of
<hi>Chartres,</hi> and more than two hundred
and fifty Men at Arms. There was an
Interval of an hundred and fifty Paces,
betwixt the Prince and the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who Rode at the Head of
his Squadron of three hundred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
amongst whom were the Lords
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42159:137"/>
               <hi>de la Force, de Ponts, de la Boulaye,</hi>
and <hi>de Foix Candale</hi> who bore the
Standard. At last follow'd the young
Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> having after him
the famous Captain <hi>Favas,</hi> and two
hundred Horse in his Squadron, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
from the King two hundred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and sustain'd, on his left, along
the River side, by another gross Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion,
compos'd of the very flower
of the Regiments, which were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Charbonniere,</hi> the young
<hi>Montgomery, de Preaux, de la Borie</hi>
and <hi>de Neuvy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these Squadrons made up a large
Front, and were of little Depth, that
they might take up the more in Bredth.
And the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as he had
formerly seen it practis'd by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>Coligny,</hi> had cast into their
Intervals, on both sides of his Horse,
small Parties of Dragoons, by fifteen
and twenty in a Company, who some
of them with one Knee on the Ground,
some of them half Stooping, and some
of them standing upright, that they
might not mischieve one another,
shou'd discharge upon the Enemy at
fifteen foot distance, for certainty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Execution. And his Artillery, which
the Night before he had left beyond
the River, that he might pass it more
speedily to gain <hi>Coutras,</hi> being come
up to him, just in the nick, under the
Convoy of <hi>George Clermont d' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise,</hi>
Master of the Ordnance, was
advantageously plac'd on a small as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
at the right hand of the Count
of <hi>Soiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns.</hi> Thus was this Army
rang'd in form of a Crescent, whose
two Battalions of Infantry, more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
than the Squadrons towards
the Enemy, made the two Horns,
and betwixt both of them the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> and the
Vicount of <hi>Turenne</hi> form'd the hollow
of the middle part.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke of
<hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> having pass'd through certain
narrow and troublesome ways, which
lay betwixt his last Nights Lodging and
the Plain, and that with difficulty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
which was caus'd by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
March of his young Gallants,
whose eagerness was not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
the Marquis of <hi>Lavardin</hi>
his Marshal <hi>de Camp</hi> a great Souldier,
on whom chiefly he rely'd, drew up
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42159:138"/>
his Army into Battalia, as well as the
disorder wou'd give him leave; his
whole Forces, at that time, not amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to more than nine thousand men,
and those ill Disciplin'd. Over against
that gross Battalion which inclos'd the
right Wing of the Enemy, he plac'd
on his left Wing the Regiments of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy</hi>
and <hi>Tiercelin,</hi> which form'd a
Battalion of eight hundred Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
cover'd with about a thousand
Corslets. These had on their right
hand the Light Horsemen and the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banois,</hi>
Commanded by their Captain
<hi>Mercurius Buat,</hi> and another Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of four hundred Lances, whom
<hi>Lavardin</hi> himself chose to Lead in the
room of <hi>Monsieur de Souvrè,</hi> who lay
dangerously hurt of a fall. <hi>Montigny</hi>
who Commanded another of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Lances, was plac'd on the same
hand, in opposition to the Vicount of
<hi>Turenne;</hi> after which, bending still
towards the River which they had on
their right Hand, there was extended
on both sides the way right over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the three Princes, a gross of
twelve hundred Lances, wherein was
the Person of the General, and the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42159:138"/>
Standard, born by the <hi>Sieur de Maillay
Bressay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The whole body of the young
Gallants who were Voluntiers, with
the greatest part of the Noblemen and
Gentlemen, were in this gross, the
first Rank of which was compos'd
onely of Counts, Marquesses and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
having at their Head the Duke
of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> accompanied by his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Brother the Marquis of Saint <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veur,</hi>
and the brave St. <hi>Luc;</hi> and to
close the Right Wing, there was plac'd
betwixt the Standard and the <hi>Drogne</hi>
another gross Battalion, made up of the
Regiments of <hi>des Clus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aux,</hi> and <hi>de
Verduisant,</hi> sustain'd by seven Cornets
of Dragoons, which might make in
all a gross of near three thousand men.
The Artillery which like the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi>'s consisted onely of a few
Field-Pieces, was planted advancing
a little towards the right hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the gross Squadron of the Duke
of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> and that of <hi>Montigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Armies, which continu'd
in presence of each other for the space
of almost an hour, without moving,
made two very differing Prospects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:42159:139"/>
For on the one side, there was nothing
to be seen but guilded Armour, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
damasqu'd, glittering in the
Sun; painted Lances cover'd over
with Ribands, with their Banderolles
dancing in the Air, rich Coats of
Velvet, with broad Lace and Galoon
of Gold and Silver, wherewith every
Troup was Habited, according to the
Colours of his Captain; large and
beautifull colour'd Plumes, waving
on their Crests, and shadowing them in
large Bunches; Scarfes magnificently
embroider'd, and edg'd with long Gold
Fringe, and all these young Cavaliers
carrying the Cyphers and Colours
of their Mistres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, as proudly adorn'd
as if they were Marching in a Carrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
and not upon the point of giving
Battail. To conclude, we may say
it was an Army equipp'd after the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
mode, where so much luxury and
pomp was seen, and so much Gold and
Silk, in the Habits of the Men and the
Caparisons of the Horses.</p>
            <p>But the contrary side afforded no
such Spectacle; old Souldiers inur'd
to toil and labour, whose meens were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ierce and menacing; uncomb'd, ill
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42159:139"/>
cloath'd, with their long Buff-Coats
all bespawl'd, over their course thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
Clothes, having no other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than trusty Bilbo by their sides,
and sound Armour on their Breasts,
Mounted on travelling Horses, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Housses, or any other part of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
besides the Horsemen on their
backs; in fine, the Army of another
<hi>Alexander,</hi> in opposition to that of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two Armies so very different,
having look'd each other in the Face,
long enough to take their Measures,
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> somewhat before
Nine of the Clock, commanded Prayers
to be made, to ask the assistance of
Almighty God, making loud Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that he was not going to fight
against his King, but against the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi>
who had enterpris'd the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Royal House, by deprive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Birthright the Heir pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
of the Crown. This exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was not imitated in the Army of
the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse:</hi> on the contrary,
when they perceiv'd a kind of motion
in the other Army when they were at
Prayers, some who were about the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42159:140"/>
Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> cry'd out aloud in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision
of them, they are our own, the
Cowards tremble: But the <hi>Sieur de
Vaux</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Monsieur de Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legarde,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Saintonge</hi> told
him plainly in these words; No, no,
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> believe it not, I know those
people better, they are now at their
Devotions, but you shall see them
fight like Lions.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon this, the Cannon
began to play; the first discharge
which was made from the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>'s
Ordnance, took place in the
very Standard of the Duke, which
was an ill <hi>omen</hi> to him, and all the
other Vollies, thundring athwart the
thick Forest of their Lanciers, into the
gross Battalion which clos'd their le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t
Wing, put all the Regiment of <hi>Tierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
into a vast disorder, sweeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
whole ranks of them at once.
On the contrary the Duke's Cannon,
did little or no Execution; for besides
that it answer'd not the roaring of the
other, till some time after, it kill'd
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> onely one Horse of the Prince of
<hi>Condè</hi>'s Squadron; because their Guns
were so unadvisedly planted, and the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42159:140"/>
Cannoniers took their aim so very low,
that the Bullets were grounded in a
little rise of Earth, which intercepted
their passage to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Lavardin,</hi> crying out to his
General that all was lost, if they gave
time to their Enemies to fire again,
immediately sounded the Charge, and
joyning to his own Squadron, those
of the light Horsemen and the <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>
gave in so furiously on the gross
of the Enemies light Horse, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at the first onset overturn'd <hi>la
Trimoüille</hi> and <hi>Arambure</hi> with his
Lance, and dangerously wounded <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi>
their whole Squadron was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
routed, and pursu'd into <hi>Coutras,</hi>
where the <hi>Albanois</hi> fell to Plundering
the Baggage, which the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
had left behind him in that
Town. At the same time <hi>Montigny</hi>
who was directly opposite to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Turenne,</hi> perceiving the
Flank of his <hi>Gascons</hi> to lie bare, by
the flight of the light Horsemen
which they had on their right hand,
push'd them so vigorously on that
part, that he broke into them, and

side to the other, that whole Squadron,
which thus disorder'd, were put to
the rout, as their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellows the light
Horse had been before them.</p>
            <p>There were some of them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of those who had the reputation of
the bravest, so throughly seiz'd with
this sudden fright, that they took the
River, and flying for their Lives, as
fast as they cou'd Spur, carri'd as far
as <hi>Pons</hi> the false report of their Armies
being wholly routed, for which they
had afterwards so much regret, that
they died for shame and sorrow of it.
This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light of the light Horsemen was
so precipitate and so general, that at
first there were onely remaining in
the Field <hi>Turenne</hi> and <hi>Choupes,</hi> with
one other Gentleman, to whom <hi>la Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moüille</hi>
and <hi>Arambure</hi> joyn'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who having been remounted,
and seeing they were abandon'd by
their Souldiers, cast themselves into
the Squadron of the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi>
to combat by his side.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that the greatest part of
these Runaways, immediately ralli'd, and
put themselves in order behind the
squadrons of the Princes, to repair their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42159:141"/>
fault by Fighting, as afterwards they
did most Valiantly. But this cou'd
not save them from the severe raillery
of their own party. For as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
seen, that there is a kind of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
and we may almost call it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
betwixt neighbouring Provinces,
those of <hi>Saintonge</hi> and of <hi>Poitou,</hi> who
had no great kindness for the <hi>Gascons,</hi>
and who besides were somewhat
picqu'd, that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was
us'd to praise them a little too extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly,
seeing them first disorder'd
and then routed, cry'd out as loud as
possibly they cou'd, after the example
of <hi>Monsieur de Montausier,</hi> 
               <q>At the least
it cannot now be said, that these are
either <hi>Poitevins</hi> or of <hi>Saintonge.</hi>
               </q> This
made the <hi>Gascons</hi> ready to burst with
extremity of choler; but all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
they took, was to strain their
Forces to the utmost as they did, by
a noble emulation, to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
yet better than those Valiant
men.</p>
            <p>To proceed, this first disorder was
so far from drawing on a greater, as it
ordinarily happens, that it onely serv'd
to augment the Courage and Valour
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42159:142"/>
of the rest. For on the one part, the
foot of the left Wing, which had
bravely advanc'd to push o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Pike, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Regiment <hi>des Cluseaux,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beheld the rout of the light Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and the <hi>Gascons,</hi> and hearing the
shouts of Victory which were already
Echo'd from the Duke's Army, were
not discourag'd from passing on, and
discharging furiously at a very small
distance; after which changing hands
with their Musquets, and taking to
their Swords, they cry'd out to each
other with a generous despair, let us
run to our death in that Battalion;
they open'd their passage through the
Enemies Pikes, which they either cut
asunder, or struck aside, they broke in
upon them, they scatter'd them, and
made a terrible Execution.</p>
            <p>On the other part, the Gentlemen
and Cavaliers of the Prince's Squadron,
seeing those of their Companions who
fled, and their Enemies pursuing at
their Heels, with shouts of Joy cast
on them a fierce disdainfull look, and
told one another laughing, these People
have their Business yet to doe, we are
they that must abate their pride. And
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42159:142"/>
it fell out as they desir'd; the Enemy
came up to them: For the Duke of
<hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> swell'd with the happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the first Encount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he went to a Victory as good as
gotten, spurs on before his Troups,
making a pompous shew, his rich
Armour glittering with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and ennammell, almost hidden
under his Plumes and Ribands, and
making a sign, both with his Voice
and Hand, for all his Braves to follow
him, the whole Squadron together
take their carrier of four hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and giving the Reins to their
Horses, with their Lances in the rest,
run at full speed against the three
Princes.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
who that day was onely habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like a private Souldier, in a plain
gray Suit of Arms, with a Head-piece
of the same, barefac'd to be known in
the thickest of the throng, rode through
every rank, in few words exhorted
the nearest to him, and with his
Gesture and his Eyes the more remote,
to Fight like men of Honour, for the
rights of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Royal House, and onely
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42159:143"/>
to behave themselves like him: After
which placing before him eight Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
of such as were the surest arm'd,
with strong Lances to overturn the
first who made head against him, and
to open his passage into the Squadron,
he commanded his men to advance
onely ten paces, and to expect the
shock of the Enemy, ordering his
Horsemen, who for the most part
were Arm'd but with Sword and Pistol,
not to Fire but at a very near distance,
that every shot might certainly take
place.</p>
            <p>These Orders being well executed,
were the gaining of the Battail; for
that gross of Horse which came up to
the Charge at full Gallop, was well
clear'd by the furious discharge that
was made by the first Ranks of the
Dragoons, which the Princes had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
amongst their Squadrons. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those Counts and Marquesses
and young Courtiers, who had taken
that Post of Honour, were beaten
from their Horses; and for the rest,
who had taken their carrier too far,
they were out of breath, when they
shou'd have given the blow with their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42159:143"/>
Lances, their strokes were so feeble,
that they had little or no effect, and
the Princes broke in upon them with
so much Vigour and promptitude,
that they gave them not leisure to let
their Lances descend, which therefore
they were forc'd to throw away, and
betake themselves to their Swords
and Pistols. By this means they were
reduc'd to an equality of Arms, but
with very different success.</p>
            <p>For the three Squadrons of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being at a just distance from each
other, and in excellent order, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd
that of <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> on three sides;
The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> charging him
in Front, the two Princes in the
Flanks; the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> on the
right side, and the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> on
the left. All three of them in that
bloudy medley performing what cou'd
possibly be expected from Valiant
men; But the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
above the rest, that he might
animate his Souldiers, who beheld
him exposing himself to danger like
the meanest man amongst them, gave
admirable proofs of his courage in
every place. He came even to shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42159:144"/>
in the Press such of the Enemies
whom the ardour of combating, or
the crowd of the combatants drove by
chance against him; and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
ingag'd betwixt two Valiant men,
the Baron <hi>de Fumel,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur de
Chasteau Renard,</hi> who was Guidon to
<hi>Sansaac,</hi> who made up to him with
their Swords on high, while at the
same instant, a Gendarme struck on
his Head-piece with the Truncheon of
his Lance, he fir'd his Pistol on one of
them, collard the other whom he
took Prisoner, crying out to him,
<hi>yield Philistin;</hi> and disengag'd himself
from the third, who was immediately
taken by one of his Esquires. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
all that great body of Gendar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,
in which consisted almost the
whole strength of the Duke's Army,
having been so vigourously charg'd
and broke on every side, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
cut in pieces, and intirely
defeated in less than half an hour,
without being able once to Rally, and
that not out of Cowardise, but on the
contrary, (what never or very rarely
happens,) by the too great courage
of the vanquish'd Party. For the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42159:144"/>
greater part of them being Lords of
the highest Quality, and Gentlemen
almost all young, full of bravery and
fire; they thought so little of disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
or of betaking themselves to
Flight, that there were not ten of
them kill'd or made Prisoners out of
the Field of Battail, where they rather
chose to perish, than to yield one foot
of ground.</p>
            <p>After this defeat, the Conquerours
having joyn'd their own Battalions,
who encourag'd by the example,
fought with almost equal advantage
against the adverse Infantry, it was no
longer a Combat, but a most horrible
Slaughter of that miserable Foot; to
whom they gave no manner of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> had given none
to the two Regiments, which he had
defeated near St. <hi>Maixant.</hi> As for
that Duke, when he beheld that all
was lost, instead of taking on the
right hand, to save himself at <hi>La Roche
Chalais,</hi> he turn'd upon the left, with
intention to go to his Cannon, and
Fighting beside it to end his days:
saying to St. <hi>Luc,</hi> (who ask'd him
what he resolv'd to doe.) To live no
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42159:145"/>
longer, <hi>Monsieur de</hi> St. <hi>Luc,</hi> but to
die generously after my Misfortune.
But even that last Happiness was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd
him; for he had not made twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or thirty Paces towards his Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
when he fell into the hands of
two Captains, St. <hi>Christopher,</hi> and <hi>la
Viole:</hi> and as he was offering them
for his Ransome an hundred thousand
Crowns, a Sum which those two
Captains had not been very sorry to
receive, there came up two others,
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>des Centiers,</hi> who
whether out of hatred or revenge, or
out of spight, that they had not taken
him themselves, to have shar'd so
great a Ransome, basely discharg'd
their Pistols on him; Shot him into
the Head, and overturn'd him dead
upon the place.</p>
            <p>The Valiant St. <hi>Luc,</hi> who took
upon the spot a resolution as generous
as his, and much more daring, was
also much more fortunate in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it: For having perceiv'd the
Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> at a distance, and
distinguishing him from the rest, while
that Prince was eagerly pursuing his
Victory, he comes up to him at a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42159:145"/>
round Gallop, and couching his Lance,
overturns him to the Ground with a
great stroke, which he gave him full
in the middle of his Cuirasse, after
which, immediately throwing himself
from his Horse, he presented him his
hand with extreme respect, to lift him
from the Earth, and at the same time,
beg'd him to receive him as his Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
which the brave Prince, admire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the courage and prudence of his
Enemy, perform'd, embracing him
with all the generosity of which he
made profession.</p>
            <p>This Victory was complete: the
Colours, the Cannon, the Baggage,
remain'd in possession of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
and with these, the Field
of Battel, cover'd with betwixt
four and five thousand Souldiers, and
four hundred Gentlemen of the Dukes
Army, who lay extended on the Plain;
amongst whom, besides the Duke of
<hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> and his young Brother <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de</hi> St. <hi>Sauveur,</hi> were the Counts
<hi>de La Suze, d' Avaugour, d' Aubijoux,</hi>
the <hi>Sieurs de Neuvy, du Bordet, de
Mailly-Bressay, de Roussay,</hi> youngest
Brother of <hi>Piennes,</hi> Guidon to <hi>Ioyeuse,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42159:146"/>
de Vaux,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Bellegarde,
d' Alluin de Fumel, de Roche fort de
Croissotte, de Tiercelin, Saveuse,</hi> who was
<hi>Mestre de Camp,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de</hi> St.
<hi>Lary-Bellegarde,</hi> Son to the Marshal
of the same Name, and Governour of
<hi>Saintonge</hi> and of <hi>Angoumois,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mortally wounded, died not long
after of his hurts. Almost all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of the Army were made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
excepting onely the <hi>Albanois,</hi>
who forsaking the pillage, about
which they were busied at <hi>Coutras,</hi>
preserv'd themselves by flight, and
the Marquis of <hi>Lavardin,</hi> who not
being able to Rally his men, who had
pursu'd the Runnaways too far, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
almost alone to <hi>Roche-Chalais,</hi>
with one Ensign which he sav'd out
of the Regiment of <hi>Picardy.</hi> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
way very Honourable to that
Valiant Gentleman, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
<hi>Calvinism,</hi> which his Father
had embrac'd, combated that day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as against
the Head of the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> but not
long after, casting himself into his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for the defence of the State and the
Rights of the Crown, he always
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42159:146"/>
fought for him against the <hi>League,</hi>
with so much Valour, Conduct, and
Fidelity, that at length he receiv'd in
Recompence of his long Services, the
Baston of Marshal <hi>de France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, this memorable Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cost not the Conquerours above
five or six Gentlemen, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the lustre of it, was the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Clemency of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi>
By his own presence he stop'd
the fury of the Souldiers, who were
putting all the Infantry to the Sword.
He receiv'd all Prisoners of Quality
with infinite Courtesie, he chear'd them
for their loss by extolling their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
he sent almost every man home
without paying Ransome; he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>or'd
to the Parents and Relations, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of such as had died Honourably in
the Field of Battel, and beyond all this,
the Corps of the Duke <hi>de Ioyeuse,</hi> for
whom the King, in continuance of his
favour even after Death, perform'd a
most magnificent Funeral with Royal
Pomp. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, this Generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
had so much moderation that
he sent his immediate protestations to
the King, that aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r this advantage he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42159:147"/>
demanded nothing more, than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his favour, and the restoring
of that Peace which his Majesty had
graciously given him, and which their
common Enemies had broken.</p>
            <p>But after all, it must be ingenuously
acknowleg'd, that as he had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and valour of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in this
Battel, so he had his misfortune too,
in not understanding the art of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his Victory, or in his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to use it. For were it that the
Conquerours enrich'd with the Spoils
of their Enemies long'd for Quiet,
that they might enjoy their Booty at
their ease, or that the Noblesse who
had serv'd under him as Volunteers,
had not oblig'd themselves to longer
Duty than till that time; or that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
weaken'd by his Victory the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>League,</hi> he desir'd not that
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who confided more in
the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> than himself,
shou'd encrease their strength, or to
speak more plainly, that certain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
ingagements, somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a Victorious <hi>Heroe</hi> recall'd
him into <hi>Bearne;</hi> most certain it is
that he dissolv'd his Army, and licens'd
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42159:147"/>
them to the time he had appointed,
then, repass'd the <hi>Garonne</hi> speedily,
with part of the Ensigns and Colours
he had taken from the Enemy, which
he was ambitious to present to the
fair one whom he lov'd, instead of
putting himself into a condition, of
reaping that Fruit which he might
reasonably expect from so great a
Victory, and of going speedily to joyn
the great Army of <hi>Germans,</hi> which
was Marching to his Assistance; and
concerning which, it will now be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that I speak.</p>
            <p>For while these things were acting
in <hi>France,</hi> the Protestant Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> who were furiously incens'd
against the King, for that disdainfull
and rough answer, which he had made
to their Ambassadours, set on foot a
more powerfull Army, than ever they
had sent into this Kingdom, for the
succour of the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> There were
in this Body which was rais'd, eight
thousand five hundred <hi>Reyters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
five and six thousand <hi>Lansque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi>
and sixteen thousand <hi>Swissers,</hi>
whom the <hi>Sieur de Clervant</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from the Protestants, for the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42159:148"/>
King of <hi>Navarre:</hi> besides four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
others, whom he had left behind
him in his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>age through <hi>Dauphinè,</hi>
to reinforce the Army of <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi>
but before they were able to joyn him,
they were totally defeated by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Colonel of <hi>Corsica, Alphonso d'
Ornano.</hi> Duke <hi>Iohn Casimir,</hi> of whom
I have frequently made mention in
my History of <hi>Calvinism,</hi> ought to
have commanded these <hi>Germans</hi> in his
own Person; but immediately before
they were to March, he excus'd his
going with them, because he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to stay in <hi>Germany,</hi> having taken
upon him the Government of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi>
during the minority of the
young Electour his Nephew; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they were constrain'd to receive
the Baron of <hi>Dona</hi> his Favourite, whom
long before he had resolv'd to substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
in his room.</p>
            <p>Justice ought in reason to he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to every man's desert, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the naked truth, without taking
up a prejudice on trust from receiv'd
Opinions, which often have very false
Founda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ons: Though the greatest
part of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42159:148"/>
have spoken little to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of this Baron; 'tis nevertheless
most certain, that he was of a Birth
Noble enough to sustain the Quality
of a General, and that he was not at
all below the Dignity of that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being descended from one of
the most illustrious Families of <hi>Prussia;</hi>
and his Ancestours having possess'd for
many Ages the Honour of <hi>Burgraves,</hi>
which is one of the most considerable
of the Empire. He was a man who
wanted neither Sense nor good Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and was besides extremely
brave: but on the other side, he had
neither Authority, nor experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to command so great an Army,
the greater part of whose Officers
were commonly at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, and never willing
to obey his Orders.</p>
            <p>Thus, to speak properly, he was
onely the General of the <hi>Reyters,</hi>
though the <hi>Lansquenets</hi> and <hi>Swissers</hi>
acknowledg'd him for their Chief, in
the room of Prince <hi>Casimir:</hi> But the
young Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> was he,
whom the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had nam'd
for his Lieutenant, and who had the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42159:149"/>
Title of General of that Army. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which, he had no abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Command over it, because there
was a Council compos'd of six <hi>French</hi>
Officers, and as many <hi>Germans</hi> joyn'd
with him, who, together with the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>Dona,</hi> decided all things by plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Voices; which was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of much disorder. For the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
seldom or never joyn'd in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the <hi>French;</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, the <hi>French</hi> were jealous
both of them, and of one another;
so that there cou'd be no good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
amongst them. Besides all
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, there were some of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
whom the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the
most artfull of Mankind, had gain'd
into his Interests, and who underhand
gave him notice of all the resolutions,
which were taken in the Council.</p>
            <p>For the rest, after the Strangers had
receiv'd some part of their Pay, which
the Queen of <hi>England</hi> had suppli'd,
after they had been assur'd of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
and also promis'd that the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> wou'd joyn them in
a little time, and that they shou'd have
onely the <hi>League</hi> upon their hands,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42159:149"/>
and not the King, who had Arm'd for
no other purpose, but to assist them
in the destruction of the <hi>Guises;</hi> they
pass'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> about the twentieth
of <hi>August,</hi> and in the Plain of <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
found <hi>William Robert de la Mark</hi>
Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and his Brother
<hi>Iohn Robert</hi> Count <hi>de la Mark,</hi> who
had waited there for their coming about
fifteen days, with two thousand Foot,
and between three and four hundred
<hi>French</hi> Horse. Thus this Army in
the general review which was made
of it near <hi>Strasburg,</hi> was found to
consist of thirty three thousand men
effective; all experienc'd Souldiers,
and well equipp'd; without reckoning
into the number, the fifteen or sixteen
hundred foot, and two hundred
Horse, which the Count of <hi>Chastillon,</hi>
Son of the late Admiral, brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a small time after; and about
two thousand others who joyn'd
them in their march. Insomuch that
when they enter'd <hi>France,</hi> they were
not less than forty thousand Men;
with eighteen or twenty pieces of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery;
which undoubtedly was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to strike a terrour into those
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42159:150"/>
against whom they march'd in favour
of the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed this distant thunderclap,
which was heard as far as <hi>Paris,</hi> alarm'd
the Council of Sixteen so te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ribly, that
to shelter themselves from the ensuing
Storm, they sent fresh instructions to
the principal Cities of the Kingdom,
and a new form of Oath to unite
them more straitly to themselves in
their common defence: endeavouring
maliciously to make them believe, that
it was the King himself who had call'd
in these <hi>Heretique</hi> Foreigners, with
intention of destroying those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion, and
with design that hereafter Heresie it
self and the Promoter of it shou'd
Reign in <hi>France.</hi> But the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> whose undaunted heart was not
capable of the least cowardise, took
ways much different from theirs, in
pursuance of the same design, <hi>viz.</hi> the
destruction of that formidable Army,
which menac'd him with inevitable
ruine. And he compass'd his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
happily and gloriously, by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
conduct, readiness of wit, and
daring resolution, performing one of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42159:150"/>
the noblest actions which were ever
done, and which alone may justly
rank him with the greatest Heroes of
Antiquity.</p>
            <p>He had almost nothing of all that
had been promis'd him at <hi>Meaux,</hi>
when there was made the partition of
the Forces, which by appointment
were to serve in the King's Army and
in his. Of twenty Troups of Men
at Arms which were order'd him, not
one appear'd at the Rendesvouz that
was assign'd at <hi>Chaumont:</hi> there was
neither Money, nor Ammunition, nor
Cannon sent him: so that having assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Vaucoleur,</hi> on the twenty second
of <hi>August,</hi> all the forces he could get
together, by the means of his friends,
and partly by the money of the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
there were found no more than
a body of three thousand Men; that
is to say, about six hundred <hi>Cuirassiers</hi>
of his own company, and those of the
Prince of <hi>Ioinville</hi>'s, his Son, of the
Count of <hi>Chaligny,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>d'
Aumale,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs</hi> of <hi>La Chastre,</hi>
and <hi>D' Amblize;</hi> three hundred Horse
which were sent him from the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Cambray</hi> by <hi>Balagny,</hi> who had
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42159:151"/>
made himself a <hi>Leaguer,</hi> to change
his Government into a Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
under protection of the <hi>League;</hi>
besides almost as many light Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
some <hi>Italians</hi> some <hi>Albanois,</hi>
which were sent him by the Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
As for Infantry he had no more
than the two Regiments of Captain <hi>St.
Paul,</hi> and of <hi>Iohannes,</hi> on whom he
very much rely'd.</p>
            <p>With these inconsiderable Forces he
went to joyn himself with those of
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> who with
the Succours which he had receiv'd
out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> under the conduct
of the Marquis <hi>d' Avre,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Varambon,</hi> and all he cou'd
Levy in <hi>Germany,</hi> had no more than
seven thousand Foot, and about fifteen
hundred Horse; Insomuch, that both
in conjunction cou'd not make above
twelve or thirteen thousand Men at
most, to oppose against thirty five
thousand, who were coming to fall
on them. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who
foresaw this Tempest, had done what
lay in him to provide against it; and
to put himself in a state of defence by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42159:151"/>
fortifying the greatest part of his
Towns. And observing that <hi>Nancy,</hi>
his Capital City, was of too little
compass to receive those great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Persons of Quality, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men,
who ran thither for refuge
from every quarter, some from their
Countrey-houses, others from their
small Castles, and unfortified Towns, he
took this opportunity to enlarge that
great and beautifull part of it, which
is call'd the New Town; on the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
of which, being without
dispute the fairest and the strongest
of that time, he employ'd his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with so much diligence, that it
was already in condition of making
a stout defence against that Army,
which as numerous and as powerfull as
it was had never th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it.</p>
            <p>These two Armies being one of
them on this side the Mountains of
<hi>Vauge,</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
those Mountains in <hi>Alsace,</hi> a
Council was held in both of them at
the same time; and it so happen'd by
an accident seldom known, that the
same resolution was taken by them
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42159:152"/>
both. In the <hi>German</hi> Army the Duke
of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and one part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
wou'd have it, that the War shou'd
be made in <hi>Lorrain;</hi> to compass (as
they urg'd) at one onely blow the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of that House, which first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
and since that time maintain'd
the <hi>League.</hi> But the bottom of that
design was this, that the <hi>Germans,</hi> had
no great desire to be at so great a
distance from their own Countrey:
and the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> wou'd have
been glad under that pretence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the security of <hi>Sedan</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metz</hi>
to which he knew the <hi>Lorrainers</hi>
cast a longing eye. On the contrary
the <hi>French-men,</hi> the Envoys of the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Baron <hi>de
Dona,</hi> who follow'd the Orders he had
receiv'd from Duke <hi>Casimir,</hi> made it
be concluded, that they shou'd satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselves in their passage through
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> to make what havock they
cou'd in that Countrey, which had been
wholly free from War, since that which
the <hi>Burgundians</hi> made, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
with their last Duke at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Nancy;</hi> and that without stopping
their course by investing Towns, they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42159:152"/>
shou'd hasten their conjunction with
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> who expected
them.</p>
            <p>On the other side, in the Council
which was held at <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> propos'd to hinder the passage of
the Enemy, because, that being well
inform'd of the division which was
amongst them, he doubted not with
those few Troups, which he had then
with him, which notwithstanding
were compos'd of well disciplin'd and
experienc'd men, that he shou'd find
some opportunity of Defeating them
in that narrow Dukedom, inclos'd
on all sides with mountains and Rivers,
or at least that he shou'd force them
back into their own Countrey: and
this was also adher'd to by all the
<hi>French</hi> who were then present. But
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who by no means
wou'd consent to expose his State to
the hazard of a Battel, and who after
all that cou'd be said, had rather his
Dukedom shou'd be ruinated than be
lost; wou'd absolutely have it, that
without opposing the passage of that
Army, one part of his Forces shou'd
be put into his Towns, whither the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42159:153"/>
Countrey-people shou'd retire, with all
the provision they cou'd carry; that
the Ovens shou'd every where be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the Mills pull'd down, and the
Forage destroy'd; and that with the
remaining part of his Forces, they
shou'd coast the Enemies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them, by the scarcity of all
things and by harrassing them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
to depart speedily from
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> and pass into <hi>France,</hi> into
which he was resolv'd he wou'd not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And fearing lest the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> whose design and boldness he
well knew, shou'd engage his little
Army, whether he wou'd or not in
some dangerous Battel, he determin'd
to have the Command of it himself;
and order'd it to be encamp'd betwixt
the New Town, and a little Wood,
which serv'd for a Park to an House
of his Highnesse's, call'd the <hi>Male-Grange;</hi>
watching his opportunity to
employ it to his most advantage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the way which the Enemy
shou'd take.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> then having assembled
in the plain of <hi>Strasburg</hi> almost all
their Troups, and finding the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42159:153"/>
free, by the retreat of those who
shou'd have guarded them, but were
now recall'd to Man their Towns,
pass'd the Mountain near <hi>Saverne,</hi>
without other obstacle besides the
trouble they had for three days space,
in opening the ways which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred
with bodies of great Trees,
laid across the passages. They were
no sooner got over it, than the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> who lost no occasion of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
the <hi>Reyters,</hi> towards whom he
was advanc'd with the Van-guard,
order'd the first Camisade to be given
them, by the famous Colonel <hi>De Rone,</hi>
who was afterwards made Marshal of
the <hi>League,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Swart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenbourg,</hi>
who in the night attack'd the
Quarters of Colonel <hi>Bouck,</hi> who was
undoubtedly the most able Officer
they had. And being such he was
not surpris'd, for the Guard he kept
about his Lodgings was so watchfull,
that he had timely notice, and was
got on Horseback when he was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd;
but he was so vigorously
charg'd, that with all his brave resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
he was not able to maintain
the place from the Assailants; nor
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42159:154"/>
hinder them from taking one of his
Colours, which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
sent immediately to the King: as by
way of Advertisement that the Enemy
was already in his Countrey, and that
therefore it was time to Reinforce
<hi>Monsieur de Guise</hi> with all the Troups
which he had promis'd them.</p>
            <p>The next day which was the last
of <hi>August,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> entring into
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> immediately possess'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of <hi>Sarbourg,</hi> which a <hi>Lorrain</hi>
Gentleman who was in it, with two
Companies sufficient to defend it at
least some little time, surrender'd base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on sight onely of their Fore-Runners
without staying so much as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested.
The like happen'd not to <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
which another young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the same Countrey maintain'd
so bravely, though the Enemies Foot
with their Cannon was lodg'd in the
<hi>Fauxbourg,</hi> that having kill'd of them
more than two hundred men in one
Attacque, he forc'd them to dislodge
with shame: And from thence they
March'd to <hi>Luneville,</hi> before which
they receiv'd a greater affront than
was the former. In effect, the Baron
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42159:154"/>
               <hi>d' Ossonville</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Lorrain</hi>
Infantry, having taken upon him to
defend so weak a Place, where he had
hastily made some slight Fortifications,
shew'd so much resolution grounded on
the promise which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
had given to relieve him, that they
durst not so much as once Attacque
the Town. In this manner these
Foreigners, who acted rather like Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
or Bandits than Souldiers, made
it their onely Business to waste the
Countrey, Plundering, Sacking, and
Massacring the very Women and
Children, in revenge of the great
wants they suffer'd, by being depriv'd
of the means of their subsistance; all
Provisions being lock'd up from them
in the fortifi'd places, in besieging of
which they were unwilling to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
for fear of loosing too much
time.</p>
            <p>That which gave the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
the greatest trouble, was the fear
he had, lest they shou'd ransack
his Town of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which at
that time wanted nothing but Walls,
to be the fairest and the richest <hi>Bourg</hi>
in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> excepting onely <hi>Nancy,</hi>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:42159:155"/>
as it wou'd be at this day, if the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists,
who boasted that they wou'd
restore the late Duke <hi>Charles</hi> to his
Estates, had not finish'd its Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by their feeble Succours, laying
waste the Villages, and open Towns
without Defence, and particularly
that famous and sacred <hi>Bourg,</hi> which
they had never violated as they did,
when they reduc'd it almost into
Ashes, if any spark of Religion, or
Humanity had been remaining in
their Hearts. I hope my Reader will
pardon me for this short Digression,
and give it to the just resentments
which I have against those <hi>Barbarians;</hi>
being, as I am, particularly interess'd,
in the fortune of that miserable Town,
which had never been ruin'd by the
<hi>Croats</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> if a Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> had been its Champion, as he
was on that occasion, which I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to relate.</p>
            <p>For that gallant Prince, seeing the
concernment of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
for it, and its Destruction seeming to
be unavoidable, as lying open on all
sides, took up his quarters there, and
not contented barely to put himself in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42159:155"/>
posture of defending it, he Salli'd out
of it more than once with great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and fell into their Quarters,
which he always carried. Insomuch
that fearing to have to doe with a man
of so great Courage and Conduct,
and withall so fortunate, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to perish, or preserve the place,
which he had undertaken to Desend
with the choice and flower of the
whole Army; they durst not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
it, but instead of Marching
along the Banks of the <hi>Meurte,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which this <hi>Bourg</hi> is Situate, about
two Leagues from their Quarters in
the Nighbourhood of <hi>Luneville,</hi> they
turn'd short upon the left hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Moselle,</hi> which they pass'd
near <hi>Bayon,</hi> to go from thence into
the County of <hi>Vaudemont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, seeing there was nothing
more to fear for the places which are
beyond those two Rivers, they joyn'd
together all their Forces, and form'd
the body of an Army, with intention
to coast the Enemies, to hinder them
from sending out stragling Parties,
and from laying waste the flat Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
according to their ordinary cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:42159:156"/>
This resolution being taken, The
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> who led the Vanguard,
sent <hi>Monsieur de la Chastre</hi> Marshal of
the Camp, to take up Quarters for
the Army at <hi>Pont St. Vincent.</hi> But,
because the Duke at this place per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
one of the bravest Actions,
which have ever been done in War,
and which particularly made manifest
his great Ability and strong <hi>Genius;</hi>
I will take upon me to describe it in the
most exact manner I am able, that the
Beauty of it may be seen in all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Madon</hi> is somewhat
Narrow, but exceeding Deep; it takes
its source at the foot of the Mountains
of <hi>Vauge,</hi> and runs from the South to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North, and having receiv'd
into its Bed, the little Rivers of <hi>Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
Illon, Vittelle, Coulon,</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
it waters the Town of <hi>Mirecour,</hi>
and the Burroughs of <hi>Haroue, Ormes,
Buligny, Acraigne, Blainville,</hi> about
ten Leagues distant from <hi>Nancy,</hi> and
four above <hi>Toul.</hi> A little below this
River thus increas'd, and on this side
the <hi>Moselle</hi> stands <hi>Pont St. Vincent,</hi> a
little City, or rather a great Burrough,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42159:156"/>
Situate on the descent of a Hill,
some part of it inclos'd with weak
Walls; the rest onely fenc'd with a
quick-set Hedge, towards the foot of
the Hill, spreading along by the sides
of the <hi>Moselle;</hi> over which there was
a Bridge; on the right hand it had
the <hi>Madon,</hi> and the rib of a craggy
Hill, planted with Vines, incompass'd
with strong Quick-sets, and the top of
it cover'd with over grown Woods,
which extended even to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of <hi>Toul,</hi> and was parted
from the <hi>Madon</hi> by a Meadow, which
is bounded by that River, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
to a very little bredth.</p>
            <p>Here it was that the <hi>Catholique</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
went to take up their Quarters,
on the fifteenth of <hi>September; Monsieur
de Guise</hi> arriv'd there at seven of the
Clock in the Morning, and without
staying for the gross of the Vanguard
which follow'd him, accompani'd onely
by the <hi>Sieurs de La Chastre, Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre,
de Dunes</hi> Brother to <hi>Monsieur
d' Entragues,</hi> and three or four
besides them, Rideing on Nags,
and all of them Unarm'd as he was,
went to observe some advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42159:157"/>
place, where he might Lodge his
Vanguard, under Protection of the
<hi>Madon,</hi> which he was certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
was not foordable in any part
of it, since the Rains which had fall'n
for four or five days together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermission. But not being able
thereabout to find a Post which was
suitable to his purpose, he advanc'd
as far as the Quarters of his Light-Horse,
who were March'd beyond the
Vanguard, under the Conduct of
<hi>Rone</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Swartzembourg,</hi>
and were Quarter'd almost two Leagues
beyond <hi>Pont St. Vincent,</hi> in the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs
of <hi>Acraigne</hi> and <hi>Buligny,</hi>
where there were Stone-Bridges over
the <hi>Madon.</hi> He found them there get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hastily on Horse-back, pursuant
to the advice which they had just
receiv'd that the whole body of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
which March'd betwixt the
two Rivers, was coming immediately
to fall on them.</p>
            <p>Yet this hinder'd him not from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Madon,</hi> he the seventh man,
and with the same Company, nor
from advancing into the Plain to take
a view of the Enemy. But he had
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42159:157"/>
not gone far, before he discover'd their
Forerunners, and two Cornets of <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
detach'd from the gross of their
Army, who came thundring upon
him, to inclose him. Upon this he
turn'd his Horse, repass'd the Bridge,
and staid on the far side of a Brook,
upon a little Hill, where he rang'd his
light Horse, which were about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to make head against the Enemy.
The <hi>Reyters</hi> who had pass'd the Bridge
of <hi>Buligny</hi> after them, and pursu'd
them hotly, made an halt upon the
Brook side, in expectation of their
Army, which they believ'd to be
much nearer, than in effect it was:
and in the mean time the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> seeing they were not follow'd
by greater Numbers, detach'd against
them the <hi>Sieur de Rone,</hi> and <hi>de la
Route,</hi> who drove them back and
pursu'd them flying upon the Spur,
a good space upon the Plain beyond
the River. But the <hi>Reyters</hi> finding
there three hundred <hi>French</hi> Horse,
and about an hundred and twenty
Dragoons, with three other Cornets
of their Fellows, turn'd upon them
in a full body vigorously, and drove
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42159:158"/>
back those two Troups of Light Horse,
who endeavour'd at a round Gallop to
regain the Hill, where their Friends
were drawn up in Battalia.</p>
            <p>Then it was, (upon the discovery
which they made from their Hill, of
the whole Army which was fileing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Bridge,) that their danger was
almost inevitable: To expect the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and stand their Ground, was
to take a desperate resolution, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all cut in pieces; for how was it
possible for four hundred Horse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Infantry and Cannon to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against an Army of five thousand
men, who were ready to Attacque
them, with eighteen or twenty pieces
of Artillery? To retire was altogether
as impossible; for who knows not that
a Retreat of two Leagues, before an
Army of twelve thousand Horse, and
in open day, can never be attempted
without being expos'd to extreme
Danger, and constrain'd to change it,
to a general Rout; the consequence
of which is, that all must be either
kill'd or taken.</p>
            <p>This being consider'd by <hi>La Chastre</hi>
and <hi>Bassompierre,</hi> who were near the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42159:158"/>
Duke, they earnestly desir'd him, to
provide for his own safety, while they
stopp'd the fury of the Enemy for
some time, to procure him the
means of retiring to the gross of their
Army, leaving the rest to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Fortune, which sometimes
finds out unexpected ways of safety,
when all things are in appearance des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
At which, the Duke looking
upon them with a smiling and assur'd
Countenance; No, no, Gentlemen
(says he) I cannot on such terms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
so many brave men, whom I
my self have expos'd to this present
Danger. I have consider'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it, in its full extent; but I
think, that at the same time I have
found an expedient to draw us out of
it. The Counsell which you have
given me, as believing it necessary for
my safety, I command you to take
for your selves, and for us all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Go
then, to give out Orders to the Army;
draw them up in the narrow Passage,
and upon the Hill which is Planted
with Vines, without <hi>Pont St. Vincent,</hi>
to receive me after I have made the
Retreat, which I take upon my self to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42159:159"/>
doe; which I will perform, after the
manner which I have already cast in
my imagination, and which perhaps
shall be as much without Danger, as
it is without Example.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Rone,</hi> and <hi>La Route,</hi>
having already without loss, rejoyn'd
the Body of Light Horse, he began to
encourage his Souldiers, and that
much less by his Words than by his
Countenance, and that Majestique air,
which animated all his actions, and
inspir'd a part of his own Courage and
assurance into the most fearfull; for
appearing at the Head of his little
Troup, with his Sword in his hand,
otherwise unarm'd upon a Pad,
and beholding his Souldiers and their
Officers with a lively piercing eye,
which when he pleas'd he cou'd even
dart into their Souls, and command
them as he thought good, he spoke
onely a few words to his <hi>French, Italian</hi>
and <hi>German</hi> Officers, to each in their own
Language, and calling them by their
Names, he assur'd them that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
an infallible way of preserving
them, if they wou'd follow his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
undauntedly, and take him for
their Example.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:42159:159"/>
Those few words chearfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
by a Prince, who always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
more than he wou'd promise,
so much encourag'd those four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, that without farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
on the apparent danger of
perishing, and the seeming impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their escape, they look'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully
from their Hill, on that vast
Army of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who having
almost all of them already pass'd the
<hi>Madon,</hi> at the Bridge of <hi>Buligny,</hi>
March'd directly towards them in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,
not doubting but they shou'd
inclose them, and cut them all in
pieces, if they had the confidence to
expect them; or put them to the Rout,
and totally defeat them, if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to make their Retreat before
them. Yet they stood at first in some
suspence, when having pass'd the Brook
which was betwixt them and the Hill,
they beheld them yet standing firm,
and appearing with a resolution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them with their Swords in
their hands.</p>
            <p>So uncommon a Spectacle stopp'd
them a while to observe their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
as fearing perhaps that their
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42159:160"/>
great assurance proceeded from their
being back'd by the whole Army.
But at length resuming Courage, and
being asham'd that they had doubted
one moment to Attacque so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Party, they sounded a Charge
without more delay. Seven Cornets
of <hi>Reyters,</hi> having before them three
hundred <hi>French-men</hi> of Arms, March'd
foremost and began to Mount the
Hill at a round Trot against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but the ascent was so rough,
that their Horses, who were spur'd to
the Quick, grew out of breath, and
constrain'd them to abate of their speed,
and change their Trot into a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace.
Then the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his opportunity to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
according as he had modell'd it
in his Head, in such a manner as none
before him had ever practis'd, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
a little farther off upon the Hill,
so as to be out of sight of the Enemy;
after which having made a half turn on
the right hand, he turn'd short upon
the left hand at the right of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
through a little Valley, which
was betwixt them and the River. His
March was out of View, under cover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:42159:160"/>
of the Hills, which hid that Valley, as
far as to a Foord which he had observ'd,
though he had been inform'd that
there was none: besides which there was
a Mill, wherein he Lodg'd a dozen
Arquebusiers, who were resolv'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it to the utmost, and there he
pass'd the <hi>Madon,</hi> from whence the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
were departed, in pursuit of
him. On that side were onely the
<hi>Swissers,</hi> who March'd after the others
to pass at the Bridge of <hi>Buligny,</hi> and
who being Foot, cou'd neither stop
nor follow that Cavalry which had
pass'd the River below the <hi>Bourg,</hi> and
by that means had the advantage of
them. So that turning Face, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
on the left, along that little
River, on the other side of which the
Enemy was pass'd to Attacque him,
he continu'd to make his retreat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the gross of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which was drawing up in <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
near <hi>Pont St. Vincent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with much difficulty overcome
the top of the Hill, where they thought
to find the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> were strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surpris'd to see him beyond the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42159:161"/>
retiring at his ease. Immediately
they descended with much more
speed than they had Mounted, and
pursu'd him eagerly. But they were
stopp'd so long by those twelve reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Souldiers, who defended the Mill
upon the Foord, at the expence of their
Lives, which they sold at a dear rate,
that before they cou'd be forc'd, the
Duke had the leisure, without mending
his pace, to repass the River on this
side, at another Foord which he had
also observ'd adjoyning to that narrow
space, and that rib of the Hill planted
with Vineyards, where the gross of
his Army lay.</p>
            <p>In this manner that Prince, who
had ingag'd himself too far in discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Enemy, found the means of
saving his little Troup, and retiring
in the Face of a great Army, not by
turning his back as is the usual custome,
but by going on their side, by a new
invented Strategem, and placing the
River twice successively betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the Enemy. And what
Crown'd the glory of the whole action
was, that putting himself at the Head
of five or six hundred Horse, in that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42159:161"/>
little Meadow which is at the foot of
that rib of the Mountain, on which
his Army was not wholly yet embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel'd,
he defended the passage of the
River and always repuls'd the <hi>Reyters,</hi>
who return'd twice or thrice to the
Charge, and did their uttermost to
Force it; and that having left it free
the next Morning, according to the
resolution which had been taken in the
Council of War, he made good the
Retreat of his whole Army, without
the loss of one single man.</p>
            <p>After both Armies had refresh'd
themselves for two or three days, the
<hi>Germans</hi> who were always Coasted on
the Right, and perpetually harrass'd
by the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> who led the
Vanguard, having pass'd the <hi>Meuse</hi>
near <hi>Neufchateau,</hi> enter'd <hi>France</hi> by
the Principality of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> where
they took their first Quarters at St.
<hi>Vrbain.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> who had
follow'd them as far as his own Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and had what he desir'd, when
he had seen the Strangers out of his
Estates, was resolv'd to go no farther,
but retir'd into the Dutchy of <hi>Barre,</hi>
as did also the Marquis <hi>d' Havre</hi> with
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42159:162"/>
his <hi>Walloons,</hi> both of them saying that
they cou'd not enter into <hi>France</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
permission from the King. Thus
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was left to himself,
with his own Troups, which amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not to four thousand men; and
nevertheless he undertook with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Courage, and so small a
Power, to pursue, to infeeble and
entirely to ruine that great Army,
which was yet more increas'd in the
<hi>Bassigny,</hi> by the conjunction of those
Troups, which the brave <hi>Chastillon</hi>
Son to the late Admiral brought out
of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
travers'd <hi>Lionnois</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi>
with incredible difficulty.</p>
            <p>The Duke then undertook them all,
being follow'd by Souldiers as indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
as himself, who believ'd there was
nothing impossible for them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
under his Conduct: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
appearing at the head of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
sometimes at their Rere, then

and afterwards on the left, cutting

               </gap>assing them
Night and Day in a hundred several

manners, he reduc'd them often to
great extremities, particularly after he
was reinforc'd by the Troups, which
were brought him by <hi>Monsieur de
Mayenne,</hi> by <hi>Chaligny, Elbeuf,</hi> and
<hi>Brissac</hi> who joyn'd him at <hi>Auxerre;</hi>
his Forces then consisting of six
thousand Foot and eighteen hundred
Horse.</p>
            <p>With these inconveniences, besides
those which the continual rain, the
broken ways, their gluttony, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
sickness, made the <hi>Germans</hi>
suffer, their Forces having pass'd the
<hi>Saine</hi> near <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and the <hi>Yonne,</hi>
at <hi>Mailly-la-Ville,</hi> they advanc'd about
the middle of <hi>October,</hi> as far as the
Banks of the River <hi>Loire,</hi> which they
thought to have pass'd at <hi>La Charitè;</hi>
where much to their amazement they
found that place not onely in a good
condition of defence, but the King in
person beyond it, with a powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to dispute their passage, on what
part soever they shou'd attempt to force
it.</p>
            <p>In effect, that Prince, according to
the resolution which he had taken to
hinder both the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42159:163"/>
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> from growing too
strong, the first by joyning the Army
of the <hi>Reyters,</hi> and the second by their
defeat, had given the Duke almost
nothing of that Succour which he had
promis'd him, either to stop or fight
the <hi>Germans;</hi> and in the mean time
had assembled a very considerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the neighbourhood of <hi>Gien</hi> on
the <hi>Loire,</hi> to oppose their passage.
His Forces not being less than ten
thousand <hi>French</hi> Foot, eight thousand
<hi>Swissers,</hi> for the most part levyed out
of the <hi>Catholique Cantons,</hi> and eight
thousand Horse, the one half <hi>French</hi>
the other <hi>Germans.</hi> The Duke of
<hi>Montpensier</hi> had also recruited him
with the little body which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
apart; the Dukes of <hi>Nevers</hi>
and of <hi>Espernon,</hi> the Marshals <hi>de Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
and <hi>de Retz,</hi> and <hi>La Guiche,</hi>
Grand Master of the Artillery, had
each of them a Command in it, and
held no very good intelligence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unless in this one particular, that
according to the King's express orders,
they spoil'd and made unpassable all
the Foords from that of <hi>Pas de Fer</hi> near
<hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vers,</hi> as far as <hi>Gien,</hi> by laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cross
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42159:163"/>
them huge bodies of Trees, and
whatsoever else they cou'd find, to
incumber the feet of Men and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>This ill understanding amongst the
Commanders, and the large Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums
which rung in <hi>Paris</hi> of the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> on occasion of every small
advantage which he gain'd upon the
Enemy, and more than all, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
or rather the downright rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who maliciously
accus'd the King of holding intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with the <hi>Navarrois,</hi> at the length
produc'd this effect in him, that sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off his fatal drowziness, and those
soft pleasures of the Court, with much
adoe he came to his Army beyond the
<hi>Gien</hi> about mid-<hi>October.</hi> Where he had
no sooner set his foot, but he began on
the sudden to revive, to appear the
same brave Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> with the
same Heroique soul, which inspir'd
him with so much vigour when he
commanded the Armies of the King
his Brother in the fields of <hi>Iarnac</hi> and
<hi>Moncontour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Undoubtedly there can nothing be
imagin'd more generous or more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42159:164"/>
than what he did on that occasion.
He put himself at the Head of his
Army; he gave out Orders in his own
Person; and caus'd them to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all manner of exactness;
he reunited the minds of his Captains
and Officers, taking care that every
man shou'd employ himself in his own
duty, without interfering with the
business of another. He shar'd with
them the labours and fatigues of War;
lying abroad in Tents, sleeping little,
was first on Horseback, always in
Arms, his Men in good order on the
Bank of the River, appearing in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to receive the Enemy whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shou'd attempt his passage; and
giving him to understand by sound of
Trumpet and beat of Drum, that he
desir'd nothing more than to give him
Battel, if he shou'd dare to seek it on the
other side.</p>
            <p>This manner of proceeding put the
Strangers into a terrible consternation:
The <hi>French Huguenots</hi> who guided
them, had made them to believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they enter'd into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that
they shou'd have the Town of <hi>Charité,</hi>
and the Bridge for friend. That if those
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42159:164"/>
shou'd fail them, the <hi>Loire</hi> was foorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
almost every where during the
Month of <hi>October;</hi> that the King who
kept a secret correspondence with the
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to revenge himself of
the <hi>League</hi> their common Enemy,
either wou'd joyn himself with them,
or at least favour their passage, and
that they shou'd find the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
in a readiness on the far side of
the River to receive them. In the
mean time they found the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all this: the Town of <hi>Charité</hi>
against them, the King in Arms to
combat them, and instead of the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> onely some Envoys from
him, who without being able to ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them of any thing, barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
them that he wou'd suddenly be
with them; or at least in his room a
Prince of the Bloud whom he wou'd
send to command them. This fill'd
with complaints, murmurs, disorders
and Sedition the whole Army, which
was come down as far as <hi>Neuvy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope of being able to force the
passage which the Royal Army in
Battalia beyond the River continually
defended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:42159:165"/>
The <hi>Reyters,</hi> with loud clamours
demanded the Money which had been
promis'd them as soon as they shou'd
be enter'd into <hi>France:</hi> threatning to
return into their own Countrey, in
case they were not immediately satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
The <hi>Swissers</hi> were already har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
to the proposition which some
of their Officers, who were gain'd by
the King, had made to them of passing
into his Army, where they had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
given them of great advantages.
The <hi>Lansquenets</hi> were ready to do as
much; all things manifestly tended
to revolt. And it was not without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
pains, that the Baron of <hi>Dona,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
Officers put an end to this Mutiny
by promising to lead them into <hi>Beauce,</hi>
a Country abounding in all sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
where they might refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at their own leisure, expecting
there the Money and the Prince whom
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> wou'd send to
conduct them by <hi>Vandome</hi> to <hi>Monso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi>
upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> where he waited
to receive them with his Troups.
Thus the Army dislodging from <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
and turning their back to the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42159:165"/>
               <hi>Loire,</hi> took the Road toward <hi>Beauce,</hi>
marching by little journeys all along
the River of <hi>Loing,</hi> where they found
good Quarters on the Estate of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Chastillon,</hi> who spar'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to content the <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
who lay betwixt that River and the
<hi>Yonne,</hi> and had re-assembled all his
Forces near <hi>Charny,</hi> to observe from
thence the motions of the Enemy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
receiv'd information that they
were quarter'd on the twenty fourth of
<hi>October</hi> in the neighbourhood of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi>
advanc'd as far as <hi>Courtenay,</hi>
taking his march from thence towards
the lower part of the River, thereby
to put himself betwixt them and <hi>Paris,</hi>
and to cover that great City, which
lay open to them; so that five or six
thousand <hi>Reyters</hi> detach'd from their
Army, were capable of giving some
terrible Alarm to the Citizens, by
Plundering and Firing of their Suburbs.
This occasion'd the <hi>Parisians,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
their ardent affection to that
Prince, regarding him at that time as
their onely Protectour; and the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi>
who omitted no opportunity of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42159:166"/>
decrying the conduct of the King,
made them believe, that he stopp'd
short at <hi>Gien,</hi> on set purpose to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them to the fury of the <hi>Reyters,</hi>
who without this interposition of the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had ransack'd all things
to their very Gates.</p>
            <p>But this was the least part of their
design; for they intended nothing
more than to pass on the left hand,
through a Countrey more open and
more easie, betwixt the Forest of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Montargis,</hi> and to enter as fast
as they were able into the Plains of
<hi>Beauce.</hi> For which reason, as soon
as he had discovered by his Spies that
their Quarters were taken up for the
twenty sixth of <hi>October,</hi> spreading two
Leagues about <hi>Montargis,</hi> on the left
side of the River, he order'd the <hi>Sieur
de la Chastre,</hi> to depart about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
with the Light Horse; who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at <hi>Montargis</hi> at seven of the
Clock in the Morning, on the same
day, (being the twenty sixth) caus'd
the Gates of the Town immediately to
be shut, that no advice might be given
to the Enemies; and the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> came thither about noon with
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42159:166"/>
one half of the Army, the other half
not being able to come up till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>As he sate at Table supping with
the Princes who accompanied him,
one of his best Officers who had been
sent to take a view of the Enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to make his report, saying, that
he had seen seven or eight Cornets of
the <hi>Reyters,</hi> who took up their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with their General at <hi>Vimory,</hi> a
Burrough almost half a League in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
a League and half above <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argis,</hi>
and situate not far from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which it had on the right hand.
His intelligence was true; but he
knew not that fourteen other Cornets
of them which arriv'd afterwards were
lodg'd in the same place; that the
<hi>French</hi> were Quarter'd but half a
League beyond the <hi>Ladon,</hi> and the
<hi>Lansquenets</hi> and <hi>Swissers</hi> in two other
Villages, which were but the distance
of a League from them.</p>
            <p>The Duke after he had consider'd
for some time what was to be done on
this report, believ'd that those Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at <hi>Vimory</hi> might easily be carried
in the Night, that the others where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42159:167"/>
they might be, hearing the
Alarm, and at the same time fearing
to be attack'd themselves, wou'd think
rather how to secure themselves in their
own Post, and stay for day-light, than
to march in the dark to the succour
of their Fellows: that after he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
the <hi>Reyters,</hi> in the next place
he might attacque the rest, and put
their whole Army to a rout; and in
conclusion if he shou'd miss his blow, he
had secur'd himself a retreat in the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
of <hi>Montargis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus resolv'd, and rising briskly
from the Table, before he had done
Supper, he gave command that they
shou'd sound to Horse, and that every
one shou'd be in readiness to march an
hour after at the farthest: The Duke
of <hi>Mayenne</hi> not a little surpris'd at the
sudden orders, ask'd him whither he
was going? he cooly answer'd him,
to fight the Enemy. And after having
in few words satisfi'd them of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of his undertaking, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that if any man thought the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
too hazardous, he had free
leave to stay behind at <hi>Montargis:</hi> It
may very probably succeed said the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42159:167"/>
Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and we will all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you, yet we are a little too hot
upon the execution of it, and it wou'd
not doe amiss to weigh the business
somewhat better. Understand, Brother,
repli'd the <hi>Guise,</hi> raising his Voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ordinary tone, that I shou'd
not come to a resolution of any thing
in all my life, which I cou'd not resolve
on at a quarter of an hours thinking.
On this he Arm'd and mounted on
Horseback, finding all his Men in
readiness to follow him, full of gaiety
in their faces, and not doubting in the
least of Victory under his Command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all imaginable odds of number.
So important a thing it is in War for
Souldiers to have confidence in their
Captain, that they believe his fortune,
his valour, and his capacity in Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
affairs, will always answer for the
good success of whatsoever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.</p>
            <p>All the Orders being given, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
which was in the Suburbs,
was caus'd to pass through the body
of the Town, an hour before the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in of the Evening; and drawn
up in Battalia, half a League beyond
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42159:168"/>
it. It was divided into three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions,
each of them consisting of a
thousand men. Captain St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that on the right hand; <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes</hi>
had the left, with his Regiment
which form'd the second; <hi>Chevriers</hi>
and <hi>Pontsenac</hi> were in the middle, at
the head of the third; the remainder
was left at the entry of the Bridge, and
in the Town, in order to the favouring
of their retreat.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> who had waited
till eight of the clock, for seven or
eight hundred Horse of his Army,
which were not yet arriv'd from <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenay,</hi>
distant seven long Leagues from
<hi>Montargis,</hi> was resolv'd notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to go on, and advancing the
gross of his Cavalry before his Foot,
he Marshall'd it in four Squadrons.
<hi>Monsieur de Mayenne</hi> led the first, of
three hundred Horse at the head of the
Army: he was sustain'd by <hi>Monsieur
de Elbeuf</hi> with his, of two hundred
Men at Arms. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
plac'd himself on the left hand, and
<hi>Monsieur d' Aumale</hi> on the right of the
Infantry having each of them three
hundred Horse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:42159:168"/>
In this Order this little Army
march'd directly on to <hi>Vimory</hi> through
a long Plain, and in a night so dark
that one man cou'd not discern ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Notwithstanding which they
kept on their way, till the Guides
having advertis'd <hi>Monsieur de Mayenne</hi>
that they were just upon <hi>Vimory,</hi> he
sent before him four Cavaliers, who
found neither Sentinel set, nor Guard
advanc'd, nor Barrs at the entry of the
Town, but the passage wholly free.
For which reason, drawing off a little
on the left hand, as did also <hi>Monsieur
de Elbeuf</hi> on the right to make way
for the Foot, <hi>Monsieur de Guise</hi> having
given the signal to the Infantry, the
three Battalions enter'd one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the great Street of <hi>Vimory,</hi>
where the Baggage of the <hi>Reyters</hi> lay.
And immediately having dispatch'd
the first they met, before they cou'd
so much as ask the Word, they enter'd
the Houses on both sides the Street,
killing all the <hi>Germans</hi> whom they
found: some of them at their Supper,
some in bed, and setting on fire the
Granaries and Cellars to consume those
who absconded in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:42159:169"/>
This Execution lasted for half an
hour, during which they still went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
firing the Houses as they pass'd
along, which being at some distance
from each other, cou'd not spread the
flames either so fast, or so far as they
desir'd. And in the mean time the
Souldiers tempted with the sight of
the <hi>Reyters</hi> Wagons, instead of stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to plunder till they had comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the victory, as their duty is on
the like occasions, fell upon the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in a hurry, and loaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the richest part of the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This gave leisure to the Baron of
<hi>Dona,</hi> who was lodg'd at the farther
end of the Town, to get on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
and rally six or seven Cornets,
with which he made shew of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
against the Foot, who seeing him
coming on, made ready to receive
him, and forsook their plunder; at
the same time calling out to their Horse
to enter and sustain them.</p>
            <p>This their Outcry caus'd two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects, which occasion'd two
great skirmishes, for on the one side
the Baron fearing if he pass'd forward
in the great Street, through the Flames
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42159:169"/>
and Wagons with which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd,
that he shou'd expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without defence to the Shot of
the Infantry, turn'd on the right hand
to another Street adjoyning on the
Plain; on the other side the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> who had taken on the left
hand out of the Burrough, coasting
the Foot, having heard their cry, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
precipitately before his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
who presently lost sight of him
in the dark, and follow'd onely by
threescore Men of Arms, put on at
a gallop to the succour of the Foot,
through the same Street, at the entry
of which he rancounter'd the Baron
with his gross of <hi>Reyters,</hi> which charg'd
him with extreme fury.</p>
            <p>Never was there seen a Combat
more unequal or more sharp. The
Baron, who was exceeding brave, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Cavalry, whose number
he cou'd not distinguish in the dark,
rode up to him who was mounted on
the white Horse at the head of those
Cavaliers, and fir'd his Pistol as he
thought at the sight of his Helmet;
but it carried no higher than the Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.
'Twas the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:42159:170"/>
who at the same time struck with his
full force upon his head, and swept
off a good cantle of the skin; after
which both the one and the other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
his point, the Baron with his
second Pistol kill'd <hi>Rouvroy</hi> who bore
the Duke's colours, and pull'd them
from him; and the Duke well secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by those few brave men who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him, at last broke through
this gross of seven Cornets, having
lost seventeen Gentlemen in the fight
which cost the lives of fourscore <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this there happening a great
Storm which separated the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
the rest of the <hi>Reyters</hi> being
now gotten on Horseback, and there
being some danger, lest the other Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which had already taken the
Alarm shou'd fall upon them before
day, the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> order'd them
to sound the retreat. He made it very
fortunately to <hi>Montargis,</hi> in the same
order, in which he came; and brought
back his Souldiers inrich'd with the
booty which they had taken from the
<hi>Reyters,</hi> who lost in this occasion near
a thousand Men betwixt Souldiers and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42159:170"/>
Servants, a considerable part of
their Baggage, and above twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horses, on which twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot were mounted in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Montargis:</hi> and what most
mortifi'd the Baron, two Camels which
he had design'd to present the King
of <hi>Navarre;</hi> and the Kettle Drums
that are carried before the General
as a mark of Honour, the loss of
which is accounted to be more
shamefull, than that of his own Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard.</p>
            <p>Though this Victory was not very
great, yet it drew after it important
consequences: and made way by the
dangerous effects which it had, to the
total ruine of their Army. The <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
who had lost the better half of
their Baggage, mutined afresh, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
their Pay, and threatning to
retire in case they were not satisfied,
which was not possibly to be done.
The <hi>Swissers</hi> sent their Deputies to the
King, to negotiate their return; and
the matter went so far that the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who led the Vanguard of
the Royal Army, concluded the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with them: by which the King
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42159:171"/>
was oblig'd to pay them four hundred
thousand Crowns, and to grant them
a free passage into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lansquenets,</hi> whom the fatigues
of so tedious a march had reduc'd to a
very ill condition, were also thinking
of some means to obtain the liberty of
going home. The Baron of <hi>Dona</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri'd
on all sides for his extreme neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
in not providing for the security
of his Quarters, had wholly lost his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
amongst them; and the <hi>French</hi>
who conducted them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
reproach'd with the unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their promises, were asham'd to
shew their heads.</p>
            <p>But at last, the certain news of the
great Victory obtain'd by the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> and the hope which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they had, that he wou'd spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
appear, with his victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
together with the arrival of the
Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> whom he sent before
to command them in his place, till he
shou'd himself come up, restor'd their
courage, and caus'd a general rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the whole Army. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King's Forces were gone to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42159:171"/>
encamp at <hi>Bonneval,</hi> to cut off their
way, and hinder them from descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
lower by the Countrey of <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
towards the <hi>Loire,</hi> they took
a resolution to change their Road, and
to march upwards towards the source
of that River, according to the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s request. But seeing they
were at that time in good Quarters, in
the heart of <hi>Beauce,</hi> and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Chartres,</hi> they deferr'd for
some days the departure of the Army.
And that gave opportunity to the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to accomplish at last
with so much glory the execution of
his design, by the famous defeat of the
<hi>Reyters</hi> at <hi>Auneau,</hi> which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
succeeded by the total rout of
that formidable Army.</p>
            <p>That Prince, who some few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Combat of <hi>Vimory</hi> had retir'd
to <hi>Montereau-faut-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onne,</hi> as if he had
turn'd his back upon the <hi>Germans,</hi> who
at the same time enter'd into <hi>Beauce,</hi>
and without caring what constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might be made of his retreat,
which rais'd a very odd report con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him, there refresh'd his Men,
for ten or twelve days together; and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42159:172"/>
dismiss'd from thence the Dukes of
<hi>Mayenne</hi> and <hi>Aumale</hi> with all their
Troups, into their several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which he imagin'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of his House had some design:
After which, though he had remaining
in his little Army no more than twelve
hundred Horse, and betwixt three
and four thousand Foot, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
according to his custome in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of the Enemy, who march'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
slowly, and ceas'd not from
harassing them, till, (before he came
up with the Army of the King, who
press'd him extremely to a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
he found an occasion of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
what he had so long time pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
to carry their head Quarters,
by making himself master of the place
which furnish'd them with victuals.
For he nothing doubted but the loss of
that wou'd be the total ruine of their
Army; which action he perform'd in
the manner which I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
briefly.</p>
            <p>Being arriv'd at <hi>Estampes</hi> on the
eighteenth of <hi>November,</hi> after having
for some days coasted the Enemy on
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42159:172"/>
the right, the next Morning he sent
the <hi>Sieur de la Chastre</hi> with seven or
eight hundred Horse to <hi>Dourdan;</hi>
from whence, the <hi>Sieur de Vins,</hi> who
commanded the Light Horse, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd
to make discovery of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
This he perform'd with great
exactness, and after some petty skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
wherein he had the advantage,
he understood from some Prisoners
which he had taken, that they were
Quarter'd at large in five or six great
Villages, two or three Leagues beyond
<hi>Chartres,</hi> round <hi>Auneau,</hi> which was
the quarter of the <hi>Reyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auneau</hi> is a great Burrough Town,
or little City, inclos'd onely with
Walls of six or seven foot high, without
Ditches any way considerable, or
Draw-bridges at the Gates, like the
other Burroughs of <hi>La Beauce:</hi> On
the side of this Town is a Marsh, and
a broad Lake, from which there issues
a River whose banks are planted with
Osiers and other Trees that slourish
in a moist soil: 'tis indifferently deep,
and not easie to be pass'd unless by the
Mills and Villages which were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
by the Enemy for more than
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42159:173"/>
two Leagues below the River, which
mixing with the <hi>Lorray</hi> empties it self
into the <hi>Eure,</hi> near <hi>Maintenon;</hi> at
one end of the Lake there is a Causey,
which after having cross'd the Marsh,
is terminated at a little Wood and a
Warren, right overagainst the Gate
of the Castle which commands the
Town. The Castle it self is fair, large,
and of strength sufficient to defend it
self from Storming, having in it a
great Base Court, large eno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh to draw
up the Garrison in Battalia there; and
which is separated from the Houses of
the Town by an open place; so that
no approaches can be made without
being discover'd. As soon as the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>Dona</hi> was lodg'd in the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
into which he enter'd without
resistance, the <hi>Reyters</hi> greedy after
pillage, fail'd not to come on as far as
the Gate of the Base Court belonging
to the Castle; into which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
had hastily remov'd the best of
their Goods, and a great number of
their Cattle, which these <hi>Germans</hi>
were desirous to get into their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But they were repuls'd with vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of Musquet Shot, which laid three
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42159:173"/>
or four of them upon the ground.
On this the Baron dispatch'd a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
to the Captain of the Castle with
a threatning message, that he wou'd
set fire on all things in his way, and
beat the Castle about his ears with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
for which he wou'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
send, in case he desisted not from
Shooting. But the Captain who was
a <hi>Gascon,</hi> and held the Castle for the
King, answer'd with a Bravade, after
the manner of his Countrey-men; and
let the Baron know by his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
that he fear'd neither him nor his
Artillery; and that if his people made
any more so near approaches to the
Castle, he wou'd spare neither for
Powder nor Ball to set them going as
he had done before. This was all the
Parlee that was betwixt them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any manner of ingagement on the
<hi>Gascon</hi>'s part, (though some have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
reported) that he wou'd at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
nothing against those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Guests, who were lodg'd in his
Town against his will. Accordingly
to secure their lives against a man of
the Captain's humour, the <hi>Reyters</hi>
barricado'd themselves, and set strong
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42159:174"/>
Guards at the Avenues, from whence
there is a passage into the two great
Streets which make the length of the
Burrough. After which believing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be now in safety, they took
their ease with profound security, for
seven or eight days together, during
which the season of new Wines being
just come in, and the Vintage of that
year exceeding plentifull, they fell to
ply the Bottle, and to celebrate the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Victory, and the
Prince of <hi>Conty</hi>'s arrival, with all sorts
of merriments, and particularly with
drunkenness, toping after their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
fashion, night and day to the good
health of the two Princes.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
whose head was perpetually working
how he might surprise them, having
receiv'd the Plan of their Quarters
from the <hi>Sieur de Vins,</hi> who had been
there in person to take the View, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to attaque them in <hi>Auneau.</hi> To
this effect he negotiated so dextrously
with the Captain of the Castle, that
after many difficulties, which were
surmounted by the large promises, and
great liberality of that Prince, who
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42159:174"/>
after the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> gave
all away, and reserv'd nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but onely the hope of accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his enterprises, the <hi>Gascon,</hi> who
had no quarrel to a Bag of Money,
came at last to a conclusion with him
upon that point in the World, in
which a wary Governour ought to
be most nice; for he agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Troups into the Castle,
through which they might enter into
the Town.</p>
            <p>He had advanc'd from <hi>Estampes</hi> as
far as <hi>Dourdan</hi> on Friday the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of <hi>November,</hi> when he receiv'd
this comfortable assurance; and as his
little Army was on its march, on the
morrow in order to the execution of
his enterprise, he was inform'd that
the Enemies had discover'd it by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Peasant who was bringing him
a Letter from the Governour. This
undoubtedly was capable of Making
him desist from farther prosecution of
it; and all his Captains so advis'd him.
But he onely deferr'd it for two days,
till he was assur'd that the <hi>Reyters</hi> were
no longer on their Guard, and that
they still continued their Debauches,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42159:175"/>
notwithstanding, that by an Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade
he had cut off an hundred, or
six score of the bravest men in their
whole Army; amongst whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
thirty five Gentlemen of the best
Houses in <hi>Germany,</hi> were found slain a
Count of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and one allyed to
him, who was Nephew to the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Cologne Gebbard Truchses,</hi>
the same person who, misled by a blind
affection, preferr'd the enjoyment of
the fair <hi>Chanoiness Agnes de Mansfield</hi>
to his Electorat and his Religion,
which he renounc'd, to gain the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Marrying her.</p>
            <p>The Duke being then resolv'd to
carry on his Enterprise, though it was
objected to him, that in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
the Enemy wou'd not have lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd
out the time so long at <hi>Auneau,</hi>
and the adjacent places, but out of
design to draw him into the Plain,
over which he must pass of necessity
before he cou'd reach the Town; gave
Order on Monday Night, that all
shou'd be in readiness to March on
Tuesday the four and twentieth of
<hi>November,</hi> which was precisely the
day that the <hi>Germans</hi> had pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42159:175"/>
for their return towards the Source
of the River <hi>Loire.</hi> Yet on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
he reli'd not so much on his good
Fortune, as not to take all manner of
precautions, and particularly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
not that of Piety, for before he
departed out of <hi>Dourdan</hi> on his March,
he did his Devotions publiquely at the
Church; where he implor'd the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Lord of Hosts, for the
happy success of his undertaking.</p>
            <p>And yet farther, he left his Almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with the Clergy, to continue all
Night their Prayers before the Holy
Sacrament, which was expos'd; and
by an extravagant Sally of Piety, did
an action, no ways to be imitated,
yet excuseable in a Prince, who acted
sincerely, and Cavalier-like on this
occasion, in which he was so far from
perceiving the least shadow of ill, that
on the contrary, without searching
deep into the matter, he believ'd it
acceptable to God. For he ordain'd
of his own Authority, that every Priest
that Night shou'd Celebrate three
Masses, as the custome is to doe before
<hi>Christmas</hi>-Day. And those well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
men who understood not so much
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42159:176"/>
in those times as we do in ours, obey'd
him Simply, Devoutly, and without
scruple: And it may charitably be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that God who heard their
Prayers and accepted their Sacrifice,
as the event sufficiently shews, was
not offended at what they did out of
their simplicity and without reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Duke forearm'd in this manner,
came up at seven of the Clock in the
Evening, to the Rendesvouz, which
he had given to his Troups, on the
far side of the Wood of <hi>Dourdan,</hi> in
an open plain, where according to his
Orders, <hi>Monsieur de la Chastre,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
of the Field, had drawn them up
in Battalia. The <hi>Sieur de Vins,</hi> with
three hundred Light Horse, was at
the Head of this little Army. The
<hi>Sieur de la Chastre</hi> follow'd him, with
his Squadron of more than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men at Arms: and the Dukes of
<hi>Guise</hi> and of <hi>Elbeuf</hi> sustain'd them on
the right and the left with their two
Squadrons, consisting each of them,
of about three hundred Horse. The
Infantry divided into four Battalions
under the Colonels, <hi>Ioannes, Pontse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42159:176"/>
Bourg,</hi> and <hi>Gié,</hi> was rang'd on
the right hand of the Cavalry, which
cover'd it from the Enemy, who cou'd
not possibly approach them, but on
the left hand in a large Plain, where
there was neither Tree nor Bush, nor
Hedge for their defence. They March'd
in this order during almost all the
Night, which was so extremely dark,
that wandring about from time to
time, they arriv'd not till four in the
Morning within a Mile of <hi>Auneau,</hi> in
a Valley at one end of the Causey,
which led them to the Postern Gate of
the Castle, just bordering upon the
Warren, till <hi>La Chastre</hi> who advanc'd
before the rest, came back and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that he had heard the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The reason of it was, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was that day preparing to remove
their Quarters, but there was some
reason to apprehend, that they had
had intelligence of the Duke's March.
For this cause, that Prince who was
advanc'd too far to retire, and who
was absolutely bent to Attacque the
<hi>Germans,</hi> whether they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd
or not, and to prevent them,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42159:177"/>
made his Infantry pass the Causey in
File, and himself led them, without
the least notice taken by the Enemy,
to the Postern Gate which was open'd
to him, and which his Men enter'd,
as before in File: chearfully exhorting
the Souldiers and Officers to doe well,
and to make themselves Masters of the
rich Booty which was waiting for
them, meaning the Baggage of the
<hi>Reyters.</hi> After this retiring to his
Cavalry, which attending his return
had made a halt at the end of the
Marsh; he went to dispose his four
Squadrons in the Plain round about
the Burrough, to receive, and cut in
pieces those who shou'd bolt for their
safety into the Fields.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Captain St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
having left in the Castle as many men
as he thought sufficient to secure his
retreat, if he were driven to it, was
descended into the Base Court, where
he gave out his Orders for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
in this following manner.
Himself took on the left hand, at the
Head of five or six hundred Arquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers,
to charge into the great Street,
where the Baron of <hi>Dona</hi> lay: He
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42159:177"/>
plac'd on the right hand five hundred
more of the Regiment of <hi>Pontsenac,</hi>
Commanded by their Colonel, to enter
the Burrough by the other Street.
He order'd four hundred to stand in
Battalia in the Base Court, to sustain
and to relieve the first, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
before him three or four hundred
with the Forelorn Hope to make the
Van: leaving Orders with those who
stay'd behind, that as soon as the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
was begun, they shou'd slip
betwixt the Walls and the Houses, to
seize the Gates, where there were
neither Guard nor Centry; so little
had the Baron profited by that Lesson
which he had taken out at <hi>Vimory,</hi>
where he had been surpris'd by the
like negligence.</p>
            <p>Things being dispos'd in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the great Gate of the Base
Court open'd, by removing of the
Earth about it, the Forelorn Hope put
themselves into the Van, just at the
break of day, in that space which is
betwixt the Castle and the Town,
where they found about fifty Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Enemy, appointed for the
Guard of the Barricades, who running
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42159:178"/>
together at the Noise which was made,
receiv'd them so warmly, and repuls'd
them with so much vigour, that being
affrighted to see themselves without
Cavalry to support them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
as far as the Gate. But Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
St. <hi>Paul</hi> coming up at that point
of time, and the rest following him,
push'd them forward upon the Enemy,
crying out as loud as he cou'd, to those
who were remaining in the Base Court,
that they shou'd Fire without mercy,
on all those who gave back one foot
of Ground. But that which had
more effect on those frighted Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
than this terrible Command, or
than the inevitable danger of present
Death, in case they recoyl'd, was the
example of that Brave Captain and all
his Officers, who detaching themselves
from their several Companies, came
up to the Front against the Enemy.</p>
            <p>For after having repuls'd those Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who were soon dismounted and
kill'd, by the Vollies of shot, which
were pour'd in upon them furiously
by the Souldiers who follow'd their
Officers, those Gallant men gave on
with so much courage against the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricades,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42159:178"/>
that having forc'd, broken
and overturn'd them in a moment, and
slain the Guards who were to maintain
them, the whole body of Infantry
spread themselves like an impetuous
torrent on both sides of the Streets,
and without stopping at the Pillage, as
they had done before at <hi>Vimory,</hi> they
kill'd all within distance of their shot,
pelting down the poor <hi>Germans,</hi> as
they came dropping out of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
half asleep, staggering with
Drunkenness, and half Naked; some with
their Pistols in their hands, and some
onely with their Swords, not able to
get within reach of their Enemies,
who having all manner of advantage
over them, destroy'd them at their
ease, and without sharing any part of
the danger with them.</p>
            <p>Those of them who were already
got on Horseback to depart, being
without possibility of drawing up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Squadron, or marching orderly
against the Enemy, in those Streets
incumber'd with so many Carriages all
harness'd, were slain the more easily,
because they stood like so many Marks
to the Mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>etiers, from whose shot
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42159:179"/>
they had no means of shelter. And
this encumberment, so fatal to them,
serv'd the <hi>Catholiques</hi> instead of a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
from whence they fir'd upon
them without danger, and almost
without losing one single shot.</p>
            <p>In the desperate condition to which
these <hi>Reyters</hi> were reduc'd, they cou'd
find but one remedy to find covert
from this raging Tempest, which
they saw come pouring on their Heads,
which was as speedily as they cou'd,
to gain the Gates, that afterwards they
might either rally in the Fields, or save
themselves in their other Quarters.
But running thither tumultuously in a
crowd, they found them to be already
seiz'd by the Souldiers of <hi>Ioannes,</hi> who
drove them back, by firing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
upon them with their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets:
So that some of them,
unable to doe any thing more,
for their own safety, suffer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be miserably cut in pieces,
others returning from whence they
came, threw themselves into the
thickest of their pursuers, that they
might at least have the sad comfort, of
dying Honourably like Souldiers with
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42159:179"/>
their Weapons in their hands. Some
of them were hidden in their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
from whence the fire made them
bolt half roasted, and fell into the
hands of those, who thought it a deed
of charity to dispatch them out of
their pain, considering the condition
in which they saw them. Some there
were also, who sliding down from
the Walls, thought to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by running cross the Fields and
Marshes, but the Cavalry soon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
them, and cut them all in
pieces.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, of all who were
Quarter'd in that Burrough, I find
there was onely the Baron of <hi>Dona,</hi>
with ten or twelve in his Company
who escap'd; whether by means of
some House adjoining to the Wall,
and thence by some little pathes which
he found in the Marsh, or at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Alarm, through one of
the Gates, which the Souldiers of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes</hi>
had not yet shut up. The rest
were either kill'd or taken, when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the heat of that bloudy Execution
was over, which lasted but for half an
hour, there was no more resistance
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42159:180"/>
made. In this manner was the defeat
of the <hi>Reyters</hi> at <hi>Auneau,</hi> where,
without the loss of one single man to
the Conquerours, there were about
three thousand <hi>Germans</hi> kill'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place, and five hundred Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
made, without reckoning
into the number one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
which running from the
Neighbouring Quarters to the succour
of their Fellows, surrender'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cowardly without defence, as
soon as they were charg'd in the open
Field. Bosides the Cornet of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
there were taken nine or ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Colours, which the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> sent away immediately to the
King. All the Baggage and Carriages
loaded, and ready harness'd for their
March, their Arms, their Plate, the
Gold Chains of their Officers, and the
rest of the Booty remain'd to the
Victours; and the Infantry now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
into Cavalry, mounted on the
Horses which they found Bridl'd and
Saddl'd to their hands, with Pistols
in their Holsters return'd as it were in
triumph to <hi>Estampes,</hi> whither also the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> came immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely upon
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42159:180"/>
his Victory, which was attended with
all those happy consequences he had
foreseen.</p>
            <p>For there fell so great a consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into that shatter'd Army, which
after the defeat had rallied within a
League of <hi>Auneau,</hi> that the poor Baron
of <hi>Dona,</hi> whatsoever reasons he alledg'd
to fortify his opinion, cou'd never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Heads of it to go immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and invest the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> who
dreaming on nothing but the Pillage,
might easily be surpris'd, incompass'd,
and consequently defeated, and all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or kill'd, in that hurry of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
But far from harkning to any
such advice, the <hi>Swissers</hi> throughly
frighten'd by this second misfortune,
much greater than the first, extremely
weaken'd, and their numbers wasted
by the Fatigues of a three Months
March, separated themselves from the
body of the Army, and after having
accepted of the conditions which the
King had granted them, put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on the way of returning into
their own Countrey.</p>
            <p>Those few <hi>Reyters</hi> which were yet
remaining in that Army, and the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squenets</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:42159:181"/>
reduc'd to a pitifull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
follow'd their example within
four or five days afterwards. They
found themselves on the one side,
pursu'd by the Vanguard of the King's
Army, under the conduct of the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and on the other by the
Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> whom the Marquis
<hi>du Pont</hi> had reinforc'd with three or
four thousand <hi>Italian</hi> Horse, which
the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had given order
to levy at the beginning of the War.
They had been inform'd that the <hi>Sieur
de Mandelot,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lyons,</hi> was
come out with five or six thousand
men to cut off their passage; and they
were reduc'd after the defeat of <hi>Aune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au,</hi>
by frequent desertions, by sickness,
and by the toils of their long Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
to a very inconsiderable number,
without Victuals, Ammunition and
Baggage, and almost without Arms,
and hopeless of escaping from the midst
of so many enemies by whom they were
on every side incompass'd. Thus the
last necessity forc'd them in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to accept of the Treaty which by
permission from the King was still
offer'd them by the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:42159:181"/>
to hinder the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> whom he
lov'd not, from the Glory of having
intirely defeated so great a multitude
of Foreigners.</p>
            <p>The Conditions were, that the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squenets</hi>
shou'd deliver up their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
that the <hi>Reyters</hi> shou'd carry
away theirs, but furl'd up and put in
their Portmantues. That the <hi>French</hi>
Protestants shou'd be repossess'd of
their Estates, but that they shou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the Realm, in case they return'd
not into the Church; That both the
one and the other shou'd promise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to bear Arms against the Service
of the King, and that his Majesty
wou'd give them both an ample safe
Conduct and a Convoy, to pass in
safety through his Dominions, and to
his Frontiers, from thence every man
to dispose of himself according to his
own liking.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> in that Army us'd their
utmost endeavours to hinder the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
from accepting such shamefull
conditions, promising to lead them
without hazard to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>'s
Army. But perceiving that
the Strangers, far from listning to their
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42159:182"/>
had design'd to detain them as Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
to secure their pay, which had
been so often promis'd without effect,
they shifted every man for himself as
secretly as he cou'd, and took diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ways to avoid pursuit. The
Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> with fourteen or fifteen
Gentlemen, struck out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Roads into by passages, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
without being discover'd to an
Estate of his in the Countrey of <hi>Mayne.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> took upon the
right hand, and after having cross'd
through <hi>Lionois</hi> and <hi>la Bresse</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
pains, avoiding continually
the High-ways, came at last to <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
where not long after he Died, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worn out with the Toils he had
undergone: in the same manner his
Brother the Count <hi>de la Mark</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Dead, during their March at
<hi>Ancy-le-Franc</hi> in <hi>Senonois.</hi> The rest
of the Captains retir'd also, slenderly
attended and with great hazard and
trouble, into other parts.</p>
            <p>There was onely the brave <hi>Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
who with about an hundred and
twenty Horsemen, resolv'd to run his
Fortune, and abandoning themselves
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42159:182"/>
to his Conduct, pierc'd with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
favour'd by Fortune quite
through the Troups of <hi>Mandelot,</hi> and
all the Countrey of <hi>Lionois, Forest,</hi> and
<hi>Velay,</hi> from whence they came pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon him on all sides, at the sound
of the Larun Bell, which they rung
in all the Towns, Burroughts and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
and arriv'd at last without much
loss into <hi>Vivarez,</hi> where he had strong
Places, and from thence into <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc.</hi>
As for the <hi>Lansquenets</hi> and <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
after their Treaty concluded and
sign'd, they were splendidly treated
at <hi>Marsigny</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
who gave them a Convoy of some
Troups of men at Arms, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Foot, to secure them as far
as beyond the <hi>Saone,</hi> which they were
order'd to pass at <hi>Mascon.</hi> Yet all this
prevented not the loss of a great part
of these miserable <hi>Germans,</hi> who fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Sick, or staying behind the rest
out of weakness, or being at too great
a distance from their Convoy, and
scatteringly Quarter'd, had their throats
Cut, and were knock'd on the Head
without resistance and without mercy,
by the <hi>Peasants</hi> in revenge of so many
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42159:183"/>
horrible insolences which those Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
had committed in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this pitifull condition it was
that the Baron of <hi>Dona,</hi> and Colonel
<hi>Boucq,</hi> who were the onely survivours
amongst the head Officers of this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
Army, being arriv'd on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> implor'd the mercy of
that Duke; who that he might lay an
obligation on the <hi>German</hi> Princes, gave
them passage through his Estates, from
whence retiring through <hi>Swisserland</hi>
they got into <hi>Germany.</hi> The surprise was
incredible to behold so great a desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so miserable a remnant of the
greatest and most flourishing Army,
which at any time had been sent out of
that Countrey to the succour of the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> For, in fine, of
twenty thousand <hi>Swissers,</hi> nine or ten
thousand <hi>Lansquenets,</hi> and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Reyters,</hi> which were levi'd for
their assistance, there return'd onely
four thousand, betwixt Masters and
Servants, of whom the greatest part
contemn'd and whooted at by their
own Countreymen, surviv'd not their
misfortunes any long time after; but
died as much of shame and sorrow, as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42159:183"/>
of the diseases which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by so many hardships which
they had undergone, in so long and so
unfortunate an expedition.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>du Pont,</hi> who after the departure
of these wretches out of <hi>France,</hi> had
follow'd them almost as far as <hi>Geneva,</hi>
understanding by Letters from the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that he had taken them
into his Protection, abandon'd them
to their ill fortune, which persecuted
them worse than even their Enemies
cou'd have wish'd. After which, in
order to refresh their Troups, which
excepting onely the <hi>Italians</hi> last arriv'd,
had extremely suffer'd during four
Months, in which they follow'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
harras'd the Protestant Army,
they put them into Quarters, in the
small territory of the Count of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliard,</hi>
one of the principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of this Expedition, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated
the <hi>Reyters</hi> to take Arms.
There it was that the Souldiers, to
whom too much licence was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
reveng'd themselves without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(by all manner of Excess, Rapine
and Cruelty, Plundring, Burning,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42159:184"/>
Massacring and Spoiling,) of all those
mischiefs which the <hi>Germans,</hi> whose
example they ought not to have
follow'd had caus'd the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> to
suffer.</p>
            <p>This great Victory obtain'd against
so powerfull an Army, without cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almost any thing, was certainly
most Glorious, but withall most fatal
and unfortunate to <hi>France;</hi> through
the extreme malice, and insupportable
insolence of the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who took
advantage from thence, to raise their
Idol to the Skyes; at the same time,
infinitely debasing him who was God's
Lieutenant, and his living Image in
<hi>France,</hi> by the indelible character of
Royalty. The whole City of <hi>Paris</hi>
echo'd from side to side, with loud
acclamations of the Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi>
In private Families, in publique places,
in the Palace, and in the Schools of
the University, in the Churches, and
Pulpits of the Preachers, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of nothing but the defeat of the
<hi>Reyters,</hi> and that too as of a Miracle,
which they wholly and solely attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him; comparing him to <hi>Moses,</hi>
and <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> the destroyer
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42159:184"/>
of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and in short, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Heroe</hi> of the Scriptures. And in
the mean time, far from commending
as they ought in duty, what the King
had perform'd with so much Conduct
and Valour, in hindring the <hi>Germans</hi>
from passing the <hi>Loire,</hi> they went on
with dreadfull malice, to charge him
with horrible calumnies, and that with
so much the more insolence, as he had
testified remisness and pusillanimity,
when it was his duty to have inflicted
severe punishments on those abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Villains, who three or four
months before, had the impudence to
publish and to justifie them with a high
hand in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Prevost</hi> the Curate of St. <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
one of the most Seditious and
most impudent fellows of the Age,
having dar'd to say in one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that the King (whom he accus'd
after the example of the Sixteen, to
have call'd in the <hi>Reyters</hi> on purpose
to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>troy the <hi>Catholiques,</hi>) was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and an enemy of God, and of
his Church; <hi>Bussy, le Clerc,</hi> and <hi>Cruce</hi>
plac'd themselves in Arms, about the
passages of the Parish, to secure the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42159:185"/>
Curate from being apprehended, and
put in Custody. At the same time,
the Curate of St. <hi>Bennet, Iohn Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
the most violent of all the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi>
having caus'd the Alarm-Bell
to be rung in his Church, all the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
who came running in, from about
the University, with Arms in their
hands to their assistance, fell upon the
Commissaries, the Serjeants and the
Archers, whom the Lieutenant <hi>Civill,</hi>
and the Lieutenant of the Grand <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost</hi>
had brought to seize them, and
drove them back, well loaded with ill
Language and with knocks, beyond
the Bridges. And then as if they had
atchiev'd some glorious Victory, in
pitch'd Battel against the King himself,
(who instead of Marching his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Guards, to have laid hold on
the Mutineers at the beginning of the
Tumult, was weak enough to restrain
and conceal his just indignation, so
far as even to flatter and cajoll them,)
the Sixteen in sign of Triumph after
so famous an exploit, ordain'd that
this day which was the third of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
shou'd henceforth be call'd the
happy day of St. <hi>Severin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:42159:185"/>
Now as they were become more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
through the impunity of so great a
crime, and by the defeat of the <hi>Reyters,</hi>
their Preachers animated with the Spirit
of Rebellion, made it their business to
inspire it more furiously than ever into
the people, shamelesly affirming in
their publique Sermons, that the King,
who had invited the <hi>Reyters</hi> into
<hi>France,</hi> being now grown desperate
to see his design ruin'd, by the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
over them, had hinder'd the
great Defender of their Religion from
cutting in pieces the remainder of those
Heretiques, that the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
their known Patron and Protectour,
had snatch'd them out of his hands by
order from his Master, and by a Treaty
which he had made with them, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
them the means of putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a condition of returning once
more into <hi>France.</hi> And the business
went so far, that the Spirit of Revolt,
(which those Guides of Consciences,
those Confessours and Preachers ought
to combat with all their force, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly opposite to the Gospel,
which teaches nothing but Obedience
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42159:186"/>
and Submission to lawfull Powers,)
was not onely inspir'd into the people
in private discourses, in confessions
and in Sermons, but also in some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
authoris'd by the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe not that I can be taxed
with any want of respect to that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Body, because when occasion has
been given me, which has happen'd
more than once, in divers of my Works,
I have not been wanting in those due
commendations, which the truth it
self, to which I am entirely devoted,
has drawn from my Pen: But by the
same obligation which indispensibly
binds me to the truth, I must say that
in so numerous a Company, of young
and old Doctours mix'd together, 'tis
impossible but that there shou'd be
form'd in troublesome conjunctures,
by the unhappiness of times, some
Factions deriv'd from certain mutinous
and extravagant persons who deviate
from the principles and practices of
the more prudent. And as we have
beheld in our own days a party, which,
in relation to a Book that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,
was overcome by the greater
number of Orthodox Doctours, who
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42159:186"/>
now prevalent; so, during the <hi>League,</hi>
which had poison'd the minds of most
in <hi>Paris,</hi> there was one which carri'd
it by their Caball over the more sound
and better Divines; who sigh'd at the
deplorable blindness of their Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as shall be seen in the sequel of
this History.</p>
            <p>On the Subject of those Calumnies,
which the Preachers of the <hi>League</hi>
and the Sixteen daily publish'd, as so
many indisputable truths, that faction
of corrupt Doctours being then assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
on the sixteenth of <hi>December,</hi>
made a decree, in which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
lawfull for Subjects to take away
the Government from a Prince, who
acted not for the good of Religion and
of the State; in the same manner as
the administration of goods shou'd be
taken from the Guardian of a Ward,
who might reasonably be suspected to
abuse his trust. This was doubtless
no other than to decide, on a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Subject, a case of Conscience
from the false and pernicious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Morals, the most corrupt that
ever were. Accordingly the King,
who after having expell'd the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42159:187"/>
out of <hi>France,</hi> made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into <hi>Paris</hi> in Arms, was exrteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surpris'd, at the furious insolence,
and unbounded licence which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to decry his conduct in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and to stir up the people to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ead of resenting it
like a Severaign Prince, by punishing
that attempt, and making a terrible
example of its Authours, (who well
deserv'd it for that detestable Doctrine,
which tends to the subversion of all
Monarchy,) he satisfi'd himself with
acting like a Censor, or to speak more
properly like a Ghostly Father, and a
Guide of Consciences.</p>
            <p>For all the punishment which he
inflicted, for such an ungodly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
an action, was to make to
those factious people, and principally
to Doctour <hi>Boucher,</hi> the most seditious
man amongst them, in presence of the
Deputies of Parliament, whom he
sent for to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> a very pious
and charitable remonstrance, in which
he taught them to comprehend the
great enormity of their crime, which
merited eternal Damnation, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vilified their King, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42159:187"/>
horrible impostures in the chair
of truth, which they had chang'd into
a pestilential Pulpit full of lies and
calumnies; after which, when they
were come down, they made no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of scruple to goe immediately to
the Altar, and to offer there to God
the Sacrifice of the Holy Eucharist,
before they had reconcil'd themselves
to him, whom they had so unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affronted. He added, that though
he might justly treat them, as Pope
<hi>Sixtus</hi> had lately some Religious of
his Order, whom he had sent to the
Gallies, for presuming to speak irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently
of him in their Sermons, yet
notwithstanding, he wou'd not at this
time proceed in that manner against
them; but in case they shou'd once
more commit a crime of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he was resolv'd that his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shou'd doe justice so exemplary
and severe upon them, that it might
strike a terrour into all wicked
and seditious persons who resembled
them.</p>
            <p>This was all the Vengeance, which
this too good and gracious King took
upon those people, who abusing his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42159:188"/>
Clemency which they now despis'd,
grew day by day more insolent against
him. Which makes it demonstrable
how extremely much it concerns a
Prince, so to temper the vertues
which he ought to have, that one of
them may not destroy the other by
its excess, and consequently be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to himself. That his Justice
and his Mercy may agree without the
interfering of one in the others Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
that by endeavouring to be too
rigorously just he become not odious,
and by being too yielding he grow not
contemptible to his Subjects. In the
mean while it was impossible that
these excessive praises which were
given to the Servant, when at the
same time they revil'd the Master with
so much malice and indignity, shou'd
not create great jealousies and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets
in him; and that a just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shou'd not cause him to take up
a resolution of revenging so many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
as were given to the Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and of putting the <hi>Leaguers</hi> and
principally the Sixteen and their Head,
out of a condition of disputing any
longer with their Severeign for the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42159:188"/>
Mastery. On the other side, the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was puff'd up more than
ever with such a series of Success, and
with those illustrious testimonies which
Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Prince of
<hi>Parma,</hi> had so solemnly render'd to
his merit; the one by sending him
the consecrated Sword, and the other
his Arms, as to him, who amongst all
Princes best deserv'd the glorious Title
of a great Captain. And as he was
too clear sighted not to discern the
visible signs, which the King in spight
of his dissimulation cou'd not hinder
often from breaking out, and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the disdain and hatred which he
had conceiv'd against him; He resolv'd
to fortify his party in such manner,
that he shou'd not onely have nothing
to apprehend, but also that he might
hope for all things from his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
And he did it with so much the
more ardour and resolution, as he
was then more than ever exasperated,
and almost driven to despair, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
which he had from the King,
which was given him in a most diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
manner, by preferring his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
in Ambition before him; which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42159:189"/>
he esteem'd the most sensible affront
that he cou'd receive: and which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
put things out of a possibility
of accommodation. Thus it happen'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> after the signal
Service which he had perform'd to
the Kingdom, was of opinion, that if
he demanded some part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
which had been possess'd
by the late Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> Admiral
of <hi>France</hi> and Governour of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
they cou'd not possibly be refus'd him.
And in order to obtain his request more
easily, he was content onely to ask the
Admiralty, and that not for himself,
nor any of the Princes of his Family,
but for the Count of <hi>Brissac;</hi> whom
the Nobility of his Birth, and his great
desert, together with the services
which <hi>France</hi> had receiv'd from the
brave <hi>Timoleon de Cossé</hi> his Brother,
Colonel of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, and
from his Father the great Marshal of
<hi>Brissac,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> might
raise without envy, and with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
applause to that high command.
After the Duke had been held in hand,
and fed with fair promises and false
hopes, he not onely fail'd of obtaining
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42159:189"/>
the place which he requested, but as
if it had purposely been done to spight
him, it was conferr'd, together with
the Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi> on the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> his declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whose Character I shall next give
you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Louis de Nogaret,</hi> the youngest
Brother of his House, who was call'd
when he came first to Court, the
young <hi>La Valette,</hi> understood so well
to gain the favour of the King, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
after <hi>Quelus</hi> one of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Minions who kill'd each other
in Duel, had recommended him to
his Majesty at his death, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
he grew up into the first rank
of Favourites, with the Duke of <hi>Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euse,</hi>
over whom at length he carried
it, having had the cunning to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
into him the desire of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an Army, and by that artifice
to remove him from his Master's
sight. There was no sort of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Wealth or Dignities which the
King did not heap on this new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
in favour of whom he erected
<hi>Espernon</hi> into a Dutchy, to make him
Duke and Peer as well as <hi>Anne de
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42159:190"/>
Ioyeuse,</hi> because he had taken upon
him to make them equal in all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;
having so great a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for both of them, (I might say
weakness unworthy of a King,) that
he answer'd those who represented to
him his great profusions, and that he
impoverish'd himself to inrich them,
that when he had married and settled
his two Children, for so he call'd them
in his ordinary discourse, he was then
resolv'd to turn good husband. Yet
there was this difference betwixt them,
that <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> by his courtesie, his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
his magnificence, and by the
winning way of his behaviour, had
attracted mens affections; but on the
contrary, <hi>Espernon</hi> by reason of his
rough, imperious and haughty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was hated not onely by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who made a
thousand invective Satyrs on him,
but also by the great men of the
Court, whom he treated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and insolence, as if the favour
of his Master which he abus'd, had
given him the privilege to affront even
those whose vertue and desert was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
and respected by the King.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42159:190"/>
For in this manner it was, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others he us'd <hi>Francis d' Espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur
de Villeroy</hi> one of the most prudent
and faithfull Ministers which our
Kings have ever had; a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
not disadvantageous to the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> who laid hold on that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to gain the Archbishop entirely to
his interests.</p>
            <p>Above all the rest there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Antipathy betwixt the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> and this proud Favourite; who
whether it were to please his Master,
or to put an obligation upon the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with whom he then held
a private correspondence, or were it
out of the contrariety of their humours,
profess'd himself on all occasions his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
enemy, omitting no opportunity
of rendring him suspected and odious
to the King, and of working him up still
more and more to a greater height of
hatred and indignation against him. And
in requital of those ill offices, the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi> was not wanting on his side
to animate the People of <hi>Paris</hi> against
<hi>Espernon;</hi> who one day, ran the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
(in passing over the <hi>Pont Nostre
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42159:191"/>
Dame,</hi> of being murther'd by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
who running out of their Shops
in multitudes, went about to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
him, if he had not escap'd by
speedy flight. 'Tis true, that the
<hi>Nuncio Morosini</hi> foreseeing the fatal
consequences of this their enmity, did
all he was able by his prudent admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
to extinguish it; but though
he smother'd it for a little time, he
cou'd not hinder it from blazing out
immediately afterwards. Insomuch
that it grew to a greater height than
ever, when the King who either wou'd
not, or durst not refuse any thing to
this Favourite, united in his onely
person, what before had been shar'd
betwixt him and <hi>Ioyeuse;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on him both the Government of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Admiralty, which
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had requested for
<hi>Brissac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ceremony was perform'd with
great magnificence; and the Attorney
General in a long Harangue which he
made at the Admission of the Duke of
<hi>Espernon,</hi> said pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>quely, that the
King who had made so worthy a choice
was a great Saint, and deserv'd to be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42159:191"/>
Canoniz'd at least as well as Saint
<hi>Lewis;</hi> that the New made Admiral,
wou'd expiate for all the crimes of the
late Admiral <hi>de Coligny,</hi> and make the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi>
Religion once more to flourish
in the Kingdom. An insipid Panegyrique,
which is indeed no better than a base
and fulsome flattery, if the Author
does not intend to fpeak by contraries
shou'd no more be suffer'd by great men,
who are lovers of true glory, than an
affront or a Libel; neither ought they
to allow any commendations to be
given them, but such as are solid and
establish'd on such known truths, that
their very enemies shall not be able to
deny them.</p>
            <p>That Speech which the King's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
made on this occasion, did his
Master and the Admiral more mischief
than all the furious Libels of the <hi>League.</hi>
It drew upon them the contempt and
railery of the people; which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make a man more uneasie than a
Satyr, which is but the impotent
anger of a Scribler. And it occasion'd
that famous Epigramm, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
that <hi>Henry</hi> cannot be deni'd to
be a great Saint, and a worker of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42159:192"/>

of <hi>La Valette,</hi> by a kind of
clenching Witticism, much in fashion
in those times, but which is now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded.
And an offer was likewise
made at vilifying his birth, not unlike
what <hi>Busbequius,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi>
his Ambassadour to that King,
has written in one of his Letters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with some little malignity, and
following the foolish reports of the
rabble, who commonly love to speak
disgracefully of Favourites; what we
may receive for undoubted truth, is
this, that this prodigious raising of
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> a declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that he, being furiously incens'd
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42159:192"/>
at the refusal which he had, and at the
greatning of a man who sought his
ruine, believ'd himself now authoriz'd
to give the reins to his resentment,
and push his fortune as far as it wou'd
go. And from thence ensued all those
dismal and tragical events, the very
remembrance of which strikes an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

who never suffers a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
to escape him, and describes it
perhaps with as much superstition as
exactness; I shou'd here make long
narrations how the Sun was obscur'd
on the sudden, without the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of any Cloud appearing in the

out from the Centre of the Body; pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42159:194"/>
darkness like that of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

Earthquakes, fiery Phantasms in

which are said to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
and seen in this unhappy year
of one thousand five hundred eighty
eight, and which were fansi'd to be so
many ominous presages of those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
disorders that ensued in it.</p>
            <p>But because I am not of the opinion
that much credit ought to be given to
those sorts of Signs, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the effects of natural causes,
though very often unknown to us; nor
to the predictions of Astrologers, some
of which verily believ'd they had
found in the Stars, that this year shou'd
be the conclusion of the World: I will
onely say that the most sure presage
of so many misfortunes then impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
was the minds of men too much
exasperated on both sides, to live in
peace with each other; and not rather
to be searching out for means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
sure of those whom they suspected,
and disposing of them according to
their jealousies.</p>
            <p>In order to this the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42159:194"/>
after he had made an end of ruining
the County of <hi>Montbelliard,</hi> took his
way to <hi>Nancy,</hi> whither he had invited
all the Princes of his house, to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Month of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> there to
take their resolutions, in reference to
the present condition of affairs; and of
that happy success which they had in
the War against the <hi>Reyters.</hi> Some
of them there were, as it is reported,
so swoln with that Victory, and so
blinded with their prosperity, that
they propos'd in this Conference, the
most dangerous and most violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients;
to which the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
a moderate and wary Prince wou'd
by no means listen. Howsoever it
were, (for I find nothing to confirm
these relations, not even in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires
of their greatest Enemies, who
have written most exactly of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,)
'tis most undoubted, that if
they proceeded not so far as to those
terrible extremities, yet what was
then concluded, pass'd in the World
for a most unjust and unlawfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
and was condemn'd by all
those who were not blindly devoted
to the <hi>League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:42159:195"/>
It was, that a Request shou'd be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the King, containing Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which under the ordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their desire to preserve in
<hi>France</hi> the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
manifestly to despoil him of his
Authority and Power, and to invest
the Heads of the <hi>League</hi> in both. For
those scandalous Articles bore this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in them, that for the service of
God, and the maintenance and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Religion, the King shou'd not
onely be most humbly Petition'd, but
also summon'd to establish the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Inquisition in his Realm; to cause
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be there Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
suspending nevertheless that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which revokes the exemption
pretended by some Chapters and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
against the Bishops: to continue
the War against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and
to cause the goods both of them and
of their Associates to be sold, with
which to defray the charges of that
War; and to pay the Debts in which
the Heads of the <hi>League</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to involve themselves for the
prosecution of it: To refuse quarter to
all Prisoners who shou'd be taken in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42159:195"/>
that War, unless upon condition of
paying the full value of their goods,
and giving caution, of living afterwards
like good <hi>Catholiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold here a most specious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Zeal for Religion; but in the
next place observe the Venom which
lies hidden under all these fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
That the King shall unite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more cordially and more openly
than before to this Holy <hi>League:</hi>
thereby to keep exactly all its Laws,
to which men are oblig'd by this the
most solemn and most inviolable of
all Oaths. That besides the Forces
which he shall be oblig'd to set on
foot to wage that War against the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi>
he shall maintain an Army on
the Frontiers of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to oppose the
<hi>German</hi> Protestants, if they shou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
once again to enter <hi>France.</hi>
That besides those places which the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> already held for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
there shou'd be deliver'd to
them other Towns of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which shou'd be specifi'd to him,
where they might establish for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
those of their Heads which they
shall name, with power of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42159:196"/>
such Garisons and making such
Fortifications, as they shall think fit,
at the charges of the Provinces in
which they are situate. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
to secure them that they shall
be no more hindred, as till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they have always been, in the
executing of those things which have
been promis'd them for the safety of
Religion, his Majesty shall displace
from his Council, and from the Court,
and shall deprive of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Offices, those who shall be
nam'd to him, as Patrons of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
and Enemies to Religion and
the State.</p>
            <p>These were those extravagant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
which began to open the eyes
of many good <hi>Catholiques,</hi> who had
suffer'd themselves to be innocently
seduc'd by the appearances of true
zeal, which being little illuminated,
was not according to knowledge, as
the Apostle speaks. For they now
more clearly saw into some of those
Articles; that the <hi>League</hi> to engage
the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in their
Interests, wou'd be content to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
those Privileges and Liberties,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42159:196"/>
which our Ancestours have always
maintain'd with so much vigour and
resolution: and to subject to the yoke
of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, the <hi>French,</hi>
who have never been able to undergo
it. And in others of them, that they
design'd to bereave the King of all the
solid and essential parts of Royalty, to
leave him onely the shadow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it, and afterwards to
dispose even of his Person, as the
Heads of their party shou'd think
fit.</p>
            <p>And accordingly when the Request
was presented to the King on the part
of the Associated Princes, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> whose simplicity and
whose name they abus'd, and made it
a cloke to their Ambition, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
an extreme indignation against
it, which immediately appear'd in his
eyes and countenance. Yet he thought
it necessary at that time to dissemble,
not finding himself then in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of returning such an answer to
it, as was becoming a King justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
against his Subjects, who stood
on terms with him like Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
For which reason, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42159:197"/>
to gain farther time, he contented
himself, to say, that he wou'd exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
those Articles in his Council,
in order to his Answer: which shou'd
be in such sort, that all good <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
shou'd have reason to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> who took not fair words for
payment, well understanding the King's
design, and resolving not to give the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> the leisure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
down that Tempest which was
rais'd against him, and to infuse into
his Master those vigorous resolutions
which were necessary for him to take,
press'd the King continually to give a
precise Answer to every particular in
those Articles: For he doubted not
that in case it prov'd favourable, he
shou'd ingross all power in himself, and
if it were otherwise, that it wou'd be
thought the King resolv'd to maintain
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and that by consequence
the <hi>Catholiques</hi> wou'd enter into a War
against him.</p>
            <p>On which considerations, being
then retir'd into his Government of
<hi>Champaigne,</hi> to which place he went
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42159:197"/>
after the Conference at <hi>Nancy,</hi> he
pli'd the King incessantly with Messages
sent by Gentlemen one after another,
to urge him to a speedy and punctual
Answer: And this he did with the
more eagerness and importunity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
on the one side he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
more powerfull than ever, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a great part of the Gentry, and
almost all the People, and especially
the <hi>Parisians</hi> for him. And on the
other side he observ'd the party of the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> to be very low and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weaken'd, by the defeat of their
great <hi>German</hi> Succours, and by their
late loss of the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all others the most strictly tied
to their Religion, and on whom they
more relied than any man, not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>He deceas'd on the fifth of <hi>March</hi>
at St. <hi>Iean de Angely,</hi> of an exceeding
violent distemper, with which he was
suddenly seiz'd one evening after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and which carri'd him off in two
days time. The Sixteen with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
baseness, made a great rejoycing
for it, and their Preachers fail'd not to
roar out in their Sermons, that it was
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42159:198"/>
the effect of the Excommunication,
with which he had been Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struck
by Pope <hi>Sixtus.</hi> But besides
that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> who had
been struck in the same manner by the
Bull, had his health never the worse
for it, the King, to whom that poor
creature the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> had
been telling the same story, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
wonderfull exclamations in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it, answer'd him with a smile,
That it might very well be the
occasion of his death, but withall
there was something else which help'd
him on his journey. And truly the
matter was put beyond all doubt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the attestation of four Physicians,
and of two Master Chirurgeons, who
depos'd upon their Oaths, that they
had manifestly seen in almost all the
parts of his Body, all the most evident
signs and effects of a Caustique Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
burning and ulcerating. A most
execrable action, which cou'd not be
too rigorously punish'd; and yet the
Laws inflicted what was possible on
the person of one of his domestick
servants, who was drawn in pieces by
four Horses in the place of St. <hi>Iean de
Angely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:42159:198"/>
As to the rest, he was a Prince,
who excepting onely his obstinate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to a Religion, in which he was
born, and who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e falshood he might
have known in time, if he had not
been too much prepossess'd, had at
the Age of five and thirty years, at
which he died, all the perfections
which can meet together in one man,
to render him one of the greatest and
most accomplish'd persons in the World:
if at least there might not possibly be
discern'd in his carriage and customes
some of those little failings, from
which the most wise are not exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and which may easily be pardon'd,
without lessening the esteem which we
have for them. And if Fortune which
is not always propitious to merit, was
not favourable to him on some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
wherein he had need of her
assistance, yet in this she was his friend,
that she gave him the greater oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of shewing his invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in his adversities, in which he
rais'd himself infinitely above her,
by the vigour and greatness of his
Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:42159:199"/>
Accordingly the death of this great
Prince was lamented, not onely by
those of his own party who lov'd him
passionately, but also by the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi>
and even by the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
himself; who, Head as he was of an
infamous and wicked Faction, which
he made sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervient to his ends, had
of his own stock, and the excellency
of his nature, which was infinitely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
all the generosity which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to love and respect vertue, even in
the person of his greatest and most
formidable Enemy.</p>
            <p>All which notwithstanding, he was
content to make what advantage he
cou'd of so lamentable an accident,
towards the compassing of his designs:
And as he observ'd, not onely by this
but by a multitude of concomitant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and misfortunes, that the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenot</hi>
party decreas'd in strength and
reputation, and his own grew more
bold and undertaking, he set himself
more vigorously to push his fortune,
and to demand an entire satisfaction
to all the Articles of his request; which
had so puff'd up the spirits of the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orgot all manner of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42159:199"/>
moderation, and grew daily more and
more insupportable. It happen'd also
at the same time, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
several advertisements of the
resolution which had been taken in
their Council to seize his Person, and
to inclose him in a Monastery. And
the same Lieutenant of the Provost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Isle of <hi>Paris, Nicholas Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>
who had formerly discover'd the
like Conspiracy, to which belief was
not given, told him so many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
circumstances in relation to this,
that though he was very diffident of
that double dealing man, whose inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
he much suspected, yet his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
concurring with the extreme
insolence of the Sixteen, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his report more credible, cou'd
not but leave a strong impression on
his Soul. Insomuch that at last follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the counsel of those who had so
long advis'd him, to employ his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and justice against those Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,
he took up a resolution once for
all to take that thorn out of his side,
to reduce <hi>Paris</hi> into that state of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and obedience which belongs
to Subjects; and to extinguish the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42159:200"/>
of Sixteen, by the exemplary
chastisement of the most seditious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them.</p>
            <p>The preparations which of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he was to make to secure the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this undertaking, the three
thousand <hi>Swissers</hi> whom he caus'd to
be quarter'd at <hi>Lagny,</hi> the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Guards which were reinforc'd,
the Troups which were sent him from
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who was gone
into his Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and
all the passages of the River both above
<hi>Paris</hi> and below it being possess'd by
him, were so many Alarms to those
Mutineers who believing themselves
already lost, implor'd the assistance of
the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> That Prince who
had advanc'd from <hi>Rheims</hi> as far as
<hi>Soissons,</hi> in favour of the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi>
his Cousin, who met with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and resistance in his Government
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> satisfi'd himself at first with
sending them some of his most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd
Captains, to regulate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
their <hi>Militia</hi> in case of need.
But some few days after, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
still press'd more eagerly by the
solicitations of those people, who were
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42159:200"/>
now driven to despair, and believing
that this foundation of the <hi>League</hi> on
which he had built his hopes being
once shaken he himself must perish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its ruines, for that being destroy'd
the next design was certainly to fall
on him, who was the Head and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour
of it; he gave immediate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to his Friends and Creatures, to
get into <hi>Paris,</hi> one after another, at
several Gates, and order'd some to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Sixteen in his name, that he
wou'd suddenly be there in person to
live and die with them.</p>
            <p>The King, who was advertis'd of
this resolution, and who was under
great apprehensions of his coming,
lest his presence might hinder the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of his Enterprise, and arm with
a word speaking that great City which
was entirely at his devotion, sent the
President <hi>de Bellievre,</hi> a man of great
Authority and known Prudence, to
tell the Duke from him, that in the
present juncture of affairs, and just ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
which he had, that his
coming wou'd produce great troubles
in <hi>Paris,</hi> he thought good he shou'd
not come till he receiv'd new orders
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42159:201"/>
from him, for otherwise he wou'd ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself guilty of all those disorders
which might thence ensue.</p>
            <p>To this the Duke, who was never
to be beaten off from any resolution
which he had once taken, answer'd
calmly, but in doubtfull terms, that
he was ready to obey the King, that
he had never intended to go to <hi>Paris,</hi>
but in the condition of a Private man,
and without a Train: that he desir'd
to justifie himself from those aspersions
with which he knew his Enemies had
basely charg'd him in his absence, that
he had reason to believe there was a
design on foot to oppress the good
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> whose Protectour he had
declar'd himself; and that he humbly
besought his Majesty to give him some
security against so just an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>Bellievre,</hi> who well knew that
the King wou'd stick at no manner of
verbal satisfaction, in case that wou'd
prove sufficient to break his Journey,
promis'd he shou'd have all the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he cou'd possibly desire. In effect
the King was fully resolv'd to have
given him all manner of assurances:
But as ill luck wou'd have it, this was
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42159:201"/>
not done at the same time it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.
Insomuch that without more
delay, he got on Horseback, and
crossing the Countrey out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Roads, that he might avoid the
Messengers which he knew wou'd
be sent with new orders to him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<hi>Paris</hi> on Monday the Ninth of
<hi>May,</hi> with eight more in his company,
just about Noon by the Gate of St.
<hi>Denis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be said in one sort of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that this day was the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
and yet the most glorious
of all his life. For whether it were
that the people, who were made to
believe by the Sixteen, that the City
was to be Sack'd, were advertis'd by
them of his arrival, or that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
was spread at an instant, when he
was first seen to approach the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
'tis most certain that he had
no sooner pass'd it, but the whole
Town running together from all parts
of it, crowded up the Street, and all
the rest through which he pass'd;
the Windows were fill'd, and even the
Tiles of Houses; the Air echo'd
with a thousand sorts of acclamations,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42159:202"/>
and the loud cries of <hi>Vive Guise</hi> were
repeated with far higher peals than
had been formerly of <hi>Vive le Roy;</hi> for
those loyal shouts were grown out of
date, and, the <hi>League</hi> in a manner
had abolish'd them.</p>
            <p>There was a kind of madness in this
Transport, or rather in this furious
torrent of their joy; which was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
that it pass'd even to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
They hal'd and tore each other
to get nearest to this Prince: Those
who were born off by the throng to a
farther distance, stretch'd out their
Arms to him, with their hands clasp'd
over their heads; they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
happy, who cou'd croud so near
as to touch any part of his Cloak or
Boots. Some there were amongst
them who kneel'd to him, when he
was passing by, and others who when
they cou'd not reach him with their
hands, endeavour'd to touch him with
their Chapelets, which they kiss'd
when they had receiv'd that honour,
as the custome is in adoration at
the Shrines of Saints. A thousand
praises were given him, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
blessings. He was call'd aloud
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42159:202"/>
the Pillar of the Church, the Prop of
Faith, the Protectour of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi>
the Saviour of <hi>Paris;</hi> and from
all the Windows there fell upon him a
shower of Flowers and of Greens,
with redoubl'd acclamations of <hi>Vive
Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, no imaginable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
and testimonies of love,
honour and veneration, but were
shown to the height at this tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
entry, by that sudden overflow
of joy; and that wonderfull dilatation
of hearts and affections, which was
to him a sort of triumph, more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
than any of the <hi>Caesar</hi>'s. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he enjoy'd the full gust of it,
with all the satisfaction of extreme
pleasure; passing on Horseback very
leisurely through that infinite press
of people, bare headed, beholding
them with a smiling countenance, and
with that courteous and ingaging air,
which was so natural to him, saluting
on the right and on the left, bowing to
those below in the Streets, and to those
above in the Windows, not neglecting
the very meanest, holding out his
hand to the nearest, and casting his
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42159:203"/>
obliging glances on the more remote,
he pass'd in this manner to the Queen-Mother's
Palace, near St. <hi>Eustache,</hi>
where he alighted, and from thence
to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> following her on foot,
who had taken her Chair to conduct
him to the King, and was witness to
those incredible transports of publique
joy, and acclamations of that innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
herd of people, which beat her
ears incessantly with the name of <hi>Guise,</hi>
bellow'd from more than an hundred
thousand mouths.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King, who
had heard with infinite rage of this
sudden arrival of the Duke, was shut
up in his Closet, where he was in
consultation on that Prince's life or
death; who had been so blindly rash,
as to precipitate himself, in his single
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erson, into inevitable danger, from
whence onely his good fortune, (of
which he was not Master,) cou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him. Some there were, and
amongst others the Abbot <hi>d' Elbene,</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Alphonso d' Ornano,</hi> with
the most resolute of those <hi>Gascons,</hi> whom
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the five and forty, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:42159:203"/>
near the King's person, who coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell'd
that irresolute and wavering
Prince to dispatch him on the spot,
having so fair a pretence, and the
means so ready in his hand, to punish
a rebellious Subject; who in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his express orders, had audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
presum'd to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> as it
were on purpose to let him know, that
he was absolute Master of it. The rest
more moderate, and amongst them
the Chancellour <hi>de Chiverny,</hi> and the
<hi>Sieurs de Bellievre, de la Guiche,</hi> and
<hi>de Villequier</hi> Governour of <hi>Paris,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him from that attempt, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before him, besides the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
consequences which this terrible
action might produce in such a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that it always concern'd him,
both for his reputation, and for the
maintenance of the most inviolable
Laws of natural equity, before he
pass'd to extremities, to hear a man
who came to put himself so freely
into the hands of his King, and to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
for all that was all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dg'd against
him.</p>
            <p>While these things were in debating,
and the king in suspence betwixt his
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:42159:204"/>
anger and his fear uncertain which
way to resolve, the Duke, (who had
pass'd through the <hi>French</hi> Guards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Grillon</hi> who lov'd him not,
and through the <hi>Swissers,</hi> which stood
ranck'd on both sides of the great
Stair-case; and afterwards had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
the Hall and the Antichamber
fill'd with people who made no very
ceremonious returns to his salutations
and civilities) enter'd into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
Chamber, disguising a sudden
fright which seiz'd him, intrepid as
he was, with the best face he cou'd
set upon the matter, which yet he
cou'd not act so well, but that it was
easie to discern through that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of bravery, that he cou'd
have been well contented to have
been in some other place, and not to
have ingag'd himself so far, especially
when a certain Princess whisper'd him
in the ear to have a care of himself,
and that his life and death were under
consideration in the Closet. Yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after, as his courage was
usually rais'd at the sight of the greatest
dangers, he resum'd his wonted bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and was not able to hinder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42159:204"/>
perhaps by a sudden motion pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural, and arising from the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
of his heart, from laying his
hand on the pommel of his Sword,
without his own perceiving it, and
from stepping hastily two or three
paces forward, with a haughty walk,
as if he were putting himself into a
posture of selling his life as dear as he
was able to his Enemies. But the
King at that instant coming out of the
Closet with <hi>Bellievre,</hi> he chang'd po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
suddenly, made a low reverence,
and threw himself almost at his feet,
protesting to him, that not believing
his presence ought to be displeasing to
him, he was come to bring him his
head, and fully to justifie his carriage
against the calumnies of his Enemies;
and withall to assure his Majesty, that
he had not a more faithfull Servant
than himself. But the King deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in a grave and serious tone of
voice, Who had bid him come, and
if he had not receiv'd an express pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
from him? the business was
then brought to a scanning, and some
little contest there was betwixt him
and <hi>Bellievre,</hi> the last maintaining
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42159:205"/>
that he had deliver'd him the King's
commands, and the former instead of
answer, asking him if he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
himself to return with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
speed to <hi>Soissons,</hi> which he had
not done, and protesting that he had
never receiv'd those Letters, which
<hi>Bellievre</hi> justifi'd he had written to him.</p>
            <p>Then the Queen, who though she
seem'd to be in much affliction for the
Duke's arrival, yet held a private cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with him, broke off the
discourse, and taking aside the King her
Son, she manag'd his mind so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously,
that whether she made him
apprehend a general revolt of <hi>Paris,</hi>
which she had seen so openly to own
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> or whether he
himself were mollifi'd by the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
humble way of speaking which
that Prince had us'd, he contented
himself for that time to tell him, that
his innocence which he was so desirous
to prove, wou'd be more manifest if
his presence shou'd cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e no stirs in
<hi>Paris;</hi> and thereupon he sate down
to Table, remitting till the Afternoon
what he had farther to say to him, and
appointing the Queen's Garden for
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42159:205"/>
the place. Then the Duke bowing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
low retir'd, without being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by any of the King's Servants, but
as well attended by all the Town,
to the <hi>Hostel de Guise,</hi> as he had been
from the Gate of St. <hi>Denis</hi> to the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had made reflexion on the
danger, into which he had so rashly
thrown himself, and which now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
more formidable, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with cooler thoughts, than he
cou'd possibly in that agitation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and that anxiety wherein he was
in spight of all his courage, when he
found himself so far engag'd; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
he wou'd never hazard his life in
that sort again, and took such order
concerning it, that from the next day,
and so onward, he had in his Palace
four hundred Gentlemen who assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
there from all parts of <hi>Paris,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his orders, never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
abandon'd him. Neither wou'd
he adventure to go that afternoon to
the Queen's Garden, but well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by the bravest of his Officers,
amongst whom Captain St. <hi>Paul,</hi> se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that after his Master was enter'd,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42159:206"/>
he who kept the door was going to
shut it on him, thrust him back
roughly, and enter'd by force, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by his Companions, protesting
and swearing that if the game was there
to be play'd he was resolv'd to have his
stake in it.</p>
            <p>So that if the King had design'd to
have him murther'd in that Garden,
which I believe not, though some
have written it, 'tis easie to see that
the presence of those brave men, who
were fully resolv'd to defend their
Master, that of the Queen who made
the third in this enterview, the daring
countenance of the Duke, who from time
to time was casting his eyes towards
his Sword, and to sum up all, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
multitude of <hi>Parisians</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass'd
the Queen's Palace, and many
of which were got upon the walls, had
hinder'd the execution of such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>For that which pass'd betwixt them
at this Conference, since I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it in the most exact Memoirs
of those times, I shall not offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it, as <hi>Davila</hi> has done by a certain
Poetical licence which he and some
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42159:206"/>
other Historians have us'd, to make
men think and speak without their
leave, whatever they please to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their thoughts and mouths. What
I can deliver for undoubted truth is
this, that there was nothing conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at this Enterview; and that the
King who had resolv'd before hand,
to chastise the most Seditious of the
Sixteen, and to make himself Master
of <hi>Paris,</hi> after a long consultation ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by Night, with those in whom
he most confided, continu'd firm to
the same resolution, and set up his
rest to stand by it, in spight of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of the Duke.</p>
            <p>With this determination, he sent
the next morning for the Prevost of
the Merchants, and the Sheriffs, and
Commanded them in company of the
Lords, <hi>de Villequier</hi> and <hi>Francis d' O.</hi>
to make an exact search for all those
Strangers who were come to <hi>Paris</hi>
some few days since, without any ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occasion to call them thither, and
to cause them forthwith to depart the
Town, without respect of persons.
This was a manifest endeavour to
weaken the Duke of <hi>Guise;</hi> to reduce
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:42159:207"/>
him to those seven or eight Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who attended him into <hi>Paris,</hi>
and consequently to give him occasion
of believing that after they had rid
themselves of the others, they wou'd
attacque him.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the design was so laid, as
some have conjectur'd with probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enough: but if this were really
their intention, there are others, who
believe that according to the advice
which was given by the Abbot of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bene,</hi>
they had done more wisely to
have begun with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
when they had him single and at
their mercy coopt up in the <hi>Louvre:</hi>
and they ground this opinion on the
meaning of that Abbot's words, who
quoted the Scripture to this purpose,
<q>It is written I will strike the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
and the Flock shall be scatter'd.</q>
However it was intended, the <hi>Paris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
immediately took the Alarm, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
clearly that those Strangers
who were to be sent out of the City,
were no others but those very men
whom the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had convey'd
into the Town for their defence and
for his own. Insomuch that when they
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42159:207"/>
went about to execute that Order,
and to search their Houses, every one
oppos'd them; and the Citizens set
themselves with so much obstinacy to
conceal their Lodgers, that the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Commissaries fearing a general
Insurrection through all the Quarters,
durst proceed no farther. And in the
mean time, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who
was the Soul that actuated this great
Body, forbore not going to the <hi>Louvre,</hi>
but well accompani'd; and the very
Evening before the Barricades he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Napkin to the King.</p>
            <p>But, as after the flashes of the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the ratling of the Thunder,
comes a furious Tempest and lays waste
the Field; so after those mutual fears
and jealousies, those Nightly meetings,
those Murmurs and Menaces, and those
preparations which were made on both
sides with so much tumult, either for
assaulting or for defence, they came
to the fatal day of the Barricado's,
which was follow'd by that horrible
deluge of misfortunes, with which all
<hi>France</hi> was overflow'd.</p>
            <p>For at last, the King more incens'd
than ever, by the resistance which
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42159:208"/>
was made to his Orders, and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to make himself be obey'd one
way or other, caus'd the <hi>French</hi> Guards
to enter <hi>Paris,</hi> with some other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
and the <hi>Swissers,</hi> which in all,
made up six thousand men: this was
done on Thursday the twelfth of <hi>May,</hi>
just at day break; he being present
himself to receive them on Horseback,
at the Gate of Saint <hi>Honorè.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having given out his Orders to
their Officers, to Post them according
to his direction, he enjoyn'd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things, to be no ways injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Citizens, but onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the insolence of such, who shou'd
go about to hinder the search for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
After which himself retiring to
the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the Marshals <hi>d' Aumont</hi>
and <hi>Biron,</hi> who were at the Head of
the Troups, went to Post them with
beat of Drum, in the Church yard of
St. <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the adjoyning places,
on the Pont <hi>Nostre Dame,</hi> on that of
St. <hi>Michael,</hi> on the Pont <hi>au Change,</hi>
at the Town-House, at the <hi>Greve,</hi>
and at the Avenues of the Place <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:42159:208"/>
It appear'd immediately by what
follow'd, that this was in effect to give
the signal of a mutiny, and general
revolt to all <hi>Paris.</hi> For a Rumour
being spread, that the King had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
to put to Death a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the principal of the <hi>League,</hi>
and a List being also forg'd of their
Names who were to be Executed, and
shown openly to the people, the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
according to the order of their
Captains and Overseers of their Wards,
were in a readiness to put themselves
into a posture of defence, at the least
motion that was made. For which
reason, so soon as they heard the
Drums and Fifes, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the <hi>Swissers</hi> and the Guards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
through the Street of Saint
<hi>Honoré,</hi> they doubted not but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
which was nois'd about by the
Sixteen was true, and farther believ'd
(as they had been also assur'd) that the
Town wou'd be sack'd, and expos'd
to Pillage. The Alarm therefore was
given round the City: They began
by shutting up their Shops, and the
Church doors on that side of the
Town: They rang the Tocsin (or
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42159:209"/>
alarm Bell) first in one Parish and
then in another: and immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
through all <hi>Paris,</hi> as if the
whole City had been on fire.</p>
            <p>Then the Citizens came out in
Arms, under the Overseers of their
Wards, and their Captains, and other
Officers of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who
had mingl'd themselves amongst them,
to encourage and to marshal them.
The Count of <hi>Brissac,</hi> who had plac'd
himself at the Quarter of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
towards the place <hi>Maubert,</hi> (where
<hi>Crucè,</hi> one of the most hot-headed of
the Sixteen, caus'd the alarm to be
Sounded,) being himself incompass'd
with a multitude of Students, a rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Porters, Watermen, and Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrafts
men all Arm'd, who waited
onely for the signal to assault the <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi>
was the first who gave Orders to
Chain the Streets, to unpave them,
and erect the Barricades, with great
logs of Timber, and Barrels fill'd with
Earth and Dung, at the Avenues of
the Palace: And this word of Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades
passing in a moment from mouth
to mouth, from the University into
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ty, and from the City into the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42159:209"/>
Town, the same was done every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>where,
and that with such exceeding
haste, that before Noon, these Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades
which were continu'd from
Street to Street, at the distance of
thirty paces from each other, well
Flanck'd and Man'd with Musquetiers,
were advanc'd within fifty paces of
the <hi>Louvre:</hi> Insomuch that the King's
Souldiers found themselves so encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
on every side, that they cou'd
neither March forward nor retreat,
nor make the least motion, without
exposing themselves unprofitably to
the inevitable danger of the Musquet
shot, (which the Citizens cou'd fire
upon them without missing, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
their Barricades,) or of being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
down with a tempest of Stones,
which came powring upon their Heads
from every Window.</p>
            <p>The Marshals <hi>d' Aumont</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and <hi>Villequier</hi> the Governour of
<hi>Paris,</hi> gain'd little by crying out to the
Citizens, that they intended them no
harm, for they were too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
to give them the hearing; and
were possess'd with a belief of what
<hi>Brissac, Bois Dauphin,</hi> and the other
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42159:210"/>
Creatures of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had
told them; who roar'd out, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to envenom them against the
Royalists, that those Troups which
were entred into <hi>Paris,</hi> were sent for
to no other end, than to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Massacre of all good <hi>Catholiques,</hi>
who were members of the Holy Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to give up to the Souldiers,
their Houses, their Money, and their
Wives. Upon this the Musquet shot,
and the Stones from above, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubl'd
on those miserable men, and
more especially upon the <hi>Swissers,</hi> to
whom the Citizens were most inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>More than threescore were either
slain, or dangerously hurt, as well in
St. <hi>Innocents</hi> Church yard, as below
on the Place <hi>Maubert,</hi> without giving
Quarter, till <hi>Brissac</hi> (who with his
Sword in his hand was continually
pushing forward the Barricades) arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
there, and beholding those poor
Strangers who cry'd out for mercy,
with clasp'd Hands, and both Knees
on the ground, and sometimes making
the sign of the Cross, in testimony of
their being <hi>Catholiques,</hi>) stop'd the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:42159:210"/>
fury of the Citizens, and commanding
them to cry out <hi>vive Guise,</hi> which
they did as loud as they cou'd for safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
of their Lives, he satisfi'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with leading them disarm'd and
Prisoners into the Boucherie of the
New Market, by the Bridge of
St. <hi>Michael,</hi> which he had already
master'd.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deni'd but that this
Count was he, amongst all the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi>
who acted with the most ardour
against the Royalists on that fatal day.
As being infinitely exasperated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King had refus'd him the
Admiralty, and refus'd it in a manner
so disobliging, as to say openly he
was a man that was good for nothing
either by Sea or Land, accusing him
at the same time, that he had not done
his Duty in the Battel of the <hi>Azores,</hi>
where the Navy of <hi>Philippo Strozzi</hi>
was defeated by the Marquis of <hi>Santa-Cruz,</hi>
he burn'd inwardly with desire
of Revenge. And when he saw the
Souldiers inclos'd on all sides, by the
Barricades, which were of his raising,
and the <hi>Swissers</hi> at his mercy, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that he cry'd out, as insulting
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:42159:211"/>
on the King, with a bitter Scoff, and
magnifying himself at the same time;
<q>At least the King shall understand to
day, that I have found my Element,
and though I am good for nothing
either at Sea or Land, yet I am some
Body in the Streets.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner it was, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
making use of their advantage,
still push'd their fortune more and
more, and seem'd to be just upon the
point of investing the <hi>Louvre;</hi> while
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> by whose secret or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
all things were regularly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
amidst that horrible con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usion,
was walking almost unaccompanied,
in his own House, and coldly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Queen, and those who came
one on the neck of another with Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
to him from the King, intreating
him to appease the tumult, that he
was not Master of those wild Beasts,
which had escap'd the toyles; and
that they were in the wrong to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them as they had done.</p>
            <p>But at last, when he perceiv'd that
all things were absolutely at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he went himself from Barricade
to Barricade, with onely a riding
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42159:211"/>
switch in his hand, forbidding the
people who paid a blind obedience to
him, from proceeding any farther;
and desiring them to keep themselves
onely on the defensive. He spoke also
very civilly to the <hi>French</hi> Guards,
who at that time were wholly in his
power, to be dispos'd of as he thought
good, for Life or Death. Onely he
complain'd to their Officers, of the
violent counsells which his Enemies
had given the King to oppress his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and that of so many good
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> who had united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on no other consideration than
the defence and support of the ancient
Religion. After which, he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Captain St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to reconduct
those Souldiers to the <hi>Louvre;</hi> but
their Arms were first laid down, and
their Heads bare, in the posture of
vanquish'd men; that he might give
that satisfaction to the <hi>Parisians,</hi> who
beheld the spectacle with Joy, as the
most pleasing effect of their present
Victory. He also caus'd the <hi>Swissers</hi>
to be return'd in the same manner by
<hi>Brissac,</hi> and gave the King to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that provided the <hi>Catholique</hi>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:42159:212"/>
Religion were secur'd and maintain'd
in <hi>France,</hi> in the condition it ought
to be, and that himself and his Friends
were put in safety from the attempts
of their Enemies, they wou'd pay him
all manner of Duty and Service, which
is owing from good Subjects, to their
Lord and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>This in my opinion makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Duke had never any
intention to seize the person of the
King, and to inclose him in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery,
as that <hi>Nicholas Poulain</hi> who
gave in so many false informations,
and many Writers as well of the one
Religion as of the other, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to make the World believe.
For if that had been his purpose, what
cou'd have hinder'd him from causing
the <hi>Louvre</hi> to be invested? as he might
easily have done the same day, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the Barricades close to it,
while the tumult was at the height;
and for what reason did he return the
<hi>French</hi> Guards and <hi>Swissers</hi> to the
King, if his intention had been to
have attacqu'd him in the <hi>Louvre?</hi>
This was not his business, nor his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
aim, but to defend and protect
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42159:212"/>
his <hi>Leaguers</hi> with a high hand, and to
avail himself of so favourable an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
to obtain the thing which
he demanded; and which doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>less
had put him into condition of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the throne after the King's decease,
and becoming absolute Master of all
affairs even during his Life.</p>
            <p>In effect, the Queen having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to make the reconcilement, as
believing that thereby she might reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the management of business,
from which the Favourites had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
her, and having ask'd him what
were his pretensions, he propos'd such
extravagant terms, and with so much
haughtiness and resolv'dness, speaking
like a Conquerour, who took upon
him to dispose at his pleasure of the
Vanquish'd, that as dextrous as she
was, in the art of managing Mens
minds, from the very beginning of
the conference she despair'd of her suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
<q>For inhancing upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of <hi>Nancy,</hi> he demanded that
for the Security of the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Religion in this Realm, the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
and all the Princes of the House
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who had follow'd him
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42159:213"/>
in these last Wars, shou'd be declar'd
to have forfeited for ever their
right of succeeding to the Crown:
That the Duke of <hi>Esperno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, La Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leite</hi>
his Brother, <hi>Francis d' O.</hi> the
Marshals of <hi>Retz</hi> and of <hi>Biron,</hi> Colonel
<hi>Alphonso d' Ornano,</hi> and all others
who like them were favourers of
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> or were found to
have held any correspondence with
them, shou'd be depriv'd of their
Governments and Offices, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
from the Court, without hope
of ever being restor'd again. That
the spoils of all these shou'd be given
to the Princes of his House, and to
those Lords who had ingag'd with
him, of whom he made a long List:
That the King shou'd casheer his
Guard of five and forty, as a thing
unknown in the times of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
protesting that otherwise he
cou'd place no manner of confidence
in him, nor ever dare to approach
his person. That it wou'd please
his Majesty to declare him his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General through all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
with the same Authority
which the late Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42159:213"/>
had, under the Reign of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
the Second: by virtue of which
he hop'd to give him so good an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time there shou'd remain no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion in
all his Kingdom. To conclude, that
there shou'd be call'd immediately
an Assembly of the three Estates, to
sit at <hi>Paris</hi> where all this shou'd be
confirm'd, and to hinder for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Minions who wou'd
dispose of all things at their pleasure,
shou'd not abuse their favour, that
there shou'd be establish'd an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
form of Government,
which it shou'd not be in the power
of the King to alter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis most evident that Demands so
unreasonable, so arrogant, and so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
tended to put the Government, and
the power of it into the Duke's hands,
who being Master of the Armies, the
Offices, and the Governments of the
most principal Provinces, in his own
person by his Relations, his Creatures,
and the Estates, where he doubted not
of carrying all before him, especially
at <hi>Paris,</hi> wou'd be the absolute dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42159:214"/>
of Affairs. Insomuch that there
wou'd be nothing wanting to him but
the Crown it self, to which 'tis very
probable, that at this time he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in case he shou'd survive the
King, to the exclusion of the <hi>Bourbons,</hi>
whom he wou'd have declar'd inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of succeeding to it.</p>
            <p>For which reason, the Queen see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he wou'd recede from no part
of these Articles, and beginning to
fear, that he wou'd go farther than
she desir'd, counsell'd the King to get
out of <hi>Paris</hi> with all speed, while it
was yet in his power so to do. And
though some of his chief Officers, as
amongst others the Chancellour <hi>de
Chiverny,</hi> and the <hi>Sieurs</hi> of <hi>Villeroy</hi>
and <hi>Villequier,</hi> who were of opinion
that more wou'd be gain'd by the
Negotiation, and who foresaw that
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
whom they had no great cause to
love, wou'd make their advantage of
this retreat so unworthy of a King,
endeavour'd to dissuade him from it,
yet a thousand false advertisements,
which came every moment, that they
were going to invest the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42159:214"/>
his accustom'd fear, together with the
diffidence he had of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
whom he consider'd at that time as
his greatest Enemy, caus'd him at the
last to resolve on his departure.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, about noon the next
day, while the Queen Mother went
to the Duke with propositions onely
to amuse him, the King making shew
to take a turn or two in the Tuilleries,
put on Boots in the Stables, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on Horse-back, attended by fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or sixteen Gentlemen, and by ten
or twelve Lacqueys, having caused
notice to be given to his Guards
to follow him, went out by the
Port <hi>Neuve,</hi> riding always on full
gallop, for fear of being pursu'd by
the <hi>Parisians,</hi> till having gain'd the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
above <hi>Challiot,</hi> he stopt his Horse
to look back on <hi>Paris.</hi> 'Tis said, that
then reproaching that great City,
which he had always honour'd, and
enrich'd by his Royal presence, and
upbrayding its ingratitude, he Swore
he wou'd not return into it but through
a Breach, and that he wou'd lay it so
low, that it shou'd never more be in a
condition of lifting up its self against
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42159:215"/>
the King. After this he went to
Lodge that night at <hi>Trappes,</hi> and the
next morning arriv'd at <hi>Chartres;</hi>
where his Officers, those of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and the Courtiers came up to him,
one after another in great disorder;
some on Foot, others on Horse-back
without Boots, several on their Mules,
and in their Robes, every man mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his escape as he was best able, and
in a great hurry for fear of being
stop'd; in short, all of them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
not unlike the Servants of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
at his departure from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
travelling in a miserable Equipage, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their distress'd Master, when he
fled before the Rebel <hi>Absalom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who on the
one side, had been unwilling to push
things to an extremity, to the end he
might make his Treaty with the King,
and that it might not be said he was
not at liberty; and on the other side,
not believing that he wou'd have gone
away in that manner, as if he fled
from his Subjects, who stopping short
of the <hi>Louvre</hi> by fifty paces, seem'd
unwilling to pursue their advantage
any farther, was much surpris'd at
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42159:215"/>
this retreat which broke the measures
he had taken: but as he was endu'd
with an admirable presence of mind,
and that he cou'd at a moments war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
accommodate his resolutions to
any accident, how unexpected or
troublesome soever, he immediately
appli'd himself to put <hi>Paris</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of fearing nothing, to quiet all
things there, and restore them to their
former tranquillity, and withall to give
notice to the whole Kingdom how
matters had pass'd at the Barricades,
as much to his own advantage, as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he cou'd.</p>
            <p>To this effect he possess'd himself
of the strongest places in the City; of
the Temple, of the Palace, of the
Town-House, of the two Chastelets,
of the Gates, where he set Guards, of
the <hi>Arsenal</hi> and of the <hi>Bastille,</hi> which
was surrender'd to him too easily by
the Governour <hi>Testu;</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which he gave to <hi>Bussy Le
Clerc,</hi> the most audacious of the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen:
He oblig'd the Magistrates to
proceed in the Courts of Judicature as
formerly: He made a new Provost of
Merchants, and Sheriffs, a Lieutenant
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42159:216"/>
Civil, Colonels, and Captains of the
several Wards, all devoted to the
<hi>League,</hi> in the room of those whom
he suspected. He retook without much
trouble all the places both above and
below, on the River, that the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for Provisions might be free. He
writ at last to the King, to the Towns,
and to his particular Friends, and drew
up Manifests (or Declarations) in a
style, which had nothing in it but
what was great and generous, while he
endeavour'd to justify his proceedings,
and at the same time to preserve the
respect which was owing to the King,
protesting always that he was most
ready to pay him an entire Obedience,
and that he propos'd nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but that provision shou'd be made
for the safety of Religion, and of good
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> which were design'd to
be oppress'd, through the pernicious
Counsells of such as held intelligence
with Heretiques, and projected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the ruine of Religion and
the State.</p>
            <p>These Letters, together with those
which the <hi>Parisians</hi> wrote to the other
Towns, exhorting all men to combine
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:42159:216"/>
with them for their common preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in the <hi>Catholique</hi> Faith, and
those of the King, which on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
were written, in too soft a style,
and where there appear'd more of fear
and of excuse, than of resentment and
just complaint for so sacrilegious an
attempt, had this effect, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the people, far from being
scandalis'd at the Barricades, approv'd
them, loudly praising the conduct of
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whom they believ'd
to be full of Zeal for the <hi>Catholique</hi>
Faith, for the good of the Kingdom,
and for the Service of the King. And
as he desir'd nothing so much as to
confirm them in that opinion, he was
willing that the body of the City,
shou'd send their Deputies to the King,
humbly to beseech his Majesty, that
he wou'd forget what was pass'd, and
return to his good Town of <hi>Paris,</hi>
where his most Loyal Subjects were
ready to give him all the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of their Obedience and
devotion to his Service.</p>
            <p>He permitted that even processions
shou'd be made, in the Habit of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
to desire of God, that he wou'd
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42159:217"/>
please to mollify the King's Heart
and this was perform'd with so much
ardour, that there was one which
went from <hi>Paris</hi> as far as <hi>Chartres,</hi>
in a most extraodinary Equipage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conduct of the famous Fryar
<hi>Ange.</hi> This honest Father was <hi>Henry
de Ioyeuse,</hi> Count of <hi>Bouchage,</hi> and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the late Duke. He had given
up himself to be a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> about a
year before this time: having such
strong impressions made upon him,
by the death and good example of his
Wife, <hi>Catharine de Nogaret,</hi> Sister to
the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
with a desire of repentance;
insomuch that neither the tears of his
Brother, nor the intreaties and favours
of the King, who lov'd him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nor the ardent solicitations of all
the Court, were able to remove him
from the resolution he had taken of
leading so austere a Life. This noble
Fryar, having put a Crown of Thorns
upon his head, and carrying an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
Cross upon his Shoulders, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by his Fraternity, and by a
great number of Penitents, and others
who represented in their Habits the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42159:217"/>
several persons of the Passion, led on
that procession, singing Psalms and
Litanies. The march of these Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
was so well manag'd, that they
enter'd the great Church of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
just as the King was there at <hi>Vespers:</hi>
As they enter'd, they began to sing
the <hi>Miserere,</hi> in a very dolefull tone;
And at the same time, two swindging
Fryars arm'd with Disciplines, laid on
lustily poor Fryar <hi>Ange,</hi> whose back
was naked. The application was not
hard to make, nor very advantageous
to the <hi>Parisians,</hi> for the charitable
creature seem'd evidently to desire the
King, that he wou'd please to pardon
them, as <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was willing to
forgive the <hi>Iews,</hi> for those horrible
outrages which they had committed
against him.</p>
            <p>A Spectacle so surprising produc'd
different effects in the minds of the
standers by; according to the variety
of their tempers, some of them were
melted into compassion, others were
mov'd to Laughter, and some even to
indignation: And more than all the
rest, the Marshal <hi>de Biron,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no manner of relish for this sort of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:42159:218"/>
devotion, and fearing besides, that
some dangerous <hi>Leaguers,</hi> might have
crowded in amongst them, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to Preach the people into a
Mutiny, counsell'd the King to clap
them up in Prison every Mothers Son.
But that good Prince, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all his faults, had a stock of
Piety at the bottom, and much respect
for all things that related to Religion,
rejected wholly this advice. He listen'd
to them much more favourably, than
he had heard all the Harangues of the
former Deputies: and promis'd to
grant them the pardon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
for the Town, which he had so
much favour'd, on condition they
wou'd return to their Obedience. And
truly 'tis exceeding probable, that he
had so done from that very time, if
they had not afterwards given him
fresh provocations, by proposing the
terms on which they insisted for the
Peace, which they desir'd.</p>
            <p>For the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to whom all
these fair appearances were very service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and cou'd be no ways prejudicial,
and who always pursu'd his designs in a
direct line, knew so well to manage the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:42159:218"/>
disposition of the Queen Mother, who
had seem'd at first to be much startled at
his demands, that he recall'd her with
much dexterity into his interests; by
working on those two passions which
were rooted in her Soul. She desir'd
to raise to the Throne, after the death
of the King her Son, her Grandson
<hi>Henry de Lorrain,</hi> Marquis <hi>du Pont;</hi>
and believ'd that the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
wou'd contribute to it all that was in
his power. But as cunning as she was,
she saw not into the bottom of that
Prince, who fed her onely with vain
hopes of that Succession for another,
to which he personally aspir'd. She
infinitely hated the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
and believing he was the man, who
having possess'd himself of the King's
Soul, had render'd her suspected to
him, long'd to turn him out of Court;
promising her self by that means to
be re-establish'd in the management
of affairs from which the Favourites
had remov'd her. And the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> who had as little kindness as
her self for the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
in the same design, with at least
as much earnestness, but for a much
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:42159:219"/>
different end; for he desir'd to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
himself. In this manner this
subtle Prince, always dissembling, and
artifically hiding the true motives by
which he acted, drew the Queen at
last to consent to all that he desir'd:
and above all, to give her allowance
that a request shou'd be presented to
the King in the name of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
the Princes, the Peers of <hi>France,</hi>
the Lords, the Deputies of <hi>Paris</hi> and
the other Towns, and of all the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi>
united for the defence of the
<hi>Catholique, Apostolique</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>This reqest which in the manner
of its expressions, was couch'd in most
respectfull terms, contain'd notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the bottom of it, certain
Propositions, at least as hard as the
Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cles of <hi>Nancy;</hi> and even as those,
which not long before were propos'd
to the Queen by the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
For after a protestation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, that in whatsoever had
pass'd till that present time, there
had been nothing done, but by a pure
zeal for God's honour, and for the
preservation of his Church, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42159:219"/>
of the King, That he wou'd
make War with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and
that he wou'd conclude no Peace till
all Heresies were rooted out. That
it wou'd please him to use the Service
of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in so just and
holy an undertaking; that he wou'd
drive out of the Court, and despoil
of all their Offices, all those who
held a secret correspondence with the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> and principally the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and his Brother <hi>La Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette.</hi>
Against whom there are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
in that request, all imaginable
crimes that cou'd be thought most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of rendring them odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
to the whole Kingdom.
That he wou'd deliver the Nation
from the just apprehensions it had,
of falling one day under the power
and dominion of Heretiques. And
(that there might be given to the
City of <hi>Paris</hi> a full assurance hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to enjoy a perfect tranquillity,
without fear of oppression,) he wou'd
not onely please to confirm the new
Provosts, and Sheriffs, but that also
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid City may have full and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
liberty for the future, to make
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42159:220"/>
choice of such as shall succeed in those
places, and in those of City Colonels
and Captains.</p>
            <p>This request was extremely displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the King, who saw but too
clearly, that their intention was to
give the Law to him hereafter, whom
they had first so haughtily affronted.
He therefore caus'd it to be examin'd
in his Council, where there was but
small agreement, because the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it were divided in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.
There were but two methods
to be taken on that subject; either for
the King to joyn with the <hi>League</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> as the request
demanded, or to make War against
the <hi>League</hi> with all his Power, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he espous'd one of these inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
it was impossible for him to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
Those of the Council who lov'd
not the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who were
many, and who fear'd that the acting
of the King's Forces in combination
with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> wou'd prove of
great prejudice to his Reputation, and
of greater to Religion, were for the
former Proposition and Counsel, that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42159:220"/>
all differences shou'd be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the best manner they cou'd
with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> which was
also the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire of the Queen Mother:
But the rest, who for the most part
consisted of those persons, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and banishment was demanded
in the Request, insisted strongly on the
second: and gave their voice for a
War to be made against the Duke to
the uttermost; fortifying their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the number of Forces, which
the King might raise promiscuously,
both from <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi>
because this was not a War of Religion,
but that the Sovereign onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
himself; to quell and chastise his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Subjects.</p>
            <p>It wou'd be a matter of much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to tell precisely what was the
true resolution which the King took,
betwixt the extremes of these different
Counsels. But it may be told for a
certain truth, that having a long time
deliberated, and that much more in
his own breast than with his Council,
he seem'd at length all on the sudden to
pitch upon the first; whether it were,
that being as he was, a good <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:42159:221"/>
and hating the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> he
cou'd not yet come to a resolution of
uniting himself to them; or were it,
that he thought not himself at that
time strong enough, even with the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s assistance, to destroy
the <hi>League,</hi> which was grown more
powerfull than ever since the Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades,
and Headed by a man so able,
so bold, and so successfull as the Duke
of <hi>Guise;</hi> or lastly, as many have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
that being strongly perswaded,
he shou'd never be in safety, nor be
Master in his Kingdom, while that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whom he hated mortally was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, he took up from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a resolution within himself to
dispatch him out of the World, and
that he might draw him into the Net
which he was spreading for him, was
willing to grant in a manner whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he desir'd, as if it were done in
co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>mplation of a Peace.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever were his true motive,
(for I desire not that random guesses
shou'd be taken for truths,) 'tis certain
that though the King was highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
against the <hi>League,</hi> yet he
answer'd their request with much
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42159:221"/>
gentleness and moderation, assuring
them that he wou'd assemble the three
Estates at <hi>Blois,</hi> in the Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
there to advise of the means
to give them satisfaction, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them from the jealousie they had
of falling one day under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a <hi>Huguenot</hi> Prince; that for
what related to the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi>
he wou'd doe them Justice, like an
Equitable King, and wou'd make it
manifest that he preferr'd the publique
welfare, before the consideration of any
private person.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in the first place, that
Duke was despoil'd of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from Court, and retire himself to
<hi>Angouleme.</hi> Not long time afterwards
the King concluded a Treaty with the
Lords of the <hi>League,</hi> to whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Places which they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in possession, the Towns of
<hi>Montreuil, Orleans</hi> and <hi>Bourges</hi> were
given for six Years. A publication of
the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was promis'd,
with provision against that part of it
which was contrary to the liberties of
the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>There was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42159:222"/>
to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> instead of
the title of Constable, that of Head of
the <hi>French Gendarmerie,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the same thing. Two Armies
were promis'd to be rais'd against the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> one in <hi>Dauphinè</hi> under the
command of Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and
the other in <hi>Saintonge</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi>
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hou'd be Commanded by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the King's own choice: For
the New Constable under another name
wou'd not be so far from Court, lest
his absence from thence might be of ill
consequence to his Party. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the King caus'd to be publish'd the
famous Edict of <hi>Iuly,</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be call'd the Edict of the
Reunion, where he did more in favour
of the <hi>League,</hi> than the <hi>League</hi> it self
desir'd from him.</p>
            <p>For, after having declar'd in that
Edict, that he wou'd have all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
united to himself, that in like
manner as their Souls are redeem'd with
the same price, by the Bloud of our
Lord and Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
they and their posterity shou'd be
one Body with him; he swears, that
he will employ all his Forces, without
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42159:222"/>
sparing his proper life, to exterminate
from his Realm all Heresies condemn'd
by Councils, and principally by that of
<hi>Trent,</hi> without ever making any Peace
or Truce with Heretiques, or any
Edict in their favour. He wills that
all Princes, Lords, Gentlemen, and
Inhabitants of Towns, and generally
all his Subjects, as well Ecclesiastical
as Secular, shou'd take the same Oath.
That farther, they shou'd swear and
promise, for the time present, and for
ever, after it shall have pleas'd God to
dispose of his life, without having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him Issue Male, not to receive for
King, any Prince whatsoever, who
shall be a Heretique or a promoter of
Heresie. He declares Rebels and guilty
of High Treason, and to have forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all Privileges which have formerly
been granted to them, all persons and
all Towns, which shall refuse to take
this Oath, and sign this Union. He
promises never to bestow any Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
employment, but on such as shall
make a signal profession of the <hi>Roman
Catholique</hi> Religion. And prohibits
in express terms, that any man who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall be admitted to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42159:223"/>
of any office Judicature, or
any employment belonging to the
Treasury, whose profession of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholique</hi> Religion, appears not
under the Attestation of the Bishop or
his substitutes, or at least of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
or their Vicars, together with
the deposition of ten Witnesses, all
qualified, and unsuspected persons.
He also swears to hold for his good
and Loyal Subjects, and to protect and
defend as well those who have always
follow'd the <hi>League,</hi> as those others
who have formerly united and associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves against the Heretiques;
and that at this present he unites them
to himself; to the end they may all
act together in order to one common
end. And that he holds for null, and
as never done, that which seems to
have been done against him; as well
in the Town of <hi>Paris,</hi> as elsewhere
particularly since the twelfth of <hi>May</hi>
to the day of the publication of this
Edict: without future molestation or
bringing into trouble any person
whomsoever, for any thing relating
to the premisses. But he also wills
that all his Subjects of what Quality
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42159:223"/>
soever, swear that they will and do
renounce all <hi>Leagues</hi> and Confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as well without as within the
Realm, which are contrary to this
Union, on pain of being punish'd, as
infringers of their Oath, and guilty of
High Treason.</p>
            <p>This Edict was verifi'd in Parliament
the one and twentieth of <hi>Iuly;</hi> and
publish'd immediately after; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with extraordinary transports
of joy by the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who believ'd
that by it, they had obtain'd a clear
Victory against the King, whom they
beheld entirely subjected to the will
and good pleasure of their Heads.
He himself also as it is reported, with
profound dissimulation endeavour'd all
he was able to confirm them in that
opinion, by making publique demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of his joy, and satisfaction
for the peace. He was very solicitous
to cause his Edict to be sign'd by all
the Princes and Lords who were then
at Court: He proclaim'd the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the three Estates at <hi>Blois,</hi> which
was to be at the beginning of <hi>October</hi>
following. He procur'd the Letters
Patents for the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:42159:224"/>
of Intendant General, over all
his Armies, with the same power
which is annex'd to that of Constable,
to be verifi'd in Parliament. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
him at <hi>Chartres</hi> with such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
tokens of esteem, affection,
and trust, that it was believ'd the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
friendship which was betwixt them
when the King was then but Duke of
<hi>Anjou,</hi> was once more renew'd. He
favour'd all his creatures, on whom he
bestow'd considerable Employments,
and at last, to satisfie him in that point,
which of all others was most nice, he
caus'd the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to be
solemnly declar'd the next of Bloud to
him, by allowing him all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
and Prerogatives which belong
to the Heir presumptive of the Crown.
After all, as it is almost impossible that
a violent passion in the Soul, what
care soever be taken to conceal it,
shou'd not discover it self by its conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and by some indications,
which break out even from the closest
men: So this Prince as great a Master
as he was in the art of dissimulation,
cou'd not act his part so well, but that
he gave occasion to those who were
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:42159:224"/>
more clear sighted, to believe, or at
leastwise to suspect, that all which at
that time was done by him to testifie
his joy, was onely to cover his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and his hatred, which urg'd
him incessantly to revenge himself on
those from whom he had receiv'd such
unworthy usage.</p>
            <p>For being departed from <hi>Chartres,</hi>
and going thence to <hi>Roüen,</hi> where he
made the Edict of Reunion, he wou'd
never be perswaded to go to <hi>Paris</hi> at
his return, what instance soever the
Deputies of the Parliament, and those
of the Town cou'd make to him: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
alledging faint excuses, which
he grounded onely on the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he was to make in order
to his meeting the Estates at <hi>Blois.</hi>
He still retain'd near his person his
Guard of the five and forty which
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had requested him
to dismiss. He gave the command of
the Army design'd for <hi>Poitou</hi> to the
Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> whom the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> his Brother-in-law cou'd never
endure, since his renunciation of the
<hi>League.</hi> He admitted none to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
friendship, but the Marshal <hi>d'
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:42159:225"/>
Aumont,</hi> the Lord <hi>Nicholas d' Angen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
de Rambouillet,</hi> Colonel <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. d'
Ornano,</hi> and some few others,
who were no friends to the Duke of
<hi>Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, that which made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
noise, was, that the Chancellour
<hi>de Chiverny,</hi> the Presidents <hi>Bellievre</hi>
and <hi>Brulart,</hi> and the <hi>Sieurs de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi>
and <hi>Pinart,</hi> (the two Secretaries
of State, who had given him advice, to
accommodate matters with the Duke
of <hi>Guise</hi>) were absolutely disgrac'd.
The Queen Mother who had manag'd
that accommodation, had little or no
part in business; and was wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the Cabinet Council. The
Seals were given to <hi>Francis de Monthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
a famous Advocate, a man of rare
integrity, and of inviolable fidelity to
the King's service, who rais'd him to
that high Employment, without his
own seeking, at the recommendation
of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who was known
to be on very ill terms with the Duke
of <hi>Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this was sufficient without doubt
to alarm that Prince, and give him
caution to look about him, or at least
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42159:225"/>
to suspect the King's intentions towards
him, but the flourishing condition,
wherein he was plac'd, the applauses
which were given him both by the
people and by the Court it self, which
admir'd both his conduct and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
felicity, and regarded him as
Arbitrator and Master of Affairs; and
the certain opinion which he had,
that all things wou'd go for him in the
Estates, had so far blinded him, that
he believ'd it was not in the power of
fortune to do him any prejudice, not
so much as to shake him, or to give
the smallest stop to the full carrier of
his success. Thus he enter'd as it were
in triumph into <hi>Blois</hi> at the end of
<hi>September;</hi> and the King came thither
about the same time, to order the
preparations for the Estates. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that all future proceedings
shou'd be as it were sanctifi'd by two
solemn and conspicuous acts of piety;
which were a most devout and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Procession made on the first
Sunday of <hi>October,</hi> the second day of
that Month, and by a general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
taken by all the Deputies on
the Sunday following, the ninth of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42159:226"/>
the same Month; on which the King,
in token of a perfect reconcilement,
receiv'd with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the
precious Body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> from
the hands of the Cardinal <hi>de Bourbon,</hi>
in the Church of Saint <hi>Saviour.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, all those who were expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
being at length arriv'd, the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Estates was open'd on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the sixteenth of that Month,
in the great Hall of the Castle of
<hi>Blois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is not my business to say any
thing of this Assembly, which relates
not precisely to the History of the
<hi>League,</hi> I shall not trouble my self
with every particular which pass'd in
it. I shall onely say, that the King
who was naturally eloquent, open'd
the Assembly with an excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
wherein after he had in a most
Majestique manner, and with most
pathetique words, exhorted the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to their duty, he either cou'd
not or wou'd not conceal from them,
that he had not so far forgotten the
past actions, but that he had taken up
a firm resolution, to inflict an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
punishment on such who shou'd
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42159:226"/>
persist in acting against his Authority,
and continue to be still possest with
that spirit of Leaguing and Caballing,
which was upon the point of ruining
the State; neither wou'd he hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
spare those who shou'd have any
other union, than that which the
Members ought to have with their
Head, and Subjects with their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p>This touch'd so sensibly the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers</hi>
of that Assembly, and principally
their Head, who look'd on this Speech
as particularly address'd to himself, that
they proceeded even to threatning
that they wou'd break off the Estates
by their departure, if the King, who
had commanded his Speech to be
Printed, wou'd not give order to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it, or at least correct that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
There are some who affirm,
that after a rough dispute concerning
it, the King permitted at last that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
shou'd be alter'd, and the harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his expressions a little mollifi'd.
But there are others, and even of their
number who heard it spoken, who
assure us, that it came out in publique
in the same terms it was pronounc'd.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42159:227"/>
However it were, 'tis certain, that
this complaint of theirs much exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the King's mind, who saw clearly
by this proceeding, that the <hi>League,</hi>
notwithstanding its Reunion with him,
had still a separate interest of its own,
and extremely opposite to his.</p>
            <p>I will adventure to say farther, that
he was then fully perswaded of it,
when he perceiv'd that the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> who was the true Head of it,
was evidently more powerfull than
himself in those Estates. For besides
that the greatest part of the Deputies
had been elected by the factious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of his dependants in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
those who were chosen to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
over the several Orders, that is to
say the Cardinals of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urbon</hi> and of
<hi>Guise,</hi> for the Clergy, the Count of
<hi>Brissac,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Magnac</hi> for
the Nobility, and the Provost of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
La Chapelle Martau</hi> for the
third order, were all of them entirely
at the Duke's devotion.</p>
            <p>Insomuch that at the second Session,
after the Edict of Reunion had been
solemnly confirm'd, sworn to again,
and pass'd into a fundamental Law
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42159:227"/>
of the State, when the Petitions of the
three Orders were read, he saw that
under pretence of desiring to reform
some abuses which were crept into
the State, they were fill'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Propositions, which
tended to the manifest diminution, or
rather the annihilation of the Royal
Authority, and to reduce the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that pass, that there shou'd
remain to the King no more than the
empty name and vain appearance of
a Soveraign Monarch; and that all
the real and essential part of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
shou'd be in the <hi>League,</hi> which
absolutely depended on the Duke of
<hi>Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet farther they were not satisfied
barely to propose these things, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to the King, according to the
Ancient Laws and Constitution of the
Monarchy, the power of either pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or refusing them, according to
his pleasure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>after they had been well
examin'd in his Council; but they
pretended that after they had been
receiv'd by the consent of the three
Orders, they shou'd become Laws of
course, and be inviolable, so that the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42159:228"/>
King shou'd not have the power either
to change or abrogate them in his
Council. Then they wou'd have an
abatement of Taxes and Imposts, but
so much out of measure, that they
took away from the King the means
of making that War, in which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had ingag'd him. They wou'd
also that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> shou'd
be receiv'd absolutely, and without
modification. And the famous Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
General <hi>Iaques de Faye, d' Espesses,</hi>
who in a great Assembly held on that
occasion, maintain'd with strength of
reason, against some decrees of that
Council, the Prerogatives of the King
(or <hi>Regalia</hi>) and the Immunities
of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, was so ill
treated there, though he had baffled
the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to destroy those Privileges, that
the King who was affronted in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his Attorney, was not a little
displeas'd at their proceedings.</p>
            <p>But above all things they were ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
with him, and press'd it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
obstinacy, that the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> who at the same time had
assembled the Estates of his Party at
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42159:228"/>
               <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and from thence had sent to
those at <hi>Blois,</hi> intimating his desire of
a General Council to be summon'd,
where all things might be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
shou'd from that time forward be
declar'd uncapable of ever succeeding
to the Crown. They had made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
concerning this, by consent of
the three Orders, at the particular
instance of the Order of the Clergy.
And the King who clearly foresaw the
terrible consequences of this unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
injustice, and who was ply'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly
to subscribe it, was not able
to defend himself otherwise, than by
amusing them with delays, and rubbs
which he dextrously caus'd to be
thrown in their way, on sundry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.
It was not doubted but that
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> (who having two
thirds of the Estates for him, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Master there,) was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of all these Propositions so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the true Interests and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the King, especially when it
was evident, that he employ'd all his
Managers, to cause himself to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
in the Estates, Lieutenant
General through the whole Kingdom,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42159:229"/>
as if he wou'd possess himself of that
Supreme Command, without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the King, and that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Prince to be no more his
Master, as not having power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of a dignity which he was
to hold, from a Commission given him
by others.</p>
            <p>All these things so unworthy of the
Majesty of a great King, at the length
quite weari'd out his patience; which
after so long dissembling his injuries, on
the sudden broke out into the extremity
of rage: Insomuch that those among
his Confidents, who ardently desir'd
the destruction of the Duke for their
own advantage, found not the least
trouble, in passing on the King for
truths, many reports and oftentimes
very groundless rumours, which ran
of the Duke, adding to them that it
was he, who underhand had drawn
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to possess himself of
the Marquisate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> as he had
lately done. And this they confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm'd, though the Duke by his
own interest in the Estates, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
them to vote a War against the
<hi>Savoyard.</hi> Thus, whether it were
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42159:229"/>
that the King had long since resolv'd
to rid his hands of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
in revenge of some ancient grudge and
sense of the affronts he had receiv'd
from him, particularly on that fatal
day of the Barricades; or were it, that
being sincerely reconcil'd to him he
had taken, or perhaps resum'd that
resolution when he saw him act against
him in the Estates, of which he had
made himself the Master, and believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own condition desperate, if he
made not haste to prevent him,
most certain it is, that he deliberated
no more, but onely concerning the
manner of executing what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd.</p>
            <p>He had onely two ways to chuse,
the one by justice, first committing
him, and afterwards making his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
the other by Fact, which was
to have him slain. He manag'd this
consultation with exceeding secrecy,
admitting onely four or five of his
Confidents, on whom he most rely'd.
One of these was <hi>Beauvais Nangis,</hi>
who having serv'd the King well, in
his Army against the <hi>Reyters,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
so fully to his favour, that in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42159:230"/>
recompence of the Command, of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
of the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, which
the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> had got over
his head, he made him afterwards Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>France,</hi> though he never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
that great dignity, which he had
onely under the Signet.</p>
            <p>This Lord, who was as prudent,
and temperate in Council, as prompt
and daring in execution, concluded
for the methods of Justice, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they were not onely the
more honest, but also the more safe,
because the fear alone which wou'd
possess the Duke's party, lest they
shou'd kill him, in case they attempted
to deliver him by force, and by that
means hinder the course of Justice,
wou'd stop all manner of such procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and restrain them within the
terms of Duty. That after all, if he
were once made Prisoner, which might
be done without noise or tumult, it
wou'd be easie to give him such Judges,
as shou'd soon dispatch his Tryal, and
that afterwards he might be executed
in Prison, according to the Laws.
But if on the contrary, they shou'd
enter crudely on so bloudy an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:42159:230"/>
there was danger lest that
action which was never to be well
justified, and which the <hi>Leaguers</hi>
wou'd certainly cause to pass in the
World, for tyrannical and per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idious,
might raise a rebellion in the greatest
part of <hi>France,</hi> which had already
declar'd so loudly for that Prince,
whom they regarded as the pillar of
Religion, and wou'd afterwards look
on as the Martyr of it. But the rest,
who believ'd it impossible on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
to observe the ordinary forms of
Law and Justice, and thought that the
Head being once cut off, the Body of
the <hi>League</hi> wou'd immediately fall
like a dead Body, were of opinion
that he shou'd be dispatch'd with all
possible speed, which was easie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
especially in the Castle, where
the Duke was almost hourly in the
King's power, whom he had in no
manner of distrust, as sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
by his Lodging there.</p>
            <p>In the mean time 'tis most certain,
that this secret was not kept so close,
but that he receiv'd advertisement from
more than one, of his imminent danger,
and that his death already was resolv'd.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:42159:231"/>
And he slighted not so much these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
as intrepid as he was, or
as he affected to appear, by replying
continually, <hi>they dare not,</hi> but that
two or three days before his death, he
consulted on this affair, which so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd him, with the Cardinal
of <hi>Guise,</hi> his Brother, the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Lyons,</hi> the President <hi>de Neuilly,</hi> the
Provost of the Merchants, and the
<hi>Sieur de Mandrevile</hi> Governour of St.
<hi>Menehoud,</hi> on whom he principally
rely'd. In weighing those proofs which
in a manner were indubitable, that a
design was laid against him, they
were unanimously of opinion that the
safest course was to be taken, and that
under some pretence or other, he
shou'd instantly retire. Excepting
onely the Arch-Bishop, who continu'd
obstinate to the contrary, fortifying
his opinion with this argument, that
since he was upon the point, of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
all things in the Estates accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, he ran the hazard of
loosing all by leaving them. And,
that for the rest, it was not credible
that the King shou'd be so ill advis'd,
as to incur the manifest danger of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42159:231"/>
himself, by striking that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
blow. To which <hi>Mandrevile</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
Swearing, that for a man of
Sense as he was, he was the worst
Arguer he ever knew. For, said he,
you talk of the King, as if he were a
wary and cool-headed Prince, looking
before him at every step, and will not
understand that he is onely a hot-brain'd
Fool, who thinks no farther than how
to execute, what his two base passions,
Fear and Hatred which possess him,
have once made sink into his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and never considers what a wise
man ought to do on this occasion.
It were a folly therefore, for the Duke
to hazard himself in such a manner,
and to be mov'd by so weak a reason,
to loose all in a moment.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderfull to observe, that the
most clear sighted men, who have it in
their power if they will use the means
before them, to avoid that which is call'd
their Destiny, after the misfortune is
happen'd, shou'd suffer themselves to
be drag'd and hurried to it as it were
by force, in spight of their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and their foresight, which their
own rashness, and not a pretended fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:42159:232"/>
renders unprofitable to them.
'Tis reported that the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
confess'd that this dsicourse of <hi>Mandre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi>
carried the greater force of reason,
yet nevertheless he added, that having
gone so far forward as he then was,
if he shou'd see death coming in at the
Windows upon him, he wou'd not
give one step backward to the door,
though by so doing, he were certain
to avoid it. Nevertheless 'tis very
probable, that the incouragement he
had to speak with so much loftiness
and resolution, was the assurance,
which he thought he had, that the
King, whose <hi>Genius</hi> he knew, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
since the day when he enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the Duke gave
himself for lost, wou'd never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
dare to take up so bold a
resolution as to kill him.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that when the <hi>Sieur de
Vins,</hi> one of his greatest Confidents,
had written to him from <hi>Provence,</hi>
that he shou'd beware of keeping so
near the King, and not rely on those
large testimonies of his affection, which
he said he had receiv'd, the Duke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him, that he repos'd not the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:42159:232"/>
hopes of his own safety on the King's
Vertue, whom he knew to be ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,
and a Hypocrite, but on his
Judgment and on his Fear, because it
was not credible, but he must needs
understand, that he himself was ruin'd
in case he made any attempt against
his person. But he learnt at his own
cost, by the unhappy experiment
which he made, that it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for him to have follow'd the wise
advice which was given him, and
which he himself had approv'd, than
a bare conjecture, and the impulse of
his inborn generosity, which his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and lamentable death, as things are
commonly judg'd by their event, has
caus'd to pass in the World for an
effect of the greatest rashness.</p>
            <p>It ought not here to be expected,
that I shou'd dwell on an exact and
long description of all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that tragical action, which has
been so unfortunate to <hi>France,</hi> and so
ill receiv'd in the World. Besides that
they are recounted, in very different
manners, by the Historians of one and
the other Religion, according to their
different passions, and that the greatest
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:42159:233"/>
part of them are either false, or have
little in them worth observation; the
thing was done with so great facility,
and precipitation, and withall, in so
brutal a manner, that it cannot be too
hastily pass'd over: this then is the
plain and succinct relation of it.</p>
            <p>After that the Brave <hi>Grillon, Mestre
de Camp</hi> of the Regiment of Guards
had generously refus'd to kill the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> unless in single Duel, and in
an honourable way, the King had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to <hi>Lognac,</hi> the first Gentleman
of his Chamber, and Captain of the
forty five, who promis'd him eighteen
or twenty of the most resolute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and for whom he durst
be answerable. They were of the
number of those whom the Duke of
<hi>Guise,</hi> who had always a distrust of
those <hi>Gascons,</hi> as creatures of the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> had formerly demanded
that they might be dismiss'd, from
which request he had afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.
Insomuch that it may be said
he foresaw the misfortune that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, without being able to avoid
it. For, on Friday the twenty third
of <hi>December,</hi> being enter'd about
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42159:233"/>
eight of the Clock in the Morning,
into the great Hall, where the King
had intimated on Thursday night,
that he intended to hold the Council
very early, that he might afterwards
go to <hi>Nostre dame de Clery;</hi> some
came to tell him that His Majesty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him in the old Closset, yet he
was not there, but in the other which
looks into the Garden. Upon this,
he arose from the fire side, where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himself somewhat indispos'd, he
had been seated; and pass'd through
a narrow Entry, which was on one
side the Hall, into the Chamber, where
he found <hi>Lognac</hi> with seven or eight of
the forty five: the King himself having
caus'd them to enter into that room
very secretly before day-break: the
rest of them were posted in the old
Closset, and all of them had great
Ponyards hid under their Cloaks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
onely the coming of the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> to make sure work with
him whether it were in the Chamber
or in the Closset, in case he shou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
thither for his defence.</p>
            <p>There needed not so great a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the killing of a single man,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42159:234"/>
who came thither without distrust of
any thing that was design'd against him:
and who holding his Hat in one hand,
and with the other the lappet of his
Cloak, which he had wrapt under his
left Arm, was in no condition of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
In this posture he advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the old Closset, saluting very
civilly as his custome was, those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who made shew of attending
him out of respect, as far as the door.
And as in lifting up the Hangings, with
the help of one of them, he stoop'd to
enter, he was suddenly seiz'd by the
Arms, and by the Legs; and at the
same instant struck into the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with five or six Ponyards, and
from behind, into the Nape of the
Neck, and the Throat, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him from speaking one single
word, of all that he is made to say,
or so much as drawing out his Sword.
All that he cou'd do, was to drag a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
his Murtherers, with the last and
strongest effort that he cou'd make,
strugling and striving till he fell down
at the Beds-Feet, where some while
after, with a deep Groan, he yielded
up his breath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:42159:234"/>
The Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> and Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who were in the
Council Hall, rising up at the Noise,
with intention of running to his aid,
were made Prisoners by the Marshals
<hi>D' Aumont</hi> and <hi>de Retz:</hi> At the same
time the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was also
seiz'd in the Castle, together with
<hi>Anne d' Este</hi> Duchess of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and
Mother of the <hi>Guises,</hi> and the Prince
of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> and
<hi>Nemours, Brissac</hi> and <hi>Boisdauphin</hi> with
many other Lords, who were Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the Duke, and <hi>Pericard</hi> his
Secretary. And in the mean time the
Grand Prevost of the King's House
went with his Archers to the Chamber
of the third Estate, in the Town-House,
and there arrested the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Neuilly,</hi> the Prevost of Merchants,
the Sheriffs <hi>Compan</hi> and <hi>Cotte-Blanch,</hi>
who were Deputies for <hi>Paris,</hi> and
some other notorious <hi>Leaguers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being done, the King himself
brought the News of it to the Queen
Mother, telling her that now he was
a real King since he had cut off
the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> At which that
Princess being much surpris'd and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42159:235"/>
mov'd, asking him if he had made
provision against future accidents, he
answer'd her in an angry kind of tone,
much differing from his accustom'd
manner of speaking to her, that she
might set her heart at rest, for he had
taken order for what might happen,
and so went out surlily to go to Mass;
yet before he went, he sent particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to Cardinal <hi>Gondi,</hi> and to the
Cardinal <hi>Legat Morosini,</hi> and inform'd
them both of what had pass'd, with
his reasons to justify his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Davila</hi> the Historian reports, that
before he went to Mass, the King met
the <hi>Legat,</hi> and walking with him a
long time, gave him all his reasons
for that action, which he takes the
pains to set down at large, as if he had
been present at that long Conference,
and that he had heard, (without loosing
one single word;) all the King said to
the Cardinal, together with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
politique reflexions upon it, and
his reply to the King's discourse. For
he tells us, that the <hi>Legat</hi> fearing to
lesten <hi>Henry</hi>'s affection to the Holy
See, assur'd him that the Pope as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42159:235"/>
a common Father, wou'd listen
favourably to his excuses, and withall
exhorted him to make War against the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> that he might make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of his sincerity, and that
it might be evident, he kill'd not the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the great Enemy of
the Heretiques, out of intention to
favour the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and that
party.</p>
            <p>He adds, that the King promis'd him,
and confirm'd it with an Oath, that
provided the Pope wou'd joyn with
him he wou'd proceed to make War
against them, with more eagerness
than ever, and wou'd not suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er any
other Religion but the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
in his Kingdom. That after this
solemn Protestation, the <hi>Legat</hi>
judg'd it not expedient, to proceed
any farther in the Conference, and
that without saying any thing for the
present in favour of the Prelates who
were Prisoners, he continued to treat
with him in the same manner he had
us'd formerly: There are those also
who are bold enough to affirm, that
by the freedom of his action and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
while he was discoursing with
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:42159:236"/>
the King, sometimes whispering to
him, and sometimes laughing with
him, it was believ'd that the King had
done nothing without the consent and
privity of the Pope: And they add
with <hi>Davila,</hi> that this carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age of the
Cardinal, gave the King encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to proceed yet farther, and to
cause the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> to be also
slain; as observing that he made so
light a matter of the imprisonment of
Prelates.</p>
            <p>You see these Authours have related
with great seriousness and gravity, as an
undoubted truth, the passages of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
which they say was publiquely
beheld, in the Court of the Castle of
<hi>Blois.</hi> Notwithstanding which, 'tis all a
most manifest falsehood; and all that
<hi>Davila</hi> has said in relation to it, is no
better than one of those fictions which
onely Poets have Authority to make.
The proof of this amounts to no less
than a demonstration, and leaves not
a scruple remaining to be satisfi'd. We
have the Printed Memoires of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Morosini's</hi> Life, written in <hi>Italian,</hi>
in an Elegant and Manly style, by
<hi>Monsignor Stephano Cosmi,</hi> Archbishop
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:42159:236"/>
of <hi>Spalato;</hi> who did me the honour
to send them to me from <hi>Venice</hi> more
than three years since. And 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the Letters of this Cardinal
<hi>Legat,</hi> to Cardinal <hi>Montalto,</hi> Nephew
of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth, to whom he
gives a most exact account, of all the
passages on the twenty third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi>
and the following days, that
whatsoever importunity he had us'd
at the request of Madam <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
to obtain an Audience of the King,
on the morning of that day, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance even of the Castle was refus'd
to him, notwithstanding that he us'd
his utmost endeavours at the Gate to
get admission, and that he cou'd never
procure an Audience till the twenty
sixth, which was three days after the
Murther of the Cardinal. After this
what will become of all those fine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and all the particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of that pretended Conference
in the Castle Court, on the twenty
third? and of that easie and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
or rather light behaviour
of the Cardinal to the King, when
he whisper'd in his Ear and laugh'd so
heartily; which gave men occasion
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42159:237"/>
to believe, that according to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from <hi>Rome,</hi> he was of intelligence
with the King, who seeing him so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
dispos'd, was resolv'd to prosecute
his design yet farther, and to rid his
hands of the Cardinal of <hi>Guise?</hi> What
else is this, than to turn History in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Romance; as on this very occasion
two Protestant Writers have also done,
I mean <hi>d' Aubignè,</hi> and the Authour
of the Discourse of that which pass'd
at <hi>Blois,</hi> untill the death of the Duke
of <hi>Guise?</hi> And our <hi>Catholique</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
who have follow'd their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, having suffer'd themselves to
be impos'd on by those <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
have consequently impos'd upon their
Readers. There is so little appearance
that the complaisant Discourses of
the <hi>Legat Morosini,</hi> had given the
King occasion to resolve on the death
of the Cardinal <hi>de Guise,</hi> that you see
on the contrary he refus'd to grant
him an Audience, because he wou'd
not hear what he cou'd urge in favour
of that Cardinal, whose death already
was determin'd.</p>
            <p>In effect, that Cardinal grown des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
by reason of his Brother's death,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42159:237"/>
having utter'd in the first transports of
his grief and fury, all that those passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
cou'd possibly inspire into a man of
his hot temper, in the most opprobrious
and affronting terms he cou'd invent
against the person of the King; that
Prince thereby more incens'd than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and fearing all things from the
revenge of his violent and haughty
Soul, who was almost as formidable
to him as his Brother, Swore he shou'd
die for it. That which provok'd him
more to hold this resolution, was the
report which had been made to him,
that the Cardinal had the impudence
to say, that he shou'd not die, before
he held the King's Head to be shav'd
and made a Monk of him; for these
are the very words of the King in his
Letter of the 24th. of <hi>December,</hi> to
the Marquis <hi>Pisani,</hi> his Ambassadour
at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, they had trouble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to find out men, who wou'd
undertake the Execution of this Order.
Those of the 45 who had Ponyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Duke, refus'd in plain terms
to embrue their hands in the bloud of
a Cardinal, a Priest, and Archbishop
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:42159:238"/>
of <hi>Rheyms.</hi> Yet at last they lighted
on four Souldiers, who not having so
much Honour as those Gentlemen,
offer'd themselves to kill him for four
hundred Crowns, which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
them. So that after the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Cardinal was return'd by little and
little from the extravagance of his
Passion, and had pass'd the remainder of
the day, and the greatest part of the
night following in Prayers, with the
Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in a little Chamber
where they confess'd themselves to each
other, one came to tell him in the
morning about ten of the Clock, that
the King ask'd for him: then having
recommended his Soul to God, and
receiv'd yet once more the benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Archbishop, who believing
that he himself shou'd likewise die,
exhorted him to receive his death
with constancy of mind, and like a
Christian, he went out, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Souldiers who expected him
in an obscure passage, he cover'd his
Face with his Cloak, and leaning his
Body against the Wall, suffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be wounded, with strong
thrusts of their Hallbards, without
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:42159:238"/>
giving the least Groan or sigh, or even
shaking in the least, till he fell down
dead at the Feet of his inhumane Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
            <p>His Body together with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's,
were put into the hands of a
Chirurgeon, who consum'd the Flesh
with unslak'd Lime, and then burn'd
the Bones in a Chamber of the Castle,
that they might not come into the
possession of the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who wou'd
be sure to have us'd them, to inflame
the people who were his Idolaters, and
to have made reliques of them, to
which they wou'd have paid the same
Honours, as are given to the Bones
of Martyrs. Thus perish'd in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of his course, one of the most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
men who ever liv'd; at the
age of 42 years, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who by the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
perfections of his Body, of his
Mind, and of his Soul, which made
him admir'd even by his Enemies,
had merited all that Fortune seem'd to
be preparing for him, had he not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
to have push'd it beyond the
bounds, which the providence of God
to whom it is subservient, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:42159:239"/>
For in conclusion, the following e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
have made it evident, that the
divine providence which disposes So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignly
of Empires, had ordain'd
to take away that of <hi>France,</hi> from the
Family of <hi>Valois,</hi> and to transfer it to
the House of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
whatever was set up in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to this eternal Decree, must fall
under it at last; neither Conspiracies,
nor Leagues, nor Fortune, nor any
power on Earth, being able to resist
it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the violent death
of those Princes, far from bringing
those advantages to the King, which
he had promis'd himself from it, and
which his passion had represented to
him through false optiques, as excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great and most as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur'd, threw
him headlong on the sudden into a
more deplorable condition, than that
which he thought he had escap'd.
He well knew after he had consider'd,
what he had done in cold Bloud, that
the Murther of the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi>
wou'd be extremely offensive to the
Pope, and that it was necessary he
shou'd endeavour to appease him, lest
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42159:239"/>
he who carried all things with a high
hand, and was not of a temper to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the least affront to his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
shou'd declare himself for the
<hi>League</hi> in opposition to him, which as
yet he had not done: In consideration
of which, he writ a Note to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat</hi>
on <hi>Christmas</hi> day, in these very
words which follow.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now at last I am a King, and am
resolv'd from henceforth, not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my self to be affronted: I will
give them to understand, and make
them feel whosoever they are, who
dare to attacque me, that I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
remain in this generous resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
following therein the example
of our Holy Father the Pope, whose
common saying it is, that we must
make our selves be obey'd, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those who injure us. And since
I have accomplish'd my purpose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Maxim, to morrow
I will see you. Farewell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly on the twenty sixth of
<hi>December,</hi> the <hi>Legat</hi> had a long Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
wherein the King having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him of the reasons which he
had to kill the Duke and Cardinal,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42159:240"/>
took God to witness that he had deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within himself, and oppos'd his
own Arguments with all manner of
severity, for six days together; and
during all that time, was firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
not to have come to those extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
for fear of offending Almighty
God. But at length considering that
He who had made him a King, made
it part of his duty to maintain himself
in that Dignity, and that the Pope
had sent him word by <hi>Monsieur de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi>
and had often spoken to the
same purpose to the Cardinal of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi>
that he ought to make himself be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd,
and punish those who affronted
him; he had accordingly resolv'd to
prevent them, by taking their lives,
rather than stay, till his own were
taken by them: the design of which
they had already laid. And if he had
not proceeded by the ordinary forms
of Justice, the reason was, that in the
low condition to which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
him, 'twas impossible to make
use of Law.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Legat,</hi> who had leisure
in the mean time, to consider of what
he ought to say, answer'd, without
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42159:240"/>
mentioning the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s death,
that he thought it his duty to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
him, that supposing the Cardinal
had been guilty, yet his Majesty in
causing him to be put to death as he
had done, had incurr'd the Censures,
contain'd in the Bull, call'd <hi>In Coena
Domini;</hi> as much as those who had
executed his Orders, and either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell'd
or approv'd that action. That
therefore it was his duty to ask pardon,
and absolution of his Sin from the
Pope, who alone was able to give it
him, and in the mean time he ought
to abstain from entring into the
Church.</p>
            <p>The King, surpriz'd exceedingly at
so brisk a declaration, answer'd him,
that there was no Sovereign Prince,
who was not endued with power, to
punish his Ecclesiastical Subjects for
crimes of High Treason, and more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
when his own Life was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in them: for which reason, he
believ'd not that he had incurr'd any
manner of censure, principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have
the privilege to be exempted from
excommunication. 'Tis certain that
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42159:241"/>
he fail'd not on Newyears day to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Devotions, in ceremony with
the Knights of the Order, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
publiquely in the Church of
Saint <hi>Sauveur.</hi> And when the <hi>Legat</hi>
had made complaint concerning it, he
sent to him the <hi>Sieur de Revol,</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State, who shew'd him a Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat
of the 21st. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the year
foregoing, by which the Pope permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to chuse what Confessour he
pleas'd, and who in virtue of that
Breviat, had power to absolve him
from all manner of crimes, even the
most enormous, from all those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cases reserv'd to the Pope's own
person, from all censures and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
punishments, even those which
are contain'd in the Bull which is
call'd <hi>In Coenâ Domini.</hi> And the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
added, that though the King
by virtue of his Privileges had no
need of that Breviat, in order to his
frequenting the Sacraments, yet it was
past all manner of dispute, that having
it, he might communicate without
either scruple or scandal, after having
receiv'd Absolution from his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour.
The <hi>Legat</hi> having nothing to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:42159:241"/>
reply to this, said no more, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
himself with the remonstrance
which he had made.</p>
            <p>But Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> stopt not there, for
he was strangely transported against his
<hi>Legat</hi> whom he accus'd of Cowardise,
because that having seen a Cardinal
Murther'd, he had not publish'd the
censures against the King with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictions,
even though it shou'd
have cost him (as he said) an hundred
Lives. He testifi'd his resentment of
it to the Marquis <hi>de Pisany</hi> the King's
Ambassadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> with much
sharpness, as also to Cardinal <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi>
Protectour of <hi>France,</hi> and yet more
vehemently to the Sacred College in
full Consistory, though the Cardinal
<hi>de Saint Croix</hi> speaking to him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before, had told him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
consulted the Books of the
Doctours on this Subject, he had there
read, that a King who had found a
Cardinal plotting against his Estate,
might cause him to be put to death,
without either form or figure of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and that he had no need of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in such a case. The Pope was
incens'd at this freedom which he took,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42159:242"/>
and loudly protested, that he wou'd
never grant any favour, nor wou'd
suffer any consistorial Remission to
be made, before the King had sent to
beg Absolution, which yet shou'd
not be granted him, till the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
had been throughly examin'd in
a Congregation of Cardinals, which
he establish'd for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The King was very willing, that the
Pope if he so pleas'd, shou'd give him
yet another absolution, which cou'd
have done him no prejudice, though
he believ'd it not to be necessary. But
he wou'd by no means allow that it
shou'd be juridically scann'd, whether
he had the right of punishing his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as he had done. Upon which,
the Cardinal <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of remonstrating to the Pope, with
all the respect which was due to his
Holiness, that the best and most devout
<hi>Catholiques</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> (they are his
very words) held not for authentique
the opinions which were receiv'd at
<hi>Rome,</hi> in that which concerns not the
Doctrine and Tradition of the Church,
(in both which, there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) but
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:42159:242"/>
that in <hi>France,</hi> they held the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
or Rights of the King, to be
much greater than they were thought
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and they believ'd themselves,
to stand on so sure Foundations for
what they held, that they wou'd not
depart from it on any considerations
whatever. That in this particular
Fact, the King wou'd not want most
Zealous <hi>Catholiques</hi> to maintain, that
not onely his Majesty, who has an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial
privilege to stand exempted from
Excommunication, but that also the
meanest man can incur no censures for
having done a thing which is of absolute
necessity, for the preservation of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and of his Life. And that
which way soever it be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
yet his Majesty was absolv'd
by the Authority of his Holiness him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in virtue of the Breviat which he
had granted him.</p>
            <p>To which the Pope made no other
reply than this, that it belong'd to
him to interpret his own Breviat, and
that it ought onely to be understood of
crimes committed, before the Breviat
was given, and not of those which
were committed afterwards. But one
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:42159:243"/>
of the most understanding Prelates of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, had the confidence
to make it appear, by a writing which
was sent to the King, that this Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat
being conceiv'd as it was in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
terms, without any restriction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as well to the future as to the
past. In the mean time, the Pope as
it were by immediate inspiration,
changing his Humour on the sudden,
began to tell the Cardinal, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
the King had great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to doe what he had done; that
God had suffer'd the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi>
and the Duke his Brother, to die in
that manner for their Sins; That the
<hi>League</hi> had ruin'd the affairs of <hi>France,</hi>
and even the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion it
self: That it was at no time lawfull to
take up Arms against the will of the
Sovereign, for it never succeeded hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily:
That he call'd that very Cardinal
to witness what he had formerly told
him concerning this, and that he had
then prophesy'd what since had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal ravish'd with joy to
hear the Pope speak after this manner,
gave him his most humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:42159:243"/>
and earnestly besought
him always to persist in so just an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
without suffering himself to be
impos'd on, by the artifices of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
and the <hi>Leaguers.</hi> But when
he perceiv'd that after all this fair dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
the Pope, according to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
of his temper which was never
to be mov'd, when once he had fix'd
his resolution, still continu'd to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
all the expeditions, till the King
had sent to desire absolution, he had
the courage to tell him plainly, that
this suspension which was prejudicial to
the service of God, the salvation of
Souls, and even to the authority of the
Holy See, cou'd be laid to no other
man's charge, but the whole burthen
of it wou'd fall on the Conscience of
his Holiness. And that all the evils
which arise from the long vacancies
of Churches, wou'd be imputed to
him onely not to the King, who had
done on his part what he ought, by
naming (or presenting) men to
Bishopricks and Abbies according to
the <hi>Concordat,</hi> and that in mean time
they who were thus presented to the
Prelacy, had wherewithall to comfort
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42159:244"/>
themselves easily in their disgrace, by
enjoying their <hi>Oeconomats</hi> a longer
time, without putting themselves to the
trouble of providing and sending to
<hi>Rome</hi> so much money, for obtaining the
Apostolical Provisions. And after all,
it might well happen that the King,
mov'd by the remonstrances of the
<hi>French</hi> Clergy and even of the Estates
themselves, which were still assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Blois,</hi> and also because his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
were refus'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> might
set all things again upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ancient right, in which
case there wou'd be no more trudging
from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely for
the confirmation of three or four pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies,
and those too to be expedited
<hi>gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, this prudent and honest
Cardinal, concluded his long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches
by the advice he gave the
King, that according to the opinion
of the wisest men, and those who
meant him best, the longer he delaid
to send, or write to his Holiness, in
case either of them were his intention,
the more satisfaction he shou'd receive,
provided that his affairs prosper'd at
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42159:244"/>
home. For added he, your Majesty
has nothing more to hope or fear, but
onely from your own management,
and you are to expect that as matters
go well or ill in <hi>France,</hi> you shall be
treated here accordingly. So that to
know how you stand in grace at <hi>Rome,</hi>
you will have no need to be inform'd,
by your Ambassadours dispatches or
by mine, you will find the truest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilligence
from day to day by your
own success.</p>
            <p>The event verifi'd his prediction,
for some time after <hi>Sixtus</hi> perceiving
that the <hi>League</hi> grew exceeding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
and the King much weaker
by the Revolt of the greatest part of
<hi>France,</hi> caus'd a thundering Monitory
to be posted up at <hi>Rome</hi> against him,
in which he declares at the first dash,
that the King had incurr'd the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
provided by the Canons,
for the Murther committed on the
person of a Cardinal.</p>
            <p>The death of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
was yet more ruinous to his affairs,
and produc'd an effect quite contrary
to what he had expected from it. He
believ'd, that having cut off the Head
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:42159:245"/>
of the <hi>League,</hi> it wou'd thenceforth be
no more than a body without life or
motion, and that he shou'd then be
absolute Master and truly a King,
as he had us'd to say. But it was not
long before he found how much he
had deceiv'd himself. His supposition
may come to pass, when a faction is
weak in its beginning, and that they
who are enter'd into it are irresolute,
wavering betwixt their first fury,
which has hurri'd them into a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their fear of a Master justly
incens'd against them, whom they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
see well arm'd, and in condition to
take Vengeance on them, as well as
on their Head, in case they prove obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their revolt. But here all
things were in a contrary posture;
the <hi>League</hi> had taken root so deeply
in the peoples Hearts, that there was
no probability it shou'd be torn out,
at one single pull: and the faction was
too strongly supported both within
the Kingdom and without it, to beget
a reasonable hope that it wou'd easily
be destroy'd. On the other side, that
love and respect, which the <hi>French</hi>
have naturally for their Kings, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42159:245"/>
wholly extinguish'd in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of them, in reference to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the third, who was equally hated
both by <hi>Huguenots</hi> and <hi>Leaguers,</hi> and
so very much despis'd, especially by
the last, that he was not fear'd by any
one.</p>
            <p>Thus instead of arming himself as he
ought in reason to have done, after so
terrible a blow as he had given, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
towards <hi>Paris,</hi> with all the
Forces he either had in readiness, or
cou'd raise immediately, without
giving leisure to the <hi>Leaguers</hi> to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from their first amazement, and
to provide themselves of a new Head
against him, He trifl'd away his time
according to his custome, in making
specious Declarations, and writing fine
Letters which he sent far and near,
wherein amongst other things which
he alledg'd for his justification, he said
(what no body then believ'd, and
what the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> positively
denied to the Cardinal <hi>Legat,</hi>) that
he had receiv'd from that Duke, and
from the Dutchess of <hi>Aumale,</hi> a most
certain information of the Conspiracy
which the two Brothers had contriv'd
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:42159:246"/>
against his person. Doubtless he was
ignorant that having done an action
of this nature, a King can never justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it better, than with his Arms in his
hand, and by putting himself into a
condition of forcing the vanquish'd to
approve his reasons.</p>
            <p>And truly by making such an insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
and verbal Apology, so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the greatness of a King,
he brought his matters to that pass,
that he was neither believed by his
own Subjects, nor by Foreigners.
And was so unfortunate, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Leaguers</hi> but even the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
themselves, and principally
the Gentlemen amongst them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
his action in most reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Language, and thought it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Nation.
In the mean time he was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
that while he was losing his
time in writing and continuing the
Estates, which he held on till three
weeks after the execution, he heard
the news that <hi>Orleans</hi> was revolted
against him; that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
(who was advertis'd at <hi>Lyons</hi> of the
death of his Brothers before <hi>Alphonso
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:42159:246"/>
d' Ornano,</hi> who had been sent either
to make him Prisoner, or to kill him,
cou'd arrive there,) had refug'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Government of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
where he was Master of almost all the
Towns; and especially that <hi>Paris</hi> had
reinflam'd the <hi>League</hi> with more ardour
than before to revenge the death of the
two Brothers.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more prodigious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strange in all this History, than the
transactions in that great City, when
they heard the news of this amazing
accident. The Sixteen, who had it
first, even before the Parliament had
notice of it, (so great was the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Court) commanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
on <hi>Christmas</hi>-Evening, that
they shou'd stand to their Arms in all
the Wards, secur'd all the strong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
plac'd <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> upon the
Bridges, and in the Squares, and put
Souldiers into the Houses of the <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqúes,</hi>
for by that name they call'd
suspected persons, that is to say, all
those who were not carried away by
the Torrent of so hot-brain'd and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a Faction. Afterwards finding
themselves absolute Masters of <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:42159:247"/>
where the People being inrag'd almost
to madness for the murther of the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> were one and all for a
Revolt, they held a General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at the Town-house, where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the opposition which
was made by <hi>Achilles de Harlay,</hi> the
first President, who was in danger of
his life on that occasion, they elected
the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> their Governour,
and made amongst themselves a more
strict Union than ever, for defence, as
they gave out, of their Lives and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion.
In this manner they disguis'd Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
under a specious name; which their
Preachers, and the Doctours of the
<hi>League</hi> baul'd out, and thunder'd
through all <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Preachers, of whom the most
furious were <hi>Pelletier Boucher, Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestre,
Pigenat,</hi> and <hi>Aubry</hi> the Curats,
Father <hi>Bernard de Montgalliard,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd
the <hi>Petit Feuillant,</hi> and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Cordelier Feu Ardent,</hi> Preaching
in the Parishes of <hi>Paris,</hi> during the
<hi>Christmas</hi> Holidays, chang'd their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
into Satyrs against the Sacred
person of the King, and describ'd so
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:42159:247"/>
movingly the Tragical death of the
two Brothers, whom they lifted up
to the Skies as Martyrs, that they
melted their Audience into tears, and
nothing but sighs and groans were
heard in their well-fill'd Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And instead of proposing to them
the example of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
into them the desire of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Insomuch that even they who
were not dispos'd to sob and cry, and
who were even scandaliz'd at this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of behaviour, which was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the holy Ministery of the
Gospel, were constrain'd to act their
parts, and squeeze out tears for fear of
being murther'd, if they had not wept
for company.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that when <hi>Guincestre</hi>
who had Preach'd the <hi>Advent</hi> at St. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomews,</hi>
had said in one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
(after a terrible Declamation
against the King, and lamentation for
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>) that it behov'd
his Auditors to lift up their hands, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man of them, in token that they
wou'd revenge his death, and live and
die in the Holy Covenant, which was
now renewed, the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42159:248"/>
immediately obey'd him, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
onely the first President,<note place="margin">Ann. 1589.</note> who that
day which was the first of the Year
1589, was present at the Sermon in
his Parish Church, seated overagainst
the Preacher. Then that <hi>Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique</hi>
Zealot had the impudence to say
to him, Lift up your hand too like the
rest, you <hi>Monsieur</hi> the first President.
The <hi>Leaguers</hi> had caus'd a report to
be spread, that this excellent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
who was known to be a Loyal
Servant to the King, was one of those
who advis'd the death of the Duke of
<hi>Guise;</hi> for which reason he was of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to obey, lest otherwise he
shou'd indiscreetly expose himself to
the fury of the multitude, who in case
he had refus'd, had absolutely believ'd
the lye which was forg'd against him,
and consequently had torn him piece-meal:
He therefore lifted up his hand,
but to no great height, as an action
that was forc'd from him; upon which
that impudent covenanting Preacher,
had the insolence to bid him lift it
higher, that the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might be satisfi'd, he was under
the same obligation with the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:42159:248"/>
The Curat of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the
fields, <hi>Francis Pigenat,</hi> was yet more
audacious and more impious, than his
brother in iniquity. For, making the
Funeral Oration for the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
in the Parish of St. <hi>Iean en Greve,</hi> (as
it was made in all the Parishes of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and even at the Cathedral of <hi>Nostre
Dame,</hi> with more than Royal pomp
and Ceremonies,) he rose to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of fury, as to ask of his Auditors,
if they cou'd not find one brave Spirit
amongst them all, who wou'd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to revenge the Duke's murther,
by killing the Tyrant? And more to
enrage the People, he spoke in the
person of the Dutchess Dowager to
the late Duke, who was then big with
Child and ready to lie down, and
made her pronounce those terrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
of <hi>Virgil's Dido;</hi> thus imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by him.
<q>

Arise some offspring of my murther'd

            </p>
            <p>These Seditious Preachments occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
infinite disorders: but the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
stroke was given by the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Decree which the Doctors made,
who being blinded with that furious
passion, which possess'd the <hi>League,</hi>
and they leading the blind multitude,
brought them to tumble headlong
with themselves, into that frightfull
gulf of crimes and of misfortunes. The
body of the Town which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of <hi>Leaguers,</hi> to authorize that
horrible revolt which they design'd,
was of opinion to propose to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> not onely by a verbal
request, but by an Authentique Act,
which was sign'd by the Magistrate,
and Seal'd with the Town Seal, these
two important cases of Conscience;
the one was, <hi>Whether the</hi> French <hi>were
effectively discharg'd from the Oath
of Allegiance and Faith, which they
had made to the King?</hi> the other,
<hi>Whether in Conscience they might
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:42159:249"/>
Arm, and unite themselves, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in order to it, they might raise
Money and Contributions for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and preservation of the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
Apostolique <hi>and</hi> Roman <hi>Religion
in</hi> France, <hi>in opposition to the detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
designs and endeavours of the King
and all his Adherents, since he had
violated the publique Faith at</hi> Blois,
<hi>in prejudice of the</hi> Catholique <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Edict of the Holy Vnion, and
the natural liberty of the Estates?</hi> On
which occasion, the Faculty assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
on the Seventh of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> to
the number of <hi>Seventy</hi> Doctors, after
a solemn Procession, and a Mass of the
Holy Ghost, concluded for the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
on both the points by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent, without so much as the
opposition of one man; (as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
it self informs us,) and that this
resolution shou'd be sent to the Pope,
to the end he might approve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it by his Authority, desiring that
he wou'd have the goodness to succour
the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, which suffer'd
under great oppressions.</p>
            <p>To confess the truth, this Decree
gave great scandal; and the <hi>Huguenots</hi>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:42159:250"/>
who were not wanting to report it
word for word, and to make an <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
of it in their Writings, drew a
great advantage from it, to insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our Divines, of whom they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to say that both their Doctrine and
their Morals in this respect, are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite to the word of God, which
teaches us the quite contrary. But 'tis
easie to answer them, by letting them
know, what is most true, namely that
this Decree was pass'd by a faction of
seditious Doctours; <hi>Boucher, Prevost,
Aubry, Bourgoin, Pelletier,</hi> and seven
or eight old Doctors, who were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Leaguers,</hi> and also of the Council
of Sixteen, drew after them by their
Cabals, and by their inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
fifty or threescore Doctors, the
greatest part of whom were those
young, hot-headed, and turbulent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
whom we have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd;
and the rest, in fear of their
lives, if they shou'd dare to oppose them,
assented onely upon compulsion to
this Decree, which the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> it self,
at all times when it was free, has held
abominable, and which Doctor <hi>Iohn
Le Fevre,</hi> at that time Dean of the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:42159:250"/>
Faculty, resisted what he cou'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
gaining any thing upon that wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
faction, which constrain'd him at
last in spight of his opposition, to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it with them.</p>
            <p>In like manner the King, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
extremely of this proceeding,
having Assembled at <hi>Blois</hi> twenty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and twelve Doctors of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
who were of the number of the
Deputies, when that Decree was read
to them, they all concluded without
the least hesitation, that it was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable,
and cou'd never have pass'd
without compulsion, and for safeguard
of their lives from the rage and fury of
the <hi>Parisian Leaguers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
in what manner soever it were
gain'd, yet being of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi>
whose name and authority were had
in singular veneration through all
<hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly in <hi>France,</hi>
that Decree was the Trumpet to the
general Revolt, which was made in
<hi>Paris,</hi> and from thence in a short time
after extended it self through the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of all the Cities in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
For as soon as it was publish'd
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:42159:251"/>
in that great Town, by the most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and giddy-brain'd Preachers of
the <hi>League,</hi> who exalted it to the
People in their declamatory style, they
ran on the sudden into such horrible
extremes, and such transports of rage,
so contrary to the duty of Subjects to
their lawfull Sovereign, that though
our Writers have made them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
yet I believe it more decent
to suppress them, than to profane
my History by a Relation, which
wou'd render it unpleasant, and even
odious.</p>
            <p>I shall onely say, that at the same
time when by virtue of this damnable
Decree, they bereft him of the title of
King, leaving him onely the bare name
of <hi>Henry de Valois,</hi> they heap'd upon
him all sorts of outrages and villanies,
which the impotent fury of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cou'd produce. They vented their
rage against him in Satyrs, Lampoons,
and Libels, infamous Reports and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
and those too in the fowlest
terms, of which the most moderate
were Tyrant and Aposltate. And that
they might not be wanting to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their fury in the most brutal
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:42159:251"/>
manner they cou'd invent; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it even to his Arms, his Statues
and his Pictures, which they tore in
pieces, or trampled under their feet,
or dragg'd about the Streets, through
the mire and dirt, or burn'd them, or
cast them into the River, with a volee
of curses and imprecations against him;
in the mean adoring the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
and his Brother the Cardinal, as Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and placing their Images upon
Altars. At last this blind fury went
so far, that after the Decree, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
and Confessours of the Faction of
Sixteen abusing the power which was
given them by their Sacred Ministry,
of binding and loosing, refus'd Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to those who acknowledg'd
to them in Confession, that their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
wou'd not suffer them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<hi>Henry</hi> the third their lawfull
King.</p>
            <p>This impious practice, was the first
effect that was produc'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the Faculty, the news of which
was receiv'd by the King with much
sadness, at the same time when he was
busied in paying his last duties to the
Queen his Mother, who deceas'd at the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:42159:252"/>
Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> on the fifth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
in the seventy second year of her age,
whether it were out of melancholy for
the death of the <hi>Guises,</hi> which was
upbraided to her by the old Cardinal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> or of a Hectique Fever,
or a false Pleurisie. Certain it is, that
there was no mean or moderation us'd
either in praise or dispraise of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
who indeed has afforded suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
matter to Historians, to speak both
good and ill of her, and either of them
in excess. Both the one and the other
are easie to be discern'd, by what I
have related of her in this History, and
in that of <hi>Calvinism.</hi> I shall onely add
this last touching, to finish her picture,
that it cannot be deni'd but that she was
endued with great perfections of mind
and body; a carriage extremely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestical,
a certain air of Greatness and
Authority, worthy of her high Estate,
her Behaviour noble and engaging, her
Wit polite, her Apprehension prompt,
her Judgment piercing, a great ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for Business and Treaties, and a
singular address of managing and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others to her own bent; a Royal
Magnificence, Constancy and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:42159:252"/>
of mind, extraordinary in her
Sex, a masculine courage and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Soul, which naturally carri'd
her to the highest undertakings: In
one word, she might have pass'd for a
Heroine, if so many illustrious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
had not been blasted by great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which appear'd so openly in all her
conduct, that History neither ought,
nor is able to dissemble them.</p>
            <p>For it was but too apparent, for her
honour, what prodigality, what luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
what shamefull dissoluteness she
permitted in her Court; and which
she her self made use of for gaining
such whom she desir'd to engage in her
interests. Add to this her want of
sincerity and faith in her promises, the
too much credit she gave to Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Fortune-tellers, whom she
consulted in reference to the future,
and above all her immoderate and vast
ambition, on the account of which,
and out of her insatiable desire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always absolute, she made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to sacrifice the interests of the State
and of Religion, both which she had
almost ruin'd, by wavering betwixt
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and <hi>Catholiques,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:42159:253"/>
seeming to be on one side, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on the other, according as this
or that Religion appear'd most condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to her designs. In fine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
her character, by what relates
to the essential part of this History,
the hatred which she bore to the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> her Son-in-law, and the
love which she had to her Grand-son
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> caus'd her underhand to
favour the <hi>League,</hi> of which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
she was the gull, and was
cousen'd by those whom she intended
to deceive. For she had this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
which commonly happens to
those who wou'd manage two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Factions, and poize themselves
Trimmer-like betwixt them, that
she was in a manner equally hated
both by the <hi>Catholiques</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was this Princess, whose good
and ill qualities were in extremes.
Yet happy both in relation to God and
man. For she di'd at a time, when
the World believ'd her life wou'd be
profitable and indeed necessary for the
King, to draw him out of that Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of confusions wherein he was
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:42159:253"/>
entangl'd; and also because she di'd
with all the serenity of a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
having first receiv'd the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with much devotion, though
the <hi>Huguenot</hi> Historians, who naturally
hated her, have written to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And because she was not less
abhorr'd by the <hi>Leaguers</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> (who
believ'd she had a share in the death
of the <hi>Guises,</hi> as others also have thought
therein following the relation, which
was written by <hi>Miron</hi> the Physician,)
they said publiquely that if her Body
shou'd be brought to <hi>Paris</hi> to be laid
in the magnificent Tomb which she
had built at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> for her self and
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second her Husband,
they wou'd certainly throw it into the
<hi>Seine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the King who was
still of opinion that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to their obedience by the ways
of clemency and mildness, sent thither
the Dutchess of <hi>Nemours,</hi> mother of
the <hi>Guises</hi> and of the young Duke of
<hi>Nemours,</hi> their Brother by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
side, who had made his escape,
not long after he had been imprison'd
by the King. That Princes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who was
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:42159:254"/>
very prudent, preferring the benefits
of Peace before the unprofitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of her Childrens death, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to treat by Letter with the Dukes
of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Mayenne,</hi> her two
remaining Sons, endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them by gentle means, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them all the advantages and all the
security which they possibly cou'd
wish: which gave the King occasion
to believe, that in the end she might
conquer their resentments, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the commotions in <hi>Paris.</hi> He
was willing also that she shou'd be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd
by the Sheriffs <hi>Compan</hi> and
<hi>Cotteblanche;</hi> who promis'd him to
use their best endeavours to that effect;
or to return to Prison in <hi>Blois,</hi> if they
succeeded not in their negotiation;
and at the same time sent his express
order to the Parliament to inroll the
Declaration which he had publish'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the execution at <hi>Blois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutchess was receiv'd at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
with great honour, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
joy of the people; who paid their
veneration to her, as to the Mother
of two Holy Martyrs. And the <hi>Petit
Feuillant</hi> Preaching one day before her,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42159:254"/>
flew out into so high a transport, that
turning himself towards her, he made
an <hi>Apostrophé</hi> to the late Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> in these words; O Holy and
Glorious Martyr of God, blessed is the
Womb that bore thee, and the Breasts
that gave thee suck. But after all she
succeeded not in her negotiation.
The two Sheriffs forswore themselves,
and joyn'd with the Factious, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their former practice: And
upon the request (the original of which
is kept in the Library of <hi>Monsieur Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and which I have seen sign'd by
forty eight of the principal Citizens,)
a prohibition was made them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Blois;</hi> and the Oath which they
had taken, was declar'd Null, by an
order of the New Parliament, which
the <hi>Leaguers</hi> set up, after they had
broken the old one, by one of the
most Horrible Encroachments, which
was ever made upon the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>For the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> and the
Council of Sixteen, having that
August Body in suspicion, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Members of which, were Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
devoted to the King's service,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42159:255"/>
resolv'd to take them into custody,
and all the other Officers whom they
distrusted. <hi>Iean Le Clerc,</hi> otherwise
call'd <hi>Bussy,</hi> heretofore a <hi>Procureur</hi> in
Parliament, one of the most heady and
impudent fellows that ever breath'd,
and whom the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> well
knowing him to be a desperate <hi>Leaguer,</hi>
had made Governour of the <hi>Bastille,</hi>
demanded and obtain'd that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
which he executed on the
sixteenth of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> For in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possessing himself of the Palace-Gates,
he enter'd, arm'd <hi>Cap a pie,</hi>
into the great Chamber at eight of
the Clock, where the Parliament was
assembled, and told them, that the
good <hi>Catholiques</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> had given
him in charge to present them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
Afterwards having put it into
the hands of one of the Members, he
retir'd to the <hi>Parquet des Huissiers</hi>
where his men waited for him. The
Request was this in substance, That it
wou'd please that Court to unite it
self with the <hi>Prevost</hi> of <hi>Merchants,</hi> the
Sheriffs, and the good Citizens of
<hi>Paris,</hi> for the defence of Religion, and
of the Town. That in conformity to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42159:255"/>
the Decree of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> it wou'd
declare that the <hi>French</hi> were discharg'd
from their Oath of Allegiance and
Obedience to the King, and that they
wou'd use his name no more in their
Orders.</p>
            <p>This was the way which that Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
took, to lay hold of an occasion,
which he knew wou'd be specious and
popular, under the shadow of which
he might use the Parliament as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he did; for he knew full well,
that they wou'd never confirm a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
so impious as was that of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne.</hi>
This is a passage which all of
our Historians have omitted, and
which I learn'd from the Manuscript
Journal which the famous <hi>M. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Loysel,</hi> an Advocate in Parliament,
who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> left to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for their instruction. It was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
communicated to me by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Ioly</hi> his Grandson, Chanter of
the Church of <hi>Nostre Dame,</hi> a man
commendable for his Integrity and
Learning, and to whom the Chapter
of the Metropolitane of <hi>Paris</hi> is much
acknowledging, for his rare Library
which he has bestow'd on it. This,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:42159:256"/>
then, was the snare which <hi>Bussy Le
Clerc</hi> laid for the Parliament, thereby
to pick an occasion of treating them
with the most unworthy usage which
they cou'd possibly receive.</p>
            <p>For without expecting an answer to
his insolent request, finding that they
debated it much longer than he thought
fitting, he return'd into the great
Chamber, with his Sword in his hand,
follow'd by five and twenty or thirty
men arm'd Breast and Back, and with
Pistols; and after having told them at
the first, that the business was delay'd
too long, and that it was well known,
that there were those amongst them
who betray'd the Town, and held
correspondence with <hi>Henry de Valois,</hi>
he added, that he had order to secure
them; and commanded with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
voice, that they whom he
shou'd name, shou'd immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, if they had a mind to avoid
worse usage. At which, when look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over his list, he had nam'd the
first President <hi>Achilles de Harlay,</hi> the
Presidents <hi>de Blanc Mesnil Potier,
de Thou,</hi> and the most ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
all the rest rose up, as by
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:42159:256"/>
common consent, protesting that they
wou'd not abandon their Head; whom
they follow'd to the number of about
threescore, of all the Chambers, walking
two and two after <hi>Bussy Le Clerc,</hi> who
led them as it were in triumph through
an infinite multitude of people to the
<hi>Bastille;</hi> where those of them onely
were imprison'd who were known
to be inviolably faithfull to the
King's service.</p>
            <p>The most considerable of them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
as well as dignity, was the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles
de Harlay,</hi> whom to name is to
commend; a Magistrate every way
accomplish'd, and of that illustrious
house, which having for four hundred
years together signaliz'd it self in Arms,
has since added to that glory all that
can be acquir'd by the highest prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the long Robe, and of the
Church.</p>
            <p>I shou'd be ungratefull to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
if I did not justice to the merit
of those Senatours, who follow'd their
Head; and if I made not their names
known to posterity which are not
found in our Historians, but which I
have collected from the forementioned
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:42159:257"/>
Manuscripts of <hi>Monsieur Loysel</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
who knew them all. Besides
the Presidents already nam'd, the
Counsellours who were imprison'd in
the <hi>Bastille</hi> with them, were <hi>Chartier,
Spifame, Malvault, Perrot, Fleury,
Le Viry, Molé, Scarron, Gayant, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
Iourdain, Forget, Herivaux, Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebu,
Du Puy, Gillot, de Moussy, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Godard, Fortin, Le Meneur,</hi> and
the <hi>Sieur Denis de Here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This last was a man of Wit, and
of Quality, one of the most resolute
of the whole Company; who from a
warm <hi>Leaguer,</hi> (as formerly he had
been, out of an ill guided Zeal,) was
now become a great servant of the
King; having discovered at last the
pernicious designs of the <hi>League;</hi> of
whose extraordinary merit <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth, after his conversion, made
great account. Insomuch that he had
the credit to get his name struck out
of the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> in which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of that witty Satyr, had plac'd
it but little to his advantage. For
whereas in the first Edition, of the
year 1594. <hi>Machaut</hi> and <hi>Here</hi> were
nam'd as great sticklers for the <hi>League;</hi>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:42159:257"/>
in all the rest of the Editions we find
<hi>Machaut</hi> and <hi>Baston.</hi> That hot-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Baston,</hi> who was so furious a <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,</hi>
that he sign'd the Covenant with
his own bloud drawn from his hand,
which remain'd lame after it; and
who, after <hi>Paris</hi> was reduc'd to the
King's service, chose rather to go out
of it with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and retire to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> where he di'd sterv'd, than
to stay in <hi>France,</hi> and live at his ease
under the Government of his lawfull
King. Thus you have the names of
those Loyal MEN WORTHY of
the Parliament, who were clapt up
in the <hi>Bastille</hi> with their first Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>There were others of them whose
names I cou'd not recover, but who
well deserve to be known, and had in
veneration by the world. The rest
of them whether they turn'd <hi>Leaguers</hi>
for company, or seem'd to turn for
fear of Death, or that by such their
dissimulation, they thought they
might put themselves in a way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King some considerable service,
having engag'd to be faithfull to that
party, were left at their liberty, and
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:42159:258"/>
continued in their stations, with the
President <hi>Brisson,</hi> who from the next
morning began to sit and take the
Chair as Head of the new Parliament
of the <hi>League,</hi> with which it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
he held correspondence, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to procure himself this new dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
An action much unworthy of
a man who had so high a reputation
for his rare learning, who ought rather
to have lost his life, than to have so
basely abandon'd his King, and to have
made himself a Slave to the passions of
his mortal Enemies, under pretence
that all he did was onely to shelter
himself from the violence of the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as he privately protested. But so
it is, that the greatest Clerks are not
always the wisest Men; and that good
sense accompanied with constancy of
mind, and an unshaken fidelity in our
duty, is imcomparably more usefull to
the Service of God and of the State,
than all the knowledge of Books and
Learning of Colleges, huddled together
in a Soul without integrity and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>And truly, it manifestly appear'd,
that all these good qualities were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42159:258"/>
to this pretended Parliament, at
that time; for about nine or ten days
after that action, all the Members of
it, to the number of an hundred and
twenty, (comprehending in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Princes and the Prelates,)
swore upon the Crucifix, that they
wou'd never depart from their <hi>League,</hi>
and that they wou'd prosecute by all
manner of ways their revenge for the
death of the two <hi>Guises;</hi> against all
those who were either Authours of it,
or accomplices in it. This protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which was dispatch'd away to all
the Towns that held for the party of
the <hi>League,</hi> increas'd the fury of the
people, who every day grew worse
and worse, even to that degree, that
some of them by an abominable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Sacrilege, Paricide, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Enchantments, made Images of
Wax resembling the King, which they
plac'd upon the Altars, and prick'd them
in divers parts, pronouncing certain
Diabolical words at every one of the
forty Masses which they caus'd to be
said in many Churches, to make their
charms more powerfull; and at the
fortieth, they pierc'd the image to the
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42159:259"/>
heart, as intending thereby to give their
King the stroke of death.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time their <hi>Bedlam
Guincestre</hi> shewing in the midst of his
Sermon, certain little Silver Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
made an hundred years before,
and curiously cast into the shape of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
carrying Flambeaus, which had
been found amongst the rich ornaments
of the <hi>Capuchins</hi> Oratory, and the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes</hi>
of the <hi>Bois de Vincennes</hi> lately
plunder'd by the Rabble, accus'd the
King himself of Sorcery, saying, that
those were the Idols, and the figures of
those Devils to which <hi>Henry de Valois</hi>
was accustom'd to Sacrifice, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
to <hi>Bois de Vincennes;</hi> and
that they had commanded him to
murther the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of their Faith. But that which
gave the mortal blow to the Royal
Authority, and settled the Revolt in
Absolute power, by giving it a kind of
regular form of a popular Government,
or rather of an Aristocracy, against the
fundamental law of the <hi>French</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
was the arrival of the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:42159:259"/>
'Tis true that Prince was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with all those great and Heroique
qualities, which rais'd the admiration
of the World in the person of his elder
brother the late Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi> but if
we consider him in himself, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comparing him to the former,
whose merit being incomparably grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and his actions more glorious,
wou'd certainly obscure him, it must
be said, if we will do him right, that
he had as much spirit, as much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
wisedom, moderation, since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and probity, as was necessary for
him, to maintain an honourable place
amongst the great men of his time:
but not so much resolution, constancy,
greatness of Soul, vigour, activity and
good fortune, as he ought to have had
for the sustaining of so powerfull a
party as that, which he took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Head, in opposition to two
Kings.</p>
            <p>On the one side he was strongly
solicited by the Council of Sixteen,
and by the Dutchess of <hi>Montpensier</hi>
his Sister, to come and take the place
of his dead Brother, and to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the head of those, who were all
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42159:260"/>
in a readiness to obey his orders, and
to give up themselves to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
and on the other side he had
receiv'd the King's Letters, which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
him in most obliging terms, that
being as fully perswaded of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
as he was convinc'd of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
crimes, he was ready to give him
all the part he cou'd desire both in his
favour, and his bounty, provided that
he still continu'd in that obedience and
fidelity, which he ow'd him.</p>
            <p>But the extreme grief he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
for the cruel treatment of his
Brothers, after so many promises, and
such solemn protestations, that all past
actions shou'd be forgotten, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he thought his honour
impos'd on him to revenge their death;
and more than all, the distrust he had
of the King, which was insuperable in
him, whose fair words he took for no
security, after so horrible an action,
made him at last resolve to take up
Arms, though he was not naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to rashness, and to precipitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
blindfold, into such an Abyss of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and confusions, as are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from Civil Wars. He thought he
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:42159:260"/>
shou'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind much less security in the
King's word and honour, than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
unconstant and variable as she
is; and that he ran not so much hazard
in declaring himself openly his Enemy,
as in trusting to his Promises and Oaths.
So that at the first, it was neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
nor ambition, but onely distrust,
which hurri'd him as it were by force
into the Civil Wars; and he had never
expos'd himself to so manifest a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being ruin'd, but that he imagin'd
that by not hazarding himself, he had
been ruin'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the beginning of
his unhappy Enterprize, was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prosperous: He march'd from
<hi>Dijon,</hi> with many Troups, which he
had drawn out of his Government of
<hi>Bourgog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> and of <hi>Champaign,</hi> which
declar'd generally for the <hi>League,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
onely <hi>Chaälons,</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
of which place having receiv'd
information of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s
death before the <hi>Sieur de Rone,</hi> whom
that Duke had there establish'd Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
constrain'd him immediately to
depart out of it: And as a River swells
and enlarges its chanels, the farther
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:42159:261"/>
it flows from its Spring, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it approaches to the Sea; so the
Forces of this new Head of the <hi>League</hi>
increas'd on his march, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of those whom his own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the memory of the late Duke his
Brother, the common hatred to the
King, the example of <hi>Paris,</hi> the false
Zeal of Religion, and above all, the
Interest and desire which many had
to make their advantage of these
troubles, drew to him in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
through which he pass'd; and all
the Towns, as it were in Emulation
of each other, open'd their Gates for his
reception.</p>
            <p>He was receiv'd at <hi>Troyes,</hi> with the
same Honours which are peculiar to
Kings; and he acted there as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Prince; from thence sending
out his Commissions to the Creatures
of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and especially

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:42159:261"/>
like a Conquerour into <hi>Orleans;</hi> where
the fame alone of his coming, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
the Royalists to surrender the
Cittadel to the Townsmen who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
it. He made himself Master of
<hi>Chartres</hi> by the intelligence which
he held there: where the people
changing on the sudden, as it were by
Enchantment, were become quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort of creatures than they were
formerly, when the King retir'd thither
after the Barricades, and where they
receiv'd him with wonderfull acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Thus cover'd with glory, and now
becoming much more haughty than
his nature seem'd to allow, by reason
of so many prosperous events, which
appear'd like good Omens of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he enter'd on the twelfth of
<hi>February</hi> into <hi>Paris,</hi> where as if the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had been rais'd from
the dead in his person, there was a
loose given to all publique demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of joy, with so much transport
and excess, that they proceeded so far
as even to expose his Picture Crown'd,
and to erect a Royal Throne for him;
and if he had had ambition and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:42159:262"/>
enough to have accepted it, he
had found perhaps enow to have
acknowledg'd him, that they might
have held under him those Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he cou'd have given them,
with the titles of Dutchies, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in homage, as <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> had
given him the example. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were, that he durst not attempt
it out of fear, or wou'd not out of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as foreseeing in it insuperable
difficulties, which by his endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have risen higher, had thrown
him down from the steep of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice;
certain it is, that by refusing
to accept that honour, which yet in
the sequel he desir'd not any other
shou'd possess, he sav'd the State, and
besides his present intention, or rather
against it, preserv'd the Crown to the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> who was the rightfull
presumptive Heir of it.</p>
            <p>He satisfi'd himself then, with esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
his own authority in the first
place; and with rendring himself more
powerfull than the Council of the
<hi>League,</hi> compos'd of those famous
forty, amongst which, were the most
seditious Mutineers of the whole party,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:42159:262"/>
who, whatsoever protestation they made
to obey him, had carri'd all matters in
Council against him, and had not fail'd,
whensoever it had pleas'd them, to
have given the Law to him. To this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
he weaken'd that Council by aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
it to a greater number of the
most qualifi'd of the party, on whom
he knew he might safely rely, as being
of his own Election. For under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that it was necessary, that this
Assembly, which ought to be the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council of the Union, shou'd be
inlarg'd, and be authoriz'd by the
whole Party, he caus'd an Order to be
pass'd, that all the Princes might assist
in it, whensoever they pleas'd, and
that all the Bishops, the Presidents,
the Procureurs, and the Advocates
General of Parliaments, fifteen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
whom he nam'd, the Prevost of
Merchants, the Sheriffs, the Town
Solicitor, and the Deputies of the
three Orders of all the Provinces of
the <hi>League,</hi> shou'd have places in it, and
deliberative Votes.</p>
            <p>Thus being always the strongest in
that Assembly, by the great number of
voices, which were for him, he caus'd
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:42159:263"/>
whatsoever he pleas'd to pass, in spig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
of the Sixteen; and procur'd an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to himself, near approaching to
the Soveraign Power of a King. For
the first thing which was order'd in this
new Council, was that in sign of this
absolute Dominion, which either they
suffer'd him to take, or they gave him,
he shou'd have from thenceforth, till
the holding of the Estates, the most
extraordinary and unexampled quality
of Lieutenant General, not of the
King, for the <hi>League</hi> acknowledg'd
none at that time, but of the Estate,
and Crown of <hi>France.</hi> As if he who
commands and governs cou'd represent
a Kingdom, and hold, in quality of
Lieutenant, the place of an Estate,
which is not that which governs, but
what is, or ought to be govern'd.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which, he took his
Oath for that new fantastique dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
on the thirteenth of <hi>March</hi> in the
Parliament, which verifi'd the Letters
Patents of it, under the new Seals,
made instead of those of the King,
which were broken by them. And,
to begin the Exercise of his Office by
an act of Soveraignty, he caus'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:42159:263"/>
to be publish'd his new
Laws, contain'd in one and twenty
Articles, for the uniting under one
form of Government, all the Towns
which were enter'd into the <hi>League;</hi>
and those which in process of time
shou'd enter, the number of which in
a short space grew very great. For,
there is nothing more surprising, than
to see with what rapidity that torrent
of Rebellion spreading from the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
City into the Provinces, drew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it the greatest Towns,
which under pretence of revenging
the death of the pretended Patrons of
the Faith, and of preserving Religion,
associated themselves against God's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
either to make themselves a
new Master, or to have none at all.</p>
            <p>Almost all the Towns of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
of <hi>Champaign,</hi> of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and of the
Isle of <hi>France,</hi> the greater part of
those of <hi>Normandy, Mayne, Bretagne,
Anjou, Auvergne, Dauphine, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,
Berry,</hi> and the greatest Cities
of the Kingdom next to <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Roüen,
Lyons, Tholouse,</hi> and <hi>Poitiers,</hi> had
put themselves under the protection
of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> and were members of
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:42159:264"/>
it, before the end of <hi>March,</hi> and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
place were committed the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
as were at <hi>Paris.</hi> But princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> where the furious
Rabble having set upon the first Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Duranti,</hi> and <hi>Daphis</hi> the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
General, two men of great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
singular Vertue, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
fidelity to the King's Service,
Massacred them in the open Street.
After which their faculty of Divines,
confirm'd the decree of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi>
which was propos'd in a general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
at the Town-House, by which
they authoris'd the Revolt.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of <hi>Provence,</hi> had
also thrown it self with the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity
into the <hi>League,</hi> under the
leading of the famous <hi>Hubert de Garde
Sieur de Vins,</hi> who by his courage
and extraordinary Valour, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with his great prudence, and the
wonderfull talent he had, of gaining
the affections of the people, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
more reputation and power
than any Gentleman not supported by
the Royal Authority had ever obtain'd
in his own Countrey. He had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
sav'd the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:42159:264"/>
Third at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> when that Prince
who was then but Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
too near to a Retrenchment,
a Souldier who had singled him out
from all the rest, had just taken aim
at him, which the <hi>Sieur de Vins</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
threw himself before him,
in the Bullets way, and receiv'd the
Musquet shot, which wanted little of
costing him his Life. He expected
as he had reason, some great prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Duke when he was
King, in recompence of so generous
an action, but perceiving that all was
play'd into the Minions hands, without
so much as taking the least notice of
his worth, the indignation of being
slighted, caus'd him to enter into the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Interests, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the <hi>League,</hi> (of which he was
Head in <hi>Provence,</hi>) the Count of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
his Uncle, his Brother-in-Law the
Count <hi>de Sault,</hi> a great part of the
Nobility, and the Parliament of <hi>Aix,</hi>
as also to expose the whole Province
to the manifest danger of being lost,
by calling in the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
nevertheless was constrain'd at last,
to retire with shame into his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:42159:265"/>
In the mean time, the King who
from time to time receiv'd the unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
News of the Rebellion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
had been forc'd to send back the
Deputies of the Estates to their several
Provinces, where the greatest part of
them being hot <hi>Leaguers,</hi> blew up
the Fire to that height, that he was
constrain'd at the length to lay aside
the ways of Clemency and Mildness,
and to take up, (though somewhat of
the latest,) those of Rigour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion.
He began by sending a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald
to <hi>Paris,</hi> who bore an Injunction
to the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> the pretended
Governour, immediately to depart the
Town; an Interdiction to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Exchequer, and the
Court of <hi>Aydes,</hi> with prohibition to
all other Officers, of any farther exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their employments; But he
was remanded, without an hearing,
loaded with affronts, and threatn'd
with an Halter, if he presum'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
on such an Errant.</p>
            <p>He declar'd the Dukes of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
and <hi>Aumale,</hi> the Citizens of <hi>Paris, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,
Amiens, Abbeville,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Associated Towns, to be guilty
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:42159:265"/>
of High Treason, if within a time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd,
they return not to their Duty.
He transferr'd the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi>
to <hi>Tours,</hi> and all the Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which were in the Cities of the
<hi>League</hi> to other Towns, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
faithfull to him. But they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being concern'd at his angry De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations,
reveng'd themselves in all
places, on such as were of the Royal
Party, by all manner of ill usage. He
did in the month of <hi>March,</hi> what he
ought to have done in <hi>December:</hi> He
call'd together his Gendarmery, and
Rendevouz'd what Forces he cou'd
raise in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Tours;</hi>
to which place he had retir'd, as not
thinking himself secure in so open and
weak a Town as <hi>Blois;</hi> but first he
secur'd his Prisoners, whom he caus'd
to be carried from the Castle of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise,</hi>
and distributed them into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prisons. But the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
who over-powr'd him in men, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
upon the point of coming out
from <hi>Paris</hi> with a strong Army, with
a resolution of preventing his designs,
and assaulting him in <hi>Tours.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that consideration it was, that he
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:42159:266"/>
was forc'd to resolve upon the onely
way, which remain'd for his Shelter,
from the last extremities of Violence,
and for the preservation of his Crown
and Person. <hi>France</hi> at that time was
in a most deplorable condition, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and as it were broken into three
Parties, which laid it waste. That of
the <hi>League</hi> the most powerfull of any,
by the Rebellion of so many Towns:
that of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which
had greatly strengthen'd it self, dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first troubles; and that of the
King, which in a manner was reduc'd
to his own Houshold, and some very
few depending Towns. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him in this condition to
carry on the War, which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and
at the same time, to maintain himself
against the Army of the <hi>Leaguers.</hi> It
remain'd then, that of necessity he
must close with one of those Parties,
that by its assistance he might reduce
the other to Obedience, or at least
that he might save himself from ruine,
which was inevitable, if he stood
single and expos'd to the violence of
the other two. Now the <hi>Leaguers</hi>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:42159:266"/>
wou'd neither admit of Peace nor Truce
with him, having Sworn in the Oath,
which was administer'd to them by
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> that they wou'd
prosecute their Vengeance to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
for the death of the two
<hi>Guises.</hi> 'Tis manifest by consequence,
that he was indispensably oblig'd, to
unite himself with the King of <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
and to accept the aid he offer'd
him, with so much frankness and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity.</p>
            <p>After the death of the <hi>Guises,</hi>
that Prince making his advantage of
so favourable an opportunity, while
all things were in confusion amongst
the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> had much advanc'd
the affairs of his Party, by taking of
<hi>Niort, Saint Maxent, Maillezais,</hi> and
some other Towns in <hi>Poitou,</hi> since
when, upon his quick recovery from
a dangerous Sickness whereof he was
like to die, he had push'd his conquests
as far as the Frontiers of <hi>Touraine,</hi>
having made himself Master of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,
Thouars, Montreiuil Bellay, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebeau,
Lisle Bouchard, Chastelleraud,
Argenton,</hi> and of <hi>Blanc</hi> in <hi>Berry.</hi> At
which time, observing the wretched
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42159:267"/>
Estate to which the Kingdom was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
by the three Parties which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
it, he publish'd a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the fourth of <hi>March,</hi> address'd
to the three Estates of <hi>France,</hi> therein
exhorting them to Peace, which was
the onely remedy for so many distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as afflicted the miserable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Then, having clearly prov'd, that
it was impossible for the King to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in a Civil War, to be prosecuted
as some advis'd him, at the same time
against the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and <hi>Leaguers,</hi>
he offer'd him his Service, and all the
Forces of his Party, not for bringing
the <hi>Leaguers</hi> and the Revolted Towns
to punishment, but for reducing
them to the terms of desiring Peace,
which he most humbly petition'd him
to grant them, and to pardon and pass
by the injuries he had receiv'd, after
they had been subdu'd by the joint
Forces of all good <hi>French-men,</hi> both of
the one Religion and the other; march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the conduct of his Majesty
against Rebels. After which, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
in the sight of God, and ingag'd
his Faith and Honour, that forasmuch
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:42159:267"/>
as that union of his most faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as well <hi>Catholiques</hi> as Protestants
was onely intended, to restore the
Royal Authority, and Peace in <hi>France,</hi>
he wou'd never permit that the <hi>Roman
Catholique</hi> Faith, shou'd receive the least
prejudice in consideration of it, but
that it shou'd always be preserv'd in
such Towns as shou'd be taken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any alteration of Religion
in them.</p>
            <p>This Declaration made way for the
Treaty, which was begun with great
secrecy, immediately after it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the Union of the two Kings.
There were some in the Council who
endeavour'd to oppose that Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as fearing that it wou'd much
fortify the Party of the <hi>League,</hi> by
contributing to the belief of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
which was already spread by
the <hi>Leaguers</hi> amongst the people, that
the King had always maintain'd a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Correspondence with the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots;</hi>
besides, that the Pope whose Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
was necessary, wou'd be scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis'd
at such an Union. The King
himself had a great repugnance to it,
and doubtless wou'd much rather have
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:42159:268"/>
compounded his differences with the
Princes of the <hi>League,</hi> if it had been
possible, and thereby to have renew'd
his Edict of Reunion, a thing not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who
easily perceiv'd that the Court wou'd
never apply to him, but for want of
others.</p>
            <p>In effect, the King in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>March,</hi> had written to the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and had sent him
very advantageous conditions for the
Princes of his House, with all manner
of Security for them, in case he cou'd
prevail with them, to receive the
Peace and Treaty which he offer'd.
But being refus'd on that side, those
of his Council, who were of opinion
that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shou'd be accepted, inforc'd so far
their strongest Argument, which was
pure Necessity, farther alledging the
examples of so many <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings
and Princes, who like the great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Theodosius</hi> made use of In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idels
and Heretiques against their Enemies,
that the King at last consented to set
on foot the Treaty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:42159:268"/>
It was concluded at <hi>Tours</hi> on the
third of <hi>April,</hi> by the <hi>Sieur du Plessis-Mornay,</hi>
who capitulated on the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s behalf, on these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
That the said King, during the
Truce which was made for one year,
shou'd serve the King with all his
Forces: That he shou'd have a passage
on the <hi>Loyre,</hi> which at length was
declar'd to be the Town of <hi>Saumur;</hi>
after some difficulties which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
concerning the trusting it in
his hands. That he shou'd therein
have the free exercise of his Religion,
and in some other little Towns, which
were left to him by way of caution,
for his reimbursment of his charges in
the War.</p>
            <p>This Negotiation of <hi>Du Plessis,</hi> cou'd
not be transacted with so much Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
but that it was vented by the
<hi>Legat Morosini,</hi> who thereupon us'd
his utmost endeavours in three vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Remonstrances to hinder that
blow, which he believ'd wou'd be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to Religion, according to the false
notions which he had of the King of
<hi>Navarre.</hi> And the King having told
him, that after having tri'd all ways
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:42159:269"/>
of accommodation with the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> which that Prince had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
haughtily rejected, necessity
compell'd him to make use of the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remaining means to defend his Life;
the <hi>Legat</hi> earnestly besought him to
allow him ten days more, that he
might have opportunity of treating in
person with that Duke, whom he
hop'd he shou'd be able to prevail with,
to accept those advantageous terms of
Peace, which were presented him.
Though the Treaty was not onely
concluded, but also sign'd, as appears
by the Memoires of <hi>Du Plessis Mornay,</hi>
yet the King to make it evident, that
it was onely through necessity, that
he enter'd into this Union with the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> against the <hi>League,</hi> was
consenting that before the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, there shou'd be made
a last attempt on the inclinations of
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> to induce him
to a reconcilement. To this effect, he
gave in writing to the <hi>Legat</hi> the same
Articles, which he had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and
which were as advantageous to his
Family, as he cou'd reasonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="473" facs="tcp:42159:269"/>
For there was offer'd to the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> his Government of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
with full power of placing such
Governours in the Towns, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shou'd chuse; of disposing all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Offices, and levying on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
forty thousand Crowns yearly.
To the young Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
the Government of <hi>Champaigne,</hi>
with two Cities at his choice, therein
to keep what Garrisons he pleas'd,
twenty thousand Crowns of Pension,
and thirty thousand Livres of Income
in Benifices for his Brother. To the
Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> the Government of
<hi>Lyons,</hi> with a Pension of ten thousand
Crowns; to the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> the
Government of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in that Province; to the Duke of
<hi>Elbeuf</hi> a Government, and five and
twenty thousand Livres of Pension;
and what was of greatest importance
for that Family, to the Marquis <hi>du
Pont,</hi> eldest Son of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi>
the Government of <hi>Toul, Metz</hi>
and <hi>Verdun,</hi> with assurance, that if
his Majesty had no Issue Male, those
three Bishopricks shou'd remain to the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> To all which, the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42159:270"/>
King caus'd this addition to be made,
that to remove all difficulties, which
might arise in the execution of this
Treaty, he wou'd remit himself to the
Arbitration of his Holiness, who might
please to joyn in the Umpirage with
him the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> the great
Duke of <hi>Thuscany,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> himself,
who had so great an interest in those
Articles.</p>
            <p>With these conditions the <hi>Legat</hi>
went from <hi>Tours</hi> on the tenth of <hi>April,</hi>
towards the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who
was already advanc'd with his Army,
as far as <hi>Chasteaudun.</hi> He was receiv'd
with all manner of respect, and dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the two days conference he had
with the Duke, employ'd the most
powerfull considerations he cou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to win his consent to a Peace so
advantageous for all his House, and so
necessary to Religion and the publique
welfare: or at least to gain thus far
upon him, that if any thing were yet
wanting to his entire satisfaction, he
wou'd remit his interests and those of
his Party into the hands of the Pope,
as the King on his side was already
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42159:270"/>
dispos'd to refer his own. But after
all his endeavours, he cou'd not work
him to any condescension. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
arguments he us'd, he always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
with great respect as to the
Pope and the person of the <hi>Legat,</hi>
but with extreme contempt for the
King, whom he perpetually call'd <hi>that
Wretch,</hi> that he and his wou'd ever be
obedient to the Pope; but that he
was very well assur'd, that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wou'd never lay his Commands
upon him, to make any agreement to
the prejudice of Religion, with a man
who had none at all, and who was
united with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> against the
<hi>Catholiques.</hi> That he cou'd not bear
the mention of a reconcilement with a
perjur'd man, who had neither Faith
nor Honour, and that he cou'd never
trust his word, who had Murther'd
his Brothers so inhumanely, and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idiously, not onely the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Faith, but also the Oath which
he had taken on the Evangelists at
the most holy Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
            <p>After this, the Cardinal farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
(what he cou'd not otherways
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:42159:271"/>
have believ'd,) that even more oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
terms than these were us'd of
the King, through all the Army, and
in every City, which own'd the
<hi>League,</hi> where no man durst presume
to give him the name of King, wrote
him word that he cou'd do him no
Service with the Duke; and himself
not daring to be near his person,
while the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> continued
with him, went to <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> where
he waited the Orders which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the Pope not long after,
to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there to give
an account of his Legation. Thus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all hope was utterly lost of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
any peace with the <hi>Leaguers,</hi>
the Treaty with the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>
took place. He was put into possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Saumur,</hi> the Government of
which he gave to the <hi>Sieur du Plessis-Mornay,</hi>
who had so well succeeded in
his Negotiation: And it was from
that very place that he publish'd his
Declaration, concerning his intended
passage over the <hi>Loyre,</hi> for the Service
of his Majesty, where he protests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other things, that being first
Prince of the Bloud, whom his Birth
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:42159:271"/>
oblig'd before all others to defend his
King, he holds none for Enemies, but
such as are Rebels, forbidding most
strictly all his Souldiers, to commit
any manner of offence against those
<hi>Catholiques</hi> who were faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to his Majesty, and particularly
against the Clergy, whom he takes
into his protection.</p>
            <p>The King also made his own at
large, wherein he declares the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that oblig'd him to joyn with
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his person and the Estate,
without any prejudice which cou'd
thence ensue, to the <hi>Catholique</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which he wou'd always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in his Kingdom, even with the
hazard of his Life. But that which at
length completed the Happiness of
this Union betwixt the two Kings,
was their Enterview which was made
in the Park of <hi>Plessis,</hi> on the thirtieth
day of <hi>April,</hi> amidst the acclamations
of a multitude of people there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and with all the signs of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
confidence on both sides: Though
the old <hi>Huguenot</hi> Captains who had
not yet forgot St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> us'd
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:42159:272"/>
their best endeavours that their Master
shou'd not have put himself in the
King's Power, as he did with all frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and generosity.</p>
            <p>He did yet more, for being gone
back with his Guards, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
who attended him to the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgs</hi>
of St. <hi>Simphorian</hi> beyond the
Bridges; on the next Morning, which
was the first of <hi>May,</hi> he repa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s'd the
River, follow'd onely by one Page,
and return'd to <hi>Tours,</hi> to be present
at the King's <hi>Levè,</hi> who was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleas'd with this generous proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and clearly saw by it, that he
had no occasion to suspect him, and
that he had reason to hope all things
from a Prince, who reli'd so fully on
his word, though he had broken it
more than once to him, by revoking
the Edicts which he had made in favour
of him, onely to content the <hi>League.</hi>
In this manner they pass'd two days
together, and held a Council, where
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> caus'd a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be taken, that for the speedy
ending of the War, they shou'd assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
their whole Forces, with all possible
diligence, and March directly on to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:42159:272"/>
which was the Head of the <hi>League,</hi>
and on which the body of it depended.
After which, leaving with the King,
about four or five thousand men,
which he had in the Neighbourhood of
<hi>Tours,</hi> he went from thence to <hi>Chinon,</hi>
and into <hi>Loudunois,</hi> to bring up the
remainder of his Forces, who were as
yet in doubt of his Union with the
Royalists, and by so doing, gave the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> that opportunity
which he took of attacquing <hi>Tours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Prince had March'd out of
<hi>Paris,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> with
one half of his Army, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken in <hi>Melun,</hi> and some other
little places, which might cause an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
hindrance to the supplies of
that great City; he went to joyn the
rest of his Forces, which were Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
in <hi>La Beauce;</hi> after which, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on his left hand <hi>Beaugency</hi> and
<hi>Blois,</hi> which it was believ'd he wou'd
or ought to have attacqu'd, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
as far as <hi>Chasteaudun</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the design which he had on <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
and even upon <hi>Tours</hi> it self, by
help of the intelligence which those of
the <hi>League</hi> had prepar'd for him in
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:42159:273"/>
both those places. <hi>Maille Benehard,</hi>
who had sold <hi>Vandome,</hi> of which he
was Governour, set open the Gates of
it to <hi>Rosne,</hi> the Marshal <hi>de Camp,</hi> who
made Prisoners almost all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the great Council, which the
King had remov'd thither. The Duke
of <hi>Mayenne</hi> arriv'd there immediately
after, and having rejoyn'd the Troups
of <hi>Rosne,</hi> went to fall upon the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Charles de Luxembourg,</hi> Count
of <hi>Brienne,</hi> who was lodg'd at <hi>Saint
Ouin,</hi> and the Countrey thereabouts,
within a League of <hi>Amboise;</hi> he cut
off six hundred of his Men, dispers'd
the rest and took him Prisoner; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he went to post himself right
over against <hi>Saumur,</hi> thereby to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the passage of the remainder of the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Forces.</p>
            <p>But, when he had heard not long
after, that the said King was remov'd
from <hi>Tours,</hi> he believ'd it wou'd be a
convenient time for him to execute his
design which he judg'd impossible to
fail, by reason of the Correspondence
which he held in the Town: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
taking his way back, he March'd
with all possible expedition, contrary
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:42159:273"/>
to the slowness of his temper, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in Battalia all on the sudden,
the seventh of <hi>May</hi> in the morning,
on the Hills which overlook the
Fauxbourg of St. <hi>Simphorian.</hi> It wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but little, that the King, who was
gone betimes that day to <hi>Marmoutier,</hi>
had not been surpris'd by the Scouts
who were within an hundred paces of
him. And it was not without great
pains and danger, that he got to his
first Corps <hi>de Guard,</hi> from whence he
return'd into the Town, and there
gave so good directions in all places,
that they who held Intelligence with
the Enemy, durst attempt no distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance:
for which reason the Duke,
(who had spun out the time with faint
Skirmishes till four of the Clock in
the Afternoon, still expecting that the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> of the Town wou'd rise for
him;) now seeing that there was not
the least motion made, gave on with
his whole Army so vigorously at three
several passages, that he forc'd the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricades
which were made at those three
Avenues, and Guarded with twelve
hundred men: this he perform'd in
the space of half an hour, with the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:42159:274"/>
loss of about an hundred of his own,
and the slaughter of three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the King's Souldiers.</p>
            <p>This was all that was effected by
that attempt of the great Army,
which was set on foot by the <hi>League,</hi>
which after this first success did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, but fell to committing all
manner of Disorders, and horrible
Outrages in the Suburbs where they
had no farther opposition. For when
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> found, that part
of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Forces were
arriv'd in the Evening, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the brave <hi>Chastillon,</hi> who was
already retrench'd in the Island, over
against the Fauxbourg, and that the
rest wou'd immediately be there, with
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> who wou'd not
fail to give him more employment,
than his raw, and for the most part
new rais'd Souldiers wou'd well suffer,
he took occasion to Dislodge silently
before day, the next Morning, after
his Troups had left their fame behind
them in the Suburbs, by all manner
of Villanies which they there commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
From thence he went to gather
up some Regiments which were levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:42159:274"/>
for him in <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Maine;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which possessing himself of <hi>Alanson,</hi>
which surrender'd without resistance
for want of a Garrison, he was forc'd
to return hastily to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they
were in a wonderfull consternation,
for the loss of the Battail of <hi>Senlis,</hi>
which I shall next relate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William de Montmorancy, Sieur de
Thorè,</hi> had so well negotiated while he
was at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> with the principal
persons of that Town, which at the
first had been drawn along by the
torrent of the <hi>League,</hi> that he had
made himself Master of it at the latter
end of <hi>April,</hi> and was enter'd into it,
with an hundred Gentlemen of his
Friends, and five hundred Foot which
he had levied in the Valley of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy.</hi>
The <hi>Parisians</hi> astonish'd at
this surprise, which took from them
their communication with <hi>Picardy,</hi>
were absolutely bent on the retaking
of that place, as soon as was possible;
and were so urgent with the Duke of
<hi>Aumale,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Maineville,</hi>
Lieutenant to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
that in three days time they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Town, and besieg'd it with
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:42159:275"/>
four of five thousand Citizens of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and three pieces of Cannon; to
whom <hi>Balagny</hi> not long after joyn'd
himself with three or four thousand
men, some of them drawn out of the
Towns of the Low Countries, and the
rest from those of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and brought
along with him a train of seven pieces
of Artillery, which he had taken out
of <hi>Peronne</hi> and <hi>Amiens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while the Siege was thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that Prudent and Valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Monsieur de la Noüe,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Troups of <hi>Sedan,</hi> the
Truce being now made with the Duke
of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> had joyn'd his Forces with
those of the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> at St.
<hi>Quentin,</hi> with intention according to
the King's Orders, to meet and embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with the <hi>Swissers,</hi> whom <hi>Monsieur
de Sancy</hi> had levy'd for his Majesty's
Service in the <hi>Cantons.</hi> There seem'd
to be offer'd them a fair occasion
of doing a piece of good Service to the
King, by raising of that Siege, before
they put themselves upon their March.
To this effect, they advanc'd as far as
<hi>Compeigne,</hi> where they had appointed
a Rendevouz for the Gentlemen Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:42159:275"/>
of <hi>Picardy,</hi> who fail'd not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in at the time prefix'd. Insomuch
that on the very day, which was the
seventh of <hi>May,</hi> when the Town was
so batter'd by the Cannon, that it was
laid quite open, and must of necessity
have Surrender'd, if it had not been
succour'd before Night, they appear'd
at Noon in view of the place, to the
number of a thousand or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse, and three thousand Foot
all experienc'd Souldiers, and resolv'd
upon the point, either to force their
passage into the Town, or to perish in
the attempt.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> deceiv'd by
his Spies, who assur'd him that the
Enemy had no Cannon, and knowing
himself to be twice as strong, doubted
not but he shou'd be able to defeat
them with his Cavalry alone. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
having drawn up with much
trouble his <hi>Parisian</hi> Infantry, brisk
men to appearance and well arm'd,
but a little out of countenance, when
they saw the Business in hand, was
somewhat more than bare Trayning,
and that Life was at stake, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
so hastily with his Horse, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:42159:276"/>
               <hi>Maineville</hi> on his right hand,
and <hi>Balagny</hi> on his left, that those
two great Bodies of Horse and Foot,
were made uncapable of relieving and
serving each other in the Fight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Noiie,</hi> to whom for the sake of
his experience, the young Duke of
<hi>Longueville</hi> had intrusted the care and
conduct of the Army, having observ'd
the countenance of the Enemy, and
finding the <hi>Parisians</hi> disorder'd and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
was confident he cou'd beat
them with those few Troups, which
he had then in the Field, and who
were imbattel'd in this order. The
Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was in the main
Body, with his Squadron compos'd of
a great number of brave Gentlemen,
having at the Head of them, the Lord
<hi>Charles de Humieres,</hi> Marquis <hi>d' Encre,</hi>
and Governour of <hi>Compeigne,</hi> who
had furnish'd the Army with Cannon
and Ammunition, which occasion'd
the gaining of the Battel. This was
he who having soon discover'd the
pernicious designs of the <hi>League,</hi> serv'd
the King so well against it, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the Fourth at his coming to the
Crown, made him his Lieutenant in
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:42159:276"/>
               <hi>Picardy,</hi> with an extraordinary privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
that he shou'd have the full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of disposing all things in that
Province.</p>
            <p>His great Services, his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Deserts, his high Reputation, his
Performances on this great day, and
many signal actions during the War,
gain'd him without any other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
his Commission for Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Artillery, which was sign'd
not long before his Death; and he
was yet in a way of mounting higher,
if his too great Courage had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
him to that fatal Musquet shot,
which kill'd him at the taking of <hi>Han;</hi>
though the Garrison of <hi>Spaniards</hi> had
small cause to boast of it, who were
all sacrific'd to the just sorrow of the
Army for the loss of so brave a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
They who came in to the
Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> with him, were
<hi>Louis Dongniez,</hi> Count <hi>de Chaulne</hi> his
Brother-in-Law, the <hi>Sieurs de Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levrier,
Lanoy, Longueval, Cany, Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivet,
Givry, Fretoy, Mesvillier,</hi> and
<hi>La Tour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Squadron was slank'd on the
right and left with two gross Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:42159:277"/>
having each of them two Field
pieces, which were not drawn out of
<hi>Compeigne</hi> till some time after the
Army was March'd, on purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Spies, who thereupon gave
intelligence that they had none. He
plac'd on his right Wing the Cavalry
of <hi>Sedan,</hi> at the Head of which he
was resolv'd to Fight in Person: and
on his left, the Horsemen which were
drawn out from those places, that
held for the King in <hi>Picardy.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> who made such over
haste to the Victory, of which he
made sure in his conceipt, that he left
his Cannon behind him, was the first
who founded the Charge, and <hi>Balag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
with his Squadron of <hi>Cambresians</hi>
and <hi>Walloons,</hi> advanc'd eagerly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
the right Wing of the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
which was much inferiour to his
own in strength; but when he was
almost just upon them, the gross Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
which cover'd the left side of that
Squadron, opening in a moment, he
was surprisingly saluted with a Volley
of Cannon, which carri'd off at once
whole rancks of his Squadron, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
him to retire in great disorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:42159:277"/>
Then the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> who
plainly saw that there was no other
remedy for this unexpected mischief,
but speedily to win the Enemies Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
put himself upon the gallop,
follow'd by <hi>Maineville</hi> and <hi>Balagny,</hi>
who had recover'd his disorder, and
all three went at the Head of their
men, to force that Infantry of the
Enemy. But they were scarce come
up within an hundred paces of them,
when their other Battalion opening,
a second Volley came thundring upon
them, and raking them in the Flank,
did more execution than the former.
A third which immediately succeeded
it, shook their whole Body, which
having advanc'd a little farther, the
Musquetiers which flank'd their
Horse, made their discharge, so justly
both against Man and Horse, that the
Field was strew'd with dead Bodies;
and in the mean time the whole Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Royallists charg'd upon them
who were already wavering and half
routed: and the Besieg'd at the same
time sallying out, fell upon the rere
of the <hi>Parisian</hi> Infantry, who had been
abandon'd by their Cavalry, so that
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:42159:278"/>
now it was no longer to be call'd a
Battel, but a downright Slaughter,
and a general defeat.</p>
            <p>Never was any Victory more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete,
with so little loss to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours:
the Field of Battel remain'd
in their Possession, cover'd with above
two thousand Slain, without recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into the number, those who were
kill'd by the Peasants, or such as cou'd
not recover themselves out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
which are about the Abbey <hi>de
la Victoire.</hi> The Camp of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd,
the Merchandises, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which had been brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>Paris,</hi> the Cannon, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
the Colours, the Baggage,
and twelve hundred Prisoners were
the Conquerours reward: Who some
few days after as they March'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> there to joyn the
<hi>Swissers,</hi> saluted the <hi>Parisians</hi> from
the Heights of <hi>Montfaucon,</hi> with some
Vollies of Cannon, and thereby gave
them notice of their defeat, with a
truer account of it than had been given
them by the Duke of <hi>Aumale</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagny,</hi>
whereof the one sav'd himself in
St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and the other in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="491" facs="tcp:42159:278"/>
And as it often happens, that one
misfortune comes on the Neck of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to those who are in the way of
being beaten, this defeat was follow'd
the very next day after it, being the
eighteenth of <hi>May,</hi> with the loss
of three hundred brave Gentlemen of
<hi>Picardy,</hi> whom the Governour of
<hi>Dourlens, Charles Tiercelin de Saveuse,</hi>
was bringing to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne;</hi>
who being met in <hi>La Beauce</hi> towards
<hi>Bonneval,</hi> by the Count of <hi>Chastillon,</hi>
with a greater strength, were almost
all of them Slain, after having fought
like Lions without asking Quarter,
or so much as promising for safety of
their Lives, that they wou'd never
bear Arms against the King. Such
violent <hi>Leaguers</hi> were these men, and
above all, <hi>Saveuse</hi> their Captain, who
being carried off to <hi>Baugency,</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in all parts of his Body, where
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> a great lover of
brave Men was very desirous to have
sav'd him, refus'd all kind of remedies,
for the sullen pleasure of Dying, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing in his mouth but the
praises of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and a
thousand imprecations against his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:42159:279"/>
These fortunate events, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd
by the great success which the
Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> had in <hi>Normandy</hi>
against the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> occasion'd the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> who was advanc'd as
far as <hi>Baugency,</hi> with part of his <hi>Forces,</hi>
to return to <hi>Tours,</hi> that he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
the King no longer to delay the
time in fruitless Treaties, which were
still counsell'd him by some, and were
so agreeable to his lazy and unactive
<hi>genius;</hi> and to let him know, that it
was now high time to put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a more generous design, which was
to attaque the Enemy in their chiefest
strength, by besieging <hi>Paris.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
on this at last; but first he was
desirous of getting <hi>Orleans</hi> into his
power; which if he cou'd compass, he
shou'd thereby deprive <hi>Paris</hi> of the great
supplies which might be drawn from
thence.</p>
            <p>To effect this, having in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Iune</hi> pass'd his Army over
the Bridge of <hi>Baugency</hi> in <hi>La Sologne,</hi>
he caus'd <hi>Gergeau</hi> to be assaulted: the
Governour of which place, who had
the confidence to stay till the Cannon
had made a breach, which he was not
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:42159:279"/>
able to defend, was taken, and hang'd
for an example. Those of <hi>Gien,</hi> terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
by this just severity, made haste
to surrender before the Artillery had
play'd; and the Inhabitants of <hi>La
Charité</hi> put themselves immediately
into the King's hands of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
so that his Majesty, excepting
onely <hi>Nantz,</hi> was Master of all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
on the <hi>Loire,</hi> both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Orleans,</hi> which he invested on all
parts of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sieur de la Chastre,</hi> who after
the death of the <hi>Guises</hi> had promis'd
fidelity to the King, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
had declar'd a second time for
the <hi>League,</hi> in his Government of
<hi>Berry,</hi> put himself into that Town,
with all the Forces he cou'd make; and
the Inhabitants, encourag'd by his
presence, refus'd with great scorn those
advantageous propositions which were
made them by the King, laugh'd at his
threatnings, and took up a resolution
of defending themselves to the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
Insomuch that it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
it was but loss of time to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
that Siege, the first design of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly on to <hi>Paris</hi> was resum'd.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:42159:280"/>
For which reason they repass'd the
<hi>Loire,</hi> and upon the March without
much trouble took in the Towns of
<hi>Pluviers, Dourdan</hi> and <hi>Estampes;</hi> at
which last place the King receiv'd the
unwelcome news of the Monitory
which Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> had publish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and this was the occasion
of it.</p>
            <p>Not long after the death of the <hi>Guises,</hi>
the King, who clearly saw by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
which the <hi>Legat Morosini</hi>
had made him, that the absolution which
he had receiv'd by virtue of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viat,
wou'd not be receiv'd at <hi>Rome;</hi>
had sent thither <hi>Claude d' Angennes</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Mans</hi> to intercede for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
notwithstanding all the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
Letters which had been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him by his friends from thence,
to disswade him from it; or at least to
delay a submission of this nature,
which might prove prejudicial to him.
In farther prosecution of this the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Pisany</hi> his Ambassadour, and
the Cardinal <hi>de Ioyeuse,</hi> acting in
joint commission with the Bishop by
his order, had represented to Pope
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the most powerfull reasons they
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:42159:280"/>
cou'd urge, to procure this favour
from him: to which the Pope who
was grown inflexible on that point,
had answer'd them ruggedly according
to his nature; that he was willing to
take no cognisance of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s
death, because he was the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
but the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and
the Arch-bishop of <hi>Lyons</hi> whom he
held Prisoners, not being his Subjects,
(since none but the Pope had a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power over Cardinals and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,)
he wou'd never grant him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
before he had restor'd them to
their liberty, or at least put them into
the hands of his <hi>Legat,</hi> that they
might be sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> where himself
wou'd execute justice on them, in case
he found them guilty.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Commander
of <hi>Diu,</hi> the <hi>Sieur Coquelaire</hi> Counsellor
in Parliament, <hi>Nicholas de Piles</hi> Abbot
of <hi>Orbais,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur Frison</hi> Dean of
the Church of <hi>Rheims,</hi> who were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
for the <hi>League</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Pope</hi> from giving this Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not onely oppos'd it with all
their force, but also us'd their best
endeavours to perswade him, that he
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:42159:281"/>
wou'd publish the Excommunication,
which he himself had said was incurr'd
by the King for the murther of the
Cardinal of <hi>Guise;</hi> and amongst other
arguments which they alledg'd, to
carry him to this extreme severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a most Christian King, they
fail'd not to urge the Authority of the
Decrees of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
that of the fifth of <hi>April.</hi> In that
Decree, the Faculty declare that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
de Valois,</hi> ought not to be pray'd
for in any Ecclesiastique Prayer; much
less at the Canon of the Mass, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Excommunication, which
he had incurr'd; and that these words
<hi>Pro Rege nostro,</hi> ought to be taken out
of the Canon, lest it shou'd be believ'd
that they pray'd for him; even though
the Priest by directing his intention
otherwise shou'd call down the effect of
those Prayers on the present Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
or on him to whom God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
had reserv'd the kingdom.
The same Decree wills, that instead
of them, there shou'd be said at Mass
three Prayers which are not in the
Canon, <hi>Pro Christianis Principibus
nostris,</hi> which were Printed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:42159:281"/>
at this day to be seen. Lastly,
it adds, that all such, who will not
conform to this Decree, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the Prayers and other rights
of the Faculty, from which they
shall be driven out, like Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
Persons: and this was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by the general consent of all the
Doctors.</p>
            <p>'Tis most certain that these Decrees,
together with what was continually
buzz'd in the Pope's ears, that the
King's party was absolutely ruin'd,
contributed not a little to the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he took of prosecuting the
King by the ways of rigour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear. But that which put the last
hand to his determination, was the
<hi>Manifesto</hi> of the two Kings, who were
now in conjunction against the <hi>League.</hi>
For being a man of an haughty temper,
he was not able to endure that the
King shou'd be united, with a person
whom he had excommunicated as a
relaps'd Heretique, by a thundring
Bull, which he had caus'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in the Bullary, reprinted by
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:42159:282"/>
him, for that onely purpose: he easily
believ'd whatever reports were rais'd
by the <hi>Leaguers</hi> to the disadvantage of
the King's party or his cause, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
set up in <hi>Rome</hi> his Monitory
against him.</p>
            <p>In which he commands him to set
at full liberty the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi>
and the Arch-bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> within
ten days after the publication of his
Monitory, at the Gates of two or three
of six Cathedral Churches which are
nam'd, and which are those of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
Orleans, Chartres, Meaux, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
and <hi>Mans,</hi> and to give him assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it within thirty days by an
Authentique Act. In default of which
he pronounces from that present time,
and for the future, that he and all his
Accomplices in the murther of the
Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the other Prelates, have dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
incurr'd the greater Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and the other Ecclesiastical
censures, denounc'd by the Bull, <hi>In
Coena Domini,</hi> from which they can
never be absolv'd, except onely in the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:42159:282"/>
article of death, by giving security
that they will obey the <hi>Mandats</hi> of
the Church. Farthermore, he cites
them to make their appearance within
two months, before his Tribunal, the
King himself in person, or by his
Proctor, and the rest personally, to
give in their reasons why they believe
they have not incurr'd the censures,
and why the King's Subjects are not
absolv'd from their Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and in fine invalidates all
Privileges to the contrary which
the King himself, or his Predecessours
have formerly obtain'd from the Holy
See.</p>
            <p>This Monitory was posted up at
<hi>Rome,</hi> on the twenty fourth of <hi>May;</hi>
and the <hi>Leaguers</hi> Printed it at <hi>Paris,</hi>
and publish'd it with all the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
accustom'd, at <hi>Paris, Chartres,</hi>
and <hi>Meaux</hi> on the twenty third of <hi>Iune;</hi>
and I have seen the Acts of it, which
were Printed immediately after at
<hi>Paris,</hi> with the Monitory, by <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Nivelle,</hi> and <hi>Rolin Thierry</hi> Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Printers for the Holy Union,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:42159:283"/>
with the Privilege of the Body of the
Council General of the same Holy
Union, Signed by <hi>Senault,</hi> their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</p>
            <p>It was then at <hi>Estampes,</hi> that the
King receiv'd this information, that he
was prosecuted in this manner, both
at <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>France</hi> by the Arms
of the Church, at the same time when
the Rebels assaulted him with theirs,
to pull him from the Throne. It was
told him indeed, that there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in that Monitory, many heads
which were nullities in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which consequently made
the whole invalid, even though it
were against a private person. But
when notwithstanding all these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
he still answer'd that it gave him
exceeding trouble; the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
who desir'd nothing more than
speedily to prosecute the design of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
<hi>Paris,</hi> told him pleasantly as
well as truly, that he had found out a
sure expedient for him; <q>And, Sir,
said he, with his accustom'd quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
'tis onely this, that we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:42159:283"/>
and the sooner the better;
for if we succeed, you may assure
your self of your Absolution; but
in case we are beaten, we shall be
still Excommunicated, over and over,
and damn'd with three pil'd curses
on our heads.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This saying was much of a piece
with what the Bishop of <hi>Mans,</hi> had
written to the King from <hi>Rome;</hi> that
if he were desirous of the Absolution,
which was refus'd him in that Court,
he had no more to doe but to make
himself the strongest in his own
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus the King thinking it his best
course to dissemble his knowledge of
the Monitory, never own'd that he had
seen or heard of it; but march'd still
forward, to pass the <hi>Seine</hi> at the Bridge
of <hi>Poissy,</hi> which he forc'd; after which
having taken <hi>Pontoise,</hi> which was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd
on the 25th of <hi>Iuly,</hi> after a
fortnights siege, having been vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
defended by the <hi>Sieur d' Alin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,</hi>
who was there grievously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:42159:284"/>
and the <hi>Sieur de Hautefort,</hi> who
lost his life; he went to <hi>Constans,</hi> and
there receiv'd the Army of the <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
which was conducted to him by
<hi>Nicholas de Harlay, Sieur de Sancy;</hi>
who by performing so great and
seasonable a service to the King his
Master, has deserv'd the praise of all
posterity.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of this War, there
being a Council held, wherein were
propos'd the most speedy and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
means that cou'd be found to
carry it on, the King being then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to a very low condition; <hi>Sancy,</hi>
who had been formerly his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
in <hi>Swisserland,</hi> maintain'd that
there was no better expedient, than to
treat with the <hi>Cantons,</hi> who to defend
themselves from the Arms of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
which threatned <hi>Geneva,</hi> and design'd
to shut it up on the side of <hi>France,</hi>
wou'd willingly permit a great Levy
of their Subjects to be made in favour
of the King, who might hereafter be
in a condition to succour them, in case
they shou'd be driven to extremity.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:42159:284"/>
But, because the Exchequer was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drain'd, and <hi>No Money no Swisse</hi>
was the common Proverb, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was turn'd into ridicule, and
he was ask'd if he knew the man who
wou'd undertake to raise an Army,
without any other ingredient than
Pen and Paper? Then <hi>Sancy,</hi> who
though he was of the long Robe, had
a Souldiers heart, (for at that time, he
was onely a Master of Requests) Since,
said he, not one of all those who have
been enrich'd by the King's bounty,
will make offer of himself to serve him,
I declare that I will be the man. And
thereupon accepted a very ample Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
which was given him by the
King, but without a penny to bear his
charges, to treat with the <hi>Swisses</hi>
and <hi>Germans</hi> for the raising of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>To go through with his business,
he Mortgag'd all he had, and took up
what he coud procure upon his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;
and in sequel, acted with so much
fortune and such good management
with the Magistrates of <hi>Bern,</hi> of <hi>Basile,</hi>
               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:42159:285"/>
of <hi>Soleure,</hi> and of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that after
having taken from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
the Baily-wicks of <hi>Gex</hi> and <hi>Thonon,</hi> the
Fort of <hi>Ripaille,</hi> and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
thereby to employ him for
some time, and to hinder him from
molesting of his neighbours, he put
himself at the head of the Royal Army,
compos'd of ten or twelve thousand
Foot, <hi>Swisses, Grisons,</hi> and <hi>Genevians,</hi>
with near two thousand <hi>Reyters,</hi> and
twelve pieces of Cannon. With these
Forces he travers'd all the Countrey
from <hi>Geneva</hi> by <hi>Swisserland,</hi> as far as
the County of <hi>Montbelliard,</hi> from
whence crossing the <hi>French</hi> County,
and passing the <hi>Saone</hi> towards <hi>Ioinville,</hi>
he came to <hi>Langres</hi> which held for the
King, and thence to <hi>Chastillon</hi> on the
<hi>Seine,</hi> to joyn the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi>
and <hi>La Noüe.</hi> From whence march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through <hi>Champaigne,</hi> all three in
company, with twenty thousand men,
they passed the <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>Poissy,</hi> and in
conclusion arriv'd happily at the King's
Army. His Majesty receiv'd <hi>Sancy</hi>
with tears in his eyes, and protested
in presence of all the Officers of his
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:42159:285"/>
Army, that he wept for joy, and grief
together, that he had not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
at present to reward the greatest
service, which a Subject cou'd perform
to his King; and that what he had
done for him in making him Colonel
of the <hi>Swisses,</hi> was nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of what he intended him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
resolv'd that one day he wou'd make
him so great, that there shou'd not be
a man in his Kingdom, who might not
have occasion to envy him.</p>
            <p>But fortune, which is pleas'd with
persecuting of vertue, dispos'd quite
otherwise of the matter, by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
accident, which happen'd
three days after, and by the misery
which his own noble heartedness had
drawn upon him. For instead of those
large recompences which he might
reasonably expect, after having
done so worthy an action, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
so low, that he was constrain'd
at last to sell all he had, therewith to
pay the debts which he had contracted
by Levying at his own charges that
gallant Army, which put the King in
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:42159:286"/>
a condition of conquering his Rebels,
and by consequence of triumphing
over the <hi>League.</hi> In effect, after the
conjunction of the two Armies, in the
general review of all his Troups, he
saw himself at the head of more than
forty five thousand Men, experienc'd
Souldiers, with which, after having
possess'd himself on the thirtieth of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> of the Bridge of St. <hi>Clou,</hi> (from
whence he drove the <hi>Leaguers</hi> with
his Cannon,) he was resolv'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two days, to attaque the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgs</hi>
of <hi>Paris,</hi> on both sides of the
River.</p>
            <p>There is all the appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
that he had carri'd them, at
the first onset, and by consequence the
Town it self, where they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in extreme consternation, all the
passages for provisions, being block'd
up; and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> not
having about him above five or six
thousand Souldiers at the most; who
were not the third part of the number
which was necessary for the defence
of the Retrenchments of so great a
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:42159:286"/>
compass, as those which he had made
for all the <hi>Fauxbourgs;</hi> considering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the King had within the
Town so great a number of good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who having taken courage at his
approach, had drawn over a great party
of the honest Citizens, receiving an
assurance that the punishment wou'd
onely fall on the Principal of the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi>
in case the King entring the Town
as a Conquerour, shou'd think fit to
remember the old business of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricades.
Insomuch that the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne</hi> had occasion to fear, that at
the same time when the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi>
were attaqu'd there wou'd be a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
rising for the King, within the
Town, and that those who had thus
risen, wou'd make themselves Masters
of one of the Gates, which they wou'd
open to him, and afterwards act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with his Army.</p>
            <p>To this purpose 'tis reported, that
the Duke who, notwithstanding all his
temper and his slowness, was very
brave, being sensible of his desperate
condition, though in outward shew
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:42159:287"/>
he seem'd confident of good success,
still plying the people from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits
with a thousand Lyes for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement;
had resolv'd with a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Troup of his bravest men, who
were willing to follow his fortune, to
throw himself into the midst of the
Royal Army, with his Sword in his
hand, either to overcome, against all
appearance of probability, by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
despair, (which is sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper'd
by the chance of Arms,) or to
die honourably in using the onely
means which were now left him, to
revenge the death of his two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>In this flourishing condition the
King's affairs then stood, and to this
low ebb was the <hi>League</hi> reduc'd, when
fortune which plays with the lives of
men, of which she sometimes makes a
ridiculous Comedy, and at other
times a bloudy Tragedy, all on the
sudden chang'd the Scene, as if the
action had been upon a Theatre, by
the most Sacrilegious blow which was
ever given, I say not by a Man but
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:42159:287"/>
by a Devil incarnate. 'Tis not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that I shou'd here relate every
particular circumstance of so execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a deed, which is already known
to all the world: 'Tis sufficient that in
performance of my duty, as an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
I onely say, That a young <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin,</hi>
call'd <hi>Iaques Clement,</hi> a man of
mean capacity, Superstitious, and
Fanatically devout, being perswaded
by the furious Sermons of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and by a certain Vision which
he thought he had, that he shou'd be
a Martyr if he lost his life, for having
kill'd <hi>Henry de Valois,</hi> was so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated
with this damnable opinion,
that he scrupled not to say openly,
that the people needed not to give
themselves so much trouble; and that
he knew well enough how to deliver
<hi>Paris,</hi> in due time. And when it was
known that the King was at St. <hi>Clou,</hi>
where he had taken up his quarters,
and was lodg'd at the House of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Ierome de Gondy,</hi> he went out of
<hi>Paris,</hi> the next morning, which was
the last of <hi>Iuly,</hi> with a Letter of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
address'd to the King, from the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:42159:288"/>
first President <hi>de Harlay,</hi> who was at
that time a Prisoner in the <hi>Bastill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> 'tis
uncertain whether that Letter in reality
was written by that illustrious person,
deluded by the <hi>Iacobin,</hi> whom he
thought a fitting Messenger to convey
such intelligence, as he had to send, or
whether it were counterfeited, as an
assur'd means of gaining him access, and
opportunity to put in practice his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
resolution.</p>
            <p>For being introduc'd the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
about seven or eight a clock
in the morning into the King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
while that good Prince, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
receiv'd men in Orders with
great kindness, was reading the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
attentively, and bowing his body
to listen so some secret message which
he believ'd was brought him by the
Fryar, (as was imported by his Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,)
the Parricide who was kneeling
before him, pulling out a knife from
his sleeve, stabb'd him with it into the
belly, and left it in the wound; from
whence the King drawing it, and at
the same time rising from his Chair,
and crying out, Thrust it very deep
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:42159:288"/>
into the Fryar's forehead. There were
at that time in the room onely <hi>Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,</hi>
first Gentleman of the Bed-chamber,
and <hi>La Guesle</hi> the Attorney
General, who having the day before
interrogated the Villain without find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing in his discourse, that
might administer the least cause of
suspicion, had brought him to the
King, by his own command. But
many of the forty five entring sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
upon the King's outcry, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately
upon him in the first
transport of their fury, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
stuck him in with many thrusts
without giving any attention to <hi>La
Guesle,</hi> who after he had struck him
with the handle of his Sword, cri'd
out as loud as he cou'd possibly, that
they shou'd not kill him: The wretch
immediately expiring, they threw his
Corps all bloudy out of the Window,
which the grand Prevost of the King's
house, caus'd immediately to be tyed
to four Horses, and dragg'd about till
it was torn in pieces.</p>
            <p>There are some who, not being able
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:42159:289"/>
to believe that one in Orders cou'd be
capable of so impious an action, have
doubted that this Monster of a man
was either some <hi>Leaguer,</hi> or some
<hi>True Protestant</hi> disguis'd into a Fryar;
and a Modern Authour to save the
honour of the <hi>Iacobins,</hi> has endeavour'd
of late to renew and fortify this doubt,
in the best manner he was able: But
besides that the Parricide was known
by some who were of his acquaintance;
'tis most certain that the same <hi>Iaques
Clement,</hi> who was examin'd the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before by <hi>La Guesle,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on all sides, was introduc'd by
himself, the next morning into the
King's Chamber; for it can never be
thought, that the Attorney General,
a man of good understanding, shou'd
be so far mistaken, as to take another
man for him whom he had interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with so much circumspection.
And yet farther, since the King, in the
Letters which he sent to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Provinces and to his Allies, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after he was wounded, says
positively, that when he was stabb'd
by the <hi>Iacobin,</hi> there were onely in
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:42159:289"/>
his Chamber <hi>Bellegarde</hi> and <hi>La Guesle,</hi>
whom he had commanded to stand at
a distance, that he might hear what the
Traytour had to say to him in private,
it follows necessarily, that either the one
or the other of these two committed
this detestable action, if it were not
<hi>Iaques Clement:</hi> and the former of these
two suppositions, is what can never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the imagination of any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man.</p>
            <p>For which reason, without losing
my time either to destroy or leave
doubtfull a truth so known, and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
agreed on by all the Writers
of those times, and confirm'd besides
by so many authentique Witnesses;
I believe it safer to rest satisfi'd with
the universal opinion of Mankind,
without the least daubing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in regard of his profession, which
can reflect no manner of dishonour on
the <hi>Iacobins.</hi> For there is no dispute
but all crimes are personal; and there
is no man of good sense, who can
think it reasonable to upbraid a whole
Order, with the guilt of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:42159:290"/>
person in it; and principally
that of Saint <hi>Dominic,</hi> which is always
stor'd with excellent men, renown'd
for their Vertue, their Learning, and
their Pious conversation.</p>
            <p>Now, though the wound was great,
and had pierc'd very deep, yet the
Chirurgeons at the first dressing were
of opinion that the Knife had slipp'd
betwixt the Bowels without entring
into them, and that therefore the
King was not hurt to death: of
this they all assur'd him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he sent advice to the Princes his
Allies, that in ten days he shou'd be
able to get on horseback. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that the wound was not
search'd to the bottom, or that the
knife was empoyson'd, it was known,
not long after, that the hurt was
mortal.</p>
            <p>Never Prince was less surpris'd than
he, at the certainty of death: nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it more calmly, more Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly,
or more devoutly. He confess'd
himself three several times to the <hi>Sieur
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:42159:290"/>
de Boulogne,</hi> the Chaplain of his Closet,
and being advertis'd by him that there
was a Monitory out against him,
and exhorted to satisfie the Church
in what was demanded of him, before
he cou'd have absolution given him,
I am, answer'd he, without the least
hesitation, the Eldest Son of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick</hi> Church, and will die
such. I promise in the presence of
God, and before you all, that I have
no other desire, than to content his
Holiness in all he can require from me.
Upon which the Confessour being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfi'd gave him Absolution. All
the remainder of the day, he pass'd
in his Devotions, and in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Holy things; till the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> being arriv'd from his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at <hi>Meudon,</hi> it being now well
onward in the night, and throwing
himself on his knees before him, with
his eyes full of tears, and without
being able to pronounce one word,
he rais'd himself up a little, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gently on his head, declar'd him
his lawfull Successour, commanding
all the Nobility, who fill'd the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:42159:291"/>
to acknowledge and obey him
as their King, at the same time telling
him, that if he wou'd Reign peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
it was necessary for him to return
into the Church, and to profess the
Religion of all the most Christian Kings
his Predecessours.</p>
            <p>When he felt the approaches of
death, about two of the Clock in the
Morning, he confess'd himself once
more, after which he call'd for the
holy Sacrament; which <hi>Viaticum</hi> he
receiv'd with incredible devotion.
After which he continu'd in all the
most fervent actions of Faith, Hope,
and Charity, relying wholly on the
infinite merits of the Passion of our
Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> pardoning all
his Enemies from the bottom of his
heart, and particularly those who
had procur'd his death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he desir'd for the third time to
receive Absolution, beseeching God
to forgive him all his Sins, even as he
forgave all the injuries which had
been done him. After this he began
to say the <hi>Miserere,</hi> which he was
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:42159:291"/>
not able to finish, having lost his
Speech, at these words, <hi>And restore
to me the joy of thy Salvation;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
twice sign'd himself with the
sign of the Cross, he quietly gave
up his breath, about four of the clock
in the morning, on the second day of
<hi>August,</hi> and in the thirty ninth year
of his Age.</p>
            <p>Thus died <hi>Henry</hi> the third King of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> making it appear
at his death, that during his Life he
had in his Soul a true foundation of
Piety, and that those extraordinary
and odd actions, which he did from
time to time, though they were not
altogether regular, nor becoming his
Quality, yet proceeded not from that
unworthy principle of Hypocrisie,
with which the <hi>Leaguers</hi> have so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiously
branded him: As to the
rest, he was a Prince who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
with all the Noble Qualities,
which I have describ'd in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in the beginning of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had been one of the most excellent
Kings who ever Reign'd, if he cou'd
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:42159:292"/>
have shewn them to the World, after
his assumption to the Crown, with the
same lustre in which they appear'd
before it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Huguenots</hi> and <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who
agree'd in nothing but their common
hatred to this Prince, rejoyc'd equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at his Death, and spoke of it as a
kind of Miracle, and as a stroke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the hand of God. <q>The
Protestants have written that he was
wounded, and died afterwards in
the same Chamber, where he had
procur'd the Massacre of St. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew,</hi>
to be resolv'd. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which it is most certain, that
the House wherein the King was
hurt to Death, was not Built by
the <hi>Sieur Ierome de Gondy,</hi> till the
year 1577, which was five years
after the forefaid Massacre. For
which reason that imposture being
manifest, the Parliament upon the
complaint, which the Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
made concerning it, ordain'd
that this passage shou'd be rac'd out
from the addition which was made
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:42159:292"/>
by <hi>Monliard;</hi> to the <hi>Inventaire</hi> of the
History of <hi>France.</hi> But the Zealots
of <hi>Geneva</hi> have not been wanting,
to restore it entirely as it was before,
in the Impression which they made
of that Book.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Leaguers</hi> they proclaim'd
their Joy so loudly, and in so scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
a manner, that their Books can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be read without an extreme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence
to the Writers. They pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
in their Narratives Printed at
<hi>Paris</hi> and at <hi>Lyons,</hi> that an Angel had
declar'd to <hi>Iaques Clement,</hi> that a
Crown of Martyrdom was prepar'd for
him, when he had deliver'd <hi>France</hi>
from <hi>Henry de Valois;</hi> and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
communicated his Vision to a
knowing man in Orders, he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
it; assuring him that by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Stroke, he shou'd make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as well pleasing to God, as <hi>Iudith</hi>
was by killing <hi>Holophernes.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Prior who was called Father
<hi>Edm. Bourgoing,</hi> was accus'd to be the
man, amongst all the Preachers of the
<hi>League,</hi> who was the most transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:42159:293"/>
in the praises of this abominable
Parricide, his Subject, Apostrophising
to him in the Pulpit, and calling him
the blessed Child of his Patriarch, and
the Holy Martyr of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and
also comparing him to <hi>Iudith;</hi> It was
not doubted but that he was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
by whom this young man who
was under his charge, had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
and was afterwards confirm'd, in
this his execrable resolution.</p>
            <p>For which reason, being taken with
Arms in his hand three Months after,
at the assault of the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
his process was made, and though
he obstinately deny'd it to his Death,
(which he suffer'd with a wonderfull
resolution;) yet since he cou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Witnesses of falsehood who
Swore against him, he was judg'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the forms of Justice, as he
himself acknowledg'd, and drawn in
pieces by four Horses, according to
the decree of the Parliament sitting at
<hi>Tours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howsoever it were, 'tis certain, that
the greatest part of those outrageous
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:42159:293"/>
Preachers of the <hi>League,</hi> said altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as much as what was alledg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prior: for <hi>Monsieur Anthoine
Loysel</hi> has left it Written in his
Journal, that on the very same day
whereon the King was Wounded, and
before the news of it was come to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
he heard at St. <hi>Merry</hi> the Sermon
of Doctour <hi>Boucher,</hi> who said by way
of consolation to his Auditours, that
as on that day, (namely the first of
<hi>August</hi> when the Feast of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in
Prison is celebrated,) God had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
that Apostle from the hands of
<hi>Herod,</hi> so they ought to hope, he had
the like mercy in store for them.
<q>And immediately made no scruple
to maintain this damnable proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them, that it was an action
of great merit to kill an Heretique
King, or a favourer of Heretiques.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The rest of the same fraternity of
Preachers, joyning in the Consort,
on the same day, held forth in the
Pulpits with more violence than ever,
against <hi>Henry de Valois,</hi> and gave the
people (says the same undeniable
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:42159:294"/>
Witness,) a hope almost in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a certainty, that God wou'd
speedily deliver them, which gave
just occasion for many to believe,
that the devilish design of that Assa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinate
had been communicated to
them. And when it was known that
the Blow was given, it was order'd
that publique Prayers shou'd be made
in all the Churches of the City, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a solemn action of thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Almighty God. For a whole
Week together they made Processions
from all the Parishes, to the Church
of the <hi>Iacobins,</hi> and exhorted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to distribute their Alms liberally
to the Religious of that Cloyster, for
the sake of Fryer <hi>Iaques Clement;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to extend their Charity to his poor
Relations.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Doctour <hi>Roze,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Senlis</hi> an old man, and most outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>Leaguer</hi> Preach'd there, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the direction of the Council
of Sixteen, which was sent in Tickets
to all the Preachers in the City, on
Sunday the sixth of <hi>August,</hi> wherein
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:42159:294"/>
they were appointed to insist particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
on three Heads, which I will
here set down as they are express'd in
the Tickets themselves; that it may
be notorious with what an <hi>Egyptian</hi>
blindness, that infamous Cabal of the
<hi>League</hi> was then struck. <q>Take
them in their own Words. 1. You
are to justifie the action of the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin,</hi>
because it is a parallel to that
of <hi>Iudith,</hi> so much magnifi'd in the
Holy Scriptures. For he who hears
not the Church, ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as an Heathen or an <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes.</hi>
2. Cry out against those,
who say that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> is
to be receiv'd, in case he goes to
Mass: Because he can be but an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper
of the Kingdom, being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and also standing
excluded from that of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
3. Exhort the Magistracy, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
against all those who shall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that they
are attainted of the crime of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
and as such to proceed against
them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:42159:295"/>
But after all these doings, this bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
joy of the <hi>Leaguers</hi> for the Death
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after turn'd into sadness, and
at the last into despair, by the wise ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
and incomparable valour
of his Successour <hi>Henry de Bourbon,</hi>
to whom God had preordain'd the
Glory of restoring the happiness of
<hi>France,</hi> by the utter destruction of
the <hi>Leag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> which had laid it desolate.
The relation of which, is the Business

whom the deceas'd
King had at his Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
his Lawful Successor, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
took upon himself, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Title of King of <hi>France,</hi> yet
was he not acknowledg'd for such,
at the same time by the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
The <hi>Hugonots,</hi> whom he had
brought to the Assistance of his
Predecessor, were the first to
render him Homage, as no ways
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:42159:296"/>
doubting, but that the World was
now their own, and that <hi>Calvinism</hi>
shou'd be the predominant Religion
in <hi>France,</hi> under a Protestant King.
But this very Consideration, gave
great trouble and anxiety of Mind to
that prudent Prince; who plainly
saw, that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> foreseeing
this Misfortune, of which they were
extreamly apprehensive, might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
reunite themselves against him;
and that the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who were
without Comparison the weaker
Party, cou'd never be able to support
him on the Throne.</p>
            <p>In effect, there was, during all that
day, and the whole night following,
a great Contestation of Opinions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Catholique Lords of the
Army, in relation to this Affair. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, who consider'd more
their private Interest, than the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Good, were de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irous to make
advantage of a Juncture, so favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the establishment of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and to sell their Obedience at
the highest Rate they cou'd, by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Governments into Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
which had been to canto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:42159:296"/>
the Monarchy. There were
great numbers of them, led by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Motives, some by a true Zeal for
Religion, others by the Aversion
which they had for this new King,
which they disguis'd with a specious
pretence of Zeal, who wou'd abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
have it, that he shou'd instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare himself a Catholique;
which cou'd not possibly be done, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Kings Honour, or with
Provision of security to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques;
because too much of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
was evident in such an Action.
Some there were also, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
that since his Birth, and the
Fundamental Law of the Land, had
brought him to the Throne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which
his Heroick Virtues had render'd him
most worthy, it was their Duty to
acknowledge him, and to obey him
chearfully, without imposing on him
the least Conditions. But this was
it, which the greatest part of them
thought too dangerous to Religion,
which they were unwilling to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
by such a Complement.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, after this important
Affair had been throughly examin'd
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:42159:297"/>
in the Kings Council, and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly of the Catholique
Princes and Lords, which was held
in the Lodgings of <hi>Francis de Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi>
Duke <hi>de Piney,</hi> they came
to an Agreement the next Morning,
by holding a just Temperament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two Extreams. For,
without insisting on their private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
that they might act frankly,
and like Gentlemen, it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
that the King shou'd be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd;
but upon condition, that
he shou'd cause himself to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
within six months time, by
the most able Prelates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
that he shou'd restore the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the Catholique Religion, in
all places from whence it had been
banish'd, and remit the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astiques
into the full and entire Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of all their Goods; that he
shou'd bestow no Governments
on <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and that this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
might have leave to depute some
persons to the Pope, to render him an
account of their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>This Accommodation was sign'd
by all the Lords, excepting only the
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:42159:297"/>
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de
Vitry;</hi> who absolutely refus'd their
Consent to it. <hi>Vitry</hi> went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
into <hi>Paris,</hi> and there put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Service of the <hi>League;</hi>
which he believ'd at that time, to be
the cause of Religion. As for the
Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> he had no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to go over to the League,
which had so often solicited his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
from Court. But whether
it were, that being no longer
supported since his Masters Death, he
fear'd the Hatred and Resentment of
the greatest Persons about the King,
and even of the King himself, whom
he had very much offended during the
time of his Favour, in which it was
his only business to enrich himself;
or were it that he was afraid he
shou'd be requir'd to lend some part
of that great Wealth, which he had
scrap'd together; he, very unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
and more unhandsomly, began
to raise Scruples, and seem'd to be
troubled with Pangs of Conscience,
which never had been thought any
great grievance to him formerly; so
that he took his leave of the King,
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:42159:298"/>
and retir'd to his Government, with
2 or 3000 Foot, and 500 Horse,
which he had brought to the Service
of his late Master.</p>
            <p>This pernicious Example was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by many others, who under
pretence of ordering their Domestick
Affairs, ask'd leave to be gone (which
the King dar'd not to refuse them) or
suffer'd themselves to be seduc'd by
the Proffers and Solicitations of the
<hi>League;</hi> so that the King, not being
in a condition any longer to besiege
<hi>Paris,</hi> was forc'd to divide his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Troops, comprehending in
that number, those which <hi>Sancy</hi> still
preserv'd for his Use and Service.
Of the whole, he form'd three little
Bodies; one for <hi>Picardy,</hi> under the
Command of the Duke of <hi>Longuevill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
another for <hi>Champaigne,</hi> under the
Marshal <hi>d' Aumont;</hi> and himself led
the third into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he was
to receive Supplies from <hi>England;</hi> and
where, with that small Remainder
of his Forces, he gave the first Shock
to the Army of the <hi>League,</hi> which
at that time, was become more
powerful, than ever it had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:42159:298"/>
or than ever it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>In effect, those, who after the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricades
had their eyes so far open'd,
as to discover, that the <hi>League</hi> in
which they were ingag'd, was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a manifest Rebellion against
their King, seeing him now dead,
believ'd there was no other Interest
remaining on their side, but that of
Religion, and therefore reunited
themselves with the rest, to keep out
a Heretick Prince from the Possession
of the Crown. And truly this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
became at that time so very
plausible, that an infinite number of
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> of all Ranks and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
dazled with so specious an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
made no doubt, but that it
was better for them to perish, than to
endure that he whom they believ'd
obstinate in his Heresie, shou'd ascend
the Throne of St. <hi>Lewis;</hi> and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
that some other King might be
elected. Nay farther, there were
some of them, who took this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
once more, to press the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> that he wou'd assume
that Regal Office, which it wou'd be
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:42159:299"/>
easie for him to maintain, with all the
Forces of the united Catholiques, of
which he already was the Head; but
that Prince, who was a prudent man,
fearing the dangerous consequences of
so bold an Undertaking, lik'd better
at the first, to retain for himself all the
Essentials of Kingship, and to leave
the Title of it to the old Cardinal of
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was a Prisoner, and
whom he declar'd King, under the
Name of <hi>Charles</hi> the Tenth, by the
Council of the Union.</p>
            <p>At this time it was, that there
were scatter'd through all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
a vast number of scandalous
Pamphlets, and other Writings, in
which the Authors of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prove, that <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> stood lawfully excluded from
the Crown; those who were the
most eminent of them, were the two
Advocates general for the <hi>League,</hi> in
the Parliament of <hi>Paris; Lewis d'Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ans,</hi>
and <hi>Anthony Hotman.</hi> The
first, was Author of that very sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Libel, call'd <hi>The</hi> English <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi>
And the second, wrote a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,

Accident, concerning this: <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Hotman</hi> a <hi>Civilian,</hi> and Brother to

where he then was, maintain'd with
solid Arguments and great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>The Right of the Nephew against

excellent Book, which he publish'd
on this Subject, the Weakness and
false Reasoning of his Adversaries

was written by his Brother, who had
not put his Name to it.</p>

the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> who, during the
Life of the late King their Ally, durst
not declare openly against him, for
his Rebellious Subjects; now, after
his Death, acknowledging this
<hi>Charles</hi> the Tenth for King, made no
difficulty to send Supplies to the
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:42159:300"/>
Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> insomuch that he,
after having publish'd through all
<hi>France,</hi> a Declaration made in <hi>August,</hi>
by which he exhorts all <hi>French</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks

            <p>With these Forces he pass'd the

towards the King, who after he had

to him; made a show of besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Rouen,</hi> not having about him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

an Army of the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> compos'd

                  </gap>rmans, Lorrainers</hi>
and <hi>Walloons,</hi> which he had not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
cou'd have been so soon assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and which was now coming on
to overwhelm him; constrain'd him
to retire speedily towards <hi>Diepe,</hi> where
he was in danger to have been incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
round without any possibility
of Escape, but only by Sea into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
if the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:42159:300"/>
up the resolution, as he ought to
have done, from the first moment
when he took the Field, to pursue
him eagerly and without the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.
But while he proceeding with
his natural slowness, which was his
way of being wise, trifled out his time
in long deliberations, when he shou'd
have come to Action, he gave leisure
to the King to fortifie his Camp at
<hi>Arques,</hi> a League and half from
<hi>Diepe;</hi> inclosing with strong retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Castle, and the <hi>Bourg</hi> sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
on the Brow of an Hill, which
overlooks the little River of <hi>Bethune,</hi>
the Mouth of which forms the Haven
that belongs to <hi>Diepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had scarcely finish'd this great
work, wherein all his Army was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
after the Example of their
King, during three days with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
diligence; when the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> who had squandred away
his time, yet once again, in retaking
those little Places round about, of
which the King had lately possess'd
himself, drew near to <hi>Arques,</hi> with
purpose to dislodge him. But when
he had observ'd that he was too strong
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:42159:301"/>
on that side to be forc'd, he turn'd on
the Right Hand, passing the <hi>Bethune</hi>
somewhat higher, and went to post
himself on the other Hill, which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
against <hi>Arques,</hi> with the River
betwixt both Parties; from whence
he might more easily attacque the
<hi>Bourg</hi> below, and possess himself of
<hi>Polet,</hi> the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Diepe,</hi> on the
same side.</p>
            <p>But the foresight of the King had
provided for all Events in every place;
for he had carried on his Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as far as an Hospital for sick
People, called <hi>the Maladery,</hi> near the
River, and plac'd <hi>Chatillon,</hi> Colonel
of the Foot, with 900 Men in <hi>Polet,</hi>
which also was retrench'd. In the
mean time, the Duke having fix'd his
resolution to win the <hi>Fauxbourg,</hi> and
to force the Quarters at <hi>Arques,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in Battalia the sixteenth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
on the Hills, march'd the one
half of his Army at day-break towards
<hi>Polet,</hi> and lodg'd the other half at
the Village of <hi>Martingli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to attacque the fortifi'd <hi>Maladery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two attempts which he made
that day, prov'd very unsuccessful to
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:42159:301"/>
him: For the King, who in Person
hastned to <hi>Polet,</hi> putting himself at
the Head of his Forces, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Retrenchments, maintain'd
the Skirmish with great bravery du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole day, the Enemy not
daring all the while to close with him,
nor being able to gain the least inch
of ground from him, and at last,
forc'd them to retire shamefully in the
Night, into the ruins of a Village
which was burn'd, after having kill'd
and made Prisoners a great number of
their most forward men. And the
next morning, his Soldiers encourag'd
by his presence, and by the contempt
which they had of their cowardly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
went to attacque them in
their barricaded Village, where they
kill'd above an hundred of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the loss of a single man.</p>
            <p>Those of the Enemy, who were
posted at <hi>Martinglise,</hi> behav'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
much better than their Fellows,
and accordingly they came off with
greater loss: For having maintain'd
the skirmish for some time, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to dislodge those, who
had lin'd the Hedges that were near
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:42159:302"/>
the River, they drew out a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of their Men, who gave an
Assault to the <hi>Corps de garde</hi> of the
<hi>Maladery,</hi> in hope to carry the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments.
But the Mareschal <hi>de
Byron,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Arques,</hi>
and who was advanc'd to the <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery,</hi>
to sustain those who defended it,
gave orders to the Grand Prior of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Damville,</hi> to charge those
bold Leaguers, with a chosen Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of his bravest Men; who gave
in upon them with so much fury, that
he forc'd them back to <hi>Martinglise</hi> in
much disorder, after having kill'd
them 150 of their best Soldiers, and
wounded a much greater number.
The Cornet of the Duke <hi>de Nemours</hi>
was taken in this Fight, and 20 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of Note made Prisoners.</p>
            <p>This double Misfortune having
discourag'd the Army of the
League, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> lay
still four or five days together in his
Quarters, that he might give his
Soldiers a little time to recover of
their Fright; after which, having
reassembled all his Forces, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to pass the River some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:42159:302"/>
after Midnight, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque
the Retrenchments, from
which some of them had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
so vigorously, and which he
now hop'd he might carry by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise:
For this Attempt was to be
made at break of Day, and with
his whole Army, which was thrice
the number of the Royalists. But the
King having had timely notice of his
Design, was gone in Person into the
Trenches two or three hours before
day, and had dispos'd all things in
good order for their Reception; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
strongly man'd the Trenches
with his Infantry, and drawn up his
Cavalry without the Lines, to break
the first Onset of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>This hindred no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne</hi> from pursuing his Enterprise,
till he brought it to an Ingagement;
which was very long, and exceeding
sharp betwixt the two Armies. The
Kings Cavalry, gain'd immediately
some Advantage against that of the
League. The Grand Prieur, who
was afterwards Count of <hi>Anvergne,</hi>
and Duke of <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> having kill'd
with his Pistol, the <hi>Sieur de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne,</hi>
               <pb n="746" facs="tcp:42159:303"/>
who was Colonel of the
Leagu's Light Horse, drove back that
Squadron, consisting of four or five
hundred men, as far as the Standard of
the <hi>Vnion;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi>
who with a Gross of six hundred
Horse, had put him to the Retreat,
together with three Troops of Men
at Arms, who sustain'd him as far as
to the edge of the Retrenchments,
was then constrain'd to give back
himself in some disorder, to get out
of danger from the Cannon, which
furiously plai'd upon his Squadron.
But the second Onset, which the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> commanded to be
given by the Lansquenets of <hi>Colalte,</hi>
and <hi>Tremble-court,</hi> having the
Count of <hi>Belin</hi> at their Head, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd
on the Right, by the Duke
of <hi>Nemours</hi> (who had brought from
his Government of <hi>Lyons</hi> three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, with a brisk Body of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry)
and on the Left, by the Duke
of <hi>Aumale,</hi> with twelve hundred
Horse, was much more successful.</p>
            <p>For while they were furiously
combating, both on the Right and
Left, with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swisses</hi> of
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:42159:303"/>
               <hi>Galati,</hi> and <hi>Meru Montmorancy-Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
their Colonel, the Lansquenets
of the League, whether it were by
Stratagem, or through Cowardise,
cried out to the Royallists, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
that Quarter, that they wou'd
come over to their Side, and were
thereupon receiv'd within the Lines.
Their Captains in like manner, made
solemn Protestation to serve the King,
provided they might have Security,
that their Musters should be pay'd,
which was promis'd them by the
King. But while that gallant Prince
went hastily from place to place, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his Orders to repulse the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
these perfidious People, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
that the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi>
had broken the Battalion of the <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
immediately turn'd their Arms
against those who had receiv'd them;
and possess'd themselves of that part
of the Lines, which they deliver'd
to the Leaguers, who pursuing their
Fortune, made themselves Masters of
the <hi>Maladery.</hi> Insomuch, that the
Kings Forces having at the same time
to deal with their Enemies who
were without, and those who were
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:42159:304"/>
within; if the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
whose business it was to have sustain'd
those who made the Attaque with
the Gross of his Army, had taken
hold of that happy Opportunity, to
break into the Lines after them, with
all his Forces, 'tis exceeding probable,
that the greater number must have
oppress'd the less, by multitudes
pour'd in upon them, and that he
had that day obtain'd an absolute and
decisive Victory.</p>
            <p>But as he never did any thing in
hast, but when he fled for safety of
his Life, his March was to slow, to
make fitting use of so fair an Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where also his good Fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on his Speed; which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
the loss of that Advantage. For
the Count of <hi>Chastillon</hi> on the one
side, running to the Succour of the
King with the two Regiments, which
were in <hi>Arques;</hi> and on the other
side the Duke of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> and
the brave <hi>La Noüe,</hi> ranging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their Gendarmery by
his side; that valiant Prince, who
had already rallied the greatest part
of his Souldiers, whom the Surprise
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:42159:304"/>
had affrighted and put into disorder,
so furiously charg'd the Regiments
of <hi>Colalte,</hi> and <hi>Tremblecour,</hi> that they
were forc'd to quit the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and the <hi>Maladery,</hi> with more
speed than they had enter'd them,
and to retreat towards the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> who seem'd by his heavy
March and slow Advance, as if his
Business was only to receive them,
and not to sustain and second them.
And, at the same time, the Cannon
of the Castle, which had him fair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, playing terribly into his
Army, constrained him to take his
way back to his Quarters, and leave
the Victory to the King, who still
maintain'd the Possession of <hi>Arques,</hi>
from which his Enemies had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to dislodge him.</p>
            <p>And what was yet a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> four
or five days after this, fetching a long
compass, and posting himself before
<hi>Diepe,</hi> with purpose of besieging it,
he was himself besieg'd by the little
Army of the King, who being lodg'd
out of the Town over against his
Camp, ply'd him night and day with
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:42159:305"/>
perpetual Alarms, without his daring
once to come forth and make his
Approaches. Insomuch, that after
ten days stay, without having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
any thing, he rais'd this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Siege, re-pass'd this River,
and retir'd into <hi>Picardy,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that his Presence was necessary
in those Parts, to hinder the associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Towns of that Province, from
putting themselves into the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
under-hand, to beguile the
Simplicity of those poor People.</p>
            <p>This was the success of that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
of the League, which, with
their thirty thousand men, boasted
that they would take the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> or the <hi>Bearnois,</hi> as those
Rebels insolently call'd him, and bring
him Prisoner to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the
Dutchess of <hi>Montpensier</hi> and other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
had already hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Windows and
Balconies in St. <hi>Dennis-Street,</hi> from
whence they might have the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
to see him grace the Triumph
of the Duke <hi>de Mayenne</hi> with his
Captivity. But God had otherwise
ordain'd, and that memorable Fight
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:42159:305"/>
at <hi>Arques,</hi> wherein, according to all
humane probability, the King with
that handful of men, shou'd have
have fallen under the weight of so
formidable a Power, was the fatal
point of declination to the League.
For though their General had not
lost above seven or eight hundred men
in that Engagement, yet he lost in it,
the Honour and Reputation of the
party, which since that day, never
did any thing considerable, but what
made for the glory of their Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
by furnishing him with new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
to make appear his Clemency
in pardoning, or his Valour in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
them, which succeeded not
long afterwards, to his immortal
Fame.</p>
            <p>For as soon as he had receiv'd
the Succours, which he expected
from <hi>England,</hi> of four thousand men;
and that the Duke of <hi>Long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eville,</hi>
and Marshal <hi>Biron</hi> had joyn'd him
with their Forces, which they
brought from <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Champaigne,</hi>
he march'd upward against the Course
of the <hi>Seine,</hi> as far as <hi>Meulan,</hi> where
perceiving that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
               <pb n="752" facs="tcp:42159:306"/>
(who might have marched directly
towards him, if his Heart had serv'd
him for the Combat) appear'd not
in those Parts, he pass'd the River,
and on the thirty first of <hi>October,</hi> took
up his Quarters in the sight of <hi>Paris,</hi>
at the Villages of <hi>Isly, Vaugirard,
Montrouge</hi> and <hi>Gentilly,</hi> with resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the next morning to attaque
the Fauxbourgs of that great City,
which the <hi>Parisians</hi> had fortified.</p>
            <p>In order to which, he divided all
his Infantry into three Bodies, that
the Assault might be made at the
same time, in three several places.
The first under Marshal <hi>de Biron,</hi> on
the side of the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi> St. <hi>Marceau,</hi>
and St. <hi>Victor;</hi> the next, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Marshal <hi>d' Aumont,</hi> assisted by
<hi>Damville</hi> the Colonel of the <hi>Swisses,</hi>
and <hi>Bellegard</hi> the Grand Escuyer, at
the Head of the Fauxbourg St. <hi>Iac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi>
and at that of St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and
the third led on by the Sieurs <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon</hi>
and <hi>La No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> right over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Gates of St. <hi>Germain, Bussy,</hi>
and <hi>Nesle.</hi> They were sustain'd by
as many gross Squadrons of Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
at the Head of which, was the
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:42159:306"/>
Count <hi>de Soissons,</hi> on the right hand,
the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> on the left,
and the King himself in the midst; on
the side of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Iacques:</hi>
and four pieces of Cannon follow'd
each of these great Bodies, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
against the Gates of the City,
so soon as the <hi>Fauxburgs</hi> should be
won.</p>
            <p>Never was any Enterprise better
laid; so that the success of it already
seem'd infallible. For besides the
strength of the Assailants without
the Town, they held a secret Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
within it, which was dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously
manag'd by the President <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Potier, de Blanc Mesnil,</hi> who
who having freed himself out of the
Hands of <hi>Bussy,</hi> by a great sum of
Money, had gain'd a good number of
those whom the Leaguers suspected
to be Royallists, and whom they
call'd Pollitiques, by whose Assistance,
he was to make himself Master of
one of the Gates, and then deliver it
to the King.</p>
            <p>The invincible courage of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
and his inviolable fidelity, in
the service of the Kings his Masters,
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:42159:307"/>
in those troublesom and rebellious
times, will perpetuate his Memory in
all Ages, and raise a Veneration to his
Name in <hi>France,</hi> particularly in <hi>Paris,</hi>
his Native Town, which he honour'd
as much by his singular Vertue, as he
was honour'd by it in his Birth, being
descended from one of the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Families of that Great City. He
had the generosity, for the service of
his Prince and the safety of the State,
to expose himself to the imminent
danger of death, by the fury of the
Sixteen. For those brutal Wretches
fearing his great parts, his Courage
and his Vertue, which they knew
was never to be diverted from the
plain ways of Honesty and Honour,
put him twice in Prison, once in the
<hi>Bastile,</hi> and again in the <hi>Tower</hi> of the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> where he ran the hazard of
his Life, if he had not been deliver'd
by the good Offices which were done
him by some Persons, who had the
resolution to oppose the fury of those
Tyrants. And when in process of
time, he found he cou'd do no more
service to the King in <hi>Paris,</hi> he retir'd
to him who made him President of
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:42159:307"/>
that part of his Parliament which was
established at <hi>Chaalons.</hi> He had the
happiness to be Son to a Counsellor,
who acquir'd so much reputation in
the exercise of his Office, that the
Chancellor <hi>de l' Hospital</hi> has said of
him in one of his Poems, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Court shou'd erect his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Temple of Justice; and at
this day, after his death, has the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to be Grandfather to another
<hi>Nicholas de Potier,</hi> whom the Wisest
and Greatest of all Kings, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
the merit of Men, and
understands also to reward it, has
plac'd at the Head of his Parliament
of Peers.</p>
            <p>All things then being well dispos'd
(by means of the Intelligence which
was held with the President, <hi>De Blanc
Mesnil)</hi> to make the Kings Enterprise
succeed; on <hi>All Saints day,</hi> very early
in the morning, and under covert of
a thick mist, the Fortifications, and
the Head of the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi> were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd
at once in three several parts,
with so much vigor and resolution,
that they were all carryed by plain
force, in less than an hour. Seven or
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:42159:308"/>
Eight Hundred of the Defendants
were slain in the Assault, Thirteen
Pieces of Cannon were taken, and if
the Kings Artillery had come up at
the time which he design'd, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this great Prince, who at
Seven of the Clock entred the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
of St. <hi>Iacques,</hi> and was there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
with the loud acclamations of
<hi>Vive Le Roy,</hi> had made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Quarter of the University,
without much difficulty or hazard.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Sieur de Rosne,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
at that time in <hi>Paris,</hi> having
had the leisure to fortifie the Gates,
by reason of that delay, and the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> to whom he had given
notice of the Kings approach, being
entred into the Town the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with all his Forces; the King
satisfied himself with letting the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians</hi>
know by what he had done,
that the News which was industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
spread amongst them of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
at <hi>Diepe,</hi> was notoriously false.
And after having staid three long
hours in Battalia before the Town, as
it were, to reproach the weakness or
cowardise of their Commanders, who
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:42159:308"/>
durst not venture without their Walls,
he went to retake, during the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in <hi>Vandomois, Tourain, Anjou,
Mayne, Perche,</hi> and the <hi>Lower Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
the greatest part of the Towns
and Strong Places which held for the
League; which now began to destroy
it self by the same means which were
intended for its preservation. In this
following manner.</p>
            <p>Those of the <hi>Vnion</hi> endeavour'd all
they cou'd, to oblige his Holiness and
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they wou'd
openly espouse their Party, in which
at length they succeeded, through
the protestations which were made
by their Agents at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
that in case they were not spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
and powerfully assisted by both
of them, they must of necessity make
an Accommodation with the King of
<hi>Navarre;</hi> which neither the Pope
nor King <hi>Philip</hi> cou'd bear with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The First, for fear that <hi>France</hi>
shou'd fall under the Dominion of a
Prince who was an Heretick: And the
Second, because he was desirous to
foment the divisions which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, hoping to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:42159:309"/>
of them, either by reducing
the whole Kingdom into his power,
or at least by dismembring a great
part of it. In this manner, Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
as intelligent as he was, being
deluded by the Commander of <hi>Diu,</hi>
and by his Partners, who made him
believe, that the <hi>Navarrois</hi> cou'd not

part were intirely devoted to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
made, in the General Council
of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> on the part of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:42159:309"/>
very plausible and advantageous
Propositions for the ease of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
with promise of assisting them
with all the Forces of that Monarchy:
Protesting also, that his King, who
was Master of so many Countries,
the Titles of which he haughtily set
forth, pretended not to that of <hi>France,</hi>
either for himself or for his Son;
and that in recompence of those great
Succours which he intended to give
the Catholicks, he demanded nothing
more, than the honour to be solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declar'd, <hi>The Protector of</hi> France.
Now this was in effect the very thing
which most contributed to the ruin
of the <hi>League,</hi> and the safeguard of
the State; because this artificial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
joyn'd with the Instructions
of the Legat, fully opened the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne</hi>'s Eyes, and gave him the
means of discovering the intentions
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose design was to
establish their Kings Authority on the
ruins of his; and consequently, he
took up a firm resolution of opposing
their endeavours, as he always did
from that time forward, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of some honest men about him,
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:42159:310"/>
and particularly <hi>Monsieur de Villeroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That wise and able Minister of
State, who serv'd five of our Kings,
with so much Fidelity and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
having observ'd, that by reason
of some ill Offices which were done
him to the Late King his Master, he
cou'd no longer remain with safety in
the Towns which obeyed him, nor
at his own House during the War,
and that he had not been able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
so much as a Passport for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of the Kingdom, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to make his retreat to <hi>Paris</hi>
with his Father, and to enter into the
Party of the <hi>Vnion.</hi> But it may be
truly said of him that he entred into
it, as did the Loyal and Wise <hi>Hushai</hi>
into that of <hi>Absalom</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
there to destroy all the devices and
pernicious Counsels of the wicked <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel,</hi>
which only tended to the
total ruin of <hi>David</hi> the lawful King,
against whom the Capital City of his
Kingdom was revolted. In the same
manner, the <hi>Sieur de Villeroy</hi> embrac'd,
not out of pure necessity, the Party
of the <hi>League,</hi> and plac'd not himself
with the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="761" facs="tcp:42159:310"/>
who was in Actual War with his
King, but only to obtain the means,
by his good Counsels, to undermine
the purposes of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who
under pretence of endeavouring the
preservation of Religion in <hi>France,</hi>
design'd the Subversion of the State.
And as <hi>David</hi> thought it fitting, that
<hi>Hushai</hi> shou'd continue at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
without leaving <hi>Absalom,</hi> because he
well knew that he would be more
serviceable to him there, than if he
kept him near his Person; in like
manner <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who knew
the dexterity and faithfulness of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Villeroy,</hi> wou'd not that he
shou'd go out from <hi>Paris,</hi> after the
death of his Predecessor, or be with
him, because he was satisfied that
this Great Man, would be able to do
him greater Service by staying with
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> where by his
wise Remonstrations, and the credit
which he had acquir'd with that
Prince, he might break the measures
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Adherents.</p>
            <p>He continued this politique ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
to the end, and principally
on that occasion, whereon depended
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42159:311"/>
either the felicity or the unhappiness
of this Kingdom, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
which shou'd be taken: For
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> having ask'd
him his opinion, in relation to what
the Legat and <hi>Mendoza</hi> had propos'd,
he gave him easily to understand,
that all those plausible Propositions
which were made by the Legat, by
<hi>Mendoza,</hi> and the Sixteen, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only to deprive him of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and to subject him, and the
whole Party of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> under the
domination of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
wou'd not fail to usurp upon the
<hi>French,</hi> and to perpetuate the War,
thereby to maintain their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
That in his present condition,
without suffering an Head to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
above him, he had War and
Peace at his disposing, together
with the glory of having sustain'd,
himself alone, both Religion and the
State; but by acknowledging the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> for Protector of the
Kingdom, he shou'd only debase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
under the proud Title of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Master, who wou'd serve his
own interests too well, to leave him
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:42159:311"/>
the means, of either continuing the
War, or of concluding a Peace, to
the advantage of his Country.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to perswade
a man so knowing, and so prudent,
as was the Duke of <hi>Mayenne:</hi> 'Tis to
be confess'd, that he was a Self lover,
which is natural to all men; but he
was also a Lover of the Common
Good, which is the distinguishing
character of an Honest Man. Since
he cou'd not himself pretend to the
Crown, which he clearly saw it was
impossible for him to obtain, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reasons, he was resolv'd no Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner
should have it, nor even any
other but that only Person to whom
it belong'd rightfully, Religion being
first secur'd. He thereupon firmly
purpos'd from that time, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his particular interest, and
that of the State, to oppose whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
attempts should be made by the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> or by his own nearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
under any pretence or colour;
which was undoubtedly one great
cause of the preservation of the
State.</p>
            <p>For which reason, that he might
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:42159:312"/>
for ever cut off the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from all
hope of procuring their Master to be
made Protector of the Realm of
<hi>France,</hi> and consequently of having
in his hands the Government of the
Kingdom, and the concernments of
the <hi>League,</hi> under this new Title, as
the Sixteen, who were already at his
Devotion, had design'd; he politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told them in a full Assembly, that
since the cause of Religion was the
only thing, for which the <hi>Vnion</hi> was
ingage'd in this War which they had
undertaken, it wou'd be injurious to
the Pope, to put themselves under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other protection than that of his
Holiness: Which Proposition was so
gladly receiv'd by all, excepting only
the Faction of Sixteen, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
were constrain'd to desist, and
to let their pretensions wholly fall.</p>
            <p>And to obviate the design of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any other King to be Elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Old Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi>
under whose Name he govern'd all
things; he procur'd the Parliament
to verifie the Ordinance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
General of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> by which
that Cardinal, was declar'd King, and
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:42159:312"/>
caus'd him so to be Proclaim'd, in all
the Towns and Places of their party;
retaining for himself by the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
the Quality and Power of
Lieutenant General of the Crown, till
the King shou'd be deliver'd from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.
And at the same time,
to ruin the Faction of Sixteen, which
was wholly Spaniardiz'd, he broke
the Council of the <hi>Vnion:</hi> Saying,
<hi>That since there was a King Proclaim'd,
whose Lieutenant he also was, there
ought to be no other Council but his,
which in duty was to follow him whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shou'd be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> having
possess'd himself of all Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
under the imaginary Title of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and having overcome all the
designs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> took the
Field; and after having taken in the
Castle of <hi>Bois de Vincennes</hi> by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which had been invested for a
year together, he retook <hi>Pontoise,</hi> and
some other places, which hindred the
freedom of commerce; and being
afterwards willing to regain all the
passages of the <hi>Seine,</hi> thereby to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the communication of <hi>Paris</hi> with
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:42159:313"/>
               <hi>Rouen,</hi> and to have the Sea open, he
went to besiege the Fort of <hi>Meulan,</hi>
where he lost much time to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
while the Legat, against whom
the Kings Parliament at <hi>Tours</hi> had
made a terrible Decree, was labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Paris</hi> with all his might, that
no accommodation shou'd be made
with the King, not even though he
shou'd be converted.</p>
            <p>To this effect, seeing that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Sixteen, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
were extremely weaken'd, after what
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had done against
them, and that the Royalists, who
were generally call'd Politiques. had
resum'd courage, and began to say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
that it was the common duty
of all good Subjects, to unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Catholicks who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the King; he oppos'd them,
with a Declaration lately made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them by the factious Doctors
of the <hi>Sorbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne,</hi> on the tenth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
in the same year 1590. For
by that Decree it was ordain'd, <hi>That
all Doctors and Batchelors shou'd have
in abhorrence, and strongly combat, the
pestilential and damnable Opinions which
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:42159:313"/>
the Workers of Iniquity endeavour'd,
with all their force, to insinuate daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Minds of Ignorant and Simple
Men, principally these Propositions. That</hi>
Henry de Bourbon <hi>might, and ought
to be honour'd with the Title of King:
That it Conscience men might hold his
Party, and Pay him Taxes, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him for King, on condition he
turn'd Catholick,</hi> &amp;c. And then they
added, <hi>That in case any one shall refuse
to obey this Decree, the Faculty declares
him an Enemy to the Church of God,
Perjur'd and Disobedient to his Mother,
and, in conclusion, cuts him off from her
Body, as a gangreen'd Member which
corrupts the rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Decree of this force was of great
service to the Bigots of the <hi>League,</hi>
because it depriv'd the wiser sort of
the License they had taken, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the people to make peace: And
the Legat, that he might hinder any
from taking it for the time to come,
bethought himself, that a new Oath
should be impos'd on the Holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
betwixt his hands, in the
Church of the <hi>Augustines,</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by all the Officers of the Town,
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:42159:314"/>
and the Captains of the several Wards,
which was: <hi>That they shou'd always
persevere in the Holy</hi> Union; <hi>that they
shou'd never make Peace or Truce with
the King of</hi> Navarre, <hi>and that they
shou'd employ their Lives and Fortunes
in deliverance of their King</hi> Charles
the Tenth: Which was also enjoyn'd
to be taken by all the Officers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the other Companies,
no one man daring to oppose it: So
much had Fear prevail'd over Courage
and Virtue at that time, even in those
who knowing and detesting in their
hearts the injustice of that Oath,
ought rather to have dyed, than base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have acted against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>But the good success of the Kings
Arms, was in the mean time prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the means for them, of receiving
one day an happy dispensation from
himself, of that abominable Oath by
which 'tis most manifest they never
cou'd be ty'd. For after having made
himself Master of all the <hi>Lower Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
he made haste to relieve the
Fort of <hi>Meulan,</hi> and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> to raise
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:42159:314"/>
his Siege. After which, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Bridg of <hi>Poissy</hi> by plain force,
and in view of the Enemy; he led his
Victorious Army before <hi>Dreux,</hi> which
occasion'd the memorable Battel of
<hi>Ivry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the taking of that Town had
extremely streightned <hi>Paris,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
it on that side from the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
and the commerce of <hi>Normandy,
La Beauce,</hi> and the Country about
<hi>Chartres;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to relieve it with all his Forces.
For this purpose, having receiv'd a
recruit of 1500 Lansquenets and 500
Carabines, which King <hi>Philip</hi> (who
at the same time publish'd his <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festo</hi>
in justification of his Arms) had
given to the <hi>League</hi> by the Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> under the conduct of the
Count of <hi>Egmont,</hi> he pass'd the <hi>Seine</hi>
at the Bridg of <hi>Mant,</hi> and advanc'd
towards <hi>Dreux;</hi> yet resolving only
to put succours into the Town, and
to keep always on this side the River
of <hi>Eure,</hi> that he might avoid the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of a Battel. But upon the false
intelligence which he receiv'd from
his Scouts, that the King (who had
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:42159:315"/>
really quitted the Siege because he
design'd to Fight him) was gone from
<hi>Nonancour,</hi> and had taken on the left
hand the way to <hi>Verneüil,</hi> as if his
intentions had been to return to the
<hi>Lower Normandy,</hi> he was constrain'd,
against his own opinion, by the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Superior Officers, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
by the young Count <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Egmont,</hi> to pass over the Bridg of <hi>Ivry,</hi>
and to pursue the King in his feign'd
retreat, till he brought him to a Battel.</p>
            <p>But as the King, who wish'd for
nothing more than to come to a
pitch'd Field with him (which he
fear'd he would have declin'd) was
pleasingly surpriz'd to find that he
had already pass'd the River; so the
Duke was not a little amaz'd, when
he perceiv'd that, far from shunning
the Engagement, the King was
marching directly towards him, and
that he must be forc'd to make good
his challenge. But as the day was
already far spent, that every moment
there came in to the King some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
or Soldiers from the neigbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Garrisons, who were desirous to
have their share of honour in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:42159:315"/>
and that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
on his side mov'd not forward, but
only kept his ground, observing the
nature of the Place, and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
might be taken from its scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the two Armies which were
but a League distant from each other,
after some light skirmishes, retir'd to
their Camps, resolv'd on both sides
to decide the quarrel the next day,
which was <hi>Wednesday</hi> the fourteenth
of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Betwixt the River of <hi>Eure</hi> and that
of <hi>Itton,</hi> which passes by <hi>Evreux,</hi>
there lyes right over against <hi>Ivry</hi> a
fair Plain, of about a League in
breadth, free from Hedges, Ditches,
Mounds, or even so much as Bushes,
to hinder an open passage through it,
on all sides, bounded on the East with
a little Wood, and the River of <hi>Eure,</hi>
on which the Burrough of <hi>Ivry</hi> is sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate;
and on the West by the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of St. <hi>Andr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Fourcanville,</hi>
where the King was quarter'd the
Night before the Battel: In this Plain,
the Royal Army, and that of the
<hi>League,</hi> were drawn up almost at the
same time, betwixt the Hours of Eight
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:42159:316"/>
and Nine, in the following order.</p>
            <p>The King advancing five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces before the Villages of St.
<hi>André</hi> and <hi>Fourcanville,</hi> which he had
at his back, form'd his gross Squadron
of 600 Horse in five Divisions, each of
120: The first of which, wherein he
intended to Fight in Person, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of Princes, Dukes, Counts,
Marquesses, Blew Ribbands, and great
Lords, for the most part Catholiques,
the strength of his Army consisting
chiefly in those of that Religion: For
when it was known that the <hi>League,</hi>
for the maintenance of their cause,
was turn'd <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, whose hearts were
too generous to suffer that such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
shou'd be fastned on them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
that Party, and every day
came over in great numbers to the
King: So that he soon found himself
in a condition of overpow'ring the
<hi>League</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their Arms, even though
there had not been an <hi>Huguenot</hi> in
his Army; who in reality were but
an incosiderable number, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of that great multitude of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:42159:316"/>
and especially Gentlemen Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques,
which came in by whole
Troops together from all parts, and
made up almost all the strength of
his Army. And that which drew
down the Blessing and Protection of
God Almighty on it, was, that the
day before the Engagement, when it
was evident that the Enemy, who
had pass'd the River, cou'd not avoid
coming to a Battel; these Princes,
Lords, Gentlemen-Catholiques, and
Soldiers, who follow'd their example,
were all at the celebration of Mass at
<hi>Nonancour,</hi> and there communicated
together. The King, for his part,
having already in his Soul great incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to be converted, protested
the same day to those Princes and
Great Persons, that he humbly pray'd
the Almighty God, who is the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all hearts, to dispose of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in that bloody day, accordingly
as he shou'd please to judge it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for the universal good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
and in particular for the
safety and repose of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With these pious thoughts, he
plac'd himself the next morning at
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:42159:317"/>
the Head of his gross Squadron, of
six hundred Horse; he was flanck'd
on the right hand with a gross Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
of two <hi>Swisse</hi> Regiments, rais'd
from the Cantons of <hi>Soleure;</hi> and on
the left, with another Battalion of
two Regiments, of the Canton of
<hi>Glaris</hi> and of <hi>Grisons;</hi> these Battalions
being sustain'd, that on the right
hand, by the Regiment of Guards
and of <hi>Brigneux,</hi> and that on the
left, by the Regiments of <hi>Vignoles,</hi>
and of St. <hi>Iean.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensier</hi>
follow'd them, drawing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
towards the left, with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of betwixt 5 and 600 Horse,
betwixt two Regiments, one of <hi>Lans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenets,</hi>
and the other of <hi>Swisses,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by two Battalions, which were
the Flower of the French Infantry;
the Marshal <hi>d' Aumont</hi> clos'd his left,
having in his Squadron 300 good
Horse, flanck'd with two <hi>French</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
and before him, the light
Horse, in two Troops, each consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 200 men, commanded by the
Grand Prior their Colonel, and by
<hi>Givry</hi> their Marshal <hi>de Camp;</hi>
and these last had on their right
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:42159:317"/>
hand, on the same Line, the Baron
<hi>de Biron;</hi> who, with his Squadron
of 250 Horse, cover'd that of the
Duke of <hi>Montpensier;</hi> and the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
of four Cannons and two Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verines,
was plac'd upon their Left.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Marshal <hi>de
Biron,</hi> with 250 Horse, and two
French Regiments which flanck'd
him, stood on the right hand of the
gross Squadron of the King, after
the Regiment of Guards and that of
<hi>Brigneux;</hi> but somewhat backward,
that his Men might be for a Body of
reserve: And the Count <hi>Theodorick
de Schomberg,</hi> who commanded the
Squadron of Reiters, flanck'd in the
same manner by two small Bodies of
<hi>French</hi> Infantry, made the right
Wing a little hollow'd, in form of a
Crescent, like the left. Thus was
the Royal Army Marshall'd, which
consisted of betwixt 9 and 10000
Foot, and 2800 Horse, divided into
seven Squadrons, each of them with a
Plotoon of Forlorn Hope before them.</p>
            <p>The Army of the <hi>League</hi> appear'd
at the same time but posted on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
higher Ground, and more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:42159:318"/>
towards the River, than it was
the day before; being Marshall'd
much after the manner of the Kings
Forces, unless it were, that being
more numerous, as consisting of 4 or
5000 Horse, and of 12000 Foot, the
Wings of it advanc'd farther, and bent
more inward, in the form of a larger
Crescent. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
with his Cornet of about 300 Horse,
(to which the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> his
Brother by the Mothers side, joyn'd
his own Squadron, of the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Gendarms) plac'd himself just
opposite to that of the King, in the
very bottom of his Crescent, betwixt
two gross Squadrons, each of them
of 6 or 700 <hi>Lanciers,</hi> which were
<hi>Flemmings</hi> and <hi>Walloons,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Count <hi>Egmont.</hi> They were
flank'd on their Right and Left, with

               </gap>ions of <hi>Swisses,</hi> rais'd
from the Catholique Cantons, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with <hi>French</hi> Infantry, and
flanck'd with two Squadrons of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon
Carabins.</p>
            <p>Those were follow'd by two other
Squadrons, one of 5 or 600 Horse on
the Right hand, and the other by 3
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:42159:318"/>
or 400 on the Left; where their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
was plac'd, consisting of two
Culverines, and two Bastard Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
The Light Horse-men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Baron <hi>de Rosne,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
themselves on the right
hand, before a gross Squadron of
Gendarms, which sustain'd them,
and two Squadrons of Reiters, led by
the Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and <hi>Bassom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre</hi>
stood on the right Wing, with
the Regiment of Horse, commanded
by the Chevalier <hi>de Aumale,</hi> who put
them under the Conduct of his Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
that he might have liberty
to fight by the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>'s
side, in that formidable gross of 1800
Lanciers, which were oppos'd to the
Kings Squadron, not so strong as
themselves by two thirds, and only
arm'd with Sword and Pistol, there
not being in the whole Army of the
King, so much as one single Lance.
The Lansquenets of the <hi>League,</hi> and
the rest of the <hi>French Infantry,</hi> were
divided into many Battalions, which,
like those of the King, were plac'd
on the Flanks of their Squadrons;
betwixt whom, and their Battalions,
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:42159:319"/>
there was not interval enough, to
make room for the Reiters, when
they were to wheel about after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging,
which occasion'd their
great disorder.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being thus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall'd
about ten of the Clock, stood
viewing, and considering each other
for some time, but in very different Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.
There was scarcely any
thing to be seen in that of the <hi>League,</hi>
but Gold and Silver Embroideries, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
costly and magnificent Coats of
Velvet, of all sorts of Colours, and
an infinite number of Banderolles flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
about that thick Forrest of
<hi>Lances,</hi> which seem'd to threaten the
Overthrow of their Enemies at the
first Shock, before they cou'd come
up so close, as to single out their Men,
and discharge Brest to Brest; or even
so much as to hold out their Pistols. On
the other side, the Kings Army had no
other Ornament than Iron; but their
Joy sparkled in their Eyes, and all
the Soldiers march'd to the Fight, as
to a certain Victory; especially that
invincible Troop of 2 or 3000 Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which were the Flower of the
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:42159:319"/>
Army; and whom the King himself,
in plain Armour like the rest, inspir'd
with Vigor by his only Presence,
and the sprightfulness of his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, when he had
observ'd, that if he approach'd not
nearer to the Enemy, there wou'd
be no Battel, because they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
on the other side, to stand their
Ground, without quitting their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
Post; he advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them above 150 Paces, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more distance betwixt the two
Armies, than what was necessary for
the Charge; and by that motion,
which he made with so much judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Military Skill, drawing
somewhat on the left hand, that he
might have the Wind in his Back,
which otherwise had blown the
Smoak of the Powder in the Faces
of his Soldiers, he came up so close
to the Enemy, that it was no longer
possible to avoid the Battel.</p>

was both a great Captain, and in
spight of his natural Heaviness, a
brave Soldier, when he was once
come to a Resolution of fighting, all
he did, was to show to the first ranks
of his Army, the Crucifix, which a
jolly Fryar, who had said publick
Prayers, carried before him: He
wou'd have it understood by this only

            <p>It was almost Noon, when the King

part the cause of gaining the Battel
of <hi>Senlis,</hi> was coming up within a
quarter of a League of the Field of
Battel, with 2 or 300 Gentlemen,
whom he brought with him out of
<hi>Picardy;</hi> in which Country, almost
all the Noblemen and Gentlemen,
who had been the first to sign the
<hi>League,</hi> had now totally relinquish'd
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:42159:321"/>
it. But that the courage of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
might not cool, who were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be at blows with the Enemy,
he satisfy'd himself with bidding the
<hi>Sieur de Vic,</hi> who was Sergeant Major
General, to show them the Post he
had appointed for them, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
on their Arrival, they too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
up, with resolution to signalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that day. This being order'd,
without more delay he gave the sign
of Battel, and the work began with
the discharge of their Cannon, which
was so well perform'd by the Master
of the Ordnance, <hi>Philibert de la Guiche,</hi>
that before those of the <hi>League</hi> began
to play, nine Cannonades were given
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Royalists, which did great exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
on the Enemy, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shatter'd the Squadrons of the Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Thus, after three or four vollyes
on either side, two gross Squadrons,
made up of <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and
flank'd with Lansquenets, advanc'd,
and came up to the charge, against
the Left Wing of the Royal Army,
that they might put themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
covert from the storm of the Great
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:42159:321"/>
Guns. But the Marshal <hi>d' Aumont,</hi> who
was in that Wing, having advanc'd
likewise the better half of the way
to meet them, drove upon them so
furiously, that they turn'd their backs,
and pursuing them with slaughter to
the entry of the little Wood, which
bounds the Plain, he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to his Post, according to the
Orders which he had receiv'd from
the King.</p>
            <p>While these men were so ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Reiters on the Right Hand,
being desirous to gain the Cannon,
by which their Squadron had been so
miserably torn, went to Charge the
Kings light Horsemen with so much
fury, that they forc'd them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to give back; and at the same
time two other Squadrons of <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings</hi>
and <hi>Walloons,</hi> seeing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shaken, advanc'd to break them.
But the Baron of <hi>Biron</hi> on the one side,
and the Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> on the
other, charging them on the Flanks,
first stopp'd them, then broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and afterwards pierc'd quite
through them; and the Light Horse,
who had this time given them to
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:42159:322"/>
rally, returning to the charge, the

               </gap>ers gave ground, most basely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning
the <hi>Walloons;</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to make their retreat, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to save themselves, through the
intervals which were too narrow,
they overturn'd their own men, and
put all things in a terrible con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usion,
notwithstanding the care which was

Colonel, who was never able to rally
them, and therefore put himself into
the Squadron of <hi>Walloons;</hi> desiring
rather to perish with those valiant
men, who were inclos'd on all sides,
and cut in pieces, than to save himself
by flying with his own Runaways.</p>
            <p>In this manner the Battel was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
on either part, with extreme
obstinacy for some time, and all the
Squadrons of both Armies fell in so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously,
that they were mix'd with
each other; excepting only that of
Mareschal <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Biron,</hi> who with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Reserve, made it his business to
hinder the Enemy from rallying,
which he perform'd. But that which
decided the fortune of this great day,
and assur'd the Victory to the King,
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:42159:322"/>
was his own Heroick Valour, which
he made conspicuous, by combating
that formidable Squadron of 1800
Lanciers, which the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
had made so strong for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than to charge with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of number upon that of the King,
not at all doubting but if he cou'd
break that Body, the Victory wou'd
be his own.</p>
            <p>Observing then that the Reiters
were absolutely routed, and fearing
lest they shou'd disorder his men, by
falling back upon them; he drew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him that great Body of Horse,
and caus'd 400 chosen Carabins to
advance first, who were all of them
arm'd Head and Breast, whom the
Count <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> who led them
up, commanded to discharge within
five and twenty Paces of the first
Rank of the Royal Squadron, with
intention to clear it. And at the
same time, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
who appear'd at the Head of his Men,
mounted on a <hi>Turkish</hi> Horse, the
most beautiful that cou'd be seen,
made up furiously, with his Lance
couch'd, and follow'd by the gross of
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:42159:323"/>
his Cavalry, to the Kings own
Troop, which he believ'd to be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
well shaken, by that sudden and
terrible Discharge: who, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
sustain'd the fury of that Shock,
keeping firm in their Saddles; and
some there were, who had three Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
broken on them, without loosing
of their Stirrups.</p>
            <p>But the most admirable part of this
Encounter, was, that the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
twice the length of his Horse
before the Front of his Squadron, with
his Pistol in his hand, thrust into the
midst of that thick Wood of Lances,
and charg'd with so much ardour of
Courage into their Body, that he gave
them to understand by this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Action, he was no less, a most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Soldier, than a most expert and
great Commander. And indeed, he
was so bravely follow'd, by the Princes
and Lords of that Squadron, whom
his Example had rais'd to emulation,
that after an obstinate Dispute,
which endured a long quarter of an
hour, and was maintain'd with
Swords and Pistols, in that confus'd
Medly, where the Lances were of
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:42159:323"/>
no farther use; this great Squadron
of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> was broken,
dispers'd, and cut in pieces, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
routed; neither cou'd the Duke
(who that day perform'd all the parts
of a valiant Soldier, and a great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
even in the opinion of the King
himself) either stay their Flight, or
rally them afterwards, with all the
endeavours he cou'd use: Insomuch,
that seeing himself almost inclos'd,
he retir'd amongst the last of his men,
to the Bridge of <hi>Ivry,</hi> which he
caus'd to be broken down, after he
had pass'd the greatest part of his
routed Army over it, and then for his
own safety fled to <hi>Mant.</hi> The rest,
with the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>d' Aumale, Rosne, Tavannes,</hi>
and <hi>Bassompierre,</hi> having taken the
way of the Plain, escap'd to <hi>Chartres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Victorious
Party were in great trouble for the
King, who had vanish'd out of their
sight in that gross Squadron of 1800
Lances, into which he had charg'd
before the rest; when at length they
beheld him returning, and bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft
his bloody Sword; having defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:42159:324"/>
three Cornets of <hi>VValloons,</hi> which
were left amongst the two Battalions
of <hi>Swisses,</hi> and came desperately upon
him, after he had Charg'd through

               </gap>h loud Acclamations

the Victory being assur'd and absolute,
no other Enemies remaining in the

being forsaken by their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,

those who provided early for their

on condition they shou'd hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
keep more faithfully the Treaty
of Alliance which they had made
with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the Count of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the

slowly after him, under the Command

            </p>
            <p>This was the success of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Battel of <hi>Ivry,</hi> wherein the

strength. Almost all the Infantry of
that Party was cut in pieces, or taken

Marquess <hi>de Nesle,</hi> the Count of
<hi>Choisy,</hi> the Sieurs <hi>d'O, de Rosny, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,
Monloüet,</hi> and about twenty
other Gentlemen, who were all cur'd
of their Wounds.</p>
            <p>That which was yet more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
remarkable, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates
the peculiar care which
God Almighty took of his Majesties
rightful Cause, was, that on the
same day, <hi>Iean Louis, de Rouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,</hi>
Count of <hi>Randan,</hi> General
of the <hi>League</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd
the Town of <hi>Issoire,</hi> lost both
his Life and his little Army; which
was entirely defeated by the Marquess
of <hi>Curton,</hi> Head of the <hi>Royalists;</hi> and
that the Sieur <hi>de Lansac,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to have surpris'd <hi>Mans</hi> for the
<hi>League,</hi> whose Party, after having
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:42159:326"/>
once abandon'd it, he had again e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spous'd,
was bravely repuls'd from
before the Town. To conclude,
since that happy day, the Royal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had a continu'd series of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in every Province of <hi>France,</hi> and in
a multitude of occasions, which it is
not my business to relate paticularly;
because my Design is only to relate
the most essential affairs of the <hi>League,</hi>
and not to involve my self too far in
the History of <hi>France,</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
much more than I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>Following therefore this Model,
which I have propos'd to my self, that
which I ought to observe on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
is, that this glorious Victory,
had caus'd the immediate and total
ruine of the <hi>League;</hi> if after the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of <hi>Vernon,</hi> and <hi>Mant,</hi> which
yielded the next day, the King, who
was now Master of all the Passages of
the <hi>Seine,</hi> as far up as <hi>Paris,</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself, with his victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
before that Capital City of his
Kingdom, which at that time, was
neither provided with Victuals, nor
Ammunition, nor Governour, nor
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:42159:326"/>
Garrison, and wherein the People,
who found themselves destitute of
all these things, were already waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a general Consternation.
For 'tis exceeding probable, that the
Politiques, doubly encourag'd by his
Victory and by his Presence, had
carry'd it over the Sixteen, and had
open'd the Gates to him. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this very Counsel was given
him by the wise <hi>La Noüe;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were that the Marshal <hi>de Biron,</hi>
who had no great inclinations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to his Country-House, and mind
his Gardening, desir'd to spin out the
War, and therefore gave him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Advice; or that perhaps it was
his own Opinion, as not believing
himself yet strong enough for such an
Attempt, he continued fifteen days at
<hi>Mante,</hi> without enterprising any
thing against the <hi>Leaguers;</hi> to whom
he gave leisure by that means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
Courage, and put themselves
into a condition of Resistance.</p>
            <p>In effect, the false Relations which
were spread amongst the People, to
sooth them into a Belief, that the
Loss which they had receiv'd, was
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:42159:327"/>
not so considerable as was at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
the Sermons of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the Promises of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
the Presence of the Legate, and of the
Arch-bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who not long
before had been ransom'd by the
League, and the good order which
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had caus'd to
be establish'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> which he left
well garrison'd with his Souldiers,
before he went from <hi>St. Dennis,</hi> to
draw near to the <hi>Law-Countries,</hi> from
whence he expected new supplies:
all these Considerations put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
buoyd up their sinking spirits,
and gave them new courage, so that
there appear'd no manner of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Town: but all was hush'd
and peaceable, and a resolution taken
to defend themselves to the last Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
            <p>As indeed they did not long time
after, during the Siege of <hi>Paris,</hi> so
much to the wonder and amazement
of Mankind, that it may be plac'd in
the number of those extraordinary
and admirable accidents which may
be call'd the Miracles of History;
and which wou'd never enter into the
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:42159:327"/>
belief of men, if they were not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with an infinite number of
most credible witnesses. For, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
the King well knowing, that
the end of the War, and of the
<hi>League,</hi> depended absolutely on the
taking of <hi>Paris,</hi> resolv'd to defer no
longer the laying hold on that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he believ'd to be still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his reach, not perceiving that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
he had let it slip by his long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.
He departed therefore out of
<hi>Mante</hi> on the last of <hi>March,</hi> with his
Army, consisting at that time, of
12000 Foot, and betwixt 3 and 4000
Horse, and during the Moneth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi>
made himself Master of <hi>Corbeil,
Melun, Bray, Montereau-faut-Yonne,
Lagny, Beaumont</hi> upon <hi>Oyse, Provins,</hi>
and the Bridges of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Intelligence which he held in
<hi>Sens,</hi> having not succeeded, he gave
two brisk Assaults to it, in both
which, his men were vigorously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd,
by the Lord <hi>Chanvallon, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
de Harlay,</hi> who there command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the <hi>League.</hi> Notwithstanding
which, that great Prince, who was
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:42159:328"/>
a true lover of all brave men, being
afterwards acquainted with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Parts, and his inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
repos'd great confidence in him;
insomuch that he plac'd him with the
Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to retain him,
as he always did, in the Interests of
<hi>France.</hi> But the King, unwilling to
loose more time, on a place which
was so well defended, and which, if he
shou'd take, wou'd contribute nothing
to the Execution of his main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
as also knowing, that by means
of the Towns and Bridges, of which
he already stood possess'd, he held
shut up the four Rivers that supply'd
<hi>Paris;</hi> he went from thence, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
that City, about the end of the
Moneth, without expecting certain
Conferences which the <hi>League</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
as he believ'd, either to delay,
or to divert him. And that he might
have the freedom of sending out Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
through the whole adjoyning
Country, on both sides of the <hi>Seine,</hi>
thereby to hinder the Town from
receiving Provisions by Land, he made
a Bridge of Boats somewhat below
<hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lans;</hi> so that <hi>Paris</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:42159:328"/>
invested on all Quarters.</p>
            <p>There were some, and amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>La <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,</hi> with the greatest part
of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who had not much
kindness for the <hi>Parisians,</hi> desir'd that
the Town might be assaulted as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
it might be carry'd by plain
force at the first attempt, and that
the Citisens, who are never so very
stout, as when they have got behind
their Barricades, wou'd not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
so couragious upon the Works.
This was their Opinion; but it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
appear'd, by the Skirmishes
and other Tryals which were made
in the beginning of the Siege, and by
which, the Kings Party were no
great gainers; that those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had taken no just measures.

               </hi> St. <hi>Martin,</hi>
was beaten off with loss; and learnt,
to his cost, by a Musquet Shot, which
wounded him in the Thigh, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
him from fighting, that he had
to do with galiant men, who were
neither to be vanquish'd at the
Breach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor by scaling, so easily as
he believ'd. There were at that
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:42159:329"/>
time in <hi>Paris,</hi> not above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty thousand Souls; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
almost half the Inhabitants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the consequences of a
Siege, were departed out of it and
the wealthier sort of Citisens, who
had the Courage to continue there,
had sent off their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to other Places. But a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
which the <hi>Parisians</hi> had receiv'd,
of 5 or 6000 old <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers,
<hi>Lansquenets, Swisses,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and
50000 Citisens well arm'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to perish in the Defence of
their Town and Religion, (for which
they were perswaded that they
fought) had not easily been forc'd by
that little Army, which rather
seem'd to block them up, than to
besiege them.</p>
            <p>And besides the young and valiant
Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> their Governour,
had exellently well provided for all
things, during more than a moneth,
which he had to prepare himself for
the sustaining of this memorable
Siege, wherein by his Courage and
good Conduct, he acquir'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of an old experienc'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:42159:329"/>
For he had fortify'd all the weakest
parts, repair'd the Breaches of the
Walls, new rais'd the Ramparts and
the Terrasses, drawn large Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both within and without the
heads of the <hi>Fauxbourgs,</hi> prepar'd
Chains, and Barrels fill'd with Earth,
to make Barricades for all the Streets,
that the Enemies might be stopp'd at
every Passage, while, in the mean
time, they were to be slaughter'd
with Musket Shot, and Stones from
Windows, after they shou'd have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
the Town. He had earth'd up
the greatest part of the Gates, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
down the Houses, which might
have been of Service to the Enemy;
cast and mounted above threescore
pieces of Cannon, which were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Ramparts, and shut up the
River both above and below, by
massy Chains, sustain'd by Palisades,
and defended by strong <hi>Corps de
Guard,</hi> to preserve the Town from
being surpriz'd, and to hinder the
Entrance into it at low water. In
conlusion, he had forgot nothing, that
cou'd possibly be necessary for a stout
Defence, and for the repulsing Force
by Force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="800" facs="tcp:42159:330"/>For which cause, the King, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the difficulty better than
those about him, who, at that time,
listen'd rather to their Passion than
their Reason, being not of Opinion,
that his Enterprise cou'd succeed by
Assault, in the present condition of his
Affairs, always rejected that Advice;
besides loving his Subjects with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Affection, and principally <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
as he has always made it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
he cou'd never resolve on the
Destruction of the fairest Flower in
his Crown, and the noblest City in
the Universe, by taking it in the way
which they advis'd; which had been
to expose it to the Fury of his Men
of War, and especially of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi>
who, in revenge of their
Massacre at St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> wou'd
have lay'd it desolate with Fire and
Sword.</p>
            <p>He resolv'd therefore to take it by
Famine, not doubting, but that all
the Passages for Provisions being shut
up, it wou'd soon be forc'd to a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
for want of Bread. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
his Design was very reasonably
lay'd, and according to all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:42159:330"/>
ought to have succeeded, if
his Expectation had not been deceiv'd,
by one of the most wonderful Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of invincible Patience, or rather
extream Obstinacy, in that almost
unimaginable Distress, to which they
were reduc'd.</p>
            <p>I shall not here describe it in all the
exactness of its Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umstances; 'tis
enough if I barely say, what is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known to all the World, that
the common Provisions, which were
well husbanded, and distributed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sparingly, were consum'd in the
month of <hi>Iune;</hi> that the <hi>Fauxbourgs</hi>
being taken in <hi>Iuly,</hi> they were shut
up in the Town, and restrain'd from
going out to search for Herbs, Leaves,
and Roots, in the neighbouring Fields,
and in the Ditches: that after they
had eaten their Horses, Asses, Dogs,
and Cats, they were reduc'd in <hi>August,</hi>
to Rats and Mice, and then to Skins
and Leather, and an abominable kind
of Bread, which instead of Meal, was
made of the Powder of dead mens
Bones, taken out of the Church-yard
of St. <hi>Innocent;</hi> that there were
some, whom that Famine (by which
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:42159:331"/>
twenty thousand persons dyed)
brought to those horrible Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are mention'd in the Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all which Miseries, 'tis
wonderful to consider, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians,</hi>
accustom'd to Plenty, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to live luxuriously, chose rather
to endure this dreadful Famine to the
end, and to expose themselves to
certain Death, whose terrible Image
they had dayly before their Eyes in
every Street, than to hear the least
word of a Surrender.</p>
            <p>And questionless, they had many
Inducements, which contributed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their
obstinate Resolution of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so long and so contentedly. The
Examples of the Princesses and great
Ladies, who satisfy'd Nature with a
very small Pittance of Oat Bread,
taught them to bear those Miseries
with constancy of Mind, which their
Superiours of a more delicate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sex, supported with so much
chearfulness of Spirit. Add to this,
the great Care and Vigilance of their
Heads, to hinder Tumults and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the immediate Execution
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:42159:331"/>
of Mutineers. Then the Awe and
Terrour which was struck into them
by the <hi>Sixteen,</hi> who had resum'd
their first Authority in the Town;
and who commonly threw into the
<hi>Seine,</hi> without judicial Process, or
form of Law, all such as were sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to hold Intelligence with the
King, or to make the least mention
of a Treaty. But the most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
consideration, was the great Alms,
which were daily distributed amongst
the Poor, by the Order, and at the
Charges of the Legat <hi>Cajetan,</hi> the
Archbishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> the Spanish
Embassador, the Wealthiest of the
City Companies, and the Cardinal
<hi>Gondy</hi> Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
inclos'd himself within those
Walls, for the Relief and Ease of his
poor Flock. Besides, they had no
small Encouragement from the false
Reports which the Dutchess of
<hi>Montpensier,</hi> who was very skilful in
coining News, caus'd dayly to be
spread about <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by Letters, whether true or forg'd,
which she said she had receiv'd from
her Brother the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
               <pb n="804" facs="tcp:42159:332"/>
from time to time, of speedy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours:
All which Considerations,
serv'd not a little to encourage the
People, and to inure them to that
wonderful sufferance of their Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But after all, it must be ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
acknowledg'd, that the Cause
which principally produc'd this great
Effect, was the Zeal of Religion,
which was easily inspir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d into the
People of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the great care
which they took to perswade them,
as really they did, that it was no less
than to betray it, and expose it to
the inevitable danger of being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroy'd, as had happen'd in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
if they shou'd submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a King, who made an open
Profession of <hi>Calvinism.</hi> For in fine,
they omitted no manner of Arts, and
of Perswasions, to make this Opinion
be swallow'd by the Multitude, and
consequently to harden them against
the fear of Death it self, rather than
endure the Dominion of a Prince
who was an Heretique. In the first
place, they made use of the <hi>Sorbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
which (as their Liberty was
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:42159:332"/>
then oppress'd) immediately made a
new Decree, on the seventh of <hi>May,</hi>
in which it is declar'd, <hi>That</hi> Henry
de Bourbon, <hi>being a relaps'd Heretick,
and excommunicated personally by our
Holy Father; there was manifest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that he wou'd deceive the Church,
and ruine the Catholique Religion,
though he shou'd obtain an exteriour Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and that therefore the</hi> French
<hi>are oblig'd in Conscience, to hinder
him with all their Power, from coming
to the Crown, in case King</hi> Charles <hi>the
Tenth shou'd dye, or even if he shou'd
release his Right to him; and that, as
all such who favour his Party, are
actually Deserters of Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in mortal Sin, which makes
them liable to eternal Damnation; so
also, by the same reason, all such as shall
persevere to the Death in resistance of
him, as Champions of the Faith, shall
be rewarded with the Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the occasion of this new Decree,
a General Assembly was held at the
Town-House, where all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
were sworn to dye, rather
than to receive an Heretick King.
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:42159:333"/>
This Oath was renew'd yet more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
on the Holy Evangelists, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Hands of the Legat, at the
foot of the great Altar of the Church
of <hi>Nostredame,</hi> after a general Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
at which, besides the Clergy,
were present, all the Princes and
Princesses, and all the Companies, the
Bishops and Abbots, the Colonels and
Officers, and the Persons of Quality,
follow'd by vast Multitudes, of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
where the Reliques of all the
Churches in <hi>Paris</hi> were carryed. This
Oath, reduc'd into Writing, was
sent to every House, by the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers
of the several Wards, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
all persons to take it. After
which, the Parliament made an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
prohibiting, on pain of
Death, that any one shou'd speak of
making a Composition with the King
of <hi>Navarre.</hi> and above all the rest,
the Preachers of the <hi>League,</hi> and the
famous <hi>Cordelier Panigarole,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Ast,</hi> with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Learned
Jesuit, who both acted in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them; the Divines of the
Legat <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who preach'd like the
rest, during the Siege, encourag'd
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:42159:333"/>
their Auditors to suffer all Miseries,
rather than subject themselves to an
Heretick, assuring them, according
to the Decree of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> that
if they shou'd loose their Lives for
such a Cause, they dy'd undoubtedly
for the Faith, and were to be esteem'd
no less than Martyrs.</p>
            <p>There also happen'd an Accident,
which as fantastical and ridiculous as
it appear'd, was yet of use to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the People, and to fortifie them
in their Belief, that it was their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make opposition, even to Death,
against the setting up an Heretick
King. For above twelve hundred
Ecclesiasticks, as well Seculars as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars,
amongst whom, were the
most reform'd, and most austere of
every Order, such as were the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusians,
Minimes, Capuchins,</hi> and <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illants,</hi>
made a kind of Muster, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Rank and File through the
Streets, wearing over their ordinary
Habits, the Arms of Foot Soldiers,
having <hi>William Roze</hi> the Bishop
of <hi>Senlis</hi> at their Head, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of the Crucifix and the Blessed
Virgin flanting in their Standard, to
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:42159:334"/>
make it appear, that since Religion
was the Matter in dispute; their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
as peaceable as it was, gave
them no Dispensation in that Case,
from hazarding their Lives in War
like other Men, and that they were
all resolv'd to dye with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
in the Defence of Faith.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Paris</hi> ran to this Spiritual Show,
which was like to have prov'd fatal to
the Legat; for making a Stop with
his Coach at the end of <hi>Pont Nostre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,</hi>
to behold this noble Spectacle
of the Church Militant; while they
were giving a <hi>Salve</hi> in honour of him,
one of those good Fathers, who had
borrow'd his Musket from a Citisen,
and knew not that it was charg'd
with Bullets, let fly, with no worse
Intention than to show his Manhood,
and fairly kill'd one of his men who
sate in the Boot; which caus'd the
Prelate, who lik'd not that unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Proceeding very well, to make
haste away for his own Security.
But this made no other Impression in
the <hi>Parisians,</hi> than to confirm them
in their Resolution: For when they
beheld their Confessours and Guides
<pb n="809" facs="tcp:42159:334"/>
of their Consciences, in that War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Posture, they believ'd such men
wou'd never have appear'd in Arms,
unless they were satisfy'd that it was
for the Cause of God, in which it
was their common Duty both to live
and dye.</p>
            <p>But what most confirm'd them in
this Belief, was, that the King, whose
hour of Conversion was not yet come,
wou'd never hear speak of it, in any
Overtures which were made to no
purpose for a Peace. And though
the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> whom he had
invited by a kind Letter to Submission,
since he had already satisfy'd his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the full, had protested, that
he wou'd be the first to throw himself
at his Feet, and that he wou'd make
it his Busines too, that <hi>Paris</hi> shou'd
acknowledge him, provided he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
into the Church, he always
rejected that Proposition. On which
account, whatsoever solemn Promises
he made, that he wou'd maintain the
Catholique Religion; the <hi>Parisians,</hi>
(to whom their Preachers, who had
an absolute Dominion over their
Consciences, still represented the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:42159:335"/>
of <hi>England</hi>) cou'd never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to confide in him. Thus, being
perswaded that it was impossible for
them to surrender, without giving up
their Religion by the same Act; they
had the Courage, in the midst of their
Sufferings, to expect the great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
brought to their Relief at the end of
<hi>August.</hi> And that excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
without giving Battel, (to
which the King, who was constrain'd
to retire with all his Forces from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paris,</hi> cou'd never force him, so
well he was retrench'd at <hi>Clay</hi>) had
the Glory to execute his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and after his own manner, by
taking <hi>Lagny</hi> in the sight of the
King, and freeing <hi>Paris,</hi> which was
the end of his Undertaking. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the general History of <hi>France,</hi>
to describe all the particular Passages
of that famous Expedition; I shall
only say (that I may omit nothing
which precisely concerns my Subject)
that before the King had licens'd the
Nobility and Gentry which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, to depart, and divided his
Forces into several small Bodies, as
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:42159:335"/>
he afterwards did, he wou'd needs
make a last Attempt upon the
Town.</p>
            <p>To which effect, on Saturday night,
the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> he convey'd
secretly three or four thousand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Soldiers into the <hi>Fauxbourgs,</hi> St.
<hi>Iacques,</hi> and St. <hi>Marceau,</hi> under the
Leading of the Count <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> to
scale the Walls betwixt those two
Gates after Midnight, while the Town
was buried (as it were) in the depth
of Sleep. For he believ'd not that
the <hi>Parisians,</hi> who knew that his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was drawn up in Battalia on the
Plain of <hi>Bondy,</hi> all Saturday, wou'd
keep themselves upon their Guard,
on that side which he purpos'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque.
But as some notice had
been given of his Design, and that
besides, his Troops cou'd not possibly
enter those <hi>Fauxbourgs,</hi> without
noise, the Allarm was immediately
taken, the Bells were rung, and the
Citizens in Crouds mounted the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
especially, where he meant
to have planted his Ladders. But at
last, when after a long Expectation,
no Enemy appear'd, and that no
<pb n="812" facs="tcp:42159:336"/>
more noise was heard, because the
Kings Soldiers, who were cover'd by
the <hi>Fauxbourgs,</hi> made not the least
motion, and also kept a profound Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
it was taken only for a false
Alarm. The Bells ceas'd ringing,
and every man retir'd to his own
Lodging, excepting only ten Jesuites,
who being more vigilant than the
rest, continu'd all the remainder of
that Night on the same Post, which
was not far distant from their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Soldiers of
<hi>Chastillon,</hi> who were softly crept
down into the Ditch, began about
four of the Clock in the Morning, to
set up their Ladders, being favour'd
by a thick Mist, which hindred them
from being discern'd. The Design
was well enough lay'd, for there
needed not above ten or twelve men
to have got over into the Town, who
might have open'd the Gate of St.
<hi>Marceau</hi> to their Fellows, by means of
a Correspondence which was held
with a Captain belonging to that
Quarter; after which it had been
easie to have possest themselves of the
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:42159:336"/>
University, and consequently both
the Town and the City, wou'd have
submitted themselves to the King,
rather than have expos'd <hi>Paris</hi> as a
Prey to two great Armies, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> at
the Gate of St. <hi>Martin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Vigilance of the ten Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites,
broke all these Measures which
were so justly taken; for having
heard a Noise in the Ditch, which
was made by thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who were setting
up their Ladders against the Walls;
they cry'd out as loud as they cou'd
stretch their Voices, to Arms, to
Arms. Notwithstanding which, the
Soldiers were still getting up, and the
first of them, who was ready to leap
upon the Rampart, happen'd to
show his Head, just where one of
those honest Fathers was plac'd;
who gave him such a lusty knock,
with an old Halbard, which he had
in his hand, as he stood Centry, that
he broke it in two upon his Head,
and tumbled him down with the
Blow into the Ditch. The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of this valiant Jesuite, did as
mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h to two other Soldiers, and a
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:42159:337"/>
fourth, who was already got up, and
held his Ladder with one Hand, to
descend into the Town, and with the
other a broad Curtle-axe, to cleave
the Head of the first who shou'd op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him, was stopp'd short by two
of these Fathers, who, each of them,
with a Partizan, so vigorously
push'd him, that notwithstanding all
the Blows which he made in vain,
at too great a distance, for fear of
their long Weapons, they forc'd him
at the last to quit his Ladder, and
having hurt him in the Throat, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn'd
him backward into the
Ditch after his Fellows.</p>
            <p>The two first Citizens who ran to
their Relief,<note place="margin">Ann. 1591.</note> were the Advocate
<hi>William Balden,</hi> and the famous Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller
<hi>Nicholas Nivelle;</hi> these two,
finding one of those Jesuites grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
with a Soldier, who was get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up in spight of the poor Fathers
weak resistance, came into the rescue,
and lent him their helping Hands to
kill him: And the Advocate imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
turning himself to another,
who had already got upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
discharg'd so terrible a Reverse
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:42159:337"/>
upon his right hand, with his Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion,
that he cut it sheer off, and
sent him headlong to the Bottom; in
the mean time, the Alarm being
once more warmly taken in the
Town; the Citizens and Soldiers
made haste to Man the Walls, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on that side, and heaps of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Straw were thrown down to light
the Ditch, and make discovery what
was doing below; whereupon the
Kings Soldiers being easily discern'd,
left both their Ladders and their
Attempt, which now cou'd not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
succeed, and retir'd to the Body of
their Army.</p>
            <p>So little was there wanting to
bring about so great an Enterprise:
For 'tis most certain, that if these ten
Jesuits had done like the Townsmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and had gone back to take their rest
in their College, after the first Alarm
which was held for false, the King
had that day entred <hi>Paris.</hi> But the
Divine Providence had reserv'd that
happiness for a time more favourable
to Religion, and to that City; into
which the King, being Victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>League,</hi> was ordain'd to make
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:42159:338"/>
a peaceable entrance, after he had
solemnly profess'd the Catholique
Faith.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the affairs of the
<hi>League,</hi> far from being advanc'd after
this expedition, which was so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> were soon
after reduc'd into a worse estate than
formerly, by reason of that horrible
division which arose among their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by the prudent conduct of the
King. For perceiving that his hopes
were frustrate of drawing them to a
Battel, who were now at their ease,
after the taking of <hi>Lagny,</hi> and had
their Quarters securely extended in
<hi>La Brie;</hi> he remanded one part of
his Forces to refresh themselves in
the Neighbouring Provinces, and put
another into Garrisons, in such places
as might serve to hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with the <hi>Parisians,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in St. <hi>Denis,</hi> which he had
taken during the Siege of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
where the Chevalier <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> who
endeavour'd to retake it some small
time afterwards, was kill'd when he
was almost in possession of the place.</p>
            <p>Himself, in the mean time, with a
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:42159:338"/>
flying Army beat the Field, to cut off
Provisions from <hi>Paris,</hi> and from the
Army of the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> who
having lost much time in taking <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beil,</hi>
which was immediately retaken
from the <hi>League,</hi> was constrain'd to
return into <hi>Flanders,</hi> having always
the King at his heels, who perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
harass'd him, and put him to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great inconveniences and hardships,
during his march to the Frontiers of
<hi>Artois<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for so far he took the pains to
bring him on his Journy. After which
he made another attempt on <hi>Paris,</hi>
which he hop'd to have surpris'd by
the Gate of St. <hi>Honorè,</hi> with many
Waggons loaden with Meal, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by stout Soldiers disguis'd in the
habits of Countrymen. The strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
not succeeding, because there
was some suspicion of the design, he
reassembled all his Forces, and went
to lay Siege to <hi>Chartres,</hi> which after
a vigorous defence of more than two
months, not being reliev'd by the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> was constrain'd at
last to come to a surrender.</p>
            <p>It was particularly by the Valour,
Policy, and Industry of the Brave
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:42159:339"/>
Count of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> Colonel of the
<hi>French</hi> Infantry, that this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
place was taken: For that young
Lord, who had as much understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as courage, and was very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
especially in the Mathematicks,
invented a kind of wooden Bridge,
which he cast by a new sort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
over the Ditch; by means of
which they cou'd pass under covert,
and without danger, as far as the foot
of a great breach, which he had made
on the side of <hi>Galardon.</hi> After which,
<hi>Monsieur de la Bourdaisiere,</hi> who had
bravely defended himself till then,
seeing there was no longer a possibility
of resistance, made his capitulation;
which the King, always generous,
and a great Lover of valour even in
his Enemies, granted him on very
honourable terms.</p>
            <p>This was the last action of <hi>Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
who having serv'd his Prince all
along with so much gallantry, ended
his Life in the flower of his Age; dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not long after at his House of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon</hi>
on the <hi>Loire,</hi> of a disease which
he had brought upon himself, by his
over-labour at a Siege, wherein he
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:42159:339"/>
had acquir'd so just a reputation and
so much glory. He was extremely
lamented even by the Catholiques,
who had observ'd in him a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to renounce his Calvinism
in short time, as he who already had
begun to find out the falsities of that
opinion; tho' the Admiral <hi>de Coligny</hi>
his Father, who was a strong <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi>
had caus'd him to be carefully
instructed in that way. But that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
which he liv'd not to enjoy,
was reserv'd for his younger Brother,
<hi>Monsieur d' Andelot,</hi> who, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iacob,</hi> succeeded to the blessing
which was denyed to the Elder
Son.</p>
            <p>He was happy also in his Posterity,
who by serving their King and the
True Religion with great zeal, have
repair'd the mischiefs which have
been done to both, by the Admiral
their Predecessor. And certainly 'tis
one great sign of this good fortune,
that we have seen in our own days,
the Forces of the King, commanded
by the Count of <hi>Coligny,</hi> for the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Emperor against the <hi>Turk,</hi>
obtain a glorious Victory over them,
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:42159:340"/>
at that memorable Battel of <hi>Raab,</hi> the
gaining of which preserv'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and deliver'd it from the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger of being overrun by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
            <p>But to proceed. This last piece of
service which was perform'd by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon</hi>
for the King, was of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to the happy success of his
Affairs: For having already in his
hands the passages of all the Rivers,
which discharge themselves into the
<hi>Seine,</hi> for the supply of <hi>Paris;</hi> and
also being absolute Master of <hi>La
Beauce,</hi> by the reduction of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
and of the other small places of the
same Province; that great City was
on the sudden, as it were, invested
on all sides: And about the same time
he receiv'd intelligence, of the great
successes which his Commanders had
in other places against the <hi>Leaguers:
Les diguieres</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> where he
was receiv'd in <hi>Grenoble: La Valette</hi>
in <hi>Provence,</hi> the Mareschal of <hi>Matig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> where <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
which had hitherto maintain'd it self
in a kind of neutrality, return'd to
the Obedience of the King, and the
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:42159:340"/>
Dukes of <hi>Montpensier</hi> and of <hi>Nevers,</hi>
in <hi>Normandy</hi> and in <hi>Champaigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which, in conclusion, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd
the <hi>League,</hi> which was already
weakned by Arms, was the furious
division kindled amongst the Heads
of it; the occasion of which I shall
next relate. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had
sufficiently taken notice, that the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> of whose carriage
he was not otherwise well satisfied,
had design'd to make use of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
in order to his support against
the King, but not to be of use to
them, in making them Masters at
least of some part of <hi>France,</hi> which
was their intention, or to assist them
in the Election of a new King, who
shou'd absolutely depend on them, now
that the old Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was
deceas'd in Prison at <hi>Fontenay le Comte.</hi>
For which reason he fail'd not to give
notice to King <hi>Philip,</hi> that he ought
not to build any assurance hereafter
on that Prince, who had besides, lost
much of his reputation, by the ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of his affairs; and that it was
much more expedient for him, to get
an interest in the Corporations of
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:42159:341"/>
great Towns, and above all in the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
of <hi>Paris,</hi> who to compass the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation
of their Authority, which
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had once more
taken from them, wou'd easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to what he pleas'd.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> follow'd this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and the Sixteen, who mortally
hated the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> seeing
themselves supported by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
with whom they had entred into
a strict League of Interest and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
openly enterpris'd, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
soever he had of them, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of him, to re-establish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their first Authority. And
that which rais'd their courage to a
greater height, and made them more
boldly put their resolutions in practice
was, that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fourteenth,
who was newly exalted to the Papacy,
had declar'd in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour of them; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that particular,
and going quite contrary to <hi>Sixtus</hi>
the Fifth.</p>
            <p>That Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> who had so ill
treated the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> by the
thundring Bull which he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
against him, and who afterwards
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:42159:341"/>
oppos'd his being King of <hi>France,</hi> had
very much alter'd his opinion, after
he had been better inform'd of the
<hi>French</hi> affairs: For having made solid
reflections on the past, without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
himself to be prepossess'd, he
clearly understood the great merits of
the King, whom he then endeavour'd
to reconcile to the Church by gentle
usage: The Ambition of the Heads of
the <hi>League,</hi> the indirect dealing and
cousenages of their Agents, (who had
so often deceiv'd him by false Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and more than all the rest, the
pernicious designs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who that they might irrevocably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him in their Interests, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
urgent with him to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all the Catholiques who
follow'd the King, and that he shou'd
bind himself by Oath, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him into the Bosom of the
Church, what submission soever he
should make;) had opened his eyes,
and caus'd him to take much other
measures. For they proceeded at
length to plain threatnings, that if
he deny'd them this satisfaction, they
wou'd protest in a full Assembly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="824" facs="tcp:42159:342"/>
him, and make provision of
other means for the preservation of
the Church which he had abandon'd.
This so far inrag'd him, as he was the
Man amongst all the Popes, who was
the least capable of bearing such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
that opposing threatnings to
threatnings, he told the Embassador
<hi>Olivares</hi> in plain terms, he wou'd out
off his Head if he shou'd presume to
stir any farther in that matter. Which
fair warning he was wise enough to
take, as well knowing the fiery tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Pope, who was like enough
to have kept his word.</p>
            <p>Nay, there are some who are apt
to think, that far from joyning with
the <hi>League</hi> against the King, to which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perpetually solicited him
for their own interest, he had resolv'd
to employ the five Millions of Gold,
which he had heap'd up in the Castle
of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> during his Popedom, to
make War against them, and to beat
them out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi>
But his measures were all broken by
a sudden death, which carry'd him
off on the twenty seventh day of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
in the Year precedent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="825" facs="tcp:42159:342"/>The <hi>Leaguers,</hi> who observ'd not
even common decency, so little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
their joy for his death, that
the news of it being brought to <hi>Paris,</hi>
on the fifth of <hi>September, Aubry,</hi> the
Curate of St. <hi>Andrè des Arcs,</hi> an hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd
Fool, declaring it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in his Sermon, was impudent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to say, that his death came by
miracle, betwixt the two Feasts of
our Lady. And added these his very
words: <hi>God has deliver'd us from a
wicked Pope, and an ill Politician: If
he had liv'd longer, you wou'd have been
all amaz'd to hear Sermons Preach'd in</hi>
Paris <hi>against a Pope; and yet it must of
necessity have been done.</hi> Behold, how
much these Preachers of the <hi>League</hi>
were intoxicated with their passions,
which they easily infus'd into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
who followed quietly, like blind
men, their Guides, who were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than themselves, and who led them
to the Precipice, where they all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fourteenth, a <hi>Milanois,</hi>
who was exalted to the Papacy after
<hi>Vrban</hi> the seventh, who enjoyed that
honour but thirteen days, proceeded
<pb n="826" facs="tcp:42159:343"/>
in direct opposition to the conduct of
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth. He joyn'd with the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> and declar'd openly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>League,</hi> according to the
manner they desir'd: For laying aside
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and the other
Princes of his House, for whom the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> little car'd, he writ imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the Sixteen, to encourage
them to persevere in the resolution
which they had always testified, and
never to submit themselves to <hi>Henry
de Bourbon.</hi> He promised them fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
thousand Crowns by the Month,
for so long a time as he shou'd judge it
necessary for their supply, and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of 12000 men to be rais'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
at his own charges, which
he wou'd suddenly send them, under
the Conduct of <hi>Hercules Sfondrato</hi> his
Nephew, whom he made Duke of
<hi>Montemarciano.</hi> And that he might
joyn his Spiritual Arms with his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
he sent into <hi>France</hi> (by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendary
<hi>Marcelin Landriano</hi>) a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory,
by which he Excommunicated
all Prelates, and all other Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks
of the Kings Party, depriving
them of their Benefices, if within a
<pb n="827" facs="tcp:42159:343"/>
certain short space of time they did
not forsake him, and retire out of all
places under his obedience: He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
the Nobility and Gentry, the
Magistracy and the People, to do the
same; and, in conclusion, declar'd
<hi>Henry of Bourbon</hi> to be a relaps'd He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique,
Excommunicated, and to
have forfeited the Crown and all his
Possessions and Lordships.</p>
            <p>There are sometimes Thunders,
which make a ratling noise and do no
harm, because the fiery exhalation
which breaks out of the Clouds, is
evaporated, whether by the thinness
of its body, or by the violent agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Air, which disperses it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it reaches us. Of all the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts
which have been darted from
the Vatican, against Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
there will be found but few
which have been so noisy as this,
which was accompanied with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that was to Act in conjunction
with the <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Spaniards:</hi> All
which notwithstanding it had little
or no effect, by the care which was
taken to make evident, by many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
which were spread abroad, the
<pb n="828" facs="tcp:42159:344"/>
nullities of this Bull; and by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
resolutions of the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Parliament, sitting at <hi>Tours</hi> and
at <hi>Chaalons,</hi> and of the Clergy of
<hi>France,</hi> assembled at <hi>Mante,</hi> who
condemn'd it as erroneous, every one
of them after their own manner. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
that not a Man of all the
Catholicks, on that account forsook
the Party of the King, whose conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was continually hop'd, as soon
as he had the means and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of causing himself to be instructed.
So strongly were our Ancestors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that the power of Popes, as
Heads of the Church, extends not at
all upon the temporal, and much less
on the Rights of the Crown; and
that it can ordain nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of that Fidelity and Allegiance
which is due to Princes, in those
things which are not manifestly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that the Parliament at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
being for the <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> receiv'd that
Bull, and repeal'd the Decrees of <hi>Chaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi>
and <hi>Tours:</hi> But 'tis manifest, it was
then no free Court, as being at that
time oppress'd under the Tyranny of
<pb n="829" facs="tcp:42159:344"/>
the Sixteen, who had fetter'd it (as
I may say) by the fear which every
Member of it had, to be led Captives
in Triumph to the <hi>Bastile.</hi> In this
manner, those turbulent Spirits, who
may justly be call'd the sixteen Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
of <hi>Paris,</hi> finding themselves sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Protection of a Pope,
became daily more insolent and
haughty, in opposition to the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne</hi>'s Authority: and their
Boldness was increas'd yet more, by a
most surprising Answer, which the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> made to the Deputies
of the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Princes. Those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being assembled at <hi>Rheims,</hi> where
was present the Cardinal of <hi>Pelvè,</hi>
whom the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had made
Archbishop of that Place, found
themselves (in that low Condition to
which they were reduc'd) unable by
their own Power to resist the King, or
to procure their safety by any other
means, than obtaining from King
<hi>Philip,</hi> the Assistance of all his Forces,
to the end that they might be able
to maintain that King, who was to
be elected in the States General,
which were to be assembled for that
<pb n="830" facs="tcp:42159:345"/>
purpose; each of them in his own
Person pretending to that Honour,
yet none of them daring to own his
Ambition openly, for fear of drawing
on himself the Hatred of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
who wou'd certainly unite and
band themselves together to exclude
him.</p>
            <p>The Person who was chosen to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate
in <hi>Spain,</hi> was the famous <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Iannin,</hi> President of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> a man of great
Integrity, exquisite Understanding,
rare Prudence, and inviolable Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which had caus'd the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne</hi> to repose an absolute Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him; who, for his own part,
in the Honesty of his well meaning
Soul, had follow'd him, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>League</hi> with an implicit
Faith, that it was for the safety of
Religion and of the State: for on the
one side, he believ'd not that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d be preserv'd in <hi>France,</hi> if
the King were not a Catholique, and
therefore he argu'd that he ought to
be such; and on the other side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being
an honest <hi>French-man,</hi> he wou'd like
his Master, make use of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
               <pb n="831" facs="tcp:42159:345"/>
to compass his ends, but not
serve them, by favouring their unjust
Designs in the least circumstance, to
the prejudice of the State.</p>
            <p>Being such as I have here describ'd
him, it was not hard for him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Intentions of King <hi>Philip:</hi>
who holding himself assur'd of the
Sixteen, which he believ'd to be the
prevailing Faction, and much more
powerful than in effect it was, lay'd
himself so open, as to make his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
be clearly understood, which
the great Prudence and Policy,
whereon he so much valued himself,
shou'd have kept undiscover'd for a
longer time, in expectation of a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
opportunity to make them
known, when all things were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
and in a due readiness for the
Execution of his Designs. After the
President had represented to him in
his Audiences, the weakness and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of the <hi>League,</hi> the Forces
and Progress of the King, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
danger in which Religion then
was, and the immortal glory which
he might acquire by preserving it in
the most Christian Kingdom, by the
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:42159:346"/>
Assistance which was expected from
his Zeal and Power, that Prince who
was willing to sell his Aid at a higher
Price than bare Glory, without more
advantage, open'd his mind, without
any reserve, after a most surprizing
manner. For he caus'd him to be
told by his Secretary <hi>Don Iohn D'
Idiaques,</hi> that he had resolv'd to marry
his only Daughter the <hi>Infanta Isabella,</hi>
to the Archduke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> and to give
him in Dowry the Low-Countries,
and since that for the Preservation of
Religion in <hi>France,</hi> it was necessary
they shou'd have a Catholick King,
they cou'd not make a better Choice
than of that Princess, who, being
Neece to the three last Kings, and
Grand-daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second,
was without contradiction more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related to them than the <hi>Bourbons:</hi>
that with her Person, all the Low-Countries
wou'd be re united to the
Crown, and that having, besides
these Advantages, the whole Forces
of the House of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stria</hi> in favour of
her, the Hereticks wou'd soon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated,
and the Prince of <hi>Bearn</hi>
expell'd from the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="833" facs="tcp:42159:346"/>
The President overjoy'd, that he had
wherewithal to disabuse the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> by means of this strange
Proposition, and confirm him in
those good Opinions which the Sieur
<hi>de Villeroy</hi> had infus'd into him; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
King <hi>Philip</hi> with great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and no less Policy; and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
putting him in mind of the <hi>Salique
Law,</hi> on which he did not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
seem'd rather to encourage, than
dash his Hopes, in the prosecution of
of his Purpose. Insomuch, that he
drew him to a Promise of great Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
both in Men and Money, which
he fail'd not to send, with more
speed than usual. And the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
satisfy'd, that according to that
ambitious Design of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he
cou'd never pretend to the Kingdom,
us'd all his Endeavours for the future,
that the Election might not fall on
any other; not even on a Prince of
his own Family, who might marry
the <hi>Infanta.</hi> On the contrary, the
Sixteen, who were altogether at the
Devotion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whom
they were powerfully protected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, wrote to King <hi>Philip,</hi>
               <pb n="834" facs="tcp:42159:347"/>
by one Father <hi>Matthew</hi> (not the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
of that Name) a large Letter,
the Original of which, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
near <hi>Lyons,</hi> was brought to
the King; in which, after their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Acknowledgments to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Majesty, of the many Favours
and Benefits which they had receiv'd
from him, they earnestly petition
him, that in case he shou'd refuse to
accept the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> he
wou'd give them a King of his own
Family, or at least some other Prince,
whom he shou'd please to elect for
his Son in Law.</p>
            <p>'Tis farther observable, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
which was betwixt the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and his nearest Relations,
exceedingly increas'd the Power, and
by consequence, the Audacity and
Insolence of those factious men: For
on one side, the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi>
(who was much incens'd, that after
he had so bravely defended <hi>Paris,</hi> the
Government of <hi>Normandy</hi> shou'd be
refus'd him, which Province he
thought to have erected into a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality,
like that of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> of
which, the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> had
<pb n="835" facs="tcp:42159:347"/>
made himself a Soveraign Prince) was
retir'd with a good part of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into <hi>Lionnois,</hi> and by the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
which he held with the
Sixteen, did his best endeavours to
supplant him; and cause himself to
be chosen Head of the Party; on the
other side, the young Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
who had made his escape from the
Castle of <hi>Tours</hi> where he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
Prisoner, having been receiv'd
with great Acclamations by the <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi>
who believ'd, that in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they had recover'd his dead Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
their great Patron and Protector;
gave him much anxiety, and fill'd
his mind with jealous apprehensions,
especially when he observ'd that the
great Name of <hi>Guise,</hi> so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd
by the <hi>Parisians,</hi> drew after
it not only the Crowd of common
People, but also the Nobility and
Gentlemen of the <hi>League.</hi> But above
all things it grated him, that his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
had made a strict Alliance with
the Faction of Sixteen, who were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd
to have him at their Head,
in opposition to his Uncle, whom
they hated: All these Considerations
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:42159:348"/>
put together, swell'd them to so great
an arrogance, that they resolv'd to rid
their hands of all such as were in a
Condition of hindring them from
being Absolute in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this effect, they bethought
themselves of inventing a new kind
of Oath, which excluded from the
Crown all the Princes of the Blood;
and presenting it to such, whom they
knew to be too well principled to
sign it, on their Refusal, they made
Seizure of their Estates, and banish'd
them. In fine, having by this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Practice, driven away all
those who stood suspected by them,
and even the Cardinal of <hi>Gondy</hi> their
Bishop, who, together with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
of St. <hi>Merry,</hi> and of St. <hi>Eustache,</hi>
endeavour'd to incline the People, by
gentle Perswasions, to return to their
Obedience; they committed a most
barbarous and inhumane Action,
which by the just Judgment of God
and Men, was in conclusion, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of that execrable Faction.</p>
            <p>For, to intimidate the Parliament,
which oppos'd their unjust and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Undertakings, and had newly
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:42159:348"/>
acquitted one of those, whom they
accus'd of holding Correspondence
with the Royalists, and to revenge
themselves of the President <hi>Brisson,</hi>
who had advertis'd the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
that those Villains had written
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and offer'd him
the Crown; on the fifteenth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
very early in the Morning,
they seiz'd that worthy Gentleman,
together with the Sieur <hi>Larcher</hi> a
Counsellor of Parliament, and the
Sieur <hi>Tardif,</hi> his great Friends and
Confidents; carry'd them one after
the other, to the <hi>Petit Chastelet,</hi> and
there having first declar'd them by
their own private Authority, without
other form of Process, to be attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and convict of Treason, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favour'd the Party of the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> they order'd them to be
hang'd on a Beam of the Council
Chamber, and the next day ty'd
them to three Gibbets, in the Place
of the <hi>Greve,</hi> having each of them
an Inscription fastned to him, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they were Traytors to their
Country, and favourers of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="838" facs="tcp:42159:349"/>
They believ'd that by this means,
the People imagining that those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
men intended to have sold
them to the Enemy, wou'd approve
that action; but on the contrary, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one shook with horror at so piteous
a Spectacle. Even those who were
of their Faction, detested in their
hearts this horrible Cruelty, and there
were none who had not reason to
fear that their own Lives might eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment be expos'd to the fury of
those Tyrants, if some speedy stop
were not put to the course of their
outragious Proceedings. For which
reason, when the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>
had receiv'd Notice of it at <hi>Laon,</hi>
where he then was, and was withal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd,
that those furious People had
incurr'd the general Hatred, and that
they said openly, that they wou'd do
as much to him, as they had done to
others; he came at length to be of
Opinion, that he might sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely punish
them, without fear of a Rising in
their Favour. Upon which, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Paris</hi> with the Forces which he
had about him, forc'd <hi>Bussy le Clerc</hi>
to surrender the <hi>Bastile</hi> into his
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:42159:349"/>
hands; and after having laid the
Faction asleep, by a seeming negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
for some few days, while they
believ'd that he had satisfyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with the Reproof which he had
given them in the Town-house,
where he only advis'd them to be
more moderate, he condemn'd nine
of them to death, without observing
more formalities than they had us'd
on the like occasion.</p>
            <p>Four of them, namely, <hi>Ameline,
Emonot, Anroux,</hi> and Commissary
<hi>Louchard,</hi> who were apprehended on
the fourth of <hi>September</hi> betimes in the
morning at their houses, were brought
to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> as they were told, desir'd
to speak with them. But upon their
entrance, they found the <hi>Sieur de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
who caus'd their Sentence to be
read to them: And at the same time,
the Executioner, who stood ready
with his Servants, his Halters, and
his Ladder, hung them up all four on
a Beam, in the <hi>Swisses</hi> Hall. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
five, amongst whom was
<hi>Bussy Le Clerc,</hi> having receiv'd inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that they were to be taken,
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:42159:350"/>
sav'd themselves by flying into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
where they dy'd of want, being
unreliev'd and forsaken by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>The Duke was contented to punish
the rest in their purses, by forcing
them to refund the wealth which
they had scrap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d together during
their Tyranny, with so much rapine
and oppression. And to cut up by the
roots, those evils which proceeded
from the licentious meetings of the
Sixteen, particularly at the houses of
the two Curats, <hi>Bouch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as also to free the Citizens from their
arbitrary power of commanding them
to Arm when they thought good,
which they durst never disobey; he
caus'd to be verified in Parliament,
and publish'd an Ordinance by which
all persons were prohibited on pain of
Life, and especially those who were
called <hi>The Council of Sixteen,</hi> to hold
any more Assemblies. And all the
Officers, Colonels, Captains, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
Ensigns of the Town, and

<pb n="841" facs="tcp:42159:350"/>
of harming either the publick or
private persons, they all swore, and
made a promise to Almighty God, on
the Holy Evangelists, neither to take
Arms themselves, nor permit others
to take Arms, or to assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together, unless by authority
from the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> or the
Provost of Merchants and the Sheriffs,
who were his Creatures: To fall on
all such who shou'd presume to Arm,
or to Assemble, and to use them like
Traytors, Mutineers, and Persons guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

if they shou'd discover any attempt or

<hi>Colbert,</hi> (which is stor'd with

of the four, who were hang'd at the

third of <hi>December,</hi> and the tenth of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the year following. This
was the fatal blow, which beat down
the Faction of the Sixteen, which from
that time forward, was so far disarm'd
and weakn'd, that it never durst offer
at any thing more: which was one of
the principal Causes of the Freedom;
and in consequence of the peaceable
Reduction of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the Obedience
of the King.</p>
            <p>For which reason, I believe my

with the Names of some amongst
them, who, by the great Zeal which
they testify'd on that occasion, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

had the Happiness and Glory to have
much contributed to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

this manner re-establish'd his own

in the nature of a Soveraign Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
he created four new Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

imploy themselves on all occasions, to

after which he was oblig'd to take
the Field, and to beg, as he had done
formerly the Assistance of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>

made great progress during those
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:42159:352"/>

of the <hi>League,</hi> had laid Siege to

            </p>
            <p>He had already taken <hi>Noyon</hi> in
view of the Enemies Army, which
which was then stronger than his
own: And having lately receiv'd the
Supplies of Money, and of three
thousand men, which the Earl of
<hi>Essex,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
had brought him, he went

this considerable Succour, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the Endeavours
which the Emperor <hi>Rodolphus</hi> had
us'd to hinder him. Which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Service, with many others
which he had constantly perform'd
from time to time, during the space
of eighteen years that he had serv'd
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:42159:352"/>
the King, was immediately recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd
by his Royal Master, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given him the <hi>Baston</hi> of <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi>
made him Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and
Soveraign Prince of <hi>Sedan,</hi> by giving
him in marriage the Princess <hi>Charlotte
de la Mark,</hi> Sister and Heir to the
Duke deceas'd. He also on his
side, being desirous to let the King
understand, that he wou'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to deserve that Honour which
was done him by his Majesty, and
what he might expect hereafter
from him, did like <hi>David,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
not <hi>Sauls</hi> Daughter, till he had
kill'd an hundred <hi>Philistims;</hi> for, as
a Preparatory to his Marriage, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that Scripture-Hero, he took
the Town of <hi>Stenay</hi> by <hi>Scalado,</hi> the
day before his Marriage. The King
now finding himself strengthen'd
with so considerable a Supply, went
to re-joyn the Gross of his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Roüen,</hi> which the Marshal <hi>de
Biron</hi> had invested. As that Town
was well attaqu'd, so was it better
defended, during the space of six
months, by <hi>Andrew Brancas de Villars,</hi>
who was afterwards Admiral of
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:42159:353"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and at that time Lieutenant
General in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Roüen</hi> and <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi>
for the <hi>League.</hi> He perform'd on
that occasion, all that cou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a great Captain, for the
defence of a Town committed to his
Charge; and by his long and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Resistance, twice gave leisure
to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> to bring
him the Relief which he had obtain'd
from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much difficulty that he gain'd
these Succours; but at length, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
artfully insinuated into the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> Ministers, that he wou'd
procure the Election to fall upon the
<hi>Infanta,</hi> which thing they passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desird, though he fed them only
with false hopes of it; the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> receiv'd such express Orders
to march once more into <hi>France,</hi> for
the Relief of <hi>Roüen,</hi> that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to resist them, though
he wou'd gladly have been dispenc'd
with, from that expedition.</p>
            <p>He therefore advanc'd but very
slowly,<note place="margin">Ann. 1592.</note> with a strong Army of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fourteen thousand old Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:42159:353"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Walloons,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight thousand <hi>French, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers</hi>
and <hi>Italians,</hi> which last, were
the remainders of the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes,</hi>
and <hi>Montemarciano's</hi> Forces. The
King in person, went to meet them
on their way, with part of his
Cavalry, to harrass them in their
March, and advanc'd as far as <hi>Aumale,</hi>
that he might defend that Passage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. But considering that
he had not strength enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, and that their whole Army,
which he went on purpose to view
and to observe, was coming to fall
upon him, and might easily inclose
him, by passing the River, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
or below that Burrough, he
thought it necessary to make a speedy
Retreat. 'Tis true, that this Retreat
which he made in view of so great
an Army, was very brave, and that
he never show'd the greatness of his
Courage and undaunted Resolution,
more than on this occasion, which
was the most dangerous in which
he had ever been ingag'd; but
the great Captains of that time, all
concurr'd in one Opinion, that he
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:42159:354"/>
perform'd it rather like a valiant Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
who was well seconded by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
than like a prudent General,
whose duty it is, to take his Measures
so justly, that he may not absolutely
depend on the inconstancy of chance,
which often, by one sudden blow,
has ruin'd the most fix'd and solid
Undertakings. For, that he might
give his men the leisure of retiring
with the Baggage, he plac'd an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Arquebusiers, at the en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rance of
the Burrough, and putting himself at
the Head of two hundred Horse, he
advanc'd almost half a League towards
the Enemy, coming up within Pistol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
of them, and made many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
upon the Carabins, which
march'd at the Head of the Army,
whom he immediately stopp'd. But
the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> having receiv'd
information, that he was there in
Person, so weakly attended, and out
of his Generals Post, first sent out his
light-Horse against him, and after
them, the Body of his men at Arms,
who drove him back into <hi>Aumale.</hi>
His hundred Arquebusiers were there
almost all of them cut in pieces, and
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:42159:354"/>
he was in danger to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd,
and either kill'd or taken, had
not the night come on apace, during
which, the Enemies unwilling to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
themselves any farther, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having first discover'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
he fortunately brought off his
men, in that dangerous Retreat; in
which he was shot in the Reins with
a Pistol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Bullet; but the Discharge
being made at too great a distance, it
only raz'd his Skin, without farther
harm: His Enemies themselves, and
principally the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> in this
Combat, admir'd his Valour, and his
good Fortune, but gave no great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
to his Conduct, and the
Marshal <hi>de Biron,</hi> who us'd to speak
his mind freely, cou'd not hold from
telling him at his return, that it was
unbecoming a great King to do the
duty of a Carabin.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Villars,</hi> willing
to make advantage of his Absence,
perform'd one of the most gallant
Actions which were done in the
course of the whole War. For being
inform'd by his Spies, in what order
the Camp of the Besiegers lay; he
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:42159:355"/>
on the twenty sixth of <hi>February,</hi> made
a furious Sally out of all the Gates
which were opposite to the Key;
which, in effect, was worth to him the
gaining of a Battel. For having sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd
the Enemy, and carry'd all the
Quarters which look'd towards those
Gates, at a brisk Charge, which he
made on them severally, at the same
time, he possest himself of the Trenches
and all the Camp which was on that
side; where, during almost two
hours that he was Master of them,
his Infantry beat down, overthrew,
wasted and burnt the Tents, Gabions,
Batteries, Utensils, Ammunition,
Powder and Baggage; fill'd up the
Trenches, spoil'd the Mines, nail'd
the Cannon, destroy'd or made use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
almost all their Labour, while
himself advancing with four Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of chosen men, against the
Marshal <hi>de Biron</hi> (who was hasting
thither, though somewhat of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
from his Quarters at <hi>Dernetal,</hi>
to the Succour of his Men) made
good his Retreat with great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
returning often to the Charge,
that his Infantry might have leisure
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:42159:355"/>
to make havock of all things, and
afterwards to retire with him, which
they did, and he re-enter'd the Town
in triumph, with more than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Prisoners, and five great pieces
of Cannon, having kill'd above five
hundred men, twelve Captains, two
Colonels, and disorder'd and routed
the greatest part of the Camp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the loss of more than thirty
men.</p>
            <p>After this great Success, <hi>Villars</hi>
held himself to be in so good a
Condition of defence, that he sent,
to desire of the two Dukes, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
him only with Money for Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Garrison, as believing
that he shou'd need no other Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.
But the King, who at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
soon redress'd the Disorders,
and forwarded the Siege, having shut
up the River both above and below
the Town, with a great number of
Barques, which were well equipp'd,
and ten great <hi>Holland</hi> Vessels, which
were brought him by Count <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Nassau,</hi> the Town was reduc'd to a
want of Provisions, in two moneths
time. Insomuch, that <hi>Villars</hi> was
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:42159:356"/>
constrain'd to give notice to the
Dukes, who were refreshing their
Army beyond the <hi>Somme,</hi> that the
Citizens were not of the same mind
with the <hi>Parisians,</hi> to dye of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and that therefore he shou'd
be forc'd to capitulate, in case he was
not reliev'd within eight days.</p>
            <p>At this News, the Dukes, who
on the other hand understood, that
the Kings Army was much weaken'd
with hard Duty and Suffering at so
long a Siege, in one day reassembled
all their Forces, march'd without
their Baggage, re-pass'd the <hi>Somme,</hi>
made thirty Leagues in four days
time, and on the twentieth of <hi>April,</hi>
appear'd in Battalia within a League
of <hi>Rouen.</hi> The Head-officers enter'd the
City that Evening, because the King,
(who was not able to make Ressistance
at one time, against a great Army
which lay without, and a Garrison
within the Town, encourag'd by the
presence of so powerful a Relief) was
constrain'd to raise the Siege, and to
retire to <hi>Pont de l' Arch,</hi> where the
Nobility, and the Troops which he
had before sent off, to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:42159:356"/>
in the adjacent Country, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembled
within five or six days, to
the number of three thousand Horse,
and six thousand Foot. Then finding
himself superiour in strength to the
Army of the Dukes, who having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the small Town of <hi>Caudebec,</hi> were
gone to take up their Quarters at
<hi>Yvetot,</hi> and to cover it; he march'd
directly towards them, with a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
either to force them to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
or to enclose them within a little
corner of the Countrey of <hi>Caux,</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them off from all manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and taking from them all
means of their Retreat.</p>
            <p>And truly his Design in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
must have succeeded; for having
forc'd them, after many small Skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
wherein he had still the advantage,
to forsake their Quarters at <hi>Yvetot,</hi>
and to retire by night to a more secure
Post, within a quarter of a League
of <hi>Caudebec,</hi> he surrounded them,
and shut them up so straightly, that
they cou'd neither subsist any longer,
all the Passages for Victuals being
seiz'd, nor yet retire, having at their
Back an Arm of the Sea, and before
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:42159:357"/>
them an Enemy, who was stronger
than themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor cou'd they
fight, without being evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to a total Overthrow. But the
good Fortune, the Skill and great
Genius of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all these Difficulties, and in one
night drew them out of that immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Danger of perishing, when no
appearance of safety was remaining
to them. For under protection of
two great Forts, which he had rais'd
on the two Banks of the River, with
Redoubts, which commanded the
Water, and great Out-works, which
on his side were advanc'd towards
the Kings Army, as if he had intended
to have expected them within his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments;
on the twelfth of
<hi>May</hi> at night, he pass'd over his
whole Army, his Baggage, and his
Cannon, in a great number of large
Boats, cover'd with Beams and
Boards, which he had order'd to be
convey'd down from <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that at break of Day, every
thing was in safety on the other side
the <hi>Seine;</hi> and the King, who disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
this wonderful Stratagem too
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:42159:357"/>
late, was not able to hinder the
Prince <hi>Ranuccio Farnese,</hi> who with
fourteen or fifteen hundred men had
cover'd this Retreat in the great Fort,
and in the Out-works, from filing
off with his Men, and passing them
them all over together with his four
pieces of Cannon, on the Boats and
Ferry-boats, which he afterwards set
on fire.</p>
            <p>Thus the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> found the
means in one night, to put a great
River, which in that place was a mile
and a half broad, betwixt his Army
and that of the King, who admir'd
that Action, as the Masterpiece of
one of the greatest Captains in the
World. And without giving the King
leisure to pursue him by <hi>Pont de l'
Arche,</hi> he prevented him in such
manner by his diligence, that in four
days he was got into <hi>La Brie,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the <hi>Seine</hi> on a Bridge of Boats,
right over against <hi>Charenton.</hi> After
which, having re-inforc'd <hi>Paris</hi> with
fifteen hundred <hi>Walloons,</hi> and taken
the Town of <hi>Epernay,</hi> where he
pass'd the <hi>Marne,</hi> he re-conducted his
Forces into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:42159:358"/>
acquir'd immortal Glory, by
performing his Designs at two several
times, against a great King, without
hazarding his Army, and forcing
him to raise his Sieges from before
two the greatest Cities in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roüen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as it often happens, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is the unexpected occasion of
good, so the Siege of <hi>Roüen,</hi> which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not happily to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a Negotiation, which dispos'd
all things so well, in order to his
Conversion, that it may be said to
have sow'd the Seeds, which not
long afterwards produc'd so excellent
a Fruit. The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
hated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had
openly declar'd, they wou'd not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
him, in case he did not oblige
himself, to act in such manner, that
the States shou'd elect the <hi>Infanta,</hi>
with that Person, who shou'd be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her for Husband; of which he
had been constrain'd to give them
Hopes, though he had resolv'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to do nothing in it. He had
likewise joyn'd with the Politicks,
who were now the strongest in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
               <pb n="857" facs="tcp:42159:358"/>
against the shatter'd remnants of
the Faction of Sixteen: Those Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
had also admitted him to be
their Head, but on condition that a
Treaty shou'd be set on foot with the
King, provided he made himself a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick;
to which terms, the Duke,
who plainly saw that he cou'd no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
pretend to the Crown, had at
length submitted.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the King found
himself very uneasie, and much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext,
betwixt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
of his Party; for the first
perpetually apprehending that he
wou'd escape out of their Possession,
kept close about him, and growing
more and more jealous of his Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
were thinking to choose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
another Protector. And the
greatest part of the Catholicks, some
of them really despighted, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
seemingly, that he delay'd too
long to be instructed in the Catholick
Religion, and consequently conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it, form'd amongst themselves
a new Union, which they call'd by
the Name of the third Party, of which
the young Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:42159:359"/>
declar'd Head; who expected, that
if the King shou'd continue obstinate
in his Heresie, those who had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
follow'd him only in hopes of his
Conversion, wou'd in conclusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
his Party, and place him on
the Throne. And truly it might
reasonably be fear'd, that the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who was strongly soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to have joyn'd that Party with
his own, in order to elect a King of
the Royal House, wou'd at length
have consented to that Proposition,
rather than endure the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
shou'd elect that Person who was to
espouse their <hi>Infanta,</hi> even though
he were a Prince of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Things being thus favourably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on both sides, towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of a Peace, the Sieurs <hi>du
Plessis Mornay,</hi> and <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> were
chosen to labour in this Treaty, which
was to be kept exceeding private.
In the beginning of it, there was
started a great preliminary Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which was of necessity to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
before any thing cou'd be
propos'd, touching the Conditions
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:42159:359"/>
and Articles of the Treaty it self. For
<hi>Villeroy</hi> was resolv'd not to enter upon
it, till in the first place, the King
gave assurance, that he wou'd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Catholick Faith, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after he had been instructed in
it; and <hi>du Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssis</hi> remonstrated on the
other side, that this Proposal shock'd
both his Honour and his Conscience,
because in case he held not both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
to be indifferent to him, and
by that means wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d pass for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,
he ought not to be oblig'd,
to make choise of one in particular,
before his Doubts were remov'd, and
his Conscience satisfy'd that it was
the true Religion. But in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a temperament was found, which
was, that the King, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either his Honour or his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
shou'd cause himself to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
within six Months, with a
true desire to be converted; that, in
the mean time, he shou'd grant leave
to the Catholick Princes and Lords
of his Party, to send a Deputation
to the Pope, to petition him, that
he wou'd confirm by his Authority,
this holy Resolution; and that in
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:42159:360"/>
expectation of its Accomplishment,
the treaty of Peace shou'd still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
which being once concluded,
the King shou'd be acknowledg'd by
the Princes of the <hi>League.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
without making any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to these two preliminary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
without which, there was no
entring into the Negotiation. And
with the same ease they came to an
Agreement on the Articles, which
concern'd in general the Party of the
<hi>League;</hi> but when they proceeded
to the particular Interests of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Confederate Lords, the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne</hi> made such high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Demands for himself and
them, as were manifestly tending to
the dismembring of the State; so
that in conclusion, seeing he wou'd
abate nothing of them, they were
forc'd to break off the Conference, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two Moneths that were spent in
the Negotiation.</p>
            <p>It procur'd notwithstanding, this
good effect, that the King continued
fixt in the Resolution which he had
taken, to cause himself to be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in good earnest, and to permit
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:42159:360"/>
his Catholique Lords to send their
Deputies to the Pope, who were the
Cardinal <hi>de Gondy,</hi> and the Marquess
<hi>de Pisany. Innocent</hi> the Ninth, who
had succeeded <hi>Gregor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> the Fourteenth
the year before, had, like him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
openly in favour of the <hi>League.</hi>
He had also created Cardinal <hi>Philippo
Sega,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Placentia,</hi> and made
him his Legat in <hi>France;</hi> whom Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Cajetan,</hi> returning to <hi>Rome</hi> after
the death of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> had left
at <hi>Paris</hi> in his place, there to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the <hi>League,</hi> as in effect he
was to the utmost of his power. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
the Eighth, having succeeded
this Pope, who enjoy'd not the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
above two months, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
follow'd the steps of his two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors,
and suffering himself to be
prepossess'd by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> wou'd
not so much as give Audience to those
Deputies; yet their Deputation, as
shall be manifest in due time, fail'd
not to produce those happy effects
which were expected from it, and
which were fatal to the <hi>League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King always
pursuing his point, went to retake
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:42159:361"/>
the Town of <hi>Epernay,</hi> after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
de <hi>Biron,</hi> who was set down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and had begun to form the
Siege, was slain by the shot of a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conet,
which took off his Head as he
was going to observe the place. In
pursuance therefore of his design, that
he might make himself Master of all
<hi>Brye,</hi> he besieged and took in the
space of three days the Town of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,</hi>
which is the Capital of that
Country: After which he built a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress
in the Isle of <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rnay,</hi> betwixt
<hi>Meaux</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> within four Leagues
of that great City; thereby to hinder
it from being any ways supplied by
the <hi>Marne,</hi> which brings into it a
great part of the Commodities of <hi>La
Brie</hi> and <hi>Champaign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> who having not strength
sufficient to oppose this progress of
the Kings success, was unable to do
any thing for the relief of <hi>Paris,</hi> but
only to take <hi>Crespy</hi> in <hi>Valois,</hi> resolv'd
at last to imploy that formidable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
against the King, with which
he had so long been threatned; I
mean, the Assembly General of the
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:42159:361"/>
States, therein to proceed to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of a new King, who shou'd be
of the Catholick Religion; of which
all the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as Eldest Sons
of the Church, have made a constant
profession since the time of <hi>Clovis</hi> the
Great, who after his Baptism deserv'd
the glorious Surname of <hi>Most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
which he has transmitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least interruption, to all his
Successors, during the space of almost
twelve hundred years, from him to
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third deceas'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke had solemnly oblig'd
himself, more than once to call this
Assembly, but he had always delay'd
it with great Art, both for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the State, and for his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
concernment. For on the one
side, he always fear'd that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
(who spar'd for nothing to gain
the Deputies from him, partly by
Bribes, and partly by the presence of
a great Army, which they intended
yet once again to send into <hi>France,</hi>
under the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> to protect
the States as they gave out) at length
shou'd compass their design, which
was, to procure their <hi>Infanta</hi> to be
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:42159:362"/>
Elected: And on the other, plainly
foreseeing that he shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not be Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, because he cou'd not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the <hi>Infanta;</hi> he resolv'd no other
shou'd be chosen, that he might not
lose that Sovereign Authority, which
he cou'd maintain no longer than till
the States had made an Election of a
new King.</p>
            <p>But after all, he cou'd no longer
resist the pressing solicitations, which
the great Cities of his Party, the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Pope himself and his
Legat made him continually, putting
him in mind of the promise he had so
often given of calling that Assembly.
And that which fix'd him at last in
this determination, was, that the
Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was assembling
his Forces to enter <hi>France</hi> for the third
time, dyed in the midst of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations,
on the fifth of <hi>December:</hi>
For he believ'd that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now no General, who was any
way comparable to the <hi>Genius</hi> of that
great Man, wou'd leave him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of their Armies, or at least, not
being able to make any great progress,
wou'd be no longer so formidable to
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:42159:362"/>
him, which fell out accordingly. On
which consideration, he made no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
scruple to assemble the Deputies,
which already had been chosen in the
Provinces and in the Towns, not
doubting but since he had for him,
besides a great part of those Deputies,
the Parliament, the Town house, the
greatest part of the Colonels, and the
Faction of the Politiques; that he
shou'd be able with ease, to break all
the measures of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
those few Malecontents which were
yet remaining of the Sixteen, whom
he no longer regarded but as a sort of
Rabble, whose impotent fury he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd.
And it was for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that he at last resolv'd the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
shou'd be held at <hi>Paris,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Artifices of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who endeavour'd that it shou'd
be at <hi>Rheims,</hi> or at <hi>Soissons,</hi> where
the Duke cou'd not secure to himself
those great advantages which he had
at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Assembly then was appointed
to be held in the Month of <hi>Ianuary:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ann. 1593.</note>
And while the Deputies were coming
to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:42159:363"/>
an ample Declaration, bearing
date the fifth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in which,
after he had justify'd the Arms of the
<hi>League,</hi> by all the most plausible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d urge, and principally
by the great motive of Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, which
at last must give place to Heresie, if
an Heretick King shou'd be receiv'd;
he invited all the Princes, Prelates,
Lords, and Catholique Officers, who
were of the opposite party, to meet
the rest of that Assembly, that they
might all co-operate without other
consideration, than only the Glory of
God and the publick good, in choice
of those means, which shou'd be
found most proper for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion and the State; making
his pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>tation against such who
shou'd refuse so reasonable a way,
that they were to be esteem'd the
cause of all those mischiefs and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
which from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ensue.</p>
            <p>The Legat made his Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
but in a much more odious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
because instead of containing
himself within the general terms of
the good of Religion and the State,
<pb n="867" facs="tcp:42159:363"/>
as the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had done, he
invited the Catholiques to meet in
the States, for the Election of a King,
who shou'd be a Catholick in practice
as well as in profession, and who, by
his power, was able to support Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the State: By which words
he seem'd evidently to point out the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not hard for the King to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
these two Declarations, with
solid Arguments, and to make a like
protestation against the Authors of
them, by an Edict of the same Month.
And in the mean while, the Deputies
being almost all arriv'd they went
in procession to the Church of <hi>Nostre-Dame,</hi>
where having receiv'd the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communion, they heard a Sermon,
which was Preach'd to them by the
famous <hi>Genebrard,</hi> to the great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of all true <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
people in that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>This Doctor was certainly one of
the most able Men of the Age, but
especially in the knowledge of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, and the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi>
whereof he was the Kings Professor
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:42159:364"/>
at <hi>Paris:</hi> But by that unhappy fatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or rather excess of immoderate
Zeal, which drew almost all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of <hi>Paris</hi> into the League, he
embrac'd it so passionately, that he
was always one of the most fiery, and
headstrong defenders of it; which
quality, joyn'd to his profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was the cause that <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Fourteenth, that great Protector of
the <hi>League,</hi> gave him the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>Aix,</hi> after the death of
<hi>Alexander Canigrany;</hi> who dyed at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, he being one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Deputies for the Order of the
Clergy, and having acquir'd much
Reputation and Authority by his rare
knowledge, was desir'd to Preach this
Sermon: In which, instead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
the Deputies according to
Gods Word, that they shou'd have
nothing before their eyes, in all their
Debates and Consultations, but only
the preservation of the State and of
Religion, which is the strongest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it; he inforc'd himself to
prove by weak, sophistical reasons,
that their Assembly had power to
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:42159:364"/>
change and abolish the <hi>Salique</hi> Law,
that is, the fundamental Law of the
Realm, which has been always invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
observ'd, since the establishment
of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy even to this
day: As if the States, who have no
other power than that of representing
by way of Petition, what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be necessary for the good and
maintenance of the State, had the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of destroying it, by ruining
and undermining the foundations
which support it, and which preserve
it from falling into the hands of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
But the reason of this was, that
the Doctor, being a true Leaguer,
and a false <hi>Frenchman,</hi> as one who
was devoted to the service of King
<hi>Philip,</hi> like the Sixteen, in whose
Faction he was ingag'd, endeavour'd
to incline the Minds of the Deputies,
to dispose of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> to
the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> according to the
intentions of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had
given him instructions to Preach up
this wicked and notoriously false max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,
for sound Doctrin and for Gospel-Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="870" facs="tcp:42159:365"/>
The Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that he was Head of the
<hi>League,</hi> had the Soul of a good <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and was one who lov'd his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as the King himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
had a much different prospect
of things, and without concerning
himself at this idle discourse, because
he knew it was in his power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it from taking effect, open'd the
States-General on the Twenty sixth of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the Great Hall of the
<hi>Louvre;</hi> where all Ceremonies were
punctually observ'd in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as they are always practis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in
States which are lawfully Assembled.
And all that pleasant turn of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque,</hi>
which is given to the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of it, by the ingenious Author
of the <hi>Catholicon</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> is no other
than pure invention of a great Wit,
who under those delightful Fictions,
hides many sharp Truths, which just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decry the Party of the <hi>League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For indeed there was no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
than that which was made
by all the Deputies, when they went
in a Body to perform their Devotions
at <hi>Nostre-Dame.</hi> As for that other
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:42159:365"/>
of <hi>Monks,</hi> who were arm'd, over the
different habits of their Orders, which
is describ'd so pleasantly in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> and which is
still to be seen in several Prints, it
means no more than the Muster of
those Ecclesiastiques and Religious,
whom the Author of that Satyr has
tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sported from the Siege of <hi>Paris,</hi>
to those States, disguising his Fable
into a Procession, to make his Work
more divertising to the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Formalities there were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the usual custom, excepting
only that the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> as
Lieutenant-General of the State, and
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> was seated under a
Canopy of Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h of Gold, which was
never seen practis'd in former times.
The three Orders took their places,
after the usual manner: That of the
Clergy was very numerous: There
was but a thin appearance of Lords
and Gentlemen in that of the Nobless:
But to add more lustre to it, <hi>Monsieur
de Mayenne,</hi> as if he were invested
with Soveraign Power and Authority,
took that Prerogative which belongs
only to the King; which was, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:42159:366"/>
an Admiral, namely, the Marquess
<hi>de Villars;</hi> and four Marshals of <hi>France,</hi>

Title of Nobless.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monsieur de Mayenne,</hi> after the
death of the Duke of <hi>Guis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> whose
Creature this Captain was, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
him with the Government of
<hi>Champaigne,</hi> where after having made
himself Master of <hi>Rheims, Mezieres,</hi>
and <hi>Vitry,</hi> he had the boldness to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
himself by force of the Dutchy of
<hi>Rhetelois,</hi> and to hold it in quality of
Duke, by virtue of the Donation
which he said he had from the Pope,
as the King writ word to the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> from the Camp before <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres:</hi>
But at last his intolerable pride,
accompanied with the Tyranny which
he exercis'd in that Province, cost him
his Life by the hand of the young
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who laid him dead at
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:42159:366"/>
his feet by a thrust of his Sword which
pierc'd his heart; because that Prince
having civil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y requested him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the Soldiers out of <hi>Rheims,</hi>
which he had plac'd there to assure

               </gap>f of that City; this pretended

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shal, who wou'd in contempt of
him be absolute, had told him in a
haughty manner, and laying his hand
on his Sword, that he would not do
it.</p>
            <p>To proceed, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
as Lieutenant-General of the State, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus created an Admiral, and
four Marshals of <hi>France,</hi> thought
what he had done wou'd be of great
consequence to the Authorising these
mock-States of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to confirm
his own power together with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment
of his Party. But the
Lord of <hi>Chanvallon,</hi> who had as much
Wit as he had Courage, and who
foresaw the consequences of that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
said freely to him: <hi>Look well to
your self, Sir, for by this new Creation,
you have begotten so many Bastards, as
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egitimate themselves at your
cost and charges.</hi> And this indeed was
verified not long after, in the Persons
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:42159:367"/>
of <hi>Villars, La Chastre,</hi> and <hi>Boisdauphin,</hi>
who forsook the Duke, and made
their Treaty with the King, that they
might be maintain'd by a lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
in those high dignities which
the King alone, to the exclusion of all
others, can bestow. And if the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>Rosne,</hi> who was of Birth and
Merit sufficient to have been Marshal,
had been possess'd of Towns like the
others, which he might have surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to the King after their example,
he might have been legitimated as
well as they; and then those Cities
had not been lost, which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
(to whom he went over, after
having been refus'd by the King) took
under his conduct and by his valour,
in the Province of <hi>Picardy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given an account of the
Order of the Nobless in these States:
As for the third Order, it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of a few considerable persons,
and of a great number of such as were
pack'd together, and who serv'd only
to make a show of a full Assembly.
The Speeches which are to be seen in
the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> as if made by <hi>Rapin,
Monsieur Gillot,</hi> Counsellor of the
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:42159:367"/>
Court, <hi>Florent Chrestien,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Pierre Pithou,</hi> are only invented for
the pleasure of the Reader. For there
were spoken only four, according to
the usual custom of other States:
<hi>Monsieur de Mayenne</hi> open'd these by a
Speech of his own; wherein to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the expectation of the Deputies,
he declar'd, that this Assembly was
only call'd, that therein they might
proceed to the election of a Catholick
King; which notwithstanding was
far from his intention, for his whole
endeavours were to frustrate that
choice, as in effect he did. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Pellev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> who began very
much to decline in his Parts, said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was material in speaking
for the Order of the Clergy, which
he represented: The Baron of <hi>Senecey</hi>
for the Nobless, and the <hi>Sieur de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
Advocate General of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Provence,</hi> for the third
State, spoke incomparably better, each
of them after his own manner; the
last like a great Orator, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
like a prudent Gentleman.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King, who
was unacquainted with the secret drift
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:42159:368"/>
of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi>'s intentions,
was very much in fear that in this
Assembly they wou'd elect a King,
who being own'd for such by the
Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the
greatest part of the Potentates of
Christendom, by all the Catholiques
of the <hi>League,</hi> and perhaps also by
those of the third Party, whom he
ever suspected, wou'd at least prolong
the War, and might possibly remain
Conqueror. In order to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so great an evil, he thought
good that the Catholiques of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shou'd send a Trumpet to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
with an Authentique Act, by
which they gave them to understand,
that since the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had
signified by his Declaration, that he
had call'd that Assembly with intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to find the means of preserving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the State; they were most
ready to send their Deputies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with theirs at some place near <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
which shou'd be agreed on by
both Parties, to the end they might
compass so great a blessing, which
was the aim of their desires; protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in case they refus'd this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="877" facs="tcp:42159:368"/>
Proposition, they shou'd be
held guilty of all those evils, which
shou'd be produc'd by the continuation
of so bloody a War.</p>
            <p>'Tis a wonderful kind of blindness,
which a strong passion produces in
a Mind that suffers it self to be prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with it; that how clear-sighted
soever it be naturally, yet it sees not
those things which are obvious to the
most common capacities at the first
glance. The Proposition was made
in the plainest and most intelligible
terms, without the least ambiguity
in their meaning, that there shou'd
be a conference betwixt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the two Parties, to consider
of the safest ways which cou'd be
found for the preservation of Religion
and the State; yet the Cardinal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
consulting only the violent passion
which he had to support the Faction
of the Sixteen against the King, and
to exclude him from the Crown,
cry'd out, that this Proposition of the
Catholique Royalists was contrary to
the Law of God, who forbids any
communication with Heretiques; and
the Doctors, who were devoted to
<pb n="878" facs="tcp:42159:369"/>
the <hi>League,</hi> to whom that message
was sent to be examin'd, declar'd it
to be schismatical and Heretical. But
the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prospect of things than the
<hi>Leaguers</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and who was
resolv'd to hinder the election of a
King, manag'd that affair so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
that it was concluded in the
States, that the conference shou'd be
accepted, betwixt those only who
were Catholiques of the two Parties,
in the same manner as it was propos'd.
Notwithstanding which, it was not
held till two months after, at the end
of <hi>April,</hi> in the Burrough of <hi>Surenne,</hi>
because the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who
desir'd only to gain time for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
his ends, was gone, before he
return'd his answer, to meet the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Army, which was commanded
by Count <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nsfield.</hi> That
Duke was of opinion, that with their
assistance he might take all the places
on the <hi>Seine,</hi> both above and below,
which inconvenienc'd <hi>Paris.</hi> But the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being so very weak, that with his
own Forces which were added to it,
there were not in all above 10000
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:42159:369"/>
Men; all that he cou'd do was only
to take <hi>Noyon,</hi> which employed his
time; after which, it was so much
diminish'd by the protraction of that
Siege which had cost so much blood,
that the Count was forc'd to return
to <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Conference, though it
was made with much more prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and magnificence than all the
former, it had yet the same destiny
attending it, because the two Heads
of the Deputation on either side, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud
de Beaun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Bourges,</hi>
for the Royalists, and <hi>Peter d' Espinac,</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> for the <hi>League,</hi>
two of the most dextrous and eloquent
men of that Age, were both of them
somewhat too well conceited of their
own parts, and maintain'd their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
with too much wit and too
great vehemence, to come to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in their disputations against
each other. The Archbishop of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
in the three Speeches which he
made for the establishment of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and for the confirmation of
it, by refuting those answers which
were made him, omitted no force of
<pb n="880" facs="tcp:42159:370"/>
Arguments, which cou'd be drawn
from Reason, to induce those of the
<hi>League</hi> to a belief of these three points,
which he maintain'd constantly, and
with great vigour, to the end, as
Truths indubitable.</p>
            <p>The First was, <q>That there is an
indispensable obligation of Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
and Honouring as King, Him
to whom the Crown belongs, by the
inviolable right of Lawful Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without regard to the Religion
he professes, or to his way of Life.
And this he prov'd first by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Jesus Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who command us to honour
Kings and Higher Powers, and to
pay them that obedience which is
due to them, even though they
shou'd be Unbelievers and wicked
men; declaring that every man
ought to submit himself to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which are ordain'd by God, and
that to do otherwise is to resist his
Will, and trouble the order and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of the Publick. Secondly,
By examples drawn from the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
where we see that <hi>Zedekiah</hi>
was sharply reprehended and punish'd
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:42159:370"/>
by God, for having revolted against
the King of the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> that the
People of <hi>Israel</hi> obey'd <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity by the
Command of God; and that the
Prophets <hi>Ahijah</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> were
content to reprove those Kings, who
believ'd not in God, as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and
<hi>Ahab,</hi> without ever revolting against
them. Thirdly, By the Example of
the Christians in all Ages, who had
suffer'd peaceably the dominion of
Idolatrous Emperors, Tyrants, and
Persecutors of the Church; and had
not refus'd to acknowledge for their
Soveraigns, those Emperors who had
fallen into Heresie, such as <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Valens, Zeno, Anastasius, H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius,
Constantine</hi> the Fourth, and
the Fifth, <hi>Leo</hi> the Third and Fourth,
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> and the <hi>Gothique</hi> Kings
in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Affrica,</hi> and
the <hi>Visigoths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>Gaul,</hi>
though they were all of them <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>From thence passing to the second
point, he added, That by a more
convincing reason, they were bound
to obey the present King, who by
<pb n="882" facs="tcp:42159:371"/>
Gods Grace was neither <hi>Pagan</hi> nor
<hi>Arian,</hi> nor a Persecutor of the
Church and of Catholiques, whom
he protected and maintain'd in all
their Rights; who believ'd with
them in the same God, the same Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and the same Creed: And
though he was divided from them
by some errors, which he had suck'd
in, as we may say, with his milk,
and which he had never renounc'd
but by a forc'd conversion with the
Dagger at his Throat; yet this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it cou'd not be said,
that he was confirm'd in them with
that obstinacy which constitutes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
since he was wholly resolv'd
to forsake them as soon as he shou'd
be instructed in the truth; which
occasion'd him with all modesty to
maintain, that he ought not to pass
with them for an Heretique. That
for the rest, by Gods blessing there
was great probability of hope, that
he wou'd suddenly be converted;
that he was already altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to it, as appear'd by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
which he had given to the
Catholique Princes and Lords, to
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:42159:371"/>
send at his proper costs and charges,
the Marquess of <hi>Pisany</hi> to our Holy
Father, and to make this present
Conference with them: That he had
even uncover'd his Head with great
respect, in beholding a Procession at
<hi>Mante,</hi> which pass'd by his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows;
that not long before this time,
he had solemnly renew'd the promise
which he had made, to cause him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be instructed, and that he
wou'd infallibly accomplish it with
the soonest.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And upon this, to acquit himself
of what he had propos'd in the third
place, he set himself to adjure them,
with the strongest reasons, and the
most tender expressions he cou'd
use, that they wou'd joyn themselves
with the Kings Party, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of so good a work, and bear
their part in that Instruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Conversion of so great a
King; who receiving at their hands
that duty to which they were oblig'd,
wou'd assuredly give them the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which they wish'd, and which
he was not in a capacity of giving
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem, at a time when they demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="884" facs="tcp:42159:372"/>
it with Arms in their hands, it
wou'd have appear'd that he had done
it only on compulsion.</p>
            <p>On the other side, the Archbishop
of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who was not endu'd with
less Eloquence and Knowledge than
the Archbishop of <hi>Bourges,</hi> answering
in order to those three points which
were propos'd by that Prelate; said,
in the name of all his Colleagues,
<q>That they acknowledg'd they ought
to own for King, Soveraign Lord,
and Head of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy,
Him to whom the Kingdom belong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
by a lawful Succession: But since Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ought to be preferr'd before
Flesh and Blood, this Monarch of
necessity must be a Most Christian
King, both in name and reality; and
that according to all Laws both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Humane, it was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to give obedience to an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique
King, in a Kingdom subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Jesus Christ, by receiving and
professing the Catholique Religion.
That God in the Old Testament had
forbidden a King to be set up, who
was not of the number of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that is to say, of the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:42159:372"/>
which constitutes a true Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood:
That in prosecution of
this order, the Priests and Sacrificers
of <hi>Israel</hi> had withdrawn themselves
from the obedience of King <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
as soon as he had renounc'd the
worship of the true God. That the
Towns of—and <hi>Libnah,</hi> which
were the portion of the <hi>Levites,</hi> who
were the best instructed in the Law
of God, had forsaken <hi>Ioram,</hi> King of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> for the same reason: That
<hi>Amaziah</hi> and Queen <hi>Athaliah,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
abandon'd the Religion of their
Forefathers, had been depos'd by the
general consent of all the Orders of
the Kingdom; and that the <hi>Maccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi>
were renown'd and prais'd
through all the World, as the last
Heroes of the ancient Law, because
they had taken Arms against <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
their Soveraign Prince, for the
defence of their Religion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> did
indeed obey the King of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but they had bound themselves
by Oath so to do, according to the
express command which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by his Prophets, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punishment
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:42159:373"/>
of their abominations;
for which reason he subjected them
to the dominion of an Infidel: But
as for themselves, they were so far
from having entred into such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
that they had made one,
by the Authority of his Holiness,
quite to the contrary, that they
wou'd never acknowledge an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
for their King. And as for the
Christians, who threw not off their
obedience to their Emperors and
Kings who were Heretiques, 'tis
most certain that they obey'd only
out of pure necessity, and because
they wanted power; but that their
Hearts and Affections had no part in
it: Witness the harshness with which
the Holy Fathers have treated them
in their Writings; where they call
them Wolves, Dogs, Serpents, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Dragons, Lyons, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,
in conformity to the Gospel,
which wills, that he who is revolted
from the Church, should be held
and treated like a Pagan; so far it is
from authorising us to hold him for
a King, much less a Most Christian
King. For what remains, besides
<pb n="887" facs="tcp:42159:373"/>
the Councils receiv'd in <hi>France,</hi> and
the Imperial Laws, which declare
Heretiques to be unworthy of any
kind of honour, dignity, or publick
office, much more of Royalty: The
Fundamental Law of the <hi>French</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
is most express in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
by the Oath which the Most
Christian Kings take at their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
to maintain the Catholique
Religion, and to exterminate all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies;
in consideration of which,
they receive the Oath of Allegiance
from their Subjects; and that the
last States had decreed, with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
applause of all good <hi>Frenchmen,</hi>
that they wou'd never depart from
that Law, which was accepted and
sworn to solemnly, as a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of the State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In fine, to close up all which he
had to say, in relation to this first
point, he added, That without this,
it was impossible to preserve Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>France,</hi> because an Heretique
Prince wou'd not be wanting to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
Heresie in his States; as well by
his example which would be leading
to his Subjects, as by his authority
<pb n="888" facs="tcp:42159:374"/>
which cou'd not long be resisted: As
it was too manifest in the Kingdom
of <hi>Israel,</hi> which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> turn'd to
Idolatry; and as it has since been
seen in <hi>Denmark, Sweden,</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
States of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
where the people following
the example of their Princes, and
bending under their authority, have
suffer'd themselves to be unhappily
drawn into that Abyss of Heresies,
in which they are plung'd at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And thereupon, passing to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
points of the Archbishop of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
his Speech, he said in few words,
<q>That it cou'd not be doubted but the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was an obstinate
Heretique, and no way inclin'd to be
converted, since for so long a time
he had continued to maintain Errors
condemn'd for Heresies by General
Councils, and that he still favour'd
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> more than ever, and
especially his Preachers; that he had
been often invited, but still in vain,
to reconcile himself to the Church;
after which it wou'd be lost labour
for them to exhort him, particularly
<pb n="889" facs="tcp:42159:374"/>
after being first acknowledg'd, as he
thought to be; that therefore they
wou'd never endeavour it, and that
they had all sworn, not only not to
acknowledge him, but also to have
no manner of commerce with him,
so long as he shou'd remain an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now when the Archbishop of
<hi>Bourges,</hi> who was pre-acquainted
with the Kings secret purpose, saw,
that after a strong reply which he had
made to that noisy Harangue, they
still held fast to that one point, from
which it was impossible to remove
them; he was of opinion, that by
yielding it to them, the business
wou'd soon come to an happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For which reason, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
time to consult thereupon,
the Princes and Lords by whom they
were deputed, as soon as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the answer, which he knew
before hand they wou'd make, he
told the Deputies of the <hi>League,</hi> at
the seventh Session, which was the
seventeenth of <hi>May,</hi> That God had
at the last heard their prayers and
vows, and that they shou'd have what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="890" facs="tcp:42159:375"/>
they had requir'd for the safety
of Religion and the State, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the King, which they had
been encourag'd to hope, and which
at present was assur'd to them; since
the King, who was resolv'd to abjure
his Heresie, had already assembled the
Prelates and the Doctors, from whom
he wou'd receive the instruction,
which ought to precede that great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which all good Catholiques of
both Parties had so ardently desir'd,
for the reunition of themselves in a
lasting peace. And to the end that
it might be to the satisfaction of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man in particular, they might
treat with them concerning the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and other conditions, which
they shou'd demand for their interests:
Assuring them, that in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
all occasion of distrust, nothing
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d be done on their side, till the
King had d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>clar'd himself effectually
to be a Catholique.</p>
            <p>This Proposition which the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Union little expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
which ruin'd all the pretensions of
their Heads, disorder'd them so much,
that after they had consulted amongst
<pb n="891" facs="tcp:42159:375"/>
themselves for an Answer, not being
able to conclude on any, they thought
themselves bound to report it to the
Assembly of the Estates at <hi>Paris.</hi> And
then it was clearly to be seen, that
the Heads of the Party, who thought
on nothing but how to satisfie each
man his Ambition, under the specious
pretence of great Zeal for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, were much more afraid
than desirous of the king's Conversion.
Though it had been made evident to
them, by invincible Reasons, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Authority of the most
learned Doctors, that Absolution
might be given to the King in <hi>France,</hi>
without recourse to <hi>Rome,</hi> especially
since it wou'd be given only <hi>ad Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi>
and that afterwards they wou'd
send to the Pope for his Confirmation
of it; they return'd this Answer by
the Archbishop of <hi>Lyons, That they
ardently d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sir'd the Conversion of the
King of</hi> Navarre, <hi>but that they cou'd
not believe it sincere, till his Holiness, to
whose Iudgment they submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and who alone had the power of
absolving him, had reconcil'd him to the
Church:</hi> before which time it was not
<pb n="892" facs="tcp:42159:376"/>
permitted them to enter into any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Peace, or to take any Securities,
because that wou'd be to prevent the
Judgment of the Pope, and to treat at
least indirectly with him, who was
yet out of the Pale of the Church,
which wou'd be directly against the
Oath which they had taken. And
thereupon, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
who only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought the means of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as long as possibly he cou'd, that
almost soveraign Authority which he
had usurp'd, together with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the Princes and Lords of
his Party, took a new Oath, betwixt
the Hands of the Legat, that they
wou'd never acknowledge the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> even though he shou'd turn
Catholick, unless by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Pope. Thus remaining al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fix'd in that Resolution, which
absolutely hindred any farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in the Conference, after seven
or eight Sessions held at <hi>Surenne,</hi> and
two more at <hi>Roquette,</hi> an House be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Chancellor <hi>de Chiverny,</hi>
without St. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Gate, and at <hi>La
Villette,</hi> betwixt <hi>Paris</hi> and St. <hi>Denis,</hi>
they concluded on nothing that was
<pb n="893" facs="tcp:42159:376"/>
tending to the Peace, while the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
still imploy'd all their Cunning
and their Friends, in the Estates, to
perpetuate the War by the election of
a King.</p>
            <p>For even before the Conference of
<hi>Surenne</hi> was begun, the Duke of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
Ambassador Extraordinary from
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the General E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
at <hi>Paris,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Don
Bernardin Mendoza,</hi> Ambassador in
Ordinary, <hi>Don Diego d' Ibarra,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn Baptista Tassis,</hi> presented in a
full Assembly, (where he was receiv'd
with great Honour) his Masters Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in which he exhorted them to
proceed without delay to the election
of a Catholick King. 'Twas that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
which King <hi>Philip</hi> infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd,
as well thereby to continue the
Enmity betwixt the two Parties,
which doubtless wou'd have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the choice of a new King,
as to procure the Crown for his
Daughter the <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anta,</hi> as he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
himself more than once alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
In effect, those <hi>Spaniards</hi> were
not wanting some time after, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
her pretended Right of Proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="894" facs="tcp:42159:377"/>
as being issued from the Daughter
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterwards, that they were bent
upon a King, they renew'd the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of marrying her to the Archduke
<hi>Ernestus;</hi> till at last perceiving, that
both these Propositions were ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd,
even by their most zealous
Partisans, who adher'd to all the rest,
in the election of a King who shou'd
be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and to whom the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> might give his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Marriage; they made a new
Overture, after they had taken time
to deliberate on an Affair of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and said, That the King
their Master, that he might give them
full satisfaction, was ready to agree
on the Marriage of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> with
some <hi>French</hi> Prince, whom he wou'd
nominate, therein comprehending the
Family of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> since it was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
that himself shou'd have the
choice of the Person whom he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for his Son in-law: but that it
was also necessary that the Estates
shou'd elect them, and shou'd declare
both of them King and Queen of
<hi>France,</hi> for the whole and every part
<pb n="895" facs="tcp:42159:377"/>

whole Forces of his Kingdoms to
maintain them in it.</p>
            <p>As almost all the Deputies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of nothing more than to elect a
new King who shou'd be a <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
this Proposition which seem'd very
advantagious, was receiv'd by them
with so great Applause, that the Duke
of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who was newly return'd
to the Estates, there to frustrate the
Designs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> durst not
undertake to oppose it directly, though
he was strongly resolv'd to hinder it
from taking effect, by all the ways in
his power, because the Election cou'd
not possibly fall on him.</p>
            <p>And while he was plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Parliament of Peers, which was at

of their Members, those generous
Thoughts and inviolable Maximes,
which they have always made appear,
on all occasions, and in whatsoever
condition they were, to maintain the
fundamental Laws and Prerogatives
of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, furnish'd
<pb n="896" facs="tcp:42159:378"/>
him with an excellent Expedient. For
that Court, being inform'd that the
Proposition of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seem'd to
be approv'd by the Estates, on the

Princes and Officers of the Crown, being
now at</hi> Paris, <hi>that no Treaty shall be made
for the transferring of the Crown into the
Hands of foreign Princes or Princesses,
and that he shou'd imploy the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thority
committed to him, to hinder the Crown
from being transferr'd into a foreign
Hand, against the Laws of the Realm,
under the pretence of Religion; and that
the said Court, has from this present
time declar'd, and does hereby declare,
all those Treaties which are made, and
<pb n="897" facs="tcp:42159:378"/>
which shall be hereafter made, for the
establishment of any foreign Prince or
Princess, to be null, and of no effect and
value, as made in prejudice to the</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<hi>Law, and other fundamental Laws
of the Realm of</hi> France.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> seem'd to be
very much incens'd, that they had
made this Ordinance without his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation;
and vehemently upbraided
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> the first President <hi>Iean le
Maistre,</hi> whom he had constituted in
that Office: who not being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his secret intentions, answer'd
him with that Gravity and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is becoming the Head of so
venerable a Company, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
his Duty. But in reality that
dextrous Prince was glad of such an
occasion, because he well hop'd, this
Ordinance wou'd at least put a block
in the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s way. But he found
the contrary; for when they saw by
this Decree, and by the taking of
<hi>Dreux,</hi> (which the King had besieg'd,
and after carried by force, during these
Agitations) that if they made not
haste in their election of a King, 'twas
very probable that it wou'd be out of
<pb n="898" facs="tcp:42159:379"/>
their power to elect one afterwards,
they us'd their utmost Endeavours to
have one chosen, in the same manner
as they had first propos'd it. To put
by this Blow, the Duke of <hi>Mayenn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
who believ'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had been
impowr'd only with general Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and not to name him whom
they judg'd most proper for their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
told them, that of necessity
they were to expect a more particular
Order from their Master, wherein he
shou'd declare the individual Person,
whom he chose for his Son in law.</p>
            <p>But he was much surpriz'd, when
they, who in all appearance had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Blanks, which were ready sign'd,
and which they cou'd fill up with any
Name to serve their occasions, show'd
him before the Cardinal Legat, and the
principal Members of the Assembly,
at a meeting in his House, that they
were impowr'd, in due form, to name
the Duke of <hi>Guise:</hi> yet he strove in
the best manner he cou'd to conceal
his inward Trouble and Anxiety for
this Nomination, which his Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="899" facs="tcp:42159:379"/>
with the King, than to be so mean-spirited
as to acknowledge that raw
young Creature (for so, by way of
contempt, she call'd her Nephew)
for his King and Master. But the
Duke of <hi>Mayenn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> who at that time
cou'd not bear any Master whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
took another course, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
eight days time to give in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Demands, for his own indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> allow'd
him as fully as he cou'd desire. And
in the mean time, he knew so well to
manage the Minds of the greatest part
of the Deputies, the Lords and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and even of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
himself, by making them comprehend
how unseasonable it was to create a
King, before they had Forces suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to support him against a powerful
and victorious Prince; that in spight
of all those who were of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Interest, the Ministers of <hi>Spain</hi> were
answer'd, that the Estates were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to proceed no farther in their
Election, till they had receiv'd those
great Supplies which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
them by the King their Master.
In this manner the Election was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="900" facs="tcp:42159:380"/>
by the Address of the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne;</hi> which Dr. <hi>Mauclere,</hi> a
great Leaguer, most bitterly bewail'd,
in a Letter which he wrote from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
to Dr. <hi>de Creil,</hi> another stiff Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer
then residing at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the Interests of that Party; and
therein discov'rd the whole Secret,
which in effect overthrew all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>League,</hi>
and utterly destroy'd their whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.
For many things afterwards
happen'd, which broke off all speech
of an Election; of which the first and
most principal, was the Conversion
of the King, which is next in order to
be related.</p>
            <p>Above 9 years were already past,
since he, though Head of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
had been endeavouring the
means of reuniting himself, together
with his whole Party, to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church. For, in the year 1584.
a little before the Associated Princes
of the <hi>League</hi> had taken Arms, the
late King, having sent <hi>Monsieur de
Bellievre</hi> to <hi>Pamiers,</hi> to declare to him,
that he wou'd have the Mass re esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
<pb n="901" facs="tcp:42159:380"/>
in the County of <hi>Foix,</hi> and in
all the other Countreys which he held
under the Soveraignty of the Crown
of <hi>France,</hi> he caus'd one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of his Family, who was already
well inclin'd, to sound the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the other Ministers of that
Countrey, and to try if there were
any hope, that they would use their
Endeavours uprightly and sincerely,
to find the means of making a general
Reunion with the Catholick Church.
They gave up, without any great
difficulty, all the Points in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
excepting one which they laid to
heart; namely, their Interest, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
such vast proportions of
Maintenance, as he was not then in a
condition to give them, saying with
great simplicity these very words:
<hi>That they wou'd not go a begging for their
Living, (or live upon charity) like so
many poor Scholars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of his Counsel, and amongst
others the <hi>Sieur de Segur,</hi> one of those
in whom he most confided, were of
opinion, nevertheless, that he shou'd
not give over that Undertaking; and
that he shou'd endeavour to bring it
<pb n="902" facs="tcp:42159:381"/>
about quietly, and without any bustle,
by gaining the leading men of his
Party. And he was so well inclin'd to
do it, that he cou'd not curb himself
from protesting frequently, after his
coming to the Crown, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Battel of <hi>Ivry,</hi> that he
wish'd with all his heart, they were
reunited with that Church from
which they had separated, and that
he shou'd believe, that he had done
more than any of his Predecessors, if
God wou'd one day enable him to
make that Reunion which was so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that he might live to see
all <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> united under the same
Faith, as well as under the same King.
But there is great probability for us
to hope, that God had reserv'd that
Glory for King <hi>Louis</hi> the Great his
Grandson, whose unbloody Victories,
which he daily obtains, in full Peace,
over Heresie, by his prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and his Zeal, which have found
the means of reducing the <hi>Protestants</hi>
in crowds, and without violence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, may under his Reign,
show us the final accomplishment of
that great Work, which his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so ardently desir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="903" facs="tcp:42159:381"/>
It is also known, that this Prince
being then only King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> at
the time when he projected that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union,
of which I have spoken, said
one day in private to one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<hi>That he cou'd see no manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
in his Religion, which all consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in hearing a Sermon deliver'd in good
French, and that he had always an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Body of our Lord is in the
holy Sacrament; for otherwise the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
was but an exterior Ceremony,
which had nothing real and essential in it.</hi>
'Tis in this place, that I cannot hinder
my self from rendring Justice to the
merit of one of the greatest Men,
whom any of our Kings have imploy'd
in their most important Negotiations,
and who most contributed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
these good Inclinations into the
King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> namely, <hi>Francis de
Noailles,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Acq's,</hi> who has
gain'd an immortal Reputation, by
those great Services which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
for <hi>France,</hi> during 35 years,
under four of our Kings, in fifteen
Voyages out of the Kingdom, and
four solemn Embassies into <hi>England,
Venice, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In
<pb n="904" facs="tcp:42159:382"/>
which last Employment he did so
much for the interest of our Religion,
with <hi>Selim</hi> the Grand Signior, the <hi>2d.</hi>
of that Name, and by travelling into
<hi>Syria, Palestine,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where he
procur'd great Advantages and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the poor <hi>Christians,</hi> that the
greatest Princes of Christendom
thought themselves oblig'd, to make
their thankful Acknowledgements of
his labour to our King. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
the <hi>13th.</hi> commanded his Nuncio
himself to thank the Ambassador from
him, at his passage from <hi>Venice,</hi> on
his return to <hi>France:</hi> and to desire
him, that he wou'd use his Interest
with his Brother the Abbot of <hi>L' Isle,</hi>
who had succeeded him in many of
his Negotiations, and in that Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
as he also did in the Bishoprick of
<hi>Acq's,</hi> that he wou'd follow the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Examples which he had given
him.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi>
Predecessor to <hi>Gregory,</hi> thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
strange at first, that a Bishop shou'd
be Ambassador for the most Christian
King at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the Bishop of <hi>Agria,</hi> a most
<pb n="905" facs="tcp:42159:382"/>
prudent and vertuous Prelat, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
that Charge during five years,
for the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi>
without the least fault found with it,
he very much chang'd his opinion,
after the Bishop of <hi>Acq's,</hi> by his credit
with the Grand Signior, had obtain'd
from him, that an express Prohibition
shou'd be made to <hi>Piali Bassa,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his Navy, of making any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
on the Territories of the Church:
in consideration of which Benefit, his
Holiness made him a promise to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
him to the highest Dignities,
with which a Pope can recompence
the greatest Services that are render'd
to the Church.</p>
            <p>These were the Employments of
that Bishop, whose Deserts were not
less eminent than those of his elder
Brother, <hi>Anthony de Noailles,</hi> Head of
that illustrious Family, which is one
of the most ancient and remarkable in
<hi>Limousin;</hi> who was Ambassador in
<hi>England,</hi> Governour of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and
Lieutenant for the King in <hi>Guyenne,</hi>
where he serv'd the State and Religion
with the same Zeal, which appears at
this day, with so much Success and
Glory in his Posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="906" facs="tcp:42159:383"/>
It was then by the Motives of the
same Zeal for Religion, that <hi>Francis
de Noailles,</hi> after he had reduc'd 100
<hi>Hugonot</hi> Families, which he found in
<hi>Acq's,</hi> at his coming to that Bishoprick,
to the number of 12, was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make use of so fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as he had, to work upon the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Inclinations, which
good advice, in God's due time, had
the desir'd effect. For having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
with him at <hi>Nerac,</hi> by the King's
Orders, twice or thrice, with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to procure from him the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the Catholick Religion
in <hi>Bearn,</hi> when he found that new
Difficulties were still started, he laid
aside that particular Point, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Spring-head, whereon all
the rest depended, he told him in the
presence of <hi>Segur,</hi> with all the sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a faithful Minister, <hi>That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
cou'd not reasonably hope to support
himself by that Party, which how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
soever it appear'd, wou'd always be
too weak to bear him up (in spight of the
Catholicks, who were infinitely more
strong) to that pitch of heighth, to
which his Birth and Fortune might one
<pb n="907" facs="tcp:42159:383"/>
day carry him: that whatsoever Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his Valour might perform, yet they
wou'd never be of any advantage to him,
till he reconcil'd himself sincerely to the
Catholick Church: and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
(they were his very words)
<hi>that he cou'd ever raise any thing that
was durable for the establishment of his
Fortune, either within the Realm, or
without it, unless he built on this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
This was what he said, when
he took his leave of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre:</hi>
And some few days after this,
writing from <hi>Agen</hi> to the <hi>Sieur de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi>
he protested to him, <hi>That his
Master cou'd never arrive to the possession
of that Crown, to which he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
pretend, if he made not his entrance
by the Gate of the Catholick Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and pray'd him therefore that he wou'd
think seriously of that Matter, for if he
follow'd not his Counsel, he shou'd one day
speak to him in</hi> Petrarch<hi>'s Verse,</hi>
               <q>When Error goes before, Repentance
comes behind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Discourse startled <hi>Segur,</hi> who
had much power over his Masters In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations;
<pb n="908" facs="tcp:42159:384"/>
and it was principally on
this account, that he gave him the
Counsel above-mention'd, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
caus'd the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
to consider of the means of reuniting
himself to the Catholicks.</p>
            <p>But it happening that in the midst
of these Agitations, the <hi>Leaguers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
openly to rebel, and afterwards,
capitulating with Arms in their hands,
obtain'd an Edict, by which the King
oblig'd himself to make War with all
his Power against the <hi>Hugonots, Segur,</hi>
whom the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had lately
sent into <hi>Germany</hi> to desire assistance,
writ to him, after he had obtain'd it,
that this was not a time to think of
turning Catholick, though he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had formerly advis'd it: and that
since his Enemies wou'd make him
change his Religion by force, almost
in the same manner as they had us'd
him at the Massacre of St. <hi>Barthol'mew,</hi>
he ought to stand bent against them,
and defend his Liberty by Arms, that
it might not be said, he was basely
plyant to their will; and that he
might change freely, with safeguard
to his Honour at some other time,
<pb n="909" facs="tcp:42159:384"/>
which now he cou'd not without
shame, as being by constraint.</p>
            <p>He follow'd this Advice, which
was also seconded by his Counsel. He
made the War, and always appear'd
at the Head of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> with the
success which has already been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But being a man of a sprightly
and piercing Wit, he was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the mean time to instruct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and that by a very artificial way.
Sometimes by proposing difficult
Points to his Ministers, or to speak
more properly, his own Doubts and
Scruples in matters of Religion, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
on what Foundations their
Opinions were built: sometimes by
conferring with knowing Catholicks,
and maintaining against them with
the strongest Reasons he cou'd urge,
the Principles which had been infus'd
into him by his Ministers, on purpose
to discover by their Answers, (which
he compar'd with what had been told
him on the other side) what was real
and solid truth betwixt them. And
he always continued in this manner
of Instruction, clearing and fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the principal Points of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
<pb n="910" facs="tcp:42159:385"/>
and causing them to give in
writing, what they had to argue <hi>pro</hi>
or <hi>con;</hi> which produc'd this effect,
that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> never believ'd him
to be sound at bottom, and settled in
their Religion, but repos'd much
greater confidence in the late Prince
of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was in reality a better
Protestant than he.</p>
            <p>And truly it appears exceeding cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
that, when at his coming to
the Crown, he made a promise to the
Catholick Princes and Lords, that he
wou'd cause himself to be instructed
within six months, he was already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
on his Conversion; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
but very few things which
he then scrupled, and for which he
demanded some longer time, in order
to his fuller satisfaction. But, as he
afterwards acknowledg'd, he thought
himself oblig'd to defer that good
action to some more convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
because the <hi>Hug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nots</hi> wou'd
certainly have cantoniz'd themselves,
and set up under the protection of
some powerful Foreigner, whom
they wou'd have chosen for their
Head; which must have occasion'd
<pb n="911" facs="tcp:42159:385"/>
new Troubles in the Kingdom. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
which, the Head of the <hi>League</hi>
was at that time too strong, to think
of submitting to him, even though he
had declar'd himself a Catholick: and
the People not being yet made sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Extremities of War, and
their sufferings by reason of it, were
obstinately resolv'd to maintain it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and consequently, he
cou'd not then compass what he so
ardently desir'd, which was to restore
the Quiet of his Kingdom, and to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it in peace, by embracing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of his Predecessors. But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before the beginning of the
Conference at <hi>Surenne,</hi> after making
a sober Reflection on the present
estate of his Affairs, he plainly saw,
that all things at that time concurr'd,
to oblige him not to defer his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
any longer. For on the one side,
he was assur'd of the Leading men
amongst the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gonots,</hi> who had the
power of raising new Disturbances,
many of whom, and such as were men
of the greatest Interest, made no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to acknowledge, that in good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
he ought to go to Mass, and that
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:42159:386"/>
the peaceable possession of a Great
Kingdom, was worth the pains it
wou'd cost him in going. Add to
this, that the Heads of the Union
were so much weakned, and so little
united amongst themselves, that they
were in no condition of making any
long resistance to his Arms, though
they shou'd refuse to acknowledge
him: And for the common people of
the <hi>League,</hi> they were so overburden'd
by the War which wasted them, that
they desir'd nothing so much as
Peace.</p>
            <p>On the other side, he observ'd the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> us'd all imaginable means,
and did their utmost to perswade the
States to create a Catholique King.
That there was great danger, lest the
Third Party, which not long before
had laid a Plot to have surpris'd him
in <hi>Mante,</hi> and carried him away, now
joyning with the Catholique <hi>Leaguers</hi>
who were against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
shou'd elect a King on their side, which
wou'd be to embroyl <hi>France</hi> in worse
confusions: And to conclude, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
they who were not of that Party,
and who had always serv'd him with
<pb n="913" facs="tcp:42159:386"/>
inviolable faith, now besought him
to defer no longer his conversion;
and besought him in such a manner,
that they gave him easily to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
they wou'd forsake him, in case
he forsook not his false Religion.</p>
            <p>All these Considerations put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the Grace of God, who makes
use of second causes, put an end to his
delays, and brought him to resolve
on accomplishing what he had so long
design'd, by making a publick profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Catholique Faith. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that when the <hi>Sieur Francis
D, O,</hi> who of all the Court-Lords,
spoke to him with the greatest free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
went to press him somewhat
bluntly on behalf of the Catholiques
of his Party, that he wou'd make
good his promise to them: He with
great calmness gave him those three
Reasons which I have already set down,
why he had till that time deferr'd his
Conversion, and afterwards gave him
his positive word, that within three
months at the farthest, when he had
seen what the Conference of <hi>Surenne</hi>
would produce, he wou'd make an
abjuration of Heresie, after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="914" facs="tcp:42159:387"/>
the instruction of the Bishops
and Doctors, which, according to
the forms of the Church, ought to
precede so great an action; farther
ordering him to assure the Archbishop
of <hi>Bourges</hi> of those his intentions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to that Conference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then on his departure.</p>
            <p>And on that account it was, that
the Archbishop, after having receiv'd
the Answer which he well knew
wou'd be sent from <hi>Mante,</hi> where the
Court then was, spoke as he did at
<hi>Surenne,</hi> and believing that he had
now brought the business to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
on the seventeenth of <hi>May,</hi> and
at the seventh Session, gave the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of the <hi>League</hi> a full assurance of
the Kings Conversion.</p>
            <p>His Majesty also on his part, having
firmly resolv'd on that holy action,
fail'd not to write a Letter on the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the same Month, to many
Prelates and Doctors, both of his own
side and of the <hi>League;</hi> in which he
invited them to be with him on the
fifteenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> to the end he
might receive those good instructions
which he expected from them: As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
<pb n="915" facs="tcp:42159:387"/>
them in these very words, <hi>That
they shou'd find him most inclinable to be
inform'd of all that belongs to a Most
Christian King to know; having nothing
so lively engraven in his heart, as the
Zeal for Gods Service, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Ministers,
and the old rigid <hi>Huguenots,</hi> those
false Zealots of their Sect, fearing this
blow wou'd be fatal to their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion, made frequent Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in private, to invent some means
of diverting him from this pious reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
And there were some of them
who had the impudence to tell him
publickly of it in their Sermons, and
to threaten him with a judgment from
Heaven, if he forsook the Gospel,
(for it has pleas'd them to honour
their Errors with that venerable
Name.) This occasion'd him to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
all the principal Lords of that
new Religion, together with their
Preachers, who were at that time in
great numbers at the Court, and who
to the great grief of the Catholiques,
perpetually besieg'd him: and to tell
them plainly (that he might free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:42159:388"/>
once for all, from that troublesome
persecution) <hi>That after he had in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Almighty God, made all necessary
reflections on an affair of that importance,
he had, in conclusion, resolv'd to return
into the Catholique Church, from which
he ought never to have been separated.</hi>
And when <hi>La Faye</hi> the Minister had
adjur'd him in the name of all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Not to suffer</hi> (they are his very
words) <hi>that so great a scandal shou'd
come to them; If,</hi> said he, <hi>I shou'd fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
your advice, in a little time there
wou'd be neither King nor Kingdom left
in</hi> France: <hi>I desire to give peace to all
my Subjects, and quiet to my own Soul,
and you shall have also from me, all the
provisions which you can reasonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, being without comparison
the strongest, and in much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than he had ever been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
immediately after he had taken
the Town of <hi>Dreux,</hi> which the <hi>League,</hi>
though it was of great consequence to
them, yet durst never attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
he assign'd the place where he
wou'd receive the Instruction, which
ought to precede the act of Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="917" facs="tcp:42159:388"/>
to be at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
second of <hi>Iuly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Piacenza</hi> caus'd a
Declaration to be publish'd, in which,
taking upon him, as Legat from the
Holy See, to pronounce, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
shou'd be done in relation to that
Conversion, was to be accounted void
and null, he exhorted all Catholiques
both of the one and the other Party,
not to suffer themselves to be deluded
in an Affair of that consequence: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
all men, and especially the
Ecclesiasticks, on pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and privation of their Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
from going to St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
at that Action.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions,
(which were thought to be
made by the sollicitation of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards)</hi>
the Princes, the Officers of
the Crown, the principal Members of
the Parliaments, the Lords of the
Court, the Bishops, and many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
not only of the Royal Party,
but also of the <hi>League,</hi> went thither,
and amongst others, three famous
Curats of <hi>Paris, Rene Benoist</hi> of St.
<hi>Eustache, Charignac</hi> of St. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> and
<pb n="918" facs="tcp:42159:389"/>
               <hi>Morennes</hi> of St. <hi>Merry,</hi> who far from
being tainted with the seditious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of their fellows (the Curats of
St. <hi>Severin,</hi> St. <hi>Cosme,</hi> St. <hi>Iaques,</hi> St.
<hi>Gervais,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas in the Fields,</hi> and
St. <hi>André,</hi> who had ran riot in their
scandalous Satyrs, as I may call them,
more properly than Sermons, against
the Person of the King) had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of bearing their parts in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of so Great a Prince.</p>
            <p>Being therefore arriv'd at St. <hi>Denis</hi>
from <hi>Mante</hi> on the twenty second of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> the next morning he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Conference, and held close at it
from six in the Morning to one in the
Afternoon, with the Archbishop of
<hi>Bourges,</hi> and seven or eight Bishops,
amongst whom was <hi>Monsieur du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
nominated to the Bishoprick
of <hi>Evreux.</hi> Many Doctors of great
reputation were present in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
with the three Curats of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and Father <hi>Oliver Beranger,</hi> a
Learned <hi>Iacobin,</hi> Chaplain in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the late King. The Instruction
was made particularly touching
three points, concerning which, the
King propos'd some scruples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="919" facs="tcp:42159:389"/>
The first was on the Invocation of
Saints, to know if it were absolutely
necessary for us to pray to them: On
which point they easily satisfied him,
by giving him to understand the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church concerning it,
<hi>viz.</hi> That as it is profitable for us to
recommend our selves to the prayers
of our living Brethren, without dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
thereby from the Office of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ our Mediator; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it is very advantageous for us, to
have recourse to Saints, and pray
them to intercede for us, to the end
we may obtain benefits and favour
from God by Jesus Christ; God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
to them the knowledge of our
necessities and of our prayers, by some
way best pleasing to himself, as he
makes known to the Angels according
to the Scripture, what is done here
below, and foretels to the Prophets
future things, though they are more
particularly reserv'd to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>The second was concerning Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Confession: And it was clearly
prov'd to him, That Jesus Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given commission to his Ministers
<pb n="920" facs="tcp:42159:390"/>
in general terms of binding and of
loosing sins, that power cou'd not be
restrain'd only to publick sins, and by
consequence it was necessary, that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents
shou'd give the Priests full
knowledge of all the sins they had
committed, to the end they may make
a just distinction betwixt those offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which they ought to remit, and
those they ought not.</p>
            <p>The third Particular, in which he
desir'd to be throughly instructed,
was concerning the Authority of the
Pope: To which he submitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty, after it was made out
to him, that according to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
the Councils, and the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it extended no farther than to
things that were purely spiritual, and
nothing relating to temporals: not at
all interfering with the Rights and
Prerogatives of Kings, or the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Kingdoms. When they wou'd
have proceeded from this, to the
Point of the real Presence of Christ's
Body in the Holy Sacrament, which
of all other Articles is the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
betwixt <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
and in which, they never come
<pb n="921" facs="tcp:42159:390"/>
to an agreement, he stopp'd the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
by telling them, that he was
intirely perswaded of that Truth, that
he had no manner of scruple concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and that he always had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it.</p>
            <p>'Tis also said, that having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Conference betwixt the Doctors
and the Ministers, when one of the
<hi>Huguenot</hi> Preachers had yielded, that
Salvation might be had in the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> (for at that time they grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it) he said with great reason, <hi>There
is then no longer deliberation to be us'd:
I must of necessity be a Catholique, and
take the surest side, as every prudent man
wou'd do in a business of so great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as that of Salvation: Since, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the joynt opinion of both Parties,
I may be sav'd being a Catholique, and
if I still continue a</hi> Huguenot, <hi>I shall
be damn'd according to the opinion of the
Catholiques.</hi> But whether this be true
indeed, or only a report, 'tis certain,
that being perfectly instructed and
well assur'd of all points of belief,
which are held by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
they drew up a form of the Profession
of Faith, which was sign'd by him:
<pb n="922" facs="tcp:42159:391"/>
After which there remain'd no more,
but only to make his profession so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
according to the custom of
the Church, and to receive Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from his Heresie, and from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Excommunication, which
had been given against him.</p>
            <p>But it was first to be examin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
in a regular Conference (which
wou'd make the Decision more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick)
whether the Bishops had
power to absolve him in <hi>France,</hi> of
the Excommunication which he had
incurr'd, in a Case reserv'd by the
Popes to the Holy See. For not only
the Legat, and those Doctors who
were devoted to the <hi>League,</hi> and above
all others the Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi>
as he had made appear at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Surenne,</hi> but also the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who had much ado to
part with his imaginary Headship of a
third Party, maintain'd openly and
boldly, that the Pope alone had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to absolve him, and that all other
Absolution wou'd be null, because the
Pope had solely and positively made a
reservation of that Power to the Holy
See. Notwithstanding which, in a
<pb n="923" facs="tcp:42159:391"/>
great Assembly of Bishops and learned
Doctors, which was held for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
of this Case, the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
pass'd, <hi>nemine contradicente,</hi> in
spight of the Remonstrances of that
Cardinal, who was indeed no very
able man. The Curat of St. <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi>
himself, <hi>René Benoist,</hi> who was
afterwards Bishop of <hi>Troyes, Monsieur
de Morennes,</hi> Curat of St. <hi>Merry,</hi> who
dy'd Bishop of <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z,</hi> those I say, who
had been of the <hi>League</hi> till that very
time, and some other knowing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
gave an account to the Publick
in their printed Writings, of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
on which they grounded their
opinion; and they are reducible to this
ensuing Argumentation, which the
Reader will not be unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
as I have extracted it from
their Books, without interposing my
own Judgement in the Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I write not as a Divine, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
and maintains a Doctrine, but
as an Historian, who makes a faithful
Relation of Actions done, as he finds
them in the best Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="924" facs="tcp:42159:392"/>
'Tis indubitable, say these Doctors,
according to the most knowing Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
that he who is excommunicated
for a Case reserv'd to the Holy See, if
he have any Canonical hindrance, that
is to say, express'd and approv'd by
the Canons, which permits him not
to go and present himself before the
Pope, may be absolv'd by some other,
without being bound to send to <hi>Rome</hi>
for his Absolution; provided never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
that when the hindrance (if
it endures not always) shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
he shall go and present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
before His Holiness, submitting in
all humility to what he shall reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ordain: Now 'tis most manifest,
(they say) that there are three
sorts of Canonical Hindrances, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the King from going, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
from sending to <hi>Rome,</hi> to
desire Absolution from the Pope.</p>
            <p>The first is the manifest danger,
wherein he is continually, of losing
his Life, in so many Battels and Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
where he is forc'd to expose it dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the preservation of the Crown
which is devolv'd to him, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vioable
Right of Succssion, according
<pb n="925" facs="tcp:42159:392"/>
to the fundamental Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and which one half of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who are in Rebellion against
him, do their utmost to take away.
A Danger of this nature, and many
of the same, which are included under
it, as that of Conspiracies, Enmities,
Robbers, a long Voyage by Sea, are
esteem'd according to right Reason,
and by the Doctors, to be of that
number which is comprehended in
what we call the Article of Death;
which is not to be understood alone
of that fatal moment, when we give
up our Breath, but also of any another
time, when we are visibly expos'd to
Death. And it is on these occasions,
as in the Article of Death, that not
only the Bishops, but also all Priests,
can give Absolution from all Sins, and
Ecclesiastick Censures, with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso,
that he shall afterwards present
himself before the Pope, if there be
not some other Hindrance; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that which follows.</p>
            <p>And that is the greatness and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Persons excommunicated,
and particularly of Soveraign Princes,
who cannot leave the People whom
<pb n="926" facs="tcp:42159:393"/>
they govern, to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifest prejudice to their Crown.
For if a Father of a Family, or suppose
an ordinary Servant, may be dispenc'd
with from going thither, in case his
absence would inconvenience his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
much more strongly may it be
concluded in the Person of a great
King, whose presence is always neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or at least wise very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to his Kingdom: Therefore it
ought to be presum'd, that Persons of
that eminent Dignity, are perpetually
hindred from leaving their Countrey,
and taking such a Journey.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the third Hindrance,
which the Doctors call, <hi>Periculum in
morâ,</hi> (the danger of delay) is the
great hazard which the Nation might
run: For by deferring that Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so long, till it were given at <hi>Rome,</hi>
a thousand ill Accidents might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
and the happy opportunity be
lost, of preserving in <hi>France,</hi> our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the State, and the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Laws of the Kingdom, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the King. For all these
Reasons it was concluded in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
that they not only might, but
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:42159:393"/>
ought also to absolve him; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
send a solemn Embassy to <hi>Rome,</hi>
to desire the fatherly Benediction of
the Pope, and the Approbation of
what had been so justly done in <hi>France,</hi>
in relation to his Conversion.</p>
            <p>It being resolv'd in this manner, the
publick and solemn Act of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
which was so much the wish
of all good men, was perform'd on the
Sunday following, being the <hi>25th</hi> of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> with Magnificence worthy of so
great an Action, and of the Majesty
of him who made it. The King
cloath'd all in white, excepting only
his Cloak and Hat, which were black,
came forth from his Lodgings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the hours of 8 and 9 in the
morning, preceded by the <hi>Swiss,</hi> the
<hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Scottish</hi> Guards, and
the Officers of his House, with beat
of Drum accompanied by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Crown Officers, and those
of the Soveraign Courts, the Bishops
and Prelats, and all those who had
assisted at his Instruction, twelve
Trumpets going before him, and five
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r six hundred Gentlemen following
him, all magnificently cloath'd; the
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:42159:394"/>
Streets were hung with Tapissery, and
the Pavements strow'd with Flowers
and Greens; there were present an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
multitude of People, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
of <hi>Parisians,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all the Prohibitions of the Legat
and the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> were come
in Crowds to St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and joyn'd
heartily with the rest in the loud Cries
of <hi>Vive le Roy,</hi> while his Majesty
walk'd through the midst of them to
the Church Porch of St. <hi>Denis.</hi>
There he found the Archbishop of
<hi>Bourges,</hi> who was to perform the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
sitting on a great Chair, in
his pontifical Habit. Immediately
he ask'd the King, according to the
form, <hi>Who he was, and what he wou'd
have?</hi> To which Questions the King
having answer'd, <hi>I am the King, who
desire to be receiv'd into the bosom of
the Catholick, Apostolick, and Roman
Church.</hi> He fell upon his Knees, and
presented the Confession of his Faith,
sign'd with his Hand, to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
saying these words, <hi>I swear and
protest, before the Face of Almighty God,
that I will live and die in the Catholick,
Apostolick, and Roman Church, that I
<pb n="929" facs="tcp:42159:394"/>
will protect and defend it with the hazard
of my Blood and Life, renouncing all
Heresies which are contrary to it.</hi> After
which he receiv'd from that Prelat an
Absolution from the Censures which
he had incurr'd; immediately the
whole Church resounded with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeated Cryes of <hi>Vive le Roy;</hi>
and he was conducted by the Bishops
before the great Altar, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
his Oath upon the holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists;
and after having confess'd
himself to the Archbishop behind the
Altar, while they were singing the
<hi>Te Deum,</hi> he heard High Mass; which
was celebrated by the Bishop of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and then the Musick sang <hi>Vive le
Roy,</hi> with several repetitions of it.
At which the <hi>Parisians,</hi> (who were
present in great numbers at that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Ceremony) breaking out into
tears, drown'd the voices of the Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
with their Cryes of <hi>Vive le Roy:</hi>
which makes it evident, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Paris,</hi> excepting only the Rabble
of the Faction, were only <hi>Leaguers,</hi> by
reason of that invincible Aversion,
which they have always had for <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonotism.</hi>
For so soon as they saw the
<pb n="930" facs="tcp:42159:395"/>
King converted, they no longer call'd
him the <hi>Bearnois,</hi> or the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
but plainly the King; whom
already they desir'd to see in <hi>Paris;</hi>
as appear'd not long afterwards, by
the peaceable reduction of that capital
City of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Truly after this day, which by the
Effects it produc'd, may properly be
call'd the last day of the <hi>League,</hi> when
the Piety of the King was observ'd at
Mass, at Vespers, at the Archbishop's
Sermon, and after it, in the Visit
which he made to the Tombs of the
Martyrs at <hi>Montmartre,</hi> all which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were well known to proceed
from the Sincerity of a Soul, which
was too great to be capable of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie;
the People did but laugh at
what the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the remainders of
the Sixteen, their Preachers, and
above all others, the fiery Doctor
<hi>Boucher,</hi> publish'd in their Libels, and
in their Sermons which were but Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
against this Conversion, which
they labour'd in vain to decry by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
impudent and forg'd Defamations.
'Twas almost every mans business, as
secretly as he cou'd to make Peace
<pb n="931" facs="tcp:42159:395"/>
with the King; and deliver up the
Towns without noise, especially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had begun to taste the Sweets
of Peace, by means of the Truce,
which being earnestly desir'd by the
great Cities, was concluded for three
moneths, beginning four days after
the Conversion.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi>
fearing that it wou'd soon deprive him
of the Authority, which he enjoy'd as
Lieutenant of the Crown, procur'd in
his pretended Estates, that the Oath
shou'd be renew'd, of perseverance in
the Union, and obedience to the Pope's
Decrees. He went yet farther; for
in order to oblige his Holiness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to support his Party, he caus'd
the Estates to confirm the Declaration
which he had made for the publishing
of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> though they
had formerly inroll'd the Exceptions
which they had made in bar of it,
containing 23 Articles, which were
held to be inconsistent with the Royal
Prerogative of our Kings, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. But
in conclusion, neither that Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which they had no great mind to
<pb n="932" facs="tcp:42159:396"/>
make valid, had any effect; neither
did the Oath which they had taken,
hinder them from treating privately,
and considering of the best methods,
to receive the King into <hi>Paris,</hi> in
spight of the Duke of <hi>Mayenne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which wholly turn'd the
Ballance, and made the justice of his
Cause apparent in the eyes of all men,
reducing almost all his Subjects to
their Duty, was, that according to his
promise, he sent the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to render that filial Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which is owing to his Holiness
from the most Christian Kings, and
to desire that Absolution, which
they believ'd at <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power to give him. This met with
great Obstructions; and Pope <hi>Clement,</hi>
being earnestly solicited by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who us'd their utmost Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to hinder him from granting it,
refus'd it for a long time together, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a manner, which was somewhat
disrespectful, to so great a King. But
when his Holiness perceiv'd, that he
began to be less courted for his Gift,
and that it was believ'd in <hi>France,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what Applications had been
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:42159:396"/>
made, that the King had done all
which cou'd reasonably be expected
on his part, and consequently no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Absolution was necessary; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
of his own accord, as fast as
they went back, and encourag'd them
to renew that Negotiation, which
had been wholly given over by the
Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> whom he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not
receive as the Ambassador of the King
of <hi>France,</hi> and who for that Reason he
was departed from <hi>Rome</hi> in Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>The King therefore being desirous
to omit nothing on that occasion,
which cou'd be expected from a most
religious Prince, nam'd two new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
and both great Men, <hi>Iacques
David du Perron,</hi> and <hi>Arnaud d' Ossat,</hi>
whose extraordinary Deserts were not
long after rewarded with Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships;
and they acted both of them
with so much prudence, that after
many Disputes and Difficulties rais'd
by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> both concerning the
Essentials, and the Formalities of that
Affair, the Pope at length resolv'd on
giving a second Absolution, and to
keep himself precisely within the
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:42159:397"/>
bounds of spiritual authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mentioning the <hi>Rehabilitation</hi> to
which he pretended: For they wou'd
not admit that term, by which it
might have seem'd that the Crown
of <hi>France,</hi> which depends on God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
shou'd either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
be subjected to the Pope. In
this manner, that Absolution which
had been desir'd almost two years
before that time, was given at <hi>Rome</hi>
on the sixteenth of <hi>September,</hi> in the
year 1595. by which it is easie to be
observ'd, that the <hi>League</hi> had not the
mortal blow from thence; but on the
contrary, that which made the Pope
so pliable, was, that he saw the <hi>League</hi>
was going to destruction.</p>
            <p>In effect, as when the two great
Pillars which sustain'd the Palace of
the <hi>Philistims,</hi> were overthrown by
the strength of <hi>Sampson,</hi> all the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
went to the ground; so when
those two specious pretences of the
Publick Good and of Religion, which
the Heads of the <hi>League</hi> had taken for
the Columns of their Fabrick, were
thrown down by the Conversion of
the King, and that Conversion known
<pb n="935" facs="tcp:42159:397"/>
to be real, notwithstanding all the
jugglings of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who wou'd
have rendred it suspected; that impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Building, already more than half
ruin'd, and now having not the least
support, fell down of it self and came
to nothing. Insomuch that in the
year ensuing,<note place="margin">Ann. 1594.</note> almost all the Heads,
and all the Cities of the <hi>League,</hi> made
each of them their separate Treaty
with the King, who was better pleas'd
to win upon their hearts by gentle
means, with his admirable clemency
and Fatherly goodness, granting them
advantageous conditions, which did
him the more honour the less they
had deserv'd them, than to force
them, as he was able, by his victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Arms to return to their duty in
their own despight.</p>
            <p>As the Marquess <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Vitry,</hi> was the
first who forsook the Kings Party, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into that of the <hi>League,</hi> which
at that time he believ'd to be the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Cause; he was also the first, who
being disabus'd of that false opinion,
return'd to his obedience with the
Town of <hi>Meaux,</hi> of which he was
<pb n="936" facs="tcp:42159:398"/>
Governor. The <hi>Sieur da la Chastre</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follow'd his example, and
brought back with him <hi>Orleans</hi> and
<hi>Bourges.</hi> The <hi>Lionnois,</hi> after they
had shaken off the yoke of the Duke
of <hi>Nemours,</hi> whom they kept Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in <hi>Pierre Encise,</hi> and that of the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> his Brother by the
Mothers side, (who had underhand
wrought them to secure him, that he
might joyn his Government of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogne</hi>
to that of <hi>Lionnois,</hi> and set up
a kind of independent principality in
both) turn'd the <hi>Leaguers</hi> out of the
Town, and declar'd unanimously for
the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provence</hi> was the first of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
which openly disown'd the
Party of the <hi>League,</hi> taking up Arms
at the same time against the <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> who
had possess'd himself of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Kings Will.</p>
            <p>This voluntary reduction was made
by the courage and good management
of four brave Gentlemen, of the House
of <hi>Fourbin,</hi> one of the most Noble and
most remarkable Families of <hi>Provence.</hi>
Their Names were <hi>Palamede de Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi>
               <pb n="937" facs="tcp:42159:398"/>
Lord of <hi>Soliers,</hi> and his two Sons,
<hi>Iaspar de Soliers,</hi> and <hi>Saint Canat;</hi> and
<hi>Nicholas de Fourbin,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi>
with whom joyn'd <hi>Melchior de Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,
Sieur de Ianson,</hi> Baron of <hi>Ville-Laure,</hi>
and <hi>Mane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These being related by kindred and
alliance to <hi>Iohn de Pontevez,</hi> Count
<hi>de Carces,</hi> Governor and Grand Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal
of <hi>Provence,</hi> whose two Sisters
were married to <hi>Ianson</hi> and <hi>Saint Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi>
wrought so well with him, that
they brought him over from the
<hi>League;</hi> of which he had declar'd
himself Head, after the death of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de <hi>Vins,</hi> his Nephew, who was
kill'd with a Musquet Shot as he was
besieging <hi>Grasse.</hi> After which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perswaded the greatest part of
the Nobility and Gentry to enter into
their confederacy, the Count, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much trouble, reduc'd the City
of <hi>Aix,</hi> and the Parliament of that
place, which reunited it self at the
same time with that party of its Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which held their Sessions at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosque,</hi>
under the authority of the
King. In sequel of this, the greatest
part of the <hi>Provençals</hi> being reunited,
<pb n="938" facs="tcp:42159:399"/>
and strengthen'd by the Succours
which they receiv'd from Monsieur <hi>de
Lesdiguieres,</hi> manag'd their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
with so much prudence, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and good fortune, that at length
they constrain'd both the <hi>Savoyards</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> to depart
out of that Country, and to leave the
Government of it free to the Duke of
<hi>Guise.</hi> And that Prince, by the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> finish'd that
great work which the four Lords of
<hi>Fourbin</hi> had so generously begun, and
so well carried on, immediately after
the Kings Conversion, and when he
had made his entry into <hi>Paris,</hi> which
in a very short time was follow'd by
the reduction of all the remaining
parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Many Months were already past,
since the Parliament and Magistrates
of that Town, by the care of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
<hi>Le Maistre,</hi> the Counsellors <hi>du
Vair, D'Amours,</hi> and <hi>Molé,</hi> (who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
the Office of Procureur Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
the <hi>Sieur Huillier,</hi> Provost of the
Merchants, the <hi>Sieurs Beaurepaire,
L'Anglois,</hi> and <hi>Neret</hi> the Sheriffs, the
Colonels and Captains of the several
<pb n="939" facs="tcp:42159:399"/>
Wards, had dispos'd the minds of all
the Persons of Quality, the Officers,
and good Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> openly to
renounce the <hi>League,</hi> without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either the <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison, or the
Faction of Sixteen, which consisted of
not above 3 or 4000 seditious People,
who were the very Scum of all the
Rabble, whom the Colonels and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Wards, cou'd easily cut in
pieces, in case they shou'd presume to
take up Arms. The Treaty was also
already concluded for the safety of the
<hi>Parisians,</hi> and all necessary Measures
taken with the Count of <hi>Belin,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Paris,</hi> for the bringing in
of the King, particularly, after he
had been Crown'd at <hi>Chastres,</hi> on the
<hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the execution of so noble Design,
but only the presence of the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> who beginning to have the
Count of <hi>Belin</hi> in distrust, had put
the Count of <hi>Brissac</hi> in his place,
whom he believ'd to be the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding
man of all his Followers. But
that Count, the King being now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and his Affairs in a flourishing
condition, consider'd that he had a
<pb n="940" facs="tcp:42159:400"/>
stronger tye of Fidelity to him, than
to any other Person without exception;
and therefore made his Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
on the most advantagious terms
he cou'd procure. So that the Duke,
who had sworn never to treat with
the King, whatsoever Conditions
might be offer'd, before he had receiv'd
Absolution from the Pope, foreseeing
that he cou'd be no longer Master of
<hi>Paris:</hi> and fearing to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Town, departed out of it,
with the Dutchess, his Wife, and his
Children, whom he brought to <hi>Sois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
and leaving them there, went
into <hi>Picardy,</hi> to order his Affairs in
that Province, and to retain the Cities
in his obedience.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the King, who
had drawn his Army together at St.
<hi>Denis,</hi> hasten'd so well the execution
of the Treaty, that the day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>March:</hi> at
which time, advancing as far as <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martre,</hi>
and afterwards within 200
paces of the Town, towards the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of the River near the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi>
with the choice of his Cavalry, the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fantry was let in by the new Gate,
<pb n="941" facs="tcp:42159:400"/>
and the Gate of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> very early
in the morning: so that the Ramparts
were seiz'd, without the least tumult,
or any manner of Resistance; after
which, they possess'd themselves of
all the principal Places, the two <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelets,</hi>
the <hi>Palace,</hi> and the Avenues of
the Bridges. At the same time, the
King's Garrisons of <hi>Melun</hi> and <hi>Corbeil,</hi>
marching down by the River side, till
they came right against the <hi>Celestines,</hi>
were receiv'd by Captain <hi>Grossier</hi> into
the Arsenal; and on the other side,
the loyal Citizens, secur'd their own
Wards by strong Corps de guard, and
scattering among the multitude, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
printed Tickets, containing a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Indemnity, rais'd loud Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Cryes of <hi>Vive le Roy</hi> through
the whole City.</p>
            <p>This caus'd so great an amazement
in those who were the hottest <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi>
and in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that after
the King's Party had either cut in pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or thrown into the River a Corps
de guard of 25 or 30 Lansquenets,
who made an offer of resistance on the
Kay, not a man of them durst after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appear; so that all things being
<pb n="942" facs="tcp:42159:401"/>
now in great Tranquility, and the
whole City secur'd for the King, he
enter'd, at the New Gate, as it were
in Triumph, attended by all his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, after he had receiv'd
from the Count of <hi>Brissac,</hi> the Keys
of the Town, and a magnificent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broider'd
Scarf, instead of which he
put his own upon the Count, and
made him Mareshal of <hi>France</hi> upon the
place. Then with 5 or 600 men
arm'd Cap a pe, before him, their
Pikes being trail'd, in show that the
Town was voluntarily surrender'd he
march'd directly to the Church of
<hi>Nostre-dame,</hi> the Trumpets on every
side sounding, the Bells ringing, and
innumerable multitudes of People
continually ecchoing each other from
all parts of the Town, with incessant
Acclamations, and Shouts of <hi>Vive le
Roy.</hi> From thence, when the <hi>Te
Deum</hi> was sung during the Mass, which
he heard with such demonstrations of
Piety, as overjoy'd the <hi>Parisians,</hi> he
went to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where, after
Dinner, having receiv'd the Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all the Companies, at Three of
the Clock he went to see the dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:42159:401"/>
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison, at the
Gate of St. <hi>Denis:</hi> they were not in
number above 3 or 4000 men at most;
in the midst of them was the Duke of
<hi>Feria, Don Diego d' Ybarra,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Iuan Baptista Taxis,</hi> who all
three of them, with the whole Body
of their Souldiers, bowing lowly to
him with infinite Respect, were safely
convoy'd, till they came to <hi>Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About 30 of the most violent <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,</hi>
amongst whom, were Dr. <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
and the <hi>Petit Feuillant,</hi> believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
like <hi>Cain,</hi> that their horrible
Impieties were uncapable of Pardon,
departed with that foreign Garrison,
and retir'd into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they
pass'd the rest of their days, some of
them in extream misery, some others
well rewarded by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to the
end that Example might be servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them on some other occasion;
and that their Liberality might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
others to be like them, wholly
at their Devotion. It seems they
were little acquainted with the King's
Temper, who was Goodness and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
it self; for he lost the memory
of all that was past, as soon as ever he
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:42159:402"/>
set Foot in <hi>Paris.</hi> He even sent to
offer his Protection, and all manner
of Security, to the Cardinal of <hi>Piacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
the Pope's Legat, and to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Pellevè,</hi> his greatest Enemies; the
first of whom, to whom he had given
his safe Conduct, died by the way, on
his return to <hi>Rome;</hi> the second, who
was then desperately sick, expir'd,
not at the very moment of the King's
entrance into <hi>Paris,</hi> as the greatest
part of our Historians have written,
but six days after it, as his Epitaph
bears witness, which is to be seen, in
the Metropolitan Church of <hi>Rheims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, all things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
in <hi>Paris,</hi> to their first Estate:
The Parliament solemnly re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd,
in its natural Seat; all its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
which had been made, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Troubles, against the King's
Authority, rac'd out of their Rolls,
and the general Lieutenancy of the
Crown and Estate, judicially repeal'd.
And the Faculty of Divines in Body
assembled, (their Freedom being no
longer oppress'd, as it had been during
the <hi>League,</hi> by the Tyranny of the
Sixteen) declar'd null all the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:42159:402"/>
Decrees which it had made, in
prejudice of the inviolable Rights of
our Kings, swore Fidelity to King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and declar'd that
all <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were oblig'd in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to acknowledge him for their
lawful Soveraign, ordain'd by God;
notwithstanding that through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Pope had
not yet given him Absolution.</p>
            <p>Now, as they say, the <hi>Primum
mobile,</hi> draws along with it all the
other Heavens by the rapidity of its
motion, so the happy reduction of this
capital City of the Monarchy, was
follow'd by that of the Princes, the
Lords, and the Cities of the <hi>League,</hi>
who vyed with each other, who
shou'd first come in, and return'd in
Crowds to the King's Obedience. For
in the year ensuing,<note place="margin">Ann. 1595.</note> the Admiral <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
his Cousins, and the Sieurs of
<hi>Bois Dauphin</hi> and <hi>La Chastre,</hi> made
their Treaties for the Towns which
they yet held in their Governments.
Those of <hi>Picardy</hi> and <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> were
almost all reduc'd, either by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Submission, or by the taking of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="946" facs="tcp:42159:403"/>
Noyon,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Beaume;</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> prudently
withdrawing himself from a Party,
which must have overwhelm'd him
under its Ruines, had at last obtain'd
the Peace, which he sought from the
King. Insomuch that there remain'd
only <hi>Soissons, Chaalons upon the Saone,
Seurre,</hi> and the Castles of <hi>Dijon</hi> and
<hi>Talant,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> who
saw himself forsaken by the Head of
his Family, and the Princes of it, and
indeed by all those in whom he had
reposd his confidence. Which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
he still hop'd, he might
set himself up again, by the assistance
of a great Army of 18000 men, which
<hi>Ferdinand de Velasco,</hi> Constable of
<hi>Spain,</hi> had brought from the Dutchy
of <hi>Milan,</hi> into the <hi>French</hi> County:
which, in conclusion, only afforded
new Matter, to increase the King's
Glory, by one of the most hazardous,
but also of the most glorious Actions,
which he ever did perform.</p>
            <p>The new Mareshal <hi>Biron,</hi> having
fought successfully in <hi>Dijon,</hi> against
the Vicount <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> whom he
forc'd to leave the Town, besieg'd the
<pb n="947" facs="tcp:42159:403"/>
Castle, and at the same time, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Talant,</hi> into which the Enemies
were retir'd. It being fear'd, that the
Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> with his great
Army, which was upon the point to
pass the <hi>Saone,</hi> shou'd come upon him,
there was notice of it given to the
King, who was already advanc'd with
1500 Horse as far as <hi>Troyes.</hi> Upon
this Advertisement, he came up spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to <hi>Dijon,</hi> about the end of <hi>Iune.</hi>
From whence, after he had given all
necessary Orders, for carrying on the
Siege of the two Castles, he march'd
towards the <hi>Saone</hi> with Mareshal <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and 7 or 800 Horse, with design
to stop the Constable at least for two
or three days, at the passage of the
River, to the end that his men might
have leisure, to finish the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he had appointed, to
hinder any Relief from coming into
the Castles. But being arriv'd near
the Borough of <hi>Fontain Francoise,</hi> half
way betwixt <hi>Dijon</hi> and <hi>Grey,</hi> he had
Intelligence from his Scouts, that the
whole <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, to which the
Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> had joyn'd all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Forces, having already pass'd
<pb n="948" facs="tcp:42159:404"/>
the River at <hi>Grey,</hi> was coming up,
and just ready to fall on him.</p>
            <p>Doubtless here was sufficient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Fear, even for a great Captain,
to find himself in this terrible Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:
To stay and expect the Enemy,
who was twenty times stronger than
himself, was extream rashness; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
before him in full day, was almost
impossible to be done, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
danger of being routed, and cut
off in his Retreat. Nevertheless he
form'd his Resolution upon the Place,
with wonderful presence of mind, and
showing a bold countenance to the
Enemy, as if he had been sustain'd by
his whole Army, commanded the
Marshal to advance with 300 men,
who possessing themselves of a rising
Ground, from whence they chas'd
about 60 Horse of the Enemy, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the whole Army of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
marching in Battalia, who made
a Halt on this side the Village of St.
<hi>Seyne</hi> upon the <hi>Vigennes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four hundred Horse of the <hi>French</hi>
Troops belonging to the Duke of <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
and commanded by the Baron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="949" facs="tcp:42159:404"/>
Houdan,</hi> appear'd at the Head of their
Army, sustain'd by 800 more detach'd
from a great Body of the Vanguard,
where the Duke was in Person, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
that he might bring it to the
issue of a Battel, which the Constable
shou'd not be able to avoid. As these
were marching right on to <hi>Biron,</hi> he
having the Marquess of <hi>Mirebeau</hi> on
one side, and the Baron of <hi>Lux,</hi> on
the other, each of them commanding
an 100 Horse, spread them as wide as
he cou'd possible, to hinder himself
from being incompass'd, and receiv'd
the Enemies with his usual Valour:
but they being <hi>French,</hi> old Souldiers,
and much out-numbring him, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
charg'd with so much fury, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Squardrons of <hi>Mirebeau</hi> and <hi>Lux,</hi>
that they broke into them, and put
them in Disorder. The Marshal was
not wanting on his side, to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
proofs of his Courage and his
Conduct, in rallying and sustaining
his men, who in spight of their vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Resistance began to bend. He
made one particular Charge with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
bravery, to dis-engage the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
<hi>de Lux,</hi> who was the worst hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<pb n="950" facs="tcp:42159:405"/>
himself, and the boldest of his
Souldiers, being unhors'd; but seeing
fresh Squadrons coming on, whereof
some were marching up directly to
him, others turning on the right hand
and on the left, to inclose him, he
was at last constrain'd to give ground
with the rest, and endeavour to make
his Retreat, in which he was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
press'd, that it wanted but
little of plain flight. And the detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was sent by the King, to
receive those who fled, and to sustain
<hi>Biron,</hi> (who wounded as he was in
the Head, and blood all over, yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
to turn his back, fought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating,
accompanied by very few)
were as ill handled as the first, and
driven back to the place where the
King was himself in Person.</p>
            <p>It was on this occasion that Great
Prince perform'd a most heroick and
most memorable action: For though
he saw himself in the greatest danger
imaginable, having in front of him
near 1200 Horse in six Squadrons, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd
by the gross of the Army,
which was coming to attaque him;
he who had not at that time above
<pb n="951" facs="tcp:42159:405"/>
an hundred Horse about him in good
order, far from retiring, which one
wou'd have thought he shou'd have
endeavour'd, as being able to have
done it without danger, while the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
were employed, either in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those who yet made resistance,
or in pursuing those who fled; he
march'd straight forward, bearing his
Sword aloft, and calling by their
names the most considerable Persons
who attended him, as the Duke of
<hi>Elbeuf,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Pisany, de
Treinel, de Roquelaure, de Chasteau
Vieux, De Liencour, de Montigny, d'
Inteville</hi> and <hi>de Mirepoix,</hi> and inviting
them to act like himself, he made so
furious a charge on those who believ'd
themselves to be already in possession
of the Victory, that he stop'd them
short, and broke into them, follow'd
by all his brave Attendants, whoafter
his example fought like Lyons, and
push'd the Enemy with so much vigor,
that those six Squadrons fell back in
confusion upon each other. In the
heat of this Combat, he kill'd with
his own hand the valiant Colonel <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
who was using his uttermost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="952" facs="tcp:42159:406"/>
though in vain, to restore
the Fight: and being seconded by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
who had rallyed about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty Horse, and by the
Duke of <hi>Trimouille,</hi> who was come up
to the Charge in the midst of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his Company of <hi>Gendarmes,</hi>
he pursu'd them at full spur as
far as the great Body of Cavalry,
which the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Vanguard. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he had not fail'd to attaque him,
as he was very desirous to have done,
seeing his valour seconded with such
good fortune, if that gross had not
been flank'd with two little Copses,
lin'd with Musqueteers, and sustain'd
by the whole <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, which
had certainly overwhelm'd him, in
case they had taken that critical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>In effect, the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
observ'd, during the Combat,
the extreme danger in which the King
had involv'd himself, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his heavy maxim, might pass
for inconsideration and rashness, sent
three or four times with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
earnestness to the Constable, to
<pb n="953" facs="tcp:42159:406"/>
desire him not to let slip that favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
minute, but to march as to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
victory; giving him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the King having neither
Foot nor Cannon, cou'd not possibly
escape either from being kill'd, or at
least from being taken. But whether
the <hi>Castillian</hi> fear'd the fortune of the
King, and much more apprehended
that his whole Army was not far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
or were it the Hatred which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bore the Duke, who
for his part hated them not less; or
perhaps the Vanity and Pride of the
Constable, who cou'd not endure to
be taught his Duty: 'tis certain that
he absolutely refus'd to move, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on his Retreat the same day, to his
Quarters at St. <hi>Seyne,</hi> and the next
morning to <hi>Grey.</hi> The King, who in
the mean time had rallied all his
Troops, having still pursued him, till
he had repass'd the <hi>Saone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it may be said, that in this
famous Skirmish at <hi>Fontain Francoise,</hi>
the happy success of which is wholly
to be attributed to the incomparable
Valour of the King, he perform'd an
Action not unlike that of the great
<pb n="954" facs="tcp:42159:407"/>
               <hi>Macchabee,</hi> who with 800 men, durst
bear up against a numerous Army;
with this difference notwithstanding,
that the <hi>Iewish</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hero was lost in the
too eager prosecution of his Victory,
but ours, on the contrary, return'd
from the pursuit of his flying Enemies,
cover'd with Glory, after he had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a powerful Army out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
with an handful of men, not
exceeding the number of 6 or 700.</p>
            <p>This was the last Enterprize of the
<hi>League,</hi> which was then gasping in
the pangs of death, and expir'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after it. For the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> in despair to see himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd
by the Constable, with no
hope of recovery in his Affairs, was
upon the point of taking a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spain,</hi> and throwing himself into
the Arms of King <hi>Philip,</hi> with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to inform him of the Malice and
Cowardise of those, whom he intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Command of his Armies,
when the King, willing by an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
effect of his Goodness, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his vanquish'd Enemy from the
steep of that Precipice, where he was
seeking his destruction, let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="955" facs="tcp:42159:407"/>
that he was ready to receive
him into Grace, and grant him, in
that his low estate, very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conditions; that while the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
betwixt them was depending, he
might stay at <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lon</hi> on the <hi>Saone,</hi> the
only good Town remaining to him in
<hi>Bourgogne,</hi> and take his word for his
security. And the Duke to answer
this Generosity, as much as lay in him,
accepting this Offer, gave immediate
Order, that the Castles of <hi>Dijon</hi> and
<hi>Talant</hi> shou'd be surrendred. But
what was most admirable in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
of the King, was, that to save
the Honour of that Prince, who had
engag'd himself by Oath, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him, till he had receiv'd
Absolution from the Pope, he deferr'd
the conclusion of his Treaty, till he
had obtain'd it from his Holiness; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, in the beginning of the
year ensuing, he made an Edict in his
Favour.</p>
            <p>It was not, indeed,<note place="margin">Ann. 1596.</note> so advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as it might have been, if he cou'd
have resolv'd to have accepted those
Propositions sooner, which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him more than once; at a time,
<pb n="956" facs="tcp:42159:408"/>
when he might have treated not only
for himself, but for all that powerful
Party which he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aded. Yet it was
infinitely beyond what he cou'd reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
have expected at that time: for,
in consideration, that he had always
oppos'd the pernicious Designs of the
Sixteen, and of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that
making War like a man of Honour,
he had constantly spoken of the King
with great Respect, as one who infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
esteem'd his Person, his Merit,
and his Quality; the King who valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him exceedingly, granted, in his
favour, (even against the opinion of
the greatest part of his Counsel) that
Edict, in which, making very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
mention of him, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Zeal, which he always had for
the preservation of the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the Monarchy in its entire
estate, he granted him amongst other
things, (besides an Amnesty of the
past, the re-establishment of himself
and his Friends, in all their Possessions,
the Towns of <hi>Soissons, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the Saone,</hi> for his security) a
Declaration, importing that he had
no Accusation either against himself,
<pb n="957" facs="tcp:42159:408"/>
or the Princes and Princesses of his
Family, touching the Parricide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
on the Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the late King;
and that he bound himself and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
to the payment of all Debts
which he had contracted, as well
without the Kingdom as within it, to
make War against him.</p>
            <p>After this, the Duke going to pay
his Respects to him at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

receiv'd with great Honour, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Affection: and it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the King in walking with
him, at his ordinary rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was
very swift, that poor Prince, who
was fat and unwieldy, grew out of
breath, freely told him, <hi>That he was
quite spent, and cou'd go no farther:</hi>
The King embracing him, said only
this: <hi>For my o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to you, this is all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> I will ever

                  </gap> of the
League.</hi> Thus, the Duke being
charm'd with so much Generosity and
Goodness, which won upon his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
devoted himself wholly to his
service, and serv'd him afterwards to
his great advantage, especially against
<pb n="958" facs="tcp:42159:409"/>
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in the retaking of <hi>La
Fere</hi> and <hi>Amiens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, after this Agreement, there
remain'd no more towards the total
extinguishment of that great Fire,
which had spread it self through all
the Kingdom, than the reduction of
the Dukes of <hi>Mercaeur</hi> and of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi>
who yet held for the <hi>League,</hi> the one
in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and the other in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc.</hi>
For, as to the Town of <hi>Marseil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
(which the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to
whom the King had given that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Provence,</hi> had retaken
from the Rebels, it being then under
the dominion of two petty Tyrants,
who acknowledg'd neither the King,
nor the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> and who
wou'd have given it up to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards)</hi>
the History of its Deliverance,
belongs not to that of the <hi>League:</hi> for
the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> three years were
already past, when after the death of
his Brother, who was drown'd in the
<hi>Tarn,</hi> when he had been forc'd in his
Retrenchments at the Siege of <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
he was return'd from Father <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Capuchin, to be Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi>
and General of the <hi>League</hi> in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc.</hi>
               <pb n="959" facs="tcp:42159:409"/>
This change of his was made, at
the earnest Solicitations, of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Divines in <hi>Tholouse;</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
(who were consulted on this
Case of Conscience, and especially his
Brother the Cardinal, who after the
death of the late King, was enter'd
into the Party of the <hi>League)</hi> having
declar'd to him, that he was oblig'd,
under pain of mortal Sin, to accept of
that Employment, for the good of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Yet he wou'd not take it,
without a Dispensation from the Pope,
who transferr'd him from the Order
of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> to that of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi> He had maintain'd, till
that time, the Party of the <hi>Vnion</hi> in

but when he saw, that the greatest

it was his duty, dealing sincerely with

other Princes of his Family, had caus'd
<pb n="962" facs="tcp:42159:411"/>
almost a general Revolt in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bretagne,</hi> where he made
War for almost ten years, with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
not unlike that of the Duke of
<hi>Mayenne,</hi> but with much greater Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy.
For not withstanding that in
the declination of the <hi>League,</hi> he had
lost the greatest part of his Towns,
which were either taken from him, or
of their own accord forsook his Party,
yet he still fed his Imagination with
flattering Hopes, that this fair Dutchy,
to which he had some Pretensions in
right of his Wife, might at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in his possession, by some favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
revolution of Fortune, in case
the War continued.<note place="margin">Ann. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saw the King approaching <hi>Bretagne,</hi>
with such Forces, as there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of resisting, he made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
to the Dutchess of <hi>Beaufort,</hi>
to whom he offer'd the Princess his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Daughter, for the young Duke of
<hi>Vandome</hi> her Son. And it was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of that Marriage, that she
obtain'd from the King, an Edict yet
more honourable, and at least as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
as that which she had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
for the Duke of <hi>Mayenne,</hi> whom
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:42159:411"/>
she desir'd to have in her Interests,<note place="margin">Ann. 1598.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to make her self powerful
Friends, by whose assistance she might
compass her high Pretensions, which
all vanish'd by her sudden Death, in
the year ensuing.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the <hi>League,</hi> by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Duke of <hi>Mercaeur,</hi> who
had this advantage above all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of that Party, that his Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
was follow'd by an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein he obtain'd all the
Glory, that a Christian Hero cou'd
desire, and which has recommended
his Name to late Posterity. For the
Emperor <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> dissatisfy'd with
his <hi>German</hi> Generals, who had serv'd
him ill against the <hi>Turks,</hi> and being
inform'd of the rare Merit of this Prince,
having entertain'd him with leave
from the King, and given him the
Command of his Forces in <hi>Hungary,</hi>
he extended his Reputation through
all Christendom, by his wonderful
Exploits in War: particularly in the
famous Retreat of <hi>Canisia,</hi> with 1500
men, before an Army of 60000 <hi>Turks;</hi>
at the taking of <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> and at
the Battel wherein he defeated the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi>
               <pb n="964" facs="tcp:42159:412"/>
who came to the relief of their

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in that City. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon his return to <hi>France,</hi> after so
many heroick Actions, it pleas'd God
to reward him, with another Crown
of Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> infinitely surpassing that on
Earth, and to receive him into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
by means of a contagious Disease,
which took him from the World at
<hi>Nuremberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King was not yet satisfy'd, to
have wholly extinguish'd that Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
of Civil War, which the <hi>League</hi>
had lighted up in all the Provinces of
<hi>France,</hi> he farther desir'd, in order to
the security and quiet of his People,
after so great Troubles, to make an
end of foreign War, which he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
not long after the Treaty of the

of relation to the <hi>League,</hi> nor
the Peace which concluded it, I shall
forbear any mention of it in this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that I may not exceed the Limits
of my Subject. I shall only say, that
after the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had been oblig'd by

vertue of the Articles of Peace, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
all the Places, which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us, or that had been basely
given up to him, during our Troubles,
we have seen, since that time, under
the glorious Reigns of the <hi>Bourbons,</hi>
that imperial House still increasing
with the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, by Peace
and War, in Greatness, in Power, and
in Wealth, even till this present time,
when <hi>Louis</hi> the Great, by his victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Arms, and by his Laws, has rais'd
it to the highest pitch of Glory, on
the Ruines of those who had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its destruction by the <hi>League.</hi> A
wonderful effect of the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Justice; and a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
to all Subjects, that they
are indispensably oblig'd, to give to
<hi>Caesar</hi> what belongs to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and that
with good Reason, founded on the
express Commands of Jesus Christ,
the fourth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> inspir'd
by God's holy Spirit, has made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
against such kind of <hi>Leaguers,</hi>
containing, That whoever shall have

by which he is bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the state of his Countrey and of his

            <head>THE
POSTSCRIPT
Of the
TRANSLATOR.</head>
            <p>THat Government generally
consider'd, is of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
will admit of no
dispute: For whoever will
seriously consider, that no man has
naturally a right over his own Life,
so as to murder himself; will find by
consequence, that he has no right to
take away anothers Life; and that
no pact betwixt man and man, or of
Corporations and Individuals, or of
Soveraigns and Subjects, can intitle
them to this right. So that no Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
can lawfully, and without sin, be
punish'd, unless that power be deriv'd
from God. 'Tis He who has commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
Magistrates, and authoriz'd
them to prevent future Crimes by
punishing Offenders, and to redress
the injur'd by distributive Justice:
Subjects therefore are accountable to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42159:414"/>
Superiors, and the Superior to Him
alone. For the Soveraign being once
invested with lawful Authority, the
Subject has irrevocably given up his
power, and the dependance of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
is alone on God. A King, at
his Coronation, swears to govern his
Subjects by the Laws of the Land,
and to maintain the several Orders of
Men under him, in their lawful pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges;
and those Orders swear Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
and Fidelity to him, but
with this distinction, that the failure
of the People is punishable by the
King, that of the King is only punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the King of Kings. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
then are not Judges of good or
ill administration in their King; for
'tis inconsistent with the Nature of
Soveraignty, that they shou'd be so:
And if at some times they suffer,
through the irregularities of a bad
Prince, they enjoy more often the
benefits and advantages of a good one,
as God in his Providence shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
either for their blessing or their
punishment. The advantages, and
disadvantages of such subjection are
suppos'd to have been first consider'd,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42159:414"/>
and upon this ballance they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up their power without a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of resumption: So that it is in
vain for a Common-wealth Party to
plead, that men, for example, now
in being, cannot bind their Posterity
or give up their power: For if Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
can swear only for themselves,
when the Father dyes the subjection
ends, and the Son who has not sworn
can be no Traytor or Offender, either
to the King or to the Laws. And at
this rate a long-liv'd Prince may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
his Soveraignty, and be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
lawfully a King: But in the mean
time, 'tis evident that the Son enjoys
the benefit of the Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is an implicit acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of subjection. 'Tis endless
to run through all the extravagancies
of these men, and 'tis enough for us
that we are settled under a Lawful
Government of a Most Gracious
Prince; that our Monarchy is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary;
that it is naturally poiz'd by
our municipal Laws, with equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Prince and People; that he
Governs as he has promis'd by expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
Laws; and what the Laws are si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42159:415"/>
in, I think I may conclude to be
part of his Prerogative; for what the
King has not granted away, is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent
in him. The point of Succession
has sufficiently been discuss'd, both
as to the Right of it, and to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the People: One main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the other side is, how often
it has been remov'd from the Right
Line? As in the case of King <hi>Stephen,</hi>
and of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants
of the House of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
But 'tis easie to answer them, that
matter of Fact, and matter of Right,
are different Considerations: Both
those Kings were but Usurpers in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and the Providence of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
the Posterities of those who
were dispossess'd. By the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
they might as well justifie
the Rebellion and Murder of the Late
King: For there was not only a
Prince inhumanly put to death, but
a Government overturn'd; and first
an Arbitrary Common-wealth, then
two Usurpers set up against the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soveraign; but to our happiness
the same Providence has miraculously
restor'd the Right Heir, and to their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42159:415"/>
confusion, as miraculously preserv'd
him. In this present History, to go
no further, we see <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
by a Decree of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> divested,
what in them lay, of his Imperial
Rights, a Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> such
another as our first long Parliament,
confirming their Decree, a Pope au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorising
all this by his Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and an Holy League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
prosecuting this Deposition
by Arms: Yet an untimely death on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hindred him from reseating himself
in Glory on the Throne, after he was
in manifest possession of the Victory.
We see also the same <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> the
same Pope, Parliament, and League,
with greater force opposing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Right of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth; and we see him, in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
surmounting all these difficulties, and
triumphing over all these dangers.
God Almighty taking care of his own
Anointed, and the True Succession:
Neither the <hi>Papist</hi> nor <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Association</hi> prevailing at the last in
their attempts, but both baffl'd and
ruin'd, and the whole Rebellion end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either in the submission, or destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Conspirators.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42159:416"/>
'Tis true, as my Author has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in the beginning of his History,
that before the Catholick <hi>League,</hi> or
Holy Union, which is the Subject of
this Book, there was a League or
Combination of <hi>Huguenots,</hi> against
the Government of <hi>France,</hi> which
produc'd the Conspiracy of <hi>Amboise;</hi>
and the <hi>Calvinist</hi> Preachers (as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi>
a most impartial Historian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us) gave their opinion, that
they might take up Arms in their
own defence, and make way for a
free access to the King, to present
their Remonstrances: But it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at the same time, that they
shou'd seize on the Duke of <hi>Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se,</hi>
and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who were then Chief Ministers,
that they might be brought to Tryal
by process before the States; but he
adds immediately, who cou'd answer
for them, that the Prisoners shou'd
not have been kill'd out of hand, and
that they wou'd not have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of the Queen Mother's
Person, and of the young King's,
which was laid afterwards to their
charge? The conceal'd Heads of this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42159:416"/>
Conspiracy, were <hi>Lewis</hi> Prince of
<hi>Condè,</hi> and the famous Admiral <hi>de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny;</hi>
who being discontented at
Court, because their Enemies the
<hi>Guises</hi> had the management of affairs,
under the Queen Regent, to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
and being before turn'd <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists;</hi>
made use of that Rebellious
Sect, and the pretence of Religion,
to cover their Ambition and Revenge.
The same <hi>Mezeray</hi> tells us in one of
the next Pages, That the name of
<hi>Huguenots</hi> or <hi>Fidnos</hi> (from whence it
was corrupted) signifies <hi>League</hi> or <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation,</hi>
in the <hi>Swisse</hi> Language; and
was brought, together with the Sect,
from <hi>Geneva</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> But from
whencesoever they had their name,
'tis most certain that pestilent race of
people cannot by their principles, be
good Subjects: For whatever inforc'd
Obedience they pay to Authority,
they believe their Class above the
King; and how they wou'd order him
if they had him in their power, our
Most Gracious Soveraign has suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
experienc'd when he was in
<hi>Scotland.</hi> As for their boast that
they brought him in, 'tis much as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42159:417"/>
true, as that of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> who
pretend, as my Author tells you in
his Preface, That they seated his
Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth upon
the Throne. For both <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>English Presbyterians</hi> were fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
and practically Rebels; and the
<hi>French</hi> have this advantage over ours,
that they came in to the aid of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nry</hi>
the Third, at his greatest need, or
rather were brought over by the
King of <hi>Navarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> their declar'd Head,
on a prospect of great advantage to
their Religion; whereas ours, never
inclin'd to the Kings Restauration,
till themselves had been trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoot
by the <hi>Independent</hi> Party, and
till the voice of three Nations call'd
aloud for him, that is to say, when
they had no possibility of keeping
him any longer out of <hi>England.</hi> But
the beginning of Leagues, Unions,
and Associations, by those who call'd
themselves Gods People, for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Religious Worship, and
for the redress of pretended Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
in the State, is of a higher
rise, and is justly to be dated from
<hi>Luther</hi>'s time; and the private Spirit,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42159:417"/>
or the gift of interpreting Scriptures
by private Persons, without Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was certainly the Original Cause
of such Cabals in the Reform'd
Churches: So dangerous an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Rebellion is the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
in the hands of ignorant and
bigoted men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> led up
the Dance, who had always in their
mouths, Faith, Charity, the Fear of
God, and mortifications of the Flesh;
Prayers, Fastings, Meditations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Riches and Honours were
their first specious practices: From
thence they grew up by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to a separation from other men,
who according to their Pharisaical
account, were less holy than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and Decency, Civility, neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Attire, good Furniture and
Order in their Houses, were the
brands of carnal-minded men. Then
they proceeded to nick-name the
days of the Weeks, and <hi>Sunday, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
Tuesday, &amp;c.</hi> as Heathen names,
must be rejected for the <hi>First, Second,</hi>
and <hi>Third</hi> Days, distinguishing only
by their numbers. Thus they began
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42159:418"/>
to play, as it were, at cross purposes
with mankind; and to do every
thing by contraries, that they might
be esteem'd more godly and more
illuminated. It had been a wonder,
considering their fanciful perfections,
if they had stopp'd here. They were
now knowing and pure enough to
extend their private Reformation to
the Church and State; for Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
love always to be dealing as well in
Temporals as Spirituals; or rather,
they love to be fingring Spirituals, in
order to their grasping Temporals.
Therefore they had the impudence to
pretend to Inspiration in the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scriptures; a trick which
since that time has been familiarly
us'd by every Sect, in its turn, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their interests. Not content
with this, they assum'd to themselves
a more particular intimacy with Gods
Holy Spirit; as if it guided them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
beyond the power of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
to know more of him than
was therein taught: For now the
Bible began to be a dead Letter, of it
self; and no virtue was attributed to
the reading of it, but all to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42159:418"/>
man, the call of the Holy
Ghost, and the ingrafting of the
Word, opening their Understanding
to hidden Mysteries by Faith: And
here the Mountebank way of canting
words came first in use: as if there
were something more in Religion
than cou'd be express'd in intelligible
terms, or Nonsence were the way to
Heaven. This of necessity must breed
divisions amongst them; for every
mans Inspiration being particular to
himself, must clash with anothers,
who set up for the same qualification;
the Holy Ghost being infallible in
all alike, though he spoke contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
in several mouths: But they
had a way of licking one another
whole; mistakes were to be forgiven
to weak Brethren; the failing was
excus'd for the right intention; he
who was more illuminated, wou'd
allow some light to be in the less, and
degrees were made in contradictory
Propositions. But Godfathers and
Godmothers, by common consent,
were already set aside, together with
the observation of Festivals, which
they said were of <hi>Antichristian</hi> Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42159:419"/>
They began at last to Preach
openly, that they had no other King
but Christ, and by consequence,
Earthly Magistrates were out of
doors: All the gracious Promises in
Scripture they apply'd to themselves,
as Gods chosen, and all the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were the portion of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
These impieties were at first
unregarded, and afterwards tolerated
by their Soveraigns: And <hi>Luther</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
made request to the Duke of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi>
to deal favourably with them, as
honest-meaning men who were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
But in the end, when by these
specious pretences they had gather'd
strength, they who had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that Christ was the only King
on Earth, and at the same time as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
to themselves, that Christ was
theirs; inferr'd by good consequence,
that they were to maintain their
King; and not only so, but to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
that belief in others; for what
God wills, man must obey: And for
that reason they entred into a League
of Association amongst themselves,
to deliver their <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt;</hi>
to seize <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to turn the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42159:419"/>
out of possession. Thus you see
by what degrees of Saintship they
grew up into Rebellion, under their
Successive Heads, <hi>Muncer, Phifer,
Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Knipperdolling,</hi>
where, what Violences, Impieties,
and Sacriledges they committed,
those who are not satisfied, may read
in <hi>Sleydan.</hi> The general Tradition is,
that after they had been besieg'd in
<hi>Munster,</hi> and were forc'd by assault,
their Ringleaders being punish'd, and
they dispers'd; two Ships-lading of
these precious Saints was disembogu'd
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they set up again,
and broach'd anew their pernicious
Principles. If this be true, we may
easily perceive on what a Noble stock
Presbytery was grafted. From <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
they had a blessed passage into
<hi>England;</hi> or at least arriving here
from other parts, they soon came to
a considerable increase. <hi>Calvin,</hi> to
do him right, writ to King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth, a sharp Letter against these
People; but our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> after
him, have been content to make use
of them in the late Civil Wars,
where they and all the rest of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42159:420"/>
Sectaries were joyn'd in the <hi>Good Old
Cause</hi> of Rebellion against His Late
Majesty; though they cou'd not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
about dividing the Spoyls, when
they had obtain'd the Victory: And
'tis impossible they ever shou'd; for all
claiming to the Spirit, no Party will
suffer another to be uppermost, nor
indeed will they tolerate each other;
because the Scriptures interpreted by
each to their own purpose, is always
the best weapon in the strongest
hand: Observe them all along, and
Providence is still the prevailing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
They who happen to be in
power, will ever urge it against those
who are undermost; as they who are
depress'd, will never fail to call it
Persecution. They are never united

Bodies of contrary Natures,
and warmth divides them.</p>
            <p>How <hi>Presbytery</hi> was transplanted
into <hi>England,</hi> I have formerly related
out of good Authors. The Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
arising in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign,
forc'd many Protestants out of their
Native Country into Foreign parts,
where <hi>Calvinism</hi> having already taken
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42159:420"/>
root (as at <hi>Francfort, Strasburg,</hi> and
<hi>Geneva</hi>) those Exiles grew tainted
with that new Discipline; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, spread the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of it both amongst the Clergy
and Laity of this Nation.</p>
            <p>Any man who will look into the
Tenets of the first Sectaries, will find
these to be more or less embued with
them: Here they were supported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
by Great Men for private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests:
What trouble they gave that
Queen, and how she curb'd them,
is notoriously known to all who are
conversant in the Histori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of those
times. How King <hi>Iames</hi> was plagu'd
with them is known as well, to any
man who has read the Reverend and
Sincere <hi>Spotswood:</hi> And how they
were baffled by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in a Disputation which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> even to
the Conversion of Dr. <hi>Sparks,</hi> who was
one of the two Disputants of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and afterwards writ against them,
any one who pleases may be satisfied.</p>
            <p>The Agreement of their Principles
with the fiercest Jesuits, is as easie to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42159:421"/>
be demonstrated, and has already
been done by several hands: I will
only mention some few of them, to
show how well prepar'd they came
to that solemn Covenant of theirs,
which they borrow'd first from the
<hi>Holy League</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> and have
lately copied out again in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Association against his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as the Author of this
History has told you, was himself a
Preacher for the <hi>League</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Rebellion there, in the Reign
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. Some of
his Principles are these following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Kingdoms of Men, the Power
of the King is from the People, because
the People make the King:</hi> Observing
that he says, <hi>In the Kingdoms of Men,</hi>
there is no doubt but he restrains this
Principle to the subordination of the
Pope: For his Holiness, in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
as you have read, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
<hi>Protector of the League:</hi> So
that the Pope first Excommunicates
(which is the Outlawry of the
Church) and by virtue of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
the People are left
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42159:421"/>
to their own natural liberty, and may
without farther Process from <hi>Rome</hi>
depose him.</p>
            <p>Accordingly you see it practis'd, in
the same Instance: Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> first
thunderstruck King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
and the King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> then the
<hi>Sorbonne</hi> make Decrees, that they
have successively forfeited the Crown;
the Parliament verifies these Decrees,
and the Pope is petition'd to confirm
the sence of the Nation; that is, of
the Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I have related this too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
for</hi> Bellarmine; <hi>for we hear him
in another place, positively affirming
it as matter of Faith,</hi> If any Christian
Prince shall depart from the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and shall withdraw others from it,
he immediately forfeits all Power and
Dignity, even before the Pope has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
Sentence on him; and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in case they have power to do it,
may and ought to cast out such an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
from his Soveraignty over Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now consonant to this is</hi> Buchanan<hi>'s
Principle,</hi> That the People may confer
the Government on whom they please.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42159:422"/>
               <hi>And the Maxim of</hi> Knox, That if
Princes be Tyrants against God and his
Truth, their Subjects are releas'd from
their Oath of Obedience. <hi>And</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<hi>'s,</hi>
That when Magistrates cease to
do their Duties, God gives the Sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Peoples hands: evil Princes ought
to be depos'd by inferior Magistrates; and
a private man, having an inward Call,
may kill a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>'Tis the work of a Scavenger, to
rake together and carry off all these
Dunghills; they are easie to be found
at the Doors of all our Sects, and all
our Atheistical Commonwealths men.
And, besides, 'tis a needless labour;
they are so far from disowning such
Positions, that they glory in them;
and wear them like Marks of Honour,
as an <hi>Indian</hi> does a Ring in his Nose,
or a <hi>Souldanian</hi> a Belt of Garbidge. In
the mean time I appeal to any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
man, whether men of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
can reasonably expect any Favour
from the Government in which they
live, and which Viper-like they wou'd
devour.</p>
            <p>What I have remark'd of them is
no more than necessary, to show how
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42159:422"/>
aptly their Principles are suited to their
Practices: The History it self has suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
discover'd to the unbiass'd
Reader, that both the last Rebellion,
and this present Conspiracy, (which
is the mystery of Iniquity still work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the three Nations) were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
founded on the <hi>French League:</hi>
that was their Model, according to
which they built their <hi>Babel.</hi> You
have seen how warily the first Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in <hi>Picardy</hi> was worded: nothing
was to be attempted but for the King's
Service, and an Acknowledgement
was formally made, that both the
Right and Power of the Government
was in him: but it was pretended,
that by occasion of the true <hi>Protestant</hi>
Rebels, the Crown was not any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in condition, either of maintaining
it self, or protecting them. And that
therefore in the Name of God, and by
the Power of the holy Ghost, they
joyn'd together in their own Defence,
and that of their Religion. But all
this while, though they wou'd seem
to act by the King's Authority, and
under him, the Combination was kept
as secret as possibly they cou'd, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42159:423"/>
even without the participation of the
Soveraign; a sure Sign, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him no good at the bottom.
Nay, they had an Evasion ready too,
against his Authority; for 'tis plain,
they joyn'd <hi>Humieres,</hi> the Governour
of the Province, in Commission with
him; and only nam'd the King for
show; but engag'd themselves at the
same time to his Lieutenant, to be
obedient to all his Commands; levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men and Money, without the
King's Knowledge, or any Law, but
what they made amongst themselves.
So, that in effect, the Rebellion and
Combination of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> was
only a leading Card, and an example
to the <hi>Papists,</hi> to rebel, on their side.
And there was only this difference in
the Cause, that the <hi>Calvinists</hi> set up
for their Reformation, by the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
Power of Religion, and inherent
Right of the People, against the King
and Pope. The <hi>Papists</hi> pretended the
same popular Right for their Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against the King, and for the same
end of Reformation, only they fac'd
it, with Church and Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42159:423"/>
Our Sectaries, and Long Parliament
of 41, had certainly these <hi>French</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
in their eye. They copy'd
their Methods of Rebellion; at first
with great professions of Duty and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the King; all they did was
in order to make him glorious; all
that was done against him was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be under his Authority and
in his Name; and even the War they
rais'd, was pretended for the King
and Parliament. But those Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are so notoriously known, and
have imploy'd so many Pens, that it
wou'd be a nauseous Work for me to
dwell on them. To draw the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>French</hi> Transactions and
ours, were in effect to transcribe the
History I have translated. Every Page
is full of it. Every man has seen the
Parallel of the <hi>Holy League,</hi> and our
<hi>Covenant;</hi> and cannot but observe,
that besides the Names of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and the
Names of Religions, <hi>Protestant</hi> and
<hi>Papist,</hi> there is scarcely to be found
the least difference, in the project of
the whole, and in the substance of
the Articles. In the mean time I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42159:424"/>
but take notice, that our Rebels
have left this eternal Brand upon their
Memories, that while all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was for the setting up the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi>
Religion, and pulling down of
Popery, they have borrow'd from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
both the Model of their Design,
and their Arguments to defend it.
And not from loyal, well principled
<hi>Papists;</hi> but from the worst the most
bigotted, and most violent of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
From some of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> an
Order founded on purpose to combat
<hi>Lutheranism</hi> and <hi>Calvinism.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact is so palpably true, and so
notorious, that they cannot have the
Impudence to deny it. But some of
the <hi>Ies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ites</hi> are the shame of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church, as the Sectaries are of
ours. Their Tenets in Politicks are
the same; both of them hate Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and love Democracy: both of
them are superlatively violent; they
are inveterate haters of each other in
Religion, and yet agree in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Government. And if after so
many Advices to a Painter, I might
advise a <hi>Dutch</hi>-maker of Emblems; he
shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d draw a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in Arms on
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42159:424"/>
one side, a <hi>Iesuit</hi> on the other, and a
crownd Head betwixt them: for tis
perfectly a Battel-royal. Each of
them is endeavouring the destruction
of his Adversary; but the Monarch is
sure to get Blows on both sides. But
for those Sectaries and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men
of 41, before I leave
them, I must crave leave to observe
of them, that generally they were a
sowr sort of thinking men, grim and
surly Hypocrites; such as coud cover
their Vices, with an appearance of
great Devotion and austerity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
neither Profaneness, nor Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
were encouragd by them, nor
practisd publickly, which gave them
a great opinion of Sanctity amongst
the Multitude; and by that opinion
principally they did their business:
Though their Politicks were taken
from the <hi>Catholick League,</hi> yet their
Christianity much resembled those
<hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who were their Original
in Doctrine; and these indeed were
formidable Instruments of a religious
Rebellion. But our new Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of these seven last years, are men
of quite another Make: I speak not of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42159:425"/>
their non-Conformist Preachers, who
pretend to <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and are as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
in their Worship, as were those
first Sectaries, but of their Leading
men, the Heads of their Faction, and
the principal Members of it: what
greater looseness of Life, more athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
Discourse, more open Lewdness
was ever seen, than generally was and
is to be observ'd in those men? I am
neither making a Satyr nor a Sermon
here; but I wou'd remark a little the
ridiculousness of their Management.
The strictness of Religion is their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
and the men who are to set it
up, have theirs to choose. The Long
Parliament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Rebels frequented Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and observ'd Prayers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings
with all solemnity: but these
new Reformers, who ought in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to have trodden in their steps,
because their End was the same, to
gull the People by an outside of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
never us'd the means of insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves into the opinion of the
Multitude. Swearing, Drunkenness,
Blasphemies, and worse sins than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
are the Badges of the Party:
nothing but Liberty in their mouths,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42159:425"/>
nothing but License in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>For which reason they were never
esteem'd by the Zealots of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but as their Tools; and had
they got uppermost, after the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
had been crush'd, they wou'd
have been blown off, as too light for
their Society. For my own part,
when I had once observ'd this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
error in their Politiques, I
was no longer afraid of their success:
No Government was ever ruin'd by
the open scandal of its opposers. This
was just a <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conspiracy, of
profligate, debauch'd, and bankrupt
men: The wealthy amongst them
were the fools of the Party, drawn
in by the rest whose Fortunes were
desperate; and the Wits of the Cabal
sought only their private advantages.
They had either lost their Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and consequently were piqu'd,
or were in hope to raise themselves
by the general disturbance. Upon
which account, they never cou'd be
true to one another: There was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Honour nor Conscience in the
Foundation of their <hi>League,</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42159:426"/>
man having an eye to his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
advancement, was no longer
a Friend, than while his Interest was
carrying on: So that Treachery was
at the bottom of their design, first
against the Monarchy, and if that
fail'd, against each other; in which,
be it spoken to the honour of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the <hi>English</hi> are not behind any
other Country. In few words, just
as much fidelity might be expected
from them in a common cause, as
there is amongst a Troop of honest
murdering and ravishing Bandits;
while the Booty is in prospect, they
combine heartily and faithfully, but
when a Proclamation of Pardon
comes out, and a good reward into
the bargain, for any one who brings
in anothers Head; the Scene is
chang'd, and they are in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being betray'd every man by
his Companion, than they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
by the joynt forces of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
'Tis true, they are still to
be accounted dangerous, because,
though they are dispers'd at present,
and without an Head, yet time and
lenity may furnish them again with a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42159:426"/>
Commander: And all men are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that the debauch'd Party of
them, have no principle of Godliness
to restrain them from Violence and
Murders; nor the pretended Saints
any principle of Charity, for 'tis an
action of Piety in them to destroy
their Enemies, having first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
them Enemies of God. What
my Author says in general of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi>
may justly be applyed to all
our Sectaries: They are a malicious
and bloody Generation, they bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honest Men with their Pens when
they are not in power; and when
they are uppermost, they hang them
up like Dogs. To such kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
all means of reclaiming, but only
severity, are useless, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
obstinate in their designs against
Church and Government: For tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t
they may become more sanctify'd
Traytors another time.</p>
            <p>In the former part of our History,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42159:427"/>
we see what <hi>Henry</hi> the Third gain'd
from them by his remisness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions:
Though our last King was
not only incomparably more pious
than that Prince, but also was far from
being tax'd with any of his Vices;
yet in this they may be compar'd,
without the least manner of reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that extreme Indulgence and too
great Concessions, were the ruin of
them both: And by how much the
more, a King is subject by his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to this frailty of too much mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is so near resembling the
God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> like Attribute of Mercy; by so
much is he the more liable to be tax'd
with Tyranny. A strange Paradox,
but which was sadly verified in the
Persons of those two Princes: For a
Faction appearing zealous for the
Publick Liberty, counts him a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
who yields not up whatever they
demand, even his most undoubted
and just Prerogatives; all that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
a Soveraign from a Subject,
and the yielding up, or taking away
of which, is the very Subversion of
the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42159:427"/>
Every point which a Monarch lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or relinquishes, but renders him
the weaker to maintain the rest; and
besides, they so construe it, as if what
he gave up were the natural right of
the people, which he or his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
had usurp'd from them; which
makes it the more dangerous for him
to quit his hold, and is truly the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why so many mild Princes have
been branded with the names of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
by their incroaching Subjects.
I have not room to enlarge upon this
matter as I wou'd, neither dare I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to press the Argument more
closely: But passing by, as I promis'd,
all the remarkable passages in the late
Kings Reign, which resemble the
Transactions of the <hi>League;</hi> I will
briefly take notice of some few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
wherein our late Associators
and Conspirators have made a Third
Copy of the <hi>League.</hi> For the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of their first Politiques was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no other than the <hi>French:</hi> This
was first copied by the Rebels in Forty
One, and since recopyed within these
late years by some of those who are
lately dead, and by too many others
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42159:428"/>
yet alive, and still drawing after the
same design. In which, for want of
time, many a fair blot shall be left
unhit, neither do I promise to observe
any method of times, or to take
things in order as they happen'd.</p>
            <p>As for the Persons who manag'd
the two Associations, theirs and ours,
'tis most certain that in them is found
the least resemblance: And 'tis well
for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were not like: For they
had men of Subtilty and Valour to
design, and then to carry on their
Conspiracy; ours were but bunglers
in comparison of them, who having
a Faction not made by them, but
ready form'd and fashion'd to their
hands, (thanks to their Fathers) yet
fail'd in every one of their Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and manag'd their business with
much less dexterity, though far more
wickedness than the <hi>French.</hi> They
had indeed at their Head an old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirator,
witty and turbulent, like
the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and for cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in Execution much such another.
But the good sence and conduct was
clearly wanting on the <hi>English</hi> side;
so that if we will allow him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42159:428"/>
of the Plot, or at least of the
Conspiracy, which is an honour that
no man will be willing to take from
him; in all other circumstances he
more resembled the old decrepit Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who fed himself
with imaginary hopes of power,
dream'd of outliving a King and his
Successor, much more young and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
than himself, and of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World after their decease:
To dye in Prison, or in Banishment,
I think will make no mighty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
but this is a main one; that
the one was the Dupe of all his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the other led after him, and made
fools of all his Faction. As for a
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> or even so much as a
Duke of <hi>May<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nne,</hi> I can find none in
their whole Cabal. I cannot believe
that any man now living cou'd have
the vanity to pretend to it: 'Tis not
every Age that can produce a Duke
of <hi>Guise;</hi> a man who without the
least shadow of a Title (unless we
will believe the Memoires of the
crack-brain'd Advocate <hi>David,</hi> who
gave him one from <hi>Charlemaign)</hi>
durst make himself Head of a Party,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42159:429"/>
and was not only so in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
but really; presum'd to beard a
King, and was upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declar'd his Lieutenant General,
and his Successor. None of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
will hold in the Comparison,
and therefore I leave it to be boasted,
it may be, by one Party, but I am
sure to be laugh'd at by another.
Many hot-headed <hi>Chevaliers d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi>
and ambitious Bravo's like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> may be found amongst
them, Intriguing Ladies, and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
of the Times, such as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
in the Army of the <hi>League,</hi> at
the Battel of <hi>Yvry;</hi> and besides them,
many underling Knaves, Pimps, and
Fools; but these are not worthy to
be drawn into resemblance.</p>
            <p>Therefore to pass by their Persons,
and consider their Design: 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that on both sides they began
with a League, and ended with a
Conspiracy. In this they have copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even to the word <hi>Association,</hi>
which you may observe was us'd by
<hi>Humieres,</hi> in the first wary <hi>League,</hi>
which was form'd in <hi>Picardy:</hi> and we
see to what it tended in the Event;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42159:429"/>
For when <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> had
in a manner vanquish'd his Rebels, and
was just upon the point of mastring
<hi>Paris,</hi> a <hi>Iacobin,</hi> set on by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the <hi>League,</hi> most barbarously
murther'd him; and by the way take
notice, that he pretended <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi>
or Inspiration of God's holy Spirit, for
the commission of his Parricide. I
leave my Superiours to conclude from
thence, the danger of tolerating Non-conformists,
who (be it said with
Reverence) under pretence of a
Whisper from the holy Ghost, think
themselves oblig'd to perpetrate the
most enormous Crimes against the
Person of their Soveraign, when they
have first voted him a Tyrant, and an
Enemy to God's People. This indeed
was not so impudent a Method as what
was us'd in the formal process of a
pretended high-Court of Justice, in
the Murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First;
and therefore I do not compare those
Actions: but 'tis much resembling,
the intended Murther of our gracious
King, at the <hi>Rye,</hi> and other Places:
and that the Head of a Colledge might
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42159:430"/>
not be wanting to urge the perfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mance
of this horrible Attempt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Father <hi>Edm. Bourgoing,</hi> let
Father <hi>Ferguson</hi> appear, who was not
wanting in his spiritual Exhortations
to our Conspirators, and to make
them believe, that to assassinate the
King, was only to take away another
<hi>Holophernes.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Iacobin</hi>
was but one, and there were many
joyn'd in our Conspiracy, and more
perhaps than <hi>Rumsey</hi> or <hi>West</hi> have
ever nam'd; but this, though it takes
from the justness of the Comparison,
adds incomparably more to the Guilt
of it, and makes it fouler on our side
of the Water.</p>
            <p>My Author makes mention of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conspiracy against <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth, for the seizing of his Person
at <hi>Mante,</hi> by the young Cardinal of
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was Head of the third
Party, call'd at that time the <hi>Politicks,</hi>
that is to say in modern English,
<hi>Trimmers:</hi> This too was a Limb of
our Conspiracy; and the more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Party of our Traitors were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in it. But had it taken effect,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42159:430"/>
the least it cou'd have produc'd, was
to have overthrown the Succession;
and no reasonable man wou'd believe,
but they who cou'd forget their Duty
so much as to have seiz'd the King,
might afterwards have been induc'd
to have him made away, especially
when so fair a provision was made, by
the House of Commons, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
were to suffer for it.</p>
            <p>But they have not only rummag'd
the <hi>French</hi> Histories of the <hi>League,</hi> for
Conspiracies and Parricides of Kings;
I shall make it apparent that they
have studied those execrable Times,
for Precedents of undermining the
lawful Authority of their Soveraigns.
Our <hi>English</hi> are not generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for Invention; but these were
Merchants of small Wares; very Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in Policy: they must like our
Taylors have all their Fashions from
the <hi>French:</hi> and study the <hi>French
League</hi> for every Alteration, as our
Snippers go over once a year into
<hi>France,</hi> to bring back the newest
Mode, and to learn to cut and shape
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42159:431"/>
For example: The first Estates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd
at <hi>Blois</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, (the
<hi>League</hi> being then on foot, and most
of the three Orders dipt in it,) deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of that King, that the Articles
which shou'd be approv'd by the three
Orders shou'd pass for inviolable Laws,
without leaving to the King the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of changing any thing in them.
That the same was design'd here by
the Leading men of their Faction, is
obvious to every one: for they had it
commonly in their mouths, in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Discourse: and it was offer'd in
Print by <hi>Plato Redivivus,</hi> as a good
Expedient for the Nation, in case his
Majesty wou'd have consented to it.</p>
            <p>Both in the first and last Estates at
<hi>Blois,</hi> the Bill of Exclusion, against
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was press'd; and
in the last carried by all the three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
though the King wou'd never
pass it: The end of that Bill was very
evident; it was to have introduc'd
the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> into the Throne,
after the King's decease: to which he
had no manner of Title, or at least a
very crack'd one, of which his own
Party were asham'd. Our Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42159:431"/>
was copied from hence; but
thrown out by the House of Peers,
before it came to the King's turn to
have wholly quash'd it.</p>
            <p>After the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had forc'd
the King to fly from <hi>Paris</hi> by the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricades,</hi>
the Queen-Mother being then
in the Traitors Interests, when he had
outwitted her so far, as to perswade
her, to joyn in the Banishment of the
Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> his Enemy; and to
make her believe, that if the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> whom she hated, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
he wou'd assist her, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her beloved Grandchild of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
to the possession of the Crown; it
was propos'd by him, for the <hi>Parisians,</hi>
that the Lieutenancy of the City
might be wholly put into their hands:
that the new Provost of Merchants,
and present Sheriffs of the Faction,
might be confirm'd by the King; and
for the future, they shou'd not only
elect their Sheriffs, but the Colonels
and Captains of the several Wards.</p>
            <p>How nearly this was copied in the
tumultuous meetings of the City for
their Sheriffs, both we and they have
cause to remember; and Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi>'s
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42159:432"/>
Book, concerning their Rights in the
City Charter, mingled with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
aspersions of the Government,
confirms the Notions to have been the
same. And I could produce some
very probable instances out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Libel, (considering the time at
which it was written, which was just
before the detection of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy)
that the Author of it, as well
as the Supervisor, was engag'd in it,
or at least privy to it; but let Villany
and Ingratitude be safe and flourish.</p>
            <p>By the way, an Observation of
<hi>Philip de Comines</hi> comes into my
mind: That when the Dukes of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
who were Lords of <hi>Ghent,</hi> had
the choice of the Sheriffs of that City,
in that year all was quiet and well
govern'd; but when they were elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the people, nothing but tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and seditions follow'd.</p>
            <p>I might carry this resemblance a
little farther: For in the heat of the
Plot, when the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pilgrims were
coming over, nay more, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be landed; when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives
of the Commons were
either mortally afraid, or pretended
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42159:432"/>
to be so of this airy Invasion; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
was actually made to the King,
that he wou'd put the <hi>Militia</hi> into
their hands: which how prudently
he refus'd, the example of his Father
has inform'd the Nation.</p>
            <p>To show how the Heads of their
Party had conn'd over their Lesson of
the Barricades of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the midst
of <hi>Oates</hi> his Popish Plot, when they
had fermented the City with the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of their Sedition, and they were
all prepar'd for a rising against the
Government; let it be remembred,
that as the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> and the
<hi>Council of Sixteen,</hi> forg'd a List of
Names, which they pretended to be
of such as the King had set down for
destruction; so a certain Earl of <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Memory,</hi> caus'd a false report to
be spread of his own danger, and
some of his Accomplices, who were
to be murder'd by the Papists and the
Royal Party; which was a design to
endear themselves to the multitude,
as the Martyrs of their cause; and at
the same time, to cast an odious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
on the King and Ministers, as
if they sought their blood with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42159:433"/>
cruelty, without the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
forms of Justice. To which may
be added, as an Appendix, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
fear, when they went to the
Parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ament at <hi>Oxford;</hi> before which
some of them made their Wills, and
shew'd them publickly; others sent
to search about the places where the
two Houses were to sit, as if another
Gunpowder Plot was contriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and almost every man of
them, according to his quality, went
attended with his Guard of Janizaries,
like <hi>Titus:</hi> So that what with their
followers, and the seditious Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of that City, they made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
appearance of an Army; at
least sufficient to have swallowed up
the Guards, and to have seiz'd the
Person of the King, in case he had not
prevented it by a speedy removal, as
soon as he had Dissolv'd that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I begin already to be tir'd with
drawing after their deformities, as a
Painter wou'd be, who had nothing
before him in his Table but <hi>Lazars,</hi>
Cripples, and hideous Faces, which
he was oblig'd to represent: Yet I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42159:433"/>
must not omit some few of their most
notorious Copyings. Take for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
their <hi>Council of Six,</hi> which
was an imitation of the <hi>League,</hi> who
set up their famous Council, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call'd <hi>Of the Sixteen:</hi> And take
notice, that on both sides they pick'd
out the most heady and violent men
of the whole Party; nay they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
not so much as their natural
parts, but heavy Blockheads were
thrown in for lumber, to make up
the weight: Their Zeal for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and their Ambition, atton'd for
their want of Judgment, especially
if they were thought to have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the people. Loud roarers
of <hi>Ay</hi> and <hi>No</hi> in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
common sence in ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
if they were favourites of
the Multitude, were made Privy
Counsellors of their Cabal; and
Fools, who only wanted a parti-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd
Coat, a Cap, and a Bawble,
to pass for such amongst reasonable
men, were to redress the imaginary
Grievances of a Nation, by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
or at least seizing of the King.
Men of scandalous Lives, Cheats and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42159:434"/>
Murderers, were to Reform the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and propagate the Protestant
Religion: And the rich Ideots to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
their Estates and Expectations,
to forsake their Ease, Honour, and
Preferments, for an empty name of
Heading a Party: The wittiest man
amongst them to encumber and vex
his decrepit Age, for a silly picque of
revenge, and to maintain his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
to the last, of never being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with any Government, in which
he was not more a King than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Master. To give the last stroke
to this resemblance, Fortune did her
part; and the same fate of division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves, ruin'd both those
Councils which were contriving their
King's destruction. The Duke of
<hi>Mayenne</hi> and his Adherents, who
were much the most honest of the
<hi>Leaguers,</hi> were not only for a King,
but for a King of the Royal Line, in
case that Duke cou'd not cause the
Election to fall on himself, which
was impossible, because he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied: The rest were some for
this man, some for another, and all
in a lump for the Daughter of <hi>Spain;</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42159:434"/>
this disunited them, and in the end
ruin'd their conspiracy. In our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Six,</hi> some were for murdering,
and some for securing of the King;
some for a rising in the West, and
some for an Insurrection of the brisk
Boys of <hi>Wapping:</hi> In short, some
were for a mungrel kind of Kingship,
to the exclusion of the Royal Line,
but the greater part for a bare-fac'd
Common-wealth. This rais'd a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in their Counsel, that division
was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omented into a mutual hatred
of each other; and the conclusion
was, that instead of one Conspiracy,
the Machines play'd double, and
produc'd two, which were carry'd on
at the same time: A kind of Spread
Eagle Plot was hatch'd, with two
Heads growing out of the same Body;
such twin Treasons are apt to struggle
like <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the Womb,
and both endeavouring to be first born,
the Younger pulls back the Elder by
the Heel.</p>
            <p>I promis'd to observe no order, and
am per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orming my word before I was
aware: After the Barricades, and at
many other times, the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42159:435"/>
and <hi>Council of Sixteen,</hi> amongst the
rest of the Articles, demanded of the
King to cashier his Guards of the
forty five Gentlemen, as unknown in
the times of his Predecessors, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;
as also to remove his surest
Friends from about his Person, and
from their Places both Military and
Civil. I leave any man to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Conspirators did not play
the Second Part to the same Tune:
Whether his Majesties Guards were
not alledg'd to be unlawful, and a
grievance to the Subjects; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
frequent Votes did not pass in
the House of Commons at several
times, for removing and turning out
of Office, those who on all occasions
behav'd themselves most Loyally to
the King, without so much as giving
any other reason of their misdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
than publick same: That is to
say, reports forg'd and spread by their
own Faction, or without allowing
them the common justice of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves from those calumnies
and aspersions.</p>
            <p>I omit the many illegal Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of free-born men, by their own
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42159:435"/>
Representatives, who from a Jury e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
themselves into Judges; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I find nothing resembling it in
the worst and most seditious Times of
<hi>France.</hi> But let the History be
search'd, and I believe <hi>Bussy Le Clerc</hi>
never committed more outrages in
pillaging of Houses, than <hi>Waller,</hi> in
pretending to search for Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques:
Neither do I remember that
the <hi>French Leaguers</hi> ever took the
evidence of a <hi>Iew,</hi> as ours did of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi>
But this I wonder at the less,
considering what Christian Witnesses
have been us'd, if at least the chief
of them was ever Christned. <hi>Bussy
le Clerc,</hi> 'tis true, turn'd out a whole
Parliament together, and brought
them Prisoners to the <hi>Bastille;</hi> and
<hi>Bussy Oates</hi> was for garbling too, when
he inform'd against a worthy and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Member, whom he caus'd to be
expell'd the House, and sent Prisoner
to the Tower: But that which was
then accounted a disgrace to him,
will make him be remembred with
honour to Posterity.</p>
            <p>I will trouble the Reader but with
one Observation more, and that shall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42159:436"/>
be to show how dully and pedantical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have copied, even the false
steps of the <hi>League,</hi> in Politicks, and
those very Maxims which ruin'd the
Heads of it. The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was
always oftentatious of his power in
the States, where he carried all things
in opposition to the King: But by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
too much on the power he had
there, and not using Arms when he
had them in his hand, I mean by not
prosecuting his Victory to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
when he had the King inclos'd
in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> he miss'd his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and Fortune never gave it him
again.</p>
            <p>The late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> who
was the undoubted Head and Soul of
that Party, went upon the same max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes,
being (as we may reasonably
conclude) fearful of hazarding his
Fortunes, and observing that the late
Rebellion under the former King,
though successful in War, yet ended
in the Restauration of His Present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
his aim was to have excluded
His Royal Highness by an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
and to have forc'd such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
from the King, by pressing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42159:436"/>
the chymerical dangers of a Popish
Plot, as wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not only have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
the Succession, but have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Monarchy. For he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
he ventur'd nothing, if he
cou'd have executed his design by
form of Law, and in a Parliamentary
way. In the mean time, he made
notorious mistakes: First, in imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his pretensions wou'd have
pass'd in the House of Peers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by the King. When the
death of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> had
fermented the people, when the City
had taken the alarm of a Popish Plot,
and the Government of it was in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natique
hands; when a Body of white
Boys was already appearing in the
West, and many other Counties wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but the word to rise, then was the
time to have push'd his business: But
Almighty God, who had otherwise
dispos'd of the Event, infatuated his
Counsels, and made him slip his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
which he himself observ'd
too late, and would have redress'd by
an Insurrection which was to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
at <hi>Wapping,</hi> after the King had
been murder'd at the <hi>Rye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42159:437"/>
And now it will be but Justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude, to say a word or two
of my Author. He was formerly a
Jesuit: He has amongst others of his
works, written the History of <hi>Arian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi>
of <hi>Lutheranism,</hi> of <hi>Calvinism,</hi>
the <hi>Holy War,</hi> and the <hi>Fall of the
Western Empire.</hi> In all his Writings,
he has supported the Temporal Power
of Soveraigns, and especially of his
Master the <hi>French</hi> King, against the
usurpations and incroachments of the
Papacy: For which reason being in
disgrace at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was in a manner
forc'd to quit his Order, and from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Maimbourg,</hi> is now become Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Maimbourg:</hi> The Great King his
Patron, has provided plentifully for
him by a large Salary, and indeed he
has deserv'd it from him. As for his
style, 'tis rather <hi>Ciceronian,</hi> copious,
florid, and figurative; than succinct:
He is esteemed in the <hi>French Court</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to their best Writers, which has
procur'd him the Envy of some who
set up for Criticks. Being a profess'd
Enemy of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> he is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
hated by them; so that their
testimonies against him stand suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42159:437"/>
of prejudice. This History of the
<hi>League</hi> is generally allow'd to be one
of his best pieces: He has quoted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where his Authors in the Margin
to show his Impartiality; in which,
if I have not follow'd him, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the chiefest of them are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us, as not being hitherto
translated into <hi>English.</hi> His particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Commendations of Men and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
is all which I think superfluous in
his Book; but that too is pardonable
in a man, who having created him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
many Enemies, has need of the
support of Friends. This particular
work was written by express order of
the <hi>French</hi> King, and is now transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Kings Command: I hope
the effect of it in this Nation will be,
to make the well-meaning men of the
other Party sensible of their past er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
the worst of them asham'd, and
prevent Posterity from the like unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and impious designs.</p>
