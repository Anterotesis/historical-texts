            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Did from Alnwick write to Sir <hi>William Armyn</hi> an account of our Condition, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſiderations about your Affairs here in the North, with deſire of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things to be done by your Lordſhips appointment, in order to the carrying on of your Affairs. I ſend you here incloſed a copy of the Summons that was ſent to Barwick when I was come as far Alnwick; as alſo of a Letter written to the Committee of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I mean thoſe who we did preſume were convened as Eſtates, &amp; were the men that managed the buſineſs of the War: But there being (as I here ſince) none ſuch, the Earl of <hi>Roxbrough</hi> and ſome others having deſerted, ſo that they are not able to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113791:3"/>
make a Committee, I believe the ſaid Letter is ſuppreſſed and retained in the hands of Colonel <hi>Bright</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Rowe,</hi> for whom we obtained a ſafe Convoy to go to the Eſtates of that Kingdom with our ſaid Letter; the Governor of Barwicks Anſwer to our Summons leading us thereunto: By advantage whereof, we did inſtruct them to give all aſſurance to the Marquis of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi> and the honeſt Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> (who we heard were gathered together in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Body about Edenburgh, to make oppoſition to the Earl of <hi>Lanerick, Monro,</hi> and their Armies) of our good affection to them; wherewith they went the Sixteenth of this Moneth.</p>
            <p>Upon the Seventeenth of this Moneth Sir <hi>Andrew Car</hi> and Major <hi>Straughan,</hi> with divers other Scotiſh Gentlemen, brought me this encloſed Letter, Signed by the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as your Lordſhips will ſee: They likewiſe ſhewed me their Inſtructions, and a Paper containing the matter of their Treaty with <hi>Lanerick</hi> and <hi>Monro</hi>; as alſo an Expoſtulation upon <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericks</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113791:3"/>
breach with them, in falling upon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> and his men contrary to Agreement, wherein the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they having hold of him, but Seven hundred of his men were killed and taken: Theſe Papers alſo I ſend here encloſed to your Lordſhips. So ſoon as theſe Gentlemen came to me, I called a Councel of War, the Reſult whereof was, the Letter directed to the Lord Chancellor, a Copy whereof your Lordſhips have alſo here encloſed, which I delivered to Sir <hi>Andrew Car</hi> and Major <hi>Straughan,</hi> with which they returned upon the Eighteenth, being the next day. Upon private diſcourſe with the Gentlemen, I do finde the condition of their Affairs and their Army to be thus; The Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Crawford-Lindſey, Monro,</hi> and their Army hearing of our advance, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the condition and endeavors of their Adverſaries, marched with all ſpeed to get the poſſeſsion of Sterling-Bridge, that ſo they might have three parts of four of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at their backs to raiſe men, and to enable themſelves to carry on their Deſign, and are

above Five thouſand Foot, and Five and twenty hundred Horſe, or Three thouſand, The Earl of <hi>Leven,</hi> who is choſen General, the Marquis of <hi>Argyle,</hi> with the honeſt Lords and Gentlemen, <hi>David Leſley</hi> being the Lieut: General, having about Seven thouſand Foot, but very weak in Horſe, lye about ſix miles on this ſide the Enemy; I do hear that their Infantry conſiſts of men who come to them out of Conſcience, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are of the godly People of that Nation, which they expreſs by their Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in their Quarters, and indeed I hear they are a very godly and honeſt Body of men.</p>
            <p>I think it is not unknown to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips what Directions I have received from you for the proſecution of our late Victory; whereof I ſhall be bold to remember a Clauſe of your Letter, which was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I ſhould proſecute the remaining party in the North, and not leave any of them (where-ever they ſhall go) to be a beginning of a new Army, nor ceaſe to purſue the Victory, till I finiſh and fully compleat it, with their Rendition of thoſe Towns of</hi> Barwick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113791:4"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Carliſle, <hi>which moſt unjuſtly, and againſt all Obligations and the Treaties (then) in force, they ſurprized and Gariſoned against us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order whereunto, I marched to the Borders of Scotland, where I found the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſo exceedingly harraſed and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by <hi>Monro</hi> and the Forces with him, that the countrey was in no ſort able to bear us on the Engliſh ſide, but we muſt have neceſſarily ruined both your Army, and the Subjects of this Kingdom, who have not bread for a day, if we had continued amongſt them. In proſecution of your Orders, and in anſwer to the neceſsity of your Friends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their deſires, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſsity of marching into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to prevent the Governor of Barwick from putting Proviſions into his Gariſon on <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſide (whereof he is for the preſent in ſome want, as we are informed) I marched a good part of the Army over Tweed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day about Noon, the reſidue being to come after as conveniently as we may. Thus have I given to your Lordſhips an Account of our preſent condition and Engagement; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113791:5"/>
having done ſo, I muſt diſcharge my duty in remembring to your Lordſhips the Deſires formerly expreſſed in my Letters to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Armyn</hi> and Sir <hi>John Evelyn</hi> for Supplies; and in particular, for that of Shipping to lye upon theſe Coaſts, who may furniſh us with Ammunition or other Neceſſaries whereſoever God ſhall lead us, there being extreme difficulty to ſupply us by land, without great and ſtrong Convoys, which will weary out and deſtroy our Horſe, and cannot well come to us if the Tweed be up, without going very far about.

            <p>VPon Tueſday morning about five of the clock, the Lord <hi>Humby</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lee</hi> your Commiſſioners, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Letter Subſcribed by the Earl of <hi>Crawford-Lindſey,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> and Col: <hi>Geo: Monro</hi>; wherein they did agree, That a Treaty ſhould begin at eight of the clock in the morning at Wenchborow; with this limitation, That the Treaty ſhould onely continue till twelve at noon, promiſing that the Army under your Command ſhould march no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they were at preſent, our Army doing the like; And that during the Treaty, there ſhould be a Ceſſation from all acts of Hoſtility. Though this Letter came late to our hands, about three hours after the time appointed, and ſo it was in our choyce to have marched preſently, or to have embraced a Treaty; yet we reſolved to ſtay, and were content to ſend ſome of our number to Treat at Wenchborow with the like number from you; provided, That the Treaty might endure until Wedneſday at four of the clock in the morning, and all marching of Forces, and acts of Hoſtility on either ſide ſhould ceaſe during that time: Whereupon your Commiſſioners the Lord <hi>Humby</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lee</hi> did undertake, That either your Lordſhips ſhould agree to prorogate the time of the Treaty until Wedneſday four of the clock in the morning, the Forces of both ſides not marching further then they were at preſent, and the Marquis of <hi>Argyle</hi> not coming with his Forces to St. Nynyans Kirk, about a mile on this ſide of Sterling: Or otherwiſe if you did not agree to this, that then none of your Forces ſhould march before eleven of the clock at the ſooneſt. Two from us were ſent along with your Commiſſioners to receive your Anſwer, which was delivered by the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Glencarn,</hi> at the Town end of <hi>Lithgow,</hi> in theſe words:</p>

            <p>The Command we received upon the defeat of Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> was, <hi>To proſecute the Buſineſs until the Enemy might be put out of a condition or hope of growing into a new Army, and the Gariſons of</hi> Berwick <hi>and</hi> Carliſle <hi>were reduced</hi>: Four Regiments of our Horſe, and ſome Dragoons, having follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Enemy into the South parts being now come up, and this countrey not being able to bear us, the Cattel and old Corn thereof having been waſted by <hi>Monro</hi> and the Forces with him, the Governor of Berwick alſo daily victualling his Gariſon from <hi>Scotland</hi> ſide, and the Enemy yet in ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a poſture, as by theſe Gentlemen and your Papers we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſtill proſecuting their former Deſign, having gotten the advantage of Sterling-Bridge, and ſo much of <hi>Scotland</hi> at their backs to enable them thereunto; and your Lordſhips condition at preſent not being ſuch as may compel them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the honeſt and neceſſary things you have propoſed to them for the good of both the Kingdoms; We have thought fit out of the ſence of our Duties to the Commands laid upon us by thoſe who have ſent us, and to the end we might be in a poſture more ready to give you an aſſiſtance, and not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what we have made ſo large Profeſſions of, to advance into <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Army; And we truſt by the bleſſing of God, the Common Enemy will thereby the ſooner be brought to a ſubmiſſion to you, and we thereby ſhall do what becometh us in order to the obtaining our Gariſons; engaging our ſelves, That ſo ſoon as we ſhall know from you the Enemy ſhall yield to the things you have propoſed to them, and we have our Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons delivered to us, we ſhall forthwith depart out of your Kingdom, and in the mean time be more tender towards the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the point of Charge, then if we were in our own Native Kingdom.
