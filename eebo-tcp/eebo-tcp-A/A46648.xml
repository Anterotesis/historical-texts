            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER to a Friend, Containing some QUAERIES
about the New Commission for making Alterations in
the Liturgy, Canons, &amp;c. of the Church of England.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Your last you seem much concerned about the New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and desire my Opinion of it: I am very unfit to
resolve your Doubts in this matter, having many of my
own; which I shall reduce into some Quaeries, hoping that you
may have opportunity of consulting with some of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
who may be able to give you a more satisfactory Answer
than I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Concerning the Nature of these intended Alterations.</p>
            <p>Q. I. Whether there be any <hi>Necessity</hi> of such Alterations <hi>in
the Liturgy,</hi> or as some say <hi>of it;</hi> (Whatever may be pretended as
to Canons and Ecclesiastical Courts:) if there be any, for the
Satisfaction of the Members of our Church, who generally believe
there is none, why is not this Necessity made appear, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the contrary confuted? If there be none, enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be for the Reputation and Establishment of the Church,
or for the encrease of Reverence and Devotion in the People to
be so frequently meditating unnecessary Alterations.</p>
            <p>Q. II. If these Alterations be not pretended to be necessary,
enquire what the fitness and expediency of them is? Whether they
are intended for the sake of the Church, or, for the satisfaction
of Dissenters, or to serve both these ends together?</p>
            <p>1. If for the sake of the Church, should it not be first enquired
whether the Church desire it, and what Alterations she desires?
Ought she not to be consulted in such matters as are intended
for her advantage? Should not the Convocation then have first
met and considered, whether any Alterations at this time were
expedient, before the Commissioners had troubled themselves to
make such Alterations, and become bound in honour to defend
them? Or is it for the Peace and Unity and Edification of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95121:2"/>
Church, for some few assuming men to alter the Established
Worship, to make it comply with their own private conceits, or
to serve their own private ends?</p>
            <p>2. If for the sake of the Church, why should any thing be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
which hath the general Approbation of the true Members
of the Church? Why should such Ceremonies be taken away, or
which is much worse, left indifferent, which they approved as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the external Decency and solemnity of Worship? Why
should such Prayers and forms of Worship be altered, which they
find such great helps to Devotion, that they desire no material
change, and believe they cannot be altered for the better by any
meer humane Compositions.</p>
            <p>3. If it be for the sake of the Church, will our Commissioners
keep their eye upon the Primitive pattern which was the original
Rule of our Reformation? If they can alter our Worship and
Discipline into a nearer and more exact Conformity to the ancient
Primitive and Apostolick Churches; this I grant would be for the
advantage of the Church; but ask them, whether it will be for
the advantage of the Church to change the ancient Rules and Forms
of Worship for some new Modern Inventions? How shall we
justifie our selves against the charge of Novelty and Innovation, if
we reform away all the remains and characters of a Primitive and
Apostolick Church.</p>
            <p>2. If these Alterations be intended for the satisfaction of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and to Unite them in the Communion of our Church.</p>
            <p>Q. I. Do they know what will satisfie Dissenters? Whether
they find any greater inclinations in them now to return to our
Communion, then they have formerly had? or whether after the
fruitless tryals by the Commissioners at the <hi>Savoy</hi> in 61. and at the
L. K. <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s, where some of these Gentlemen were concerned,
it be expedient to make a new and more dangerous experiment.</p>
            <p>2. Whether it be possible in the nature of the thing, to give such
satisfaction to Dissenters as shall restore them to the Communion of
the Church without destroying the fundamental Constitution of
the Church of <hi>England?</hi> As for instance,</p>
            <p>Can any alterations in our Collects and Prayers (while we retain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95121:2"/>
a Form) satisfie those who declare against all forms of Prayer as
a quenching of the Spirit? and then it is not altering the Liturgy,
but taking it away, that must satisfie Dissenters.</p>
            <p>And not to multiply Quaeries, will the dissenting Preachers, who
have been Ordained by Schismatical Presbyters, submit to Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Ordinations? or if they will not, will the People come into the
Church without their Preachers? or if the Commissioners should
think fit to admit them as Presbyters of the Church without a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Ordination, is it not a subversion of the Constitution, not only
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but of the Catholick Church? and are
they sure that the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will own such
Presbyters?</p>
            <p>3. Inquire you whether it be reasonable at this time to make such
alterations in our Worship in favour of Dissenters, without reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
assurance of gaining them to our Communion? and whether
the temper and practises of our Dissenters at this time give any such
assurance? especially if the story of <hi>Northampton</hi> be true, that like
<hi>Novatianus</hi> of old, they oblige their Communicants to vow or swear
upon the Sacrament that they will never return to the Communion
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is said also to be a general practice.</p>
            <p>After this I suppose it will be needless to say, that these alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
can be intended both for the advantage of the Church and
satisfaction of Dissenters, since from what has been said it seems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
to make such Alterations as shall satisfie Dissenters, and
not give just scandal to the Members of our Church, and therefore
here you are to inquire,</p>
            <p>I. Whether they ought not to have as tender a regard to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our own Church, as to Dissenters? As for instance: if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Communion will be offended to see others receive the
Lord's Supper sitting, and it may be through the weakness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature may Forsake our Communion for it, whether it be
reasonable to drive these Men from our Communion out of meer
hope to gain worse men in the room of them?</p>
            <p>II. Ask if such alterations should make a Schism in the Church,
would it not prove of more fatal consequence than this Present
Schism?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95121:3"/>
               <hi>Second,</hi> Some Queries concerning the Commission and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</p>
            <p>Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I. Whether since the K. himself, besides his Solemn Oath at
his Coronation, has so often declared his resolution to maintain the
Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law established, it be not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
some of these Commissioners have procured this Commission
from the K. to make such alterations, then that it proceeded from
the K.'s own inclination?</p>
            <p>II. Whether the known Character of some of the Leading men
in this Commission be not reason enough to suspect the event?
Whether men who conformed with difficulty themselves, or upon
Principles which Wise men fore-saw would destroy the Church
in time, who have a Latitude to conform to a Church <hi>de facto,</hi>
which has power on its side, and to conceal their own inclinations
till it is time to show them, are not likely to do the Church of
<hi>England</hi> a good turn when opportunity serves, and which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they imagine now they have?</p>
            <p>III. Whether when the House of Commons addressed to the
King for a Convocation, it was not to prevent such a Commission
as this? which was then moved in the House of Lords by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Person in this Commission, and a zealous promoter of it.</p>
            <p>IV. Whether there was any such hast of altering the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Church in the World (which honourable title some of these
Commissioners in a good mood have in their Writings bestowed
upon the Church of <hi>England</hi>) that they could not expect the
calling of a Convocation, but must have these alterations ready
prepared for them by Commissioners?</p>
            <p>V. Whether the effect of this will not be to check all freedom
of debate in the Convocation, when these alterations shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to them as the judgment of the Commissioners, who will
themselves be Men of the greatest Authority in the Convocation?
and who will be so hardy as to oppose what the Commissioners
have done? and thus (as it may prove) our Church may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and altered and transformed by Nine men, who may have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and moderation enough to part with any thing but their
Church-preferments: And what an imposition would this be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95121:3"/>
thought on the Two Houses of Parliament, were as many Persons
of as great Authority and Interest, and who had the disposal of
State preferments in their hands, commissionated to prepare all Bills
for their approbation?</p>
            <p>VI. It should be Inquired whether the Convocation, when it
meets, will have Authority to offer any new alterations, or to do
any thing but approve what is so offered? For the Convocation can
go no farther than the King gives them authority, and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Commission only to <hi>approve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. If the Convocation have any authority, it should be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of what dangerous consequence it may be, should the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
dissent from the Commissioners? And whether to prevent this,
it may not occasion as much closeting for the choice of Convocation
men, as was lately practiced to pack a House of Commons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third,</hi> Some Queries concerning the fitness of the time for such
alterations.</p>
            <p>Q I. Can it be thought a convenient time for such alterations
as these, when the A. B. the Metropolitan of all <hi>England,</hi> and the
head of the Convocation, and several other Bishops (not to mention
those of the inferiour Clergy) who are as eminent for a prudent and
well tempered zeal for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as for their constant
loyalty, are now under suspension? Will not some be apt to question
the Ecclesiastical Authority of such proceedings, when the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is without its proper head, and deprived of the advice and
counsel of so many principal members of it? Will not others be apt
to suspect, that this time is chose on purpose, because the A. B. and
those other Bishops are now suspended, whose presence and authority
in the Convocation they were afraid of, as sure and fast friends to
the Church? And if they are afraid of those reverend Persons who
had before declared their readiness (in their Address to K. <hi>I.</hi> against
their publishing his Declaration for Liberty of Conscience) to come
to such a temper with reference to Dissenters, as shall be thought fit
by a Parliament and Convocation, it is very suspicious that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
something very unreasonable, which they feared would not pass
a free Convocation, when those reverend and judicious Prelates
were present.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95121:4"/>
Q. II. Can it be thought a proper season to make any alterations
in a well constituted and established Church, when the passions of
men are in such a vehement fermentation? when there are such
struglings between the different parties in religion, and such different
interests of State to serve by them? Can we expect such fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
such sedate and unbiassed councels, as (if ever) are necessary to
alter or new-lay the foundations of a Church? The reigns of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi>
and <hi>Valens</hi> will satisfie any man what may be expected from
Councels and Convocations, when reasons of State must govern,
and the late example of <hi>Scotland</hi> gives us no great reason to expect
much better.</p>
            <p>Q. III. Is it a proper time to make alterations, and unsettle the
foundations of the Church, when there are so many powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who watch an opportunity to pull it down? I think it is not
prudent, when a City is besieged to make a breach in the Walls, tho'
it be to mend them: The Church of <hi>England</hi> will stand firm if we
let it alone, but under a pretence of mending it, it will be an easie
matter, when its strength and interest is divided, to raze its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>For a Conclusion, Sir, what the Parliament will think of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
I will not pretend to guess, but I shall only add, that upon the
whole matter there seems to be great reason to have a jealous eye
upon this Commission, and I hope the friends of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> in both Houses of Parliament, will be upon their guard;
especially it behoves the Clergy to be very careful what Members
they choose for the Convocation, which is not now as formerly
a matter of meer Ceremony and Form, since the present and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Safety of the Church depends on it, and it is seldom seen that
there are any considerable Innovations in the Church, but have a
proportionable influence on the State.</p>
            <closer>I am, <salute>Sir,</salute>
