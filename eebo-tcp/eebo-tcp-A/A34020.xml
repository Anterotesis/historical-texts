            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> To the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>N. England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT can incur no juſt Cenſure that we addreſs our ſelves to the Churches of Chriſt here in the following Sheets, inaſmuch as they are but a Reply to a Book lately dedicated unto them. Nor does our zeal, (we hope) for Truth, the Honour of God, &amp; the Safety, Peace &amp; Flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing of theſe Churches come ſhort of what our Reverend Author may be inſpired with in his performance We make the ſame glorious Pretence with him to maintain &amp; defend the Order of the Goſpel, altho' we cannot allow what is ſuggeſted in the Title page, That every Principle ſo ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contended for in that Treatiſe, is either profeſſed or practiſed by the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>New-England.</hi> One part, at leaſt, therefore of his Book the Reverend Author ought to have publiſhed in his own Name, and not have obtruded it on the Churches here, whoſe Practiſe never gave grounds to ſuſpect them leavened with ſo groſs thoughts, as particularly his Doctrine of the Ordination of Miniſters is.</p>
            <p>We will not gueſs at the Authors ſecret aim, or whom in particular he raiſes his Batteries againſt We'd cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably hope he has no private Intereſt to bribe him in this Affair; and we hope for a like favourable and candid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this Reply. Indeed the Name prefix't to that faulty Treatiſe, may be preſumed, with a multitude of prejudiced People, to weigh down all the Reaſons and</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66190:3"/>Arguments which can poſſibly be brought for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. And we have no ſuch advantage to boaſt of; yet are happy in this, that we are not over-awed by any Name, and the Truth we know is greater, and more venerable than all things.</p>
            <p>Its well known how liberal ſome men are of the odious brand of <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> for every one who cannot digeſt the late publiſhed Orders: but, without arrogance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ſume, as more due, the Title of <hi>Proficients,</hi> and doubt not to make it out, that our diſſent from many of them is ſo far from a going back from any Goſpel Truth or Order, that it is rather a making progreſs, and advancing in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>It is a groundleſs Calumny which is ſuggeſted, <hi>That a latitude beyond what our Author contends for, is but a betraying the liberties and priviledges which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has given to his Church, or the Brethren of the Church.</hi> Theſe we profeſs to prize and ſtand for, and would by no means loſe. But wherein do they conſiſt? not in the Brethrens challenging any part of the Miniſterial Work! Not in impoſing upon others any thing which Chriſt has not impoſed! which is but a debarring Chriſtians of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges they have a right to. But they conſiſt (as we conceive) in ſuch things as theſe, That our Conſciences be not impoſed on by Men or their Traditions, Chriſt being the alone Lord of the Conſcience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. That Believers are through Chriſt, freed from the guilt and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin, from the curſe of the Law, and from the ſting and terror of Death. That we have the liberties of Gods Houſe and Ordinances, &amp; therein communion with God. That we may have the benefit of the gifts of his Miniſters for edification, and ſuch like, according to the Apoſtles Doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66190:3"/>Nor is that Objection leſs frivolous, when if we appear leſs Rigid than others of the Reverend Authors ſeverity, we are reflected on as caſting diſhonour on our Parents, &amp; their pious deſign in the firſt ſettlement of this Land No, we reverence our Anceſtors, and the Memory of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Zeal and Conſtancy, and would derive it as a Truth ſacred to our Poſterity, that it was a religious Intereſt which carried them through all the amazing Difficulties &amp; Diſcouragements in that Undertaking. But yet, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſign or end has been ſome-what differently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto us.</p>
            <p>Some have carried it as if the great end were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the <hi>Heathen;</hi> and there have been great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints by ſome of late, how this has been neglected and contradicted, and another courſe taken up, whereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing the <hi>Heathen</hi> into the Church of God, many whoſe Fathers and themſelves were once of the viſible Church, are now ſtrangely left out, ſcarce any face of Religion remaining among them.</p>
            <p>As for this, we bewail it, and look upon it as a Reproach to the Land, and would therefore countenance no ſuch Principles or Practices as have any tendency to ſuch Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>Again, ſome have made this the great Deſign, to be freed from the Impoſitions of Men in the Worſhip of God, wherewith they were ſometimes burthened; and as they ſought freedom for themſelves, we cannot ſuppoſe they deſign'd to impoſe upon others In this we are riſen up to make good their grounds.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> in his Sermon of the <hi>ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Worſhipping God with Mens Inſtitutions,</hi> p. 27. gives this as the errand of our fore-Fathers into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:66190:4"/>
namely, to ſequeſter themſelves into a quiet corner of the World, where they might enjoy Chriſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt Inſtitutions, and leave them uncorrupted to Poſterity; and the gain-ſaying or counter working this, is, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, to caſt diſhonour upon them, or call them fools.</p>
            <p>This Charge falls heavy on thoſe who are for impoſing their will on others. We crave no more but to enjoy the Inſtitutions of Chriſt unmix't. And it appears very ſtrange that thoſe who fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d from an Act of Uniformity, ſhould preſently impoſe on themſelves, on their Neighbours, and entail the Miſchief on their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Some indeed would make the deſign of our firſt Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to conſiſt in ſome little Rites, Modes or Circumſtances of Church Diſcipline, and thoſe ſuch as the Word of God no where requires Theſe are the men who diſhonour their Country, and their Fathers Memory, by making their great deſign to lie in ſo ſmall matters. And it is notorious there has been no agreement in theſe points from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Its known there was <hi>Anti-Synodatia</hi> printed, and who had a hand in it, <hi>and how modeſt his Diſſent was,</hi> and in what terms they contradicted what the Synod had eſtabliſhed, tho' the like is criminal and inſufferable in any other.</p>
            <p>Theſe Principles in Church Diſcipline are alſo wrote againſt in Engliſh by the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> by Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It is obſervable, that the Reverend Author in the Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the following Queſtions, makes uſe of abundance of Quotations from ſeveral famous Perſons in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; but in ſome the ſence is perverted to a wrong end, beſide the obvious intention of the Writers; in ſome he brings them in contradicting at one time what they ſaid at another, and ſets ſome in oppoſition to others. And where he endeavours to confirm his Tenets by the Teſtimony of ſome he might, if he had pleaſed, have brought many others to contradict the ſame thing.

               <p>There is another Text alſo produced to prove the power of the Brethren, <hi>ſcil. Mat.</hi> 18. 17. and if he ſhall neglect to hear them, <hi>tell it to the Church.</hi> This Text has been often brought on this account, and ſometimes on other accounts and as often anſwered, yet here brought again, but it will not anſwer the end.</p>
               <p>The Context ſuppoſes an Offender, and the wronged party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt him; and here are three ſteps the diſſatisfied Perſon is directed to take, in order to heal the wound given, 1.) To tell the Offender his fault in private. 2) To tell him before 2 or 3 wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and if the end be not obtained; 3.) To tell it to the Church. Suppoſe now a Perſon acting according to this Rule (as we could give inſtances if need were) when the firſt ſtep did not gain his Brother, nor the ſecond anſwer the end, at laſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied Perſon carried the caſe to the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and now he reckened he had told it to the Church. The Paſtor ſending ſo the Offendor preſently convinced him, brought him to Repentance, and to give ſatisfaction, and the thing was iſſued. Here the Rule was attended, the Church told, the offendor healed, the wronged Perſon ſatisfied, and the matter iſſued, when the Brotherhood all this while knew nothing of it. It is evident from the next verſe, that by the Church muſt be meant thoſe who had Power to bind and looſe, which Power Chriſt had given to the Apoſtles. Moreover let the ſenſe be that the Offence is to be told to the Rulers firſt, and then by then to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66190:8"/>
multitude; not for the multitude <hi>to judge of it,</hi> but for their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and example, for their prayers for the offendor, and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probacion of the Elders Cenſure, and that they might take care to avoid the familiarity of ſuch an inſectious ſinner, <hi>vid.

               <p>But if Scripture will not prove the Power of the Brethren, poſſibly ſome venerable Maxim may do the feat. <hi>Quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If it be objected, that even in all theſe caſes if there be any ſufficient reaſons preſented by thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, a prudent Ruler will yield to it; we eaſily grant it, and therefore its not unfit that men be propoſed to the Congregation, if there be any thing to object againſt their lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another argument for the Brethrens Power in admiſſion, is, leſt the whole Power ſhould ſometimes reſide in the hands of a ſingle Miniſter, and that this is unreaſonable we have a Speech quoted from the <hi>Preſbiterian Miniſters</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> But it is ſtrangely perverted from their true meanning, as appears not only from the whole ſeries and ſcope of the Book, but alſo from what is expreſſed in the page quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (p. 71.) where they ſay, <q>That the Power cannot be placed in the whole Church collectively taken.</q> The Scripture makes an exact diſtinction between Rulers and ruled. They only plead that there ſhould be more Rulers in a Church then one; or that, when there are more, then the Power belongs to the whole meaning, the ruling Elders as well as the Teaching. And what is that to the Power of the Brethren? One officer has Power in plain caſes to act in the Kings name.</p>
               <p>Indeed our Saviour did frequently ſend forth his Diſciples two and two But yet <hi>Phillip</hi> was ſent alone to baptize the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Eunuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>,</hi> of one who through importunity was brought to make a relation, and made the Congregation weep, when he did it; but whether for joy or grief, we are left in the dark.</p>
               <p>The Author gives us his arguments, but they do not reach his end. He pleads for them in that they are edifying; but we have known ſome that have been no ways ſo; or granting they were always ſo, can that juſtifie the inſtituting and impoſing them? would it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot be

edifying if every Sabbath day evening, ſome well diſpoſed (talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative) Brethren ſhould ſtand up and relate the experiences of the week paſt? yet ſhall we make it a law or cuſtom? will not ſome people aſſure you, they have been wonderfully edified by a womans preaching in Publick? and yet will our Reverend Author be induced to proſtitute his Pulpit to them, or part with a Sallary to cheriſh their zeal.</p>
               <p>Again, the Relation of Experiences is pleaded for, in that God may be Honoured by them. But we have known ſome to Gods diſhonour, being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pid, ſenſleſs things, to uſe our Authors own words, meer formalities, too ſcandalous and ſuperſtitious. He ſaith, they are a means to gain love with the Children of God. But we have known ſome that have loſt love and credit by them.</p>
               <p>But the Queſtion is, Whether they are an inſtituted means for any of theſe ends? Whether appointed by God, to promote his glory, ediſie the Congregation, or gain love? If not, they are but the Inſtitutions of men, and therefore to be rejected, as the before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> inſtructs us.</p>
               <p>God has appointed the preaching the Goſpel, the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for edification, and the promoting Chriſtian love among his people; but we read nothing of theſe impoſed relations, neither when Chriſt himſelf, nor when his Apoſtles after him, adminiſtred this holy Sacrament. Nor is there any appearance of ſuch a Cuſtom in the primitive Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed, there are ſome occaſions, as our Author obſerves, on which a Perſon who has had a remarkable Converſion, may declare it: but there's neither precept nor rule in the Word of God, that it ſhould be done at this ſet time, and in publick. And with what ſace can we impoſe it, when our Fathers fled from the impoſitions of men? whether arbitrary Impoſitions are inſufferable in themſelves, or not; yet certainly they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But it would make a man ſmile, were he never ſo ſerious or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, to read the Texts that are brought for this Cuſtom; as that <hi>Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 16. he ſays, <hi>Come and hear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he has done for my ſoul.</hi> We imagine the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author ſuppoſes the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> thus calling aloud in ſome vaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Concourſe, and that in order to his partaking of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> But ſhould we grant a ſuppoſal ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and extravagant, yet this makes nothing for impoſing Relations, for then it ſhould have been ſpoken and challenged by the People. Do you come, and ſtand forth, <hi>Sir,</hi> and tell us what God has done for your ſoul, and then we admit you to all the priviledges of the Temple. Another Text ſtrangely perverted to ſcare ſome good people is, that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 33. <hi>Whoſoever denyeth me before men, him will I alſo deny before my father which is in Heaven.</hi> As if there were no confeſſing Chriſt, without making formal ſpeeches in the Church.</p>
               <p>And as if a credible profeſſion of our faith in Chriſt, the taking his Name upon us in Baptiſm, and the renewal of our Baptiſmal Vow, and a devout attendance on the Ordinances of the Goſpel, were not the true confeſſion our Lord expects! Wo be to the world, if all were to be rated, denyers of Chriſt; who whether from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, modeſty or a juſt indignation, refuſe to make a quaint Speech in the Church. The laſt Scripture we ſhall name, which has been equally abuſed with the reſt is that in 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 15. That Chriſtians ſhould be ready to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them, to everyone that asketh it,</hi> to wit, in a proper place and time, for a fit end, and on ſufficient Reaſons, where there is Authority to command, or it is deſired with modeſty. The ſenſe indeed is, that we ſhould be ready to defend our Faith againſt the ſcoffs and cavils of Infidels and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors: and that it is a ſhame to Chriſtians not to be able to argue for their Religion, and confute gain-ſayers. So that if you would infer hence any publick Speech in the Church, it muſt be rather an <hi>Apology</hi> for the Chriſtian Religion, or a Sermon to prove its reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and evidence; but neither is it in the leaſt intimated that <hi>this</hi> ſhould be made a ſtated term of Communion; and we are ſure the Church has no more power to debar the reſuſer from any Chriſtian priviledge then to require Oaths, Subſcriptions, and Conformity to a Thouſand more Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66190:10"/>We have but one Remark more to make here, and that is, the Apoſtle requires this reaſon of our hope to be given with meekneſs &amp; fear. The true ſenſe whereof is, that which we are contending even with Infidels, yet we muſt not argue with an intemperate Paſſion or Zeal.

               <p>But we altogether deny a Church Covenant in the following ſenſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66190:12"/>
and ſay, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has no where appointed in his Word, that there ſhould be a Covenant ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Of ſuch a Church Covenant neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor Chriſt himſelf, the Prophets nor the Apoſties have ſpoke any thing.

               <p>But poſſibly this may be called a <hi>Miſrepreſentation.</hi> You will ſay, Who owns it, or will plead for it in this Dreſs? <hi>We Anſwer,</hi> by querying, Whether there be not ſeveral that own and plead for the things contained in it? We wiſh there were a leſs Number. But to evince it, let us take it into the ſeveral parts. Are there none that plead for a ſeperate Covenant, which ſome (and generally the leſſer part) muſt enter into? and if it be good, and for good ends, why muſt ſo many be excluded? If it be to reform Manners, if to maintain the Miniſtry and Worſhip of God, if to lay ſtricter Bonds of Duty, if to bring men more effectually to ſubmit to Diſcipline, why then are not the whole brought in? for the whole Congregation are oblig'd to theſe Duties, and why muſt the Covenant be ſeperate?</p>
               <p>Again, do not ſome plead, it is requiſit, in order to a Perſons par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Lords Supper? But did our Lord Jeſus Chriſt require any ſuch thing when he firſt inſtituted that holy Sacrament? Did the Apoſtles when they adminiſtred it? Was it the term of Communion in the primitive Church? or where i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

it? and why ſhould Gods holy Ordinances be annexed to Mens Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Again, do not ſome plead, that thoſe who thus covenant, have the Power to make and unmake Officers?

This the Reverend Author defends with all his Might, under the third Queſtion, tho', as we ſhowed, he could find no Proof.

We then declare our ſelves ſatisfied, and crave no more; for we do not conceive that any man can engage or undertake for the Education of a Child in the Chriſtian Religion, unleſs he has the Authority of a Parent devolved on him, for the government of the Child. Nor would any conſcientious Miniſter accept the engagement of one who has no power or ability to perform his Vows. So that this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neceſſarily implyes the care and authority of a Father, and conſequently there is an adoptive Right to Baptiſm.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We agree with the Reverend Author, that Baptiſm is a part of the publick Miniſtry, nor may it be adminiſtred by one who is not called to the publick Miniſtry; neither ſhould it uſually and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Yet, let the Congregation be never ſo great, if the Adminiſtrator be not a publick Miniſter, commiſſioned by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it may be called private Baptiſm, and altogether unallowable; and if the number of people be ſmall, and the place otherwiſe private, yet if the Adminiſtrator be a publick Officer and Miniſter of Chriſt, the Baptiſm may in a ſenſe be called Publick, and in ſome caſes (as that of dangerous ſickneſs) not only allowable but neceſſary, and a duty. When a Juſtice of the Peace acts in his Office, though but few are preſent, yet they are acts of publick Authority, as truly as thoſe done in higher Courts, and with greater ſolemnity. Altho among us, where Churches are orderly ſettled, there is little occaſion either for private preaching or Baptiſm, it being certain the more publick both are, the more God and his Ordinances are honoured, &amp; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But yet (as was hinted before) there are ſome caſes of neceſſity, wherein its ones duty to ſeek a more private Baptiſm; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God not permitting a more publick attendance, and no Miniſter ought to refuſe their deſire.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, in apparent danger of death, it would be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to deny ſuch a requeſt, if privacy be the only Objection. We need not ſuggeſt, that all what we call private Baptiſm there may be a competent number of people preſent; the neighbourhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called in, and notice given to ſome of the Brethren of the Church.

               <p>The Reverend Author alſo gives us another Maxim in pag. 87. with this Elogium, <hi>That it has its foundation in Nature and Reaſon,</hi> though we are ſure it makes ſtrongly againſt him here, namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſome places have no Communicants, and there all grant this Right and Priviledge belongs to the whole: if afterwards they come to have ſome Communicants, by what Rule or Reaſon do they take away that Priviledge which belonged to others before? In ſhort, let our Author find one Text that limits or confines it to the Communicants alone, and then deprive the Majority.</p>
               <p>But ſince Scripture fails him, he has another Refuge, <hi>viz.</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Synod, and the Law of the Land.

               <p>It is alſo hinted, <hi>That this may prove fatal to the Churches.</hi> But there is no danger, Truth does no harm; and we rather think it may be retorted on the Author and his Practice. There was lately a grievous Complaint made by a principal Man of <hi>Swanzy,</hi> before ſome Miniſters and others, That the Law which gives the Power to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants only to call a Miniſter, is like to ruin them and their Poſterity forever, by excluding them from an able and orthodox Miniſtry, and the Ordinances; for the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> taking advantage thereby, have ſet up a gifted Brother, and ſpoil the place of the publick Miniſtry.</p>

               <p>Indeed there may be a good uſe of Letters of Recommendation, and eſpecially among ſtrangers and where a Member removes from one Church to another, a mutual ſatisfaction may be laboured after.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66190:20"/>
But we cannot but think ſuch Letters frivilous, when in the ſame Town, and at two ſtreets diſtance, a Perſon known over all the Town for an exemplary Converſation, prefers anothers Miniſtry. Civility will conſtrain ſuch perſons to acquaint then Miniſters of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and the ſame Chriſtian Civility obliges ſuch a Miniſter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the other Paſtor (if need be) to whoſe Miniſtry they repair, that they have carried themſelves well in his Communion, and that he hopes they may prove bleſſings in all other.</p>
               <p>But as for the Brethren, We need not go to them, to make a ſecond Speech, now to ask leave to with-draw, and to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to every impertinent Talker who thinks the man Married to him, and that his bed is broke into, or that there's no juſt reaſon for a divorce.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſome people are forever diſſatisfied; neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of Habitation, liking the others Miniſtry, profiting under it, or diſlike of ſome Cuſtoms and Practices which he would willingly be rid of the light of, can ſatisfy. And what muſt the grieved perſon do further in this caſe? Why, truly he has done his duty, and may hear and communicate, where God and his own ſober Conſcience directs him. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ought any Miniſter of Chriſt, to reject his claim to the Lords Table with him.</p>
               <p>To ſay no more, our Reverend Author having in a former Treatiſe proved that perſons baptized are thereby ſubjects of Diſcipline, We think they all ought to be accountable to the Society where they are; there perſons being diſmiſſed by the Providence of God, whether they have letters of diſmiſſion or not. Elſe by their principles, an ordained Miniſter in <hi>London,</hi> formerly of Communion with a Church in <hi>Boſton,</hi> being called to Office in a particular Church, and having accepted the Paſtoral Care thereof, muſt firſt ſend over a Pacquet to <hi>New-England</hi> for a Letter of diſmiſſion.
