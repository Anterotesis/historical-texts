            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>THE Author of a late little Book, which bears the Title of <hi>[Seek and you shall find,]</hi> does, both in his own Name, and in the Name of many <hi>Sincere</hi> Persons, make open complaint of the <hi>Licentiousness of the Press.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">In the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, p. 9.</note> If he means by those Persons, such as are so <hi>Sincere</hi> in their Credulity, that they mixt not one grain of reasonable <hi>Inquiry</hi> with it, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint will give no pain to judicious People, unless it be by moving them to pity his Weakness. And a Man would imagine, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ort of <hi>Sincere</hi> People were so purely Credulous, seeing the Justice of the complaint is on the side of the <hi>Reformed.</hi> This lesser matter puts me in mind of a greater, yet of a like Nature, in the <hi>Circumcellions,</hi> one of those Branches into which the Faction, which sprang from <hi>Donatus,</hi> was divided. They went about doing injury to the Christians, from whom they had made a causeless Separation; and when their Incivilities were, by those whom they had provoked, turn'd upon them, they took the confidence to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Martyrs.</p>
            <p>But certainly, those, who are the illegal Aggres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, deserve the Blame. Those who send the Challenge are the <hi>Litentious,</hi> rather than the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63913:3"/>
modest Accepters. And, when <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi> are assaulted, such as Honour them and have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in them, ought to do some just thing in their necessary defence; and, if need be, draw their Pens in their Service. Provided that it be done (as, I think, by our Churchmen, it has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally done) in a way consistent with decency of Manners, and publick Peace.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, there appear amongst the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, <hi>Misrepresenters</hi> and crafty Softners and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourers of their own Doctrine; True and Faithful <hi>Representers</hi> are not unreasonably Officious, when they enter upon the Stage and take off the Disguise.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Artificial Expositions</hi> are imposed, and set to Sale in our own Language upon every Stall; it is very proper for such as are Friends to Sincerity, to take upon them the Office of <hi>True Expounders,</hi> and to convince the World, that such <hi>Sweetners</hi> of the Doctrines of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what those Doctrines are, but what, in their Opinion, they ought to be; or, by what turns of Wit, they may be fenced against the Arguments of <hi>Reformed Catholiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Man thinks fit not only to Preach, but to Publish in this Nation, a <hi>Sermon of St. Peter,</hi> and, in that Sermon, <q>to reproach all Churches <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Ser. on St. <hi>Pet.</hi> day, p. 39.</note> besides the Roman, as New Trimmed Vessels, Leaky at the Bottom, and unable to carry those, who Sail in them; to the Haven;</q> it cannot be a Crime to set forth a Discourse on the same Subject, (without any reflexion either on such a Person, or his Performance;) and to shew the true Sense of <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi> and the safety of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Soundness of our Bottom; whilst <hi>some</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63913:3"/>
are in a Vessel which has suffer'd so many Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Additions, that it cannot be call'd the same Ship it was, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> was in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> if such <hi>Guides in Controversy</hi> offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as lead Men out of the way, and turn them round in an endless Circle; the Direction of honest Guides is a debt which they owe to Truth and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>If Men in Books, in Pulpits, in Conversation, shall daily ask the question, Where is the Protestant's Judge? they ought to esteem it a Civility in others, when they give them a full Answer about a <hi>Iudge in Controversy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if Men of like Perswasion revile <hi>this Church</hi> as the Schismatical party of <hi>Donatus,</hi> it is out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and not want of ability, that Men do not give them an <hi>Irene</hi> for their <hi>Lucilla.</hi> In the mean time, they have a Substantial Answer, though not so sharp a Rebuke, as their bold uncharitableness justly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Last of all,</hi> If a <hi>Romanist</hi> accuseth the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as a Patroness of the Heresie of <hi>Socinus,</hi> though not with a direct and downright charge, yet from the consequence of her Methods; common Duty to so Good and Venerable a Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth her Sons to appear in her Vindication; and to shew that her <hi>Plea</hi> is very widely mistaken. If she pleads for <hi>Arians, Socinians,</hi> or any other Faction of Men, who have departed from the true Faith; she does it no otherwise than in the Words of her <hi>Litany.</hi> In that Pious <hi>Office,</hi> she <hi>beseecheth God to bring into the way of Truth all such as have erred and are deceived:</hi> And may God abundantly favour her Charitable Petition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63913:4"/>
By such Considerations as these, I have, at last, been moved to write an Answer to the Book which the Author is pleas'd to call <hi>The Protestants Plea for a Socinian,</hi> and to make that Answer publick. But I must acknowledge, that, upon other Accounts, the Diversion which this Answer has given me, has been very unwelcom: As unwelcom as the trouble was to those of old time, who, when they were employ'd in offering Sacrifice, were forc'd to turn aside, and drive away from the Altar the greedy Fowls, and the impertinent Flies.</p>
            <p>Now, in this <hi>Answer,</hi> I shall, for Order-sake, and that I may proceed distinctly, reduce what I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to say to certain Heads; and they are these three which follow.</p>

                  <p>Observations touching the Book itself, its Edition, Character and Design.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR <hi>the Book itself,</hi> it may be noted in the First place, That it is neither <hi>new,</hi> nor <hi>entire.</hi> It is the <hi>Fourth Discourse</hi> in the <hi>Second Edition</hi> of the <hi>Guide in Controversies,</hi> set out in the Year 1673. If this Tract was published be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, to me it was not; for then, and not before, it came to my knowledge. But this is not the thing which gives our Ecclesiasticks of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; for whether the Men of Controversie bring into the Field either their Old or their New Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of Arguments, this Apostolical Church is proof against them.</p>
               <p>The Book, of which this <hi>Plea</hi> is a part, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, by many of the same way, to be of very great Strength and Solidity: And when a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is moved concerning their Faith, they think it enough to say, <hi>The Guide is unanswered</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63913:5"/>
occasion, may take leave to say, The <hi>Book against the Popes Supremacy,</hi> written by the learned and humble Dr. <hi>Barrow, is unanswerable.</hi> And, after all this, the <hi>Guide</hi> is actually answered, though not in the Formality of <hi>Word for Word,</hi> in a great Volume of Refutation <note n="*" place="margin">See D. <hi>Still.</hi> sev. Discourses in Answer to the <hi>Guide in Contr.</hi> &amp;c. p. 326, 327, &amp;c.</note>. The Bottom on which all is built is shew'd to be false; and if a Workman discovers the unsoundness of the Foundation, he is not oblig'd to tell particularly how every single Brick is dawbed with untempered Mortar. The <hi>Guide</hi> is sufficiently answered, if it be prov'd, either that the first step he sets is false, or that he wants Eyes, or that he is, by prejudice, blinded. Some such thing seems to be, in some degree, in this <hi>Guide in Controversie;</hi> and I may set it down as my</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second Observation,</hi> That though there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Temper in <hi>this,</hi> and his other Writings, yet there is an obscureness in all of them; and he that is conversant in his Books, is as if he walk'd in a calm, but darkish Night.</p>
               <p>Part of this obscureness to the Unlearned riseth from <hi>Hard Words,</hi> which, though they seem not to be affected by the Author, are yet very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used by him.

               <p>Again, This Author brings, or rather forces in his <hi>Socinian,</hi> and makes him to speak to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> in these words: <note n="r" place="margin">Prot. Plea, p. 5.</note>—<q>I pray tell me, Whether do you certainly know the Sense of the Scriptures, for the Evidence of which <hi>you sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

from the Church before Luther,</hi> requiring Conformity to the contrary Doctrines as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her Communion? This is rather the Phrase of a Papist than a Socinian.</q> For, though <hi>Socinus</hi> believ'd his own Scheme to be new, and distinct from the whole Church, he did not believe that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> had made such a Separation. Neither would he have disputed with them about the Sense of the Scriptures, for the Evidence of which they separated (or rather were driven) from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for he did allow that those places were clear. Nor would he have given to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church the name of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> or scarce of a <hi>Church at all.</hi> He did not so much as allow it to be a <hi>true Church</hi> in the most favourable sense of the Protestants, who distinguish betwixt a true and a pure Church, and compare it to a Mass of Silver embased with Lead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> plac'd the Truth of the Church in the Truth of its Doctrine <note n="s" place="margin">Socin. de Ecclesiâ, Op. Vol. 1. p. 341, 342.</note>, from which Truth he held the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be extreamly departed. He affirm'd concerning the <hi>Notes</hi> or <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> That either they were false; or, if true, belong'd not to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And he made particular Instance in the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Holy.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd concerning <hi>Luther,</hi>

                  <q>That he drew Men off from false Worship and Idolatry, and brought them to that Knowledge of Divine Matters which was sufficient for the procuring of Eternal Life.</q> He added, <q>That God did afterwards, by <hi>Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> reform certain things of very great importance. He repeats it again, That, by the means of <hi>Luther,</hi> Men were enlightned in those things which were absolutely necessary to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63913:7"/>
Salvation. So that this Author does not exactly</q> personate a <hi>Socinian</hi> when he speaks thus in a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>'s Name; <q>Whether do you certainly know the Sense of the Scriptures for the Evidence of which you separated <hi>from the Church <hi>before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, A <hi>Socinian</hi> would not have spoken as this Author does in his Name, calling a heinous Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a <note n="u" place="margin">Prot. Plea, p. 43.</note> very <hi>great Mortal Sin.</hi> Nor would any accurate Speaker have us'd that improper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>(Secondly)</hi> for the <hi>Protestant</hi> in the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> he does here and there misrepresent his Sense, and speak, at the same time, as by him, and yet against him. For Example-sake; the <hi>Socinian</hi> having said out of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> That his Party had not forsaken the whole Church, seeing themselves were a part of it, (which, by the way, a <hi>Socinian</hi> would scarce have said, but rather have own'd his Church to have been a new one upon the whole Matter, and granted a kind of Universal Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note n="*" place="margin">Prot.

                  </note>) the Protestant is brought in as in a manner deriding this Argument in his own Person, or at least as contented with it as, by a <hi>Socinian,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd:—<q>So then it seems we need fear no Schism from the Church Catholick till a part can <note place="margin">Prot.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</q> a Protestant would have first told them, that there is just fear of a Schism in the Body of the Church Catholick, though not from it: And that they had made a Separation from the sound parts of it, though not from the whole; whilst the Protestants were both Members of the Universal Church, and in Communion with all particular Churches so far as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63913:7"/>
they are Christian. He would have added, That Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Words were proper in his own Case, but not in the Case of a <hi>Socinian</hi> Church, which is taken to be a Member in the Universal Church, but unsound and out of its place.</p>

               <p>The Title of this Book is Serviceable to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said design, by way of Insinuation.

I do not offer this discourse, as a proof of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for <hi>Socinianism</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet it is an Argument sufficient for the Silencing of those of that Communion, who charge it upon <hi>Ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for other Churches, that which is said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be a proof of the wonted Sincerity of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Maimbourg,</hi> who tells his Readers with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the Persons who, after the interval of nigh 900 Years, reviv'd Arianism, were all of them either <hi>Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Calvinists</hi> before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Disciples of <hi>Socinus</hi>

And Men, who consider the Nature of causes and effects, are inclined to believe that the way to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism</hi> has been much open'd and widen'd by the <hi>Popish Doctors</hi> who have so vehemently urg'd the <hi>Obscureness</hi> of the Scriptures in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and who, at this very time, furnish the <note place="margin">Dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a new Cath.

                  <hi>Hawkers</hi> with their little <hi>Dialogues,</hi> endeavouring to equal the new Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> with that of Three Persons in one incomprehensible Essence.

               <argument>
                  <p>Considerations touching the General Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the <hi>Protestants Plea</hi> for a <hi>Socinian;</hi> shewing the weakness of it, and that it is not of force enough to overthrow the <hi>Plea</hi> of the Reformed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LET that which hath been said, suffice for the <hi>Quality</hi> of this Writing, I will proceed to the <hi>General Argument of it,</hi> which may, in brief, be thus represented.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> agree in their <hi>Plea,</hi> they alledge Scripture, they measure Faith by it as by a compleat and clear Rule. They reject <hi>Councils,</hi> and the <hi>Major part of Church Authority,</hi> if they are not convinc'd that they are founded on the Scriptures, in finding out the sense of which both sides profess due <hi>Industry.</hi> Both parties excuse themselves, (whatsoever Doctrines they advance, whatsoever Wounds they open in the Church) as uninfected with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>si,</hi> and free from <hi>Schisan,</hi> till their private Spirit be satisfi'd, and, before the Tribunal they erect in their own Heads, they are self-accus'd and self-condemned.</p>
               <p>Therefore Protestants make Apology for <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and are neither able to confute them, upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63913:10"/>
these Principles and Methods; nor to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but are oblig'd to appeal to the <hi>Infallible Iudge,</hi> or the <hi>Major part</hi> of the <hi>Bench</hi> of <hi>Iudges</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> where all such Controversies may be effectually ended.</p>
               <p>The force of this specious Argument will be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as all such Arguments may easily be, whose force lays only in plausible appearance) by a few plain Considerations.</p>
               <p>First, the <hi>Socinians</hi> will not allow their <hi>Plea</hi> to be perfectly the same with that of the Protestants; especially those of the <hi>Established Church of England.</hi> The <hi>Socinian</hi> Author of the <hi>Brief Disquisition</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n a supposed difference; and he endeavours to shew that unless the <hi>Evangelical</hi> quitted their own way of <hi>Resolving Faith,</hi> and made use of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of <hi>Socinus,</hi> they could not Solidly and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently refute the Romanists, and particularly the Judgment of <hi>Valerianus Magnus,</hi> concerning the Protestant <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Believing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Both <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians plead Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> though their <hi>Plea</hi> is not manag'd exactly after our better manner. And when <hi>they</hi> plead <hi>Tradition,</hi> why is not theirs then as much the <hi>Popish Plea,</hi> as, when they plead <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is the Protestants? for neither do they plead <hi>that</hi> just as this Church does.</p>
               <p>Two Assertions may be here advanc'd.</p>
               <p>First, that the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> plead Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that some <hi>Papists</hi> have help'd the more Modern of them to Materials for the making of that <hi>Plea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> plead <hi>Tradition against</hi> the Divine Nature of Christ, as the Romanists
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63913:10"/>
plead Tradition for it. <hi>Artemon</hi> taught the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie of our Saviours being a meer Man. And we are assured by an unnamed <note n="a" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

they are unanswerable; yea, that common People are not capable of the Answers that Learned Men yield unto such obscure passages.

First <hi>Iust in Martyr,</hi> and then almost all the <hi>Fathers</hi> before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> whose Speeches, he says, touching this Point, <hi>Cum Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxa Fidei regulâ minimè consentiunt?</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I might add, That the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> between them in another matter of great importance, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Prescience of future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingents, give the <hi>Socinians</hi> the Premises, out of which their Conclusion doth unavoidably follow. For the <hi>Dominicans</hi> maintain on the one side, That God can foresee nothing but what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; The <hi>Iesuites</hi> on the other side, That he doth not decree all things; and from hence the <hi>Socinians</hi> conclude, (as it is obvious for them to do,) That he doth not foresee all things. <hi>Lastly,</hi> I might adjoyn this, That you agree with one consent, and settle for a Rule unquestionable, That no part of Religion can be repugnant to Reason, whereunto you in particular subscribe unawares in saying, <hi>From Truth no Man can by good Consequence infer Falshood;</hi> which is to say in effect, That Reason can never lead any Man to Errour: And after you have done so, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to all the World, (as you in this Pamphlet do very frequently,) That if Men follow their Reason and Discourse, they will (if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand themselves) be led to <hi>Socinianism.</hi> And thus you see with what probable Matter I might
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63913:14"/>
furnish out and justifie my Accusation, if I should charge you with leading Men to <hi>Socinianism.</hi> Yet I do not conceive that I have ground enough for this odious Imputation. And much less should you have charged Protestants with it, whom you confess to abhor and detest it; and who fight against it, not with the broken Reeds, and out of the Paper-Fortresses of an imaginary Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which were only to make sport for their Adversaries; but with the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Word of God;</hi> of which we may say most truly, what <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Abimeleck, Non est sicut iste,</hi> There is none comparable to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the Modern <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> do speak of Tradition, and not of Scripture only, yet our Plea and theirs is not perfectly the same. Touching the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> we have a greater Veneration for it than many of them; and for <hi>Tradition,</hi> though we make it not the very Rule of our Faith, nor place Infallibility in it; yet, in concurrence with Scripture, it weigheth not so much with them as with us.</p>
               <p>We have a greater Veneration for the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture itself, than the <hi>right Socinian:</hi> For such a one makes Reason the Rule of that Rule; and though he thinks a Doctrine is plain in Scripture, yet, if he believes it to be against <hi>his</hi> Reason, he assents not to it. Whereas a Man of this Church believes the Scriptures to be written by Inspiration from God: And, upon that account he assures himself that nothing contrary to true Reason can be contained in the Scriptures. Therefore when he finds any thing in Holy Writ which to him is incomprehensible, he does not say he believes it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63913:14"/>
though it be impossible and irrational; but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it to be rational though mysterious; and he suspects not Reason itself, but his own present Art of Reasoning whensoever it concludes against that which he reads, and reads without doubting of the sense of the words: And by Meditation he at last finds-his errour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Hist. Res. Polon. l. 1. c. 1 p. 7.</note> challenge to themselves <hi>Petrus Abailardus</hi> as one of their Predecessors: For this they cite St. <hi>Bernard;</hi> and they strengthen their challenge with the Testimony of <hi>Baronius,</hi> who says of <hi>Abai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardus,</hi> That he made Reason the Judge of Articles of Faith. It is true, a Protestant judges whether his Faith be rational, or whether it be founded on Divine Revelation; but he will not allow his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings to oppose any Principle in Holy Writ: For that were either to deny it to be of God, or, with blasphemous irreverence, to reproach the Almighty Wisdom with a Contradiction. Yet after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Socinians</hi> argue, though some of them use great caution, and few make open profession of it: Nay, they sometimes tell us, That the Scripture contains nothing contrary to manifest Reason <note n="x" place="margin">Slicht adv. Meisn. de SS. Trin. p. 67. Smalc. Cont. Frans. Disp. 4.</note>. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, by their manner of objecting against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the blessed Trinity, the Sagacious are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that they first think it to be against plain Reason, and then, rejecting it as an errour, they colour their Aversion with forced Interpretations of Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Ostorodius</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Ostor. c. 4. Instit.</note> hint to us at what end they begin. <q>If Reason (said he) shews ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly that a Trinity of Persons in God is false, how could it ever come into the Mind of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Man to think it to be true, and that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63913:15"/>
it can be proved by the Word of God? And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</q> They own, with us, from the Principles of Reason, that God is just and good; but then, with the <hi>Platonists,</hi> they measure Justice and Goodness by particular Notions, which are <hi>their Reasonings,</hi> but not the Reason of Mankind. And when any thing is said in the Scripture which is contrary to such measures, they are ready to depart from it. Upon this account it is, that many of them deny the Doctrine of the Eternal Torments of the finally Impenitent; not because it is not plain enough in Scripture, but because it seems contrary to their Notions of Justice, Goodness and Mercy; though to the true Notions of them it may be reconcil'd. Thus <hi>Ernestus Sonnerus</hi> lays it down <note n="z" place="margin">Ern. Sonn. Demonstr. Theol. &amp; Philos. p. 36.</note> as his Principle in the first place that the Eternal pains of the Wicked are contrary to Gods Justice; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepossessed with this prejudice, he can, thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, find nothing in the Scripture which may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule his Opinion.</p>
               <p>All this is not my private, and (as some <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> may call it) uncharitable conjecture; there is a Romanist <note n="a" place="margin">Disc. of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallib. in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. p. 200.</note> who has said the same thing, and in very plain terms. <q>The <hi>Socinian</hi> (saith he) judgeth the Bible to be the wisest and most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Book that ever was Written; such a one, as no other humane Writing can contest with it; yet not such a one as no slip nor errour may fall into it, even in matters of importance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Salvation: And therefore, that where reason is absolutely against it, he may leave it; though for Civility sake, he will rather choose to put a wrong Gloss upon it, than plainly refuse it.—It cannot be pretended that Scripture is <note place="margin">p. 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

his Rule: for, seeing <hi>he supposeth Scripture to be Fallible,</hi> and that, upon all occasions, he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth it by his discourse; it is not Scripture but his discourse, and his reasoning, that is his true and Supreme Rule.

               </p>
               <p>And as we have a greater Veneration for the Scriptures than most <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> so have we a truer regard to real <hi>Tradition,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> use, not so much as a witness of any great value, as a fit weapon for the encountring those who dispute out of Antiquity; to the end that they may overcome them with their own Arms. <hi>Socinus</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In fine,</hi> Though the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not make the <hi>Councils</hi> her Rule of Faith, or make her last Appeal to them; yet she believes that, in times of Controversie, when the Heads of Men are apt to be disturb'd even in Matters otherwise plain enough, by the Heats and Distempers of the Age they live in, they are of special use. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of them tends to the quelling of the Party: And then, when the Faction cools, it tends to the fixing and further strengthning of the weak and interrupted Faith of many. For, as in a Ballance one Scale may descend more or less below the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; so there may be Faith and Assent without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the weight of <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils;</hi> and yet (in unquiet Times especially and disputing Ages) such Testimonies may give some further strength to Minds made feeble either by publick Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the private Attacks of Crafty Seducers. Thus our Church gives to the <hi>Scripture</hi> the things that belong to the Scripture; and to <hi>Tradition</hi> the Dues of Tradition: And it gives more even to the former than generally <hi>Socinians</hi> do; and more also to the latter, though with just Caution and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. So that <hi>their Plea and ours</hi> is not, in a strict way of speaking, the very same. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we admit that the <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> is the same, for the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it; we cannot be truly said to plead for them, unless the general <hi>Plea</hi> be, with Truth and Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, as well as Boldness, applied to the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Cause. If two Men will plead the same thing with equal Assurance, but not with equal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63913:18"/>
Reason, in Truth and Merit 'tis not the same. If the Confidence of Men in pleading might weigh against the Right of others, they that were in the wrong would be in the right: For what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Reason of the Case, would be supply'd by Impudence. But is it said by any of the <hi>Robe,</hi> that when the Counsel on either side pleads <hi>Presidents,</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> or <hi>Equity,</hi> the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> pleads for the <hi>Defendent,</hi> and the <hi>Defendent</hi> for the <hi>Plaintiff?</hi> Both pretend to the same Rule, but he that is in the right measures his Case by it; the other would bend it towards his illegal Interests. One has a <hi>Plea,</hi> the other a <hi>Pretence.</hi> If a Socinian will plead Scripture, and plead it falsly, it is so far not <hi>ours,</hi> but <hi>his.</hi> If Confidence in pleading may either carry or ballance a Cause, then Pleas of <hi>Laws, Scriptures, Oral Tradition, Fathers, Councils,</hi> may be urged contrary ways, and each side be equally justifi'd: For all such Pleas have been made by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Parties. Mr. <hi>Lilburn</hi> pleaded Law as much as Judge <hi>Ienkins,</hi> though not as well. Some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters in the <hi>Queens</hi> time wrote down their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and gave their Book the Title of <hi>Sions Plea.</hi> It may be their Adversaries might call it the <hi>Plea of Babylon.</hi> Whether it was the one or the other, was to be tryed not by the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Plea,</hi> or the Persuasion of the Advocates, but by the Merit and Nature of the Cause itself. The Apostles pleaded before Magistrates of another Faith, that it was <hi>better to obey God than Man.</hi> All Parties who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from the Establish'd Religion, use the same Plea, and generally in the same Words. But does this make the Pleas equal! Must they not joyn Issue upon the Reason of the Case, and compare
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63913:18"/>
their Circumstances and those of the Apostles, and observe wherein they agree, and wherein they differ?</p>
               <p>If Men, who plead <hi>Scripture</hi> as their Rule of Faith, make Apologie, by so doing, for all others who pretend to the same Rule; then <hi>Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> themselves plead for <hi>Socinians:</hi> For (to give an example,) the General <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (and after it <hi>Evagrius)</hi> testifies <note n="u" place="margin">Evagr.

I conclude, then, that notwithstanding the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> do, both of them, plead Scripture as the rule of Faith; yet because <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> plead the rule rightly in the point of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Son of God, and the <hi>Socinians</hi> very falsly (even in the opinion of the <hi>Arians</hi> and Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists themselves) <note n="f" place="margin">Editor.

                  <p>Particular Answers to the particular Branches of the <hi>Protestants Plea</hi> for a <hi>Socinian,</hi> divided into five Conferences by the Author of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THIS Third Chapter needs not to be drawn <note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> into any very great length; for after the general Considerations which answer the general Argument, there wants little more than the Application of them to the respective Heads in the Dialogues.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>First Conference</hi> this is the Sum, both <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Prot. Plea, p. 1. to p. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Socinians plead Scripture</hi> as the sole Rule of Faith. Both say, the Scripture is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clear. Both say, it is clear in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Nature of the Son of God. The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> professeth himself to be as <hi>Industrious</hi> in finding out the sense of the Scripture as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant; and he is as well assur'd in his persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore the Protestant, in this Plea, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies</hi> the <hi>Socinian,</hi> the latter saying the same thing for himself that the former does.</p>
               <p>I answer,</p>
               <p>First, (as before,) That though they pretend to the same Rule, they Walk not alike by it. One <note place="margin">Answer to Arg. 1.</note> follows it, the other wrests it. And this ought
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63913:20"/>
not to be turn'd to the prejudice of him who is true to his Rule. Let both Opinions be brought to it, and then it will appear which is strait and which is crooked. If Two men lay before them the same Rule of <hi>Addition,</hi> and one works truly by it, and the other, either through want of due attention, or out of unjust design, shall cast up the Sum false, there is no man who will tell us in good earnest, that the first <hi>justifies</hi> the Second; or that both of them needed an <hi>Infallible Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician</hi> to be their Judg.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though this Author picks out this one point of the Divinity of Christ, and represents it in the term of <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> which to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar here, is more difficult than that of <hi>Homon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siety</hi> was to the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and passes by many more easie <hi>Socinian Doctrines,</hi> yet so it is that we find in St. <hi>Iohn</hi> this very Article plainly revealed. For that Apostle (who certainly was conscious of his own design) wrote the History of his Gospel to this very purpose, <hi>That we might believe that Iesus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">S. Joh. 20. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>is the Son of God:</hi> By which each Romanist, who owns (what his Church does,) the Catholick sense of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s first Chapter, can understand no other Article than that of <hi>Nice,</hi> that Christ is <hi>God of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though the <hi>Socinians</hi> do pretend that the Writings of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> are to them as clear as to any Protestant, and that they cannot discern in them the Divinity of Christ; yet Confidence in saying a thing is not clear, is not an Argument that it is not. The House is not naturally made dark, because the Blind will excuse their Infirmity upon it.</p>

Answ. to the Author of <hi>Sure-Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> p. 346, 347</note>) <q>seems to object as elsewhere, that some who seem to follow the Letter of the Scriptures deny this, [that is, the Divinity of Jesus Christ,] as do the <hi>Socinians.</hi> What then? This is not for want of Evidence in Scripture, but from making or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising ways to avoid this Evidence. Will this Author say, that there was no Evidence of there being Angels and Spirits, amongst the Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sadduces, who had opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving all such Evidence, beleived neither Angel nor Spirit? And will he say that there was no clear Evidence from the Word of Christ and his Miracles, <hi>that they were from God,</hi> because the Pharises and other unbeleiving Jews, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with him, and saw his Miracles, and heard his Word, did not acknowledge him for God? [I suppose not].</q>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It does not become the Author (who is a Romanist) to say of the Protestant pleading Scripture, that, in so doing, he <hi>justifies</hi> the Plea of the Socinian? For that supposes that the one has as much reason on his side as the other. Whereas a Romanist is oblig'd to own that the Protestant, so far as it is oppos'd to the Socinian Creed, is the true Catholick Faith; and that the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> which is common to us and them, is founded on the Scripture, though the bottom on which it stands is by the Church to be discover'd; whilst his Church condemns the Doctrines of <hi>Socinus</hi> as Haeretical,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63913:21"/>
and therefore as such as cannot at all, either plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or obscurely, be contain'd in the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This Author seems to magnifie the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prot. Plea, p. 1. &amp; p. 4. &amp;c.</note> of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> saying, <hi>That none have us'd more diligence in the search of the Scriptures, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Writings.</hi> This is true in part, and but in part; for somtimes they have been in haste enough. <hi>Slichtingius</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Lubieniec. Historial. p. 6.</note> made quick dispatch, writing many Commentaries in a few Months, and doing this amidst the Heats and Interruptions of War.</p>
               <p>But, I will allow <hi>Socinus</hi> himself to have been very industrious, and <hi>Crellius</hi> also. Some of the rest have been industrious rather as Scriveners than Commentators, transcribing the sense, and, in part, the words of those who went before them. But if Men are ingag'd in new Conceits, they are under a necessity of being diligent. A Text cannot be wrung and squeez'd with a dead Hand, and there is more study requir'd for the perverting of Truth, than for the declaring of it. For the true Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture, much more is requir'd than Industry and Study. The Protestant therefore, in this Author <note n="b" place="margin">Prot. Plea. p. 8.</note>, speaks of a <hi>due Industry,</hi> void of Pride, Passion, and other Interest; and such Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry has not been always acknowledg'd either in the <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>Socinians.</hi>

But farther, in the very manner of <hi>Socinian Exposition,</hi> there is apparent failure. For, though the Holy Writers express the same thing very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and without respect to nicety of Words, (as is evident from the several forms of Words us'd in representing Christs Institution of the Lords Supper); yet the <hi>Socinians</hi> make Interpretations of places which relate to the great Articles of Christian Faith, to turn upon subtleties of Grammatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

               <p>I might add that, by coming to particulars, the <hi>Socinian Prejudice</hi> and insincere Artifice, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding such places of Holy Writ as concern their Scheme, will appear to all unbyassed Readers.

Divinity of the Son of Gon, (which is the Authors Instance) does acknowledge that the Doctrine is sufficiently propos'd; does receive the <hi>Council of Nice;</hi> does own that he is convinc'd. And the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist</hi> confesseth that, thus far, he is in the right, and the <hi>Socinian</hi> in the wrong. This comes to the same thing which was said before, and the Answer is repeated, because the Objection is brought again.

but standing where we were, after having in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and Legal manner also, thrown off the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were unagreeable to the Primitive Christianity, we will try it over again with them by Scripture, Antiquity and Reason; and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial World shall judge, if it pleases, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Additional Articles in the Creed of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> are of God or Men.</p>
                  <p>For this point of <hi>Schism,</hi> as here manag'd, the reasoning of this <hi>Fifth Conference</hi> was long ago confuted by <hi>Mr. Chillingworth.</hi> But our Author did not condescend to take notice of it, though he cites many other Words of <hi>Mr. Chillingworth</hi> not far from these.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I shall be bold to produce the Words, which he, in all probability, did studiously omit <note n="*" place="margin">See here p. 9, 22, 58. Chill. part. 1.

                  <p>—<q>Whereas D. <hi>Potter</hi> says, there is a great difference between a Schism from them, and a Reformation of ourselves: This (you say) is a quaint Subtilty, by which all Schism and Sin may be as well excused. It seems, then, in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Thieves and Adulterers, and Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Traytors, may say with as much proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as Protestants, that they do no hurt to others, but only Reform themselves. But then methinks it is very strange, that all Protestants should agree with one consent in this defence of themselves from the imputation of Schism: And that, to this day, never any Thief or Murtherer should have been heard of to make use of this Apology! And then for <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> I would know, whether <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who Excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> for not conforming to his

But, suppose they were so impudent as to say so in <note place="margin">☞</note> their own Defence falsly, doth it follow by any good Logick, that therefore this <hi>Apology</hi> is not to employ'd by <hi>Protestants</hi> who may say so truly?

                        <hi>We make (say they) no Schism from you, but only a Reformation of ourselves: This</hi> (you reply) <hi>is no good justification, because it may be pretended by any Schismatique.</hi> Very true, any Schismatique that can speak may say the same Words, (as any Rebel that makes Conscience the Cloak of his impious Disobedience, may say with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Iohn, We must obey God rather than Men:)</hi> But then the Question is, whether any Schismatique may say so truly?

               <p>AFter all this causeless finding fault with the <hi>Plea</hi> of the <hi>Protestant,</hi> what is it that the <hi>Romanists</hi> aim at, and after what manner would they mend this Plea? They will tell you, <q>This seems to be the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <note place="margin">Prof. Plea, Digress. p. 9.</note> of the late way taken up by many <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, viz.</hi> That in stead of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church her setting up some Men (the Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors) as Infallible in Necessaries; here is set up by them every <hi>Christian,</hi> if he will, both Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in all Necessaries; and certain that he is so.</q> They will endeavour to persuade you, that the Great Ends they aim at are, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> And that these Blessed Ends are never to be universally attain'd without an Infallible <hi>Church</hi> to which all may submit their Judgments in Religion, and, by such submission, preserve Unity. They will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their discourse, and say, Without such a Judge, every Mans Reason is Reason, and every Mans Scripture is Scripture, and he is left to run wild after his own Imaginations. And though a Man is not in the right, he will not yield he is so, till it is given against him by an Infallible Judge.</p>
               <p>But Men must first be satisfi'd that there is such a Judge, and who he is, and where and how to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63913:30"/>
found, and how far Men will follow him. When there was such a Judge on Earth, (the most <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible High-Priest,</hi> the Blessed <hi>IESUS)</hi> prejudic'd and perverse Men would neither be of <hi>One Faith,</hi> nor of <hi>One Heart.</hi> The Wisdom of God will not, by forcing of Assent, destroy the Nature and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it; and he hath declar'd that he will permit <hi>Heresies,</hi> that those who are approved and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Christians may be distinguished from those who are not. This Expedient of the <hi>Romanists</hi> is like that of the Atheist <hi>Spinoza,</hi> who has left the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Maxim to the World as his Legacy for Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Object of Faith is not Truth but Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the quiet of human Society. And they say in effect, Shut all your Eyes, and agree in one who shall lead you all, and you will all go one way: But the difficulty lies in getting them to agree. It is not difficult to say a great deal more upon this Subject; but, in stead of that which might be here offer'd from myself, I will refer the Reader to a Book lately publish'd, and call'd, <hi>A Discourse concerning a Iudge in Controversies;</hi> if he be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with that which Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath said long ago, and to which this Author has here said nothing <note place="margin">Chill.

By which if you mean <hi>Discourse,</hi> not guiding itself by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but only by Principles of Nature, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by Prejudices and popular Errors, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Consequences not by Rule but by Chance, is, by no means, true. If you mean by <hi>Discourse,</hi> Right Reason, grounded on Divine Revelation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63913:30"/>
and common Notions, written by God in the Hearts of all Men; and deducing, according to the never-failing Rules of Logick, consequent Deductions from them: If this be it which you mean by <hi>Discourse,</hi> it is very meet, and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and necessary, that Men, as in all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so especially in that of greatest importance, the choice of their way to Happiness should be left unto it: And he that follows this in all Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Actions, and does not only seem to do so, follows always God; whereas he that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Company of Men, may oft-times follow a Company of Beasts. And in saying this, I say no more than S. <hi>Iohn</hi> to all Christians in these words, <hi>Dearly Beloved, believe not every Spirit; but try the Spirits, whether they be of God or no:</hi> And the Rule he gives them to make this tryal by, is to consider, whether they <hi>Confess IESUS to be Christ;</hi> that is, the Guide of their Faith, and Lord of their Action; not, Whether they acknowledge the Pope to be his Vicar. I say no more than S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in exhorting all Christians, <hi>To try all things, and hold fast that which is good:</hi> Than S. <hi>Peter</hi> in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Christians, <hi>To be ready to give a reason of the hope that is in them:</hi> Then <hi>our Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in forewarning all his Followers, that <hi>if they blindly followed blind Guides, both Leaders and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers should fall into the Ditch.</hi> And again, in saying even to the People, <hi>Yea, and why of your selves judge ye not what is right?</hi> And though by Passion, or Precipitation, or Prejudice, by want of Reason, or not using what they have, Men may be, and are oftentimes, lead into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Mischief; yet, that they cannot be

misguided by <hi>Discourse,</hi> truly so called, such as I have described, you yourself have given them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. For, what is <hi>Discourse,</hi> but drawing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions out of Premises by good Consequence? Now, the Principles which we have setled, to wit, the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are on all sides agreed to be Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true. And you have told us in the Fourth Chapter of this Pamphlet, <hi>That from Truth no Men can, by good Consequence, infer Falshood; Therefore,</hi> by <hi>Discourse,</hi> no Man can possibly be led to error; but if he erre in his Conclusions, he must of Necessity, either err in his Principles, (which here cannot have place) or commit some error in his Discourse; that is, indeed, not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but seem to do so.</q>

                  <q>13. You say, Thirdly, with sufficient confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That <hi>if the true Church may err in defining what Scriptures be Canonical, or in delivering the sense thereof, then we must follow either the private Spirit, or else natural Wit and Iudgment; and by them examine what Scriptures contain true or false Doctrine, and in that respect ought to be received or rejected.</hi> All which is apparently untrue, neither can any proof of it be pretended. For though the present Church may possibly err in her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching this matter, yet have we other directions in it, besides the private Spirit, and the Examination of the Contents (which latter way may conclude the Negative very strongly, to wit, that such or such a Book cannot come from God, because it contains irreconcileable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; but the Affirmative it cannot conclude, because the Contents of a Book may be all true, and yet the Book not Written by Divine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63913:31"/>
other direction therefore I say we have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides either of these three, and that is, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Primitive Christians.</q>

                  <q>14. You say, Fourthly, with convenient bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that <hi>this Infallible Authority of the Church being denied, no Man can be assured, that any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the Scripture was Written by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Which is an untruth, for which no proof is pretended; and besides, void of Modesty, and full of Iniquity. The <hi>First,</hi> because the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Innumerable Christians is against it, who are sufficiently assured, that the Scripture is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired, and yet deny the Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of your Church, or any other. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> because if I have not ground to be assured of the Divine Authority of Scripture, unless I first believe your Church <hi>Infallible,</hi> then can I have no ground at all to believe it. Because there is no ground, nor can any be pretended, why I should believe the Church <hi>Infallible,</hi> unless I first believe the Scripture Divine.</q>

               <p n="15">
                  <q>15. Fifthly and lastly, You say, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in abundance; that <hi>none can deny the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority of your Church, but he must abandon all infused Faith, and True Religion, if he do but understand himself:</hi> Which is to say, agreeable to what you had said before, and what out of the abundance of the Heart you speak very often, that <hi>all Christians besides you are open Fools, or concealed Atheists.</hi> All this you say with notable Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (as the manner of Sophisters is, to place their Confidence of Prevailing in their Confident manner of Speaking,) but then for the <hi>Evidence</hi> you promis'd to maintain this Confidence, that is quite vanished and become invisible.</q>

Hitherto I have been arguing against our Author; but now, in the close, I cannot but joyn with him in his <hi>Protestants Exhortation to Humility</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prof. Plea, p. 45.</note>. It is an Admirable Virtue; and may God grant to me, and to all Men, a greater Measure of it. It is a Virtue proper even for Guides in Religion, that they may humbly help the <hi>Faith</hi> of others, and not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Dominion over it.</p>
               <p>And, because a late Writer has been pleas'd to suffer this severe censure to drop from his Pen <note place="margin">A Defence of the Papers, &amp;c. p. 126.</note>, [<q>it is the less to be admir'd that [our Author] is such a stranger to that Spirit [of Meekness and humble Charity,] because among all the Volumes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, written by the Protestants, there is not one Original Treatise, at least, that I have seen or heard of, which has handled distinctly and by itself, that Christian Virtue of Humility.] I will tell</q> him of one Book (as I could of many others) written singly upon that Subject. I mean a late Treatise by <hi>Mr. Allen</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Practical Discourse of Humility, by W. A. Lond. 1681.</note>, a Man who had considered many ways, but long before his Death, approv'd of that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the most safe and Apostolical. He was a Lay-Man, a Citizen, a Man of little skill in Languages or Scholastick-Learning, yet, by Gods Blessing upon his Industry and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Ministeral helps he met with in our Communion, I will be bold to say he understood the Scriptures as judiciously as many Learned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <hi>Commentators,</hi> who have got a Name in the World, and stand pompously, in several Volumes, upon the Shelves of Students.</p>
