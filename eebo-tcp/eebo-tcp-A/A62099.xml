         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Three speciall reasons are usually given of div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sermons in this kind: First, to helpe and benefit Gods Church and people: Secondly, to manifest that
<pb facs="tcp:53473:3"/>
inward respect, which the publishers owe to those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable or Worshipfull persons to whom they are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and presented. Thirdly, to vindicate the truth against the mistakes and traducements of ignorant or ill-affected hearers: and truly (my Lord) these are the reasons that have imboldened my weaknesse thus to discover it selfe, in thrusting these following Sermons from my private Cell.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> I know that the wise God doth sometime sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the greatest affaires of his Church, by the poore indeavours of his meanest servants; and at this time, one of the great matters in hand, is to reforme the Clergy, and to constitute such a Ministry, as should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke the things of Jesus Christ; and he that knowes all hearts can witnesse, that mine aime when I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the first of these, did tend to that thing, and I now conceived that (with Gods providence and blessing) the samemight (haply) at this present, afford some under service towards that so pious and necessary a worke.</p>
                  <p>And mine indeavours in the second of these were, by perswasions out of Gods booke, to tie peoples tongues to their good behaviours, (as I apprehended did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Minister of Christ to doe) in those evill and barking dayes, and the conditions of many are still the same, they take and keepe to themselves, I know not what strange liberty of bold speaking, whereby these unsetled times are likely to prove exceeding miserable;
<pb facs="tcp:53473:3"/>
for evill tongues as they discover evill men, so they doe make evill times, and therefore I conceived that that Sermon also, if it come into some hands (and God please to say Amen to my prayers with it) may not altogether at this present prove unprofitable, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable</p>
                  <p>And in third, mine aimes were, when I first utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, to move my fellow-members and sufferers in the cause of Christ, to make use of that soveraigne preservative of patience, which experience hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes found to be so truly effectuall against the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie blowes of potent hands, and the smarting wounds of poysonous tongues: And I dare boldly say, that while sinne and sorrow hath a being upon earth, it will never be improper to heare or read a discourse of that subject; for we have all, at all times, yea, at this time, need of patience; nay, I dare add further, that even your Lordship in the midst of your Honours, (since you have resolved to follow only the dictate of Gods word, and conscience, in your walke, and way) while mens tongues runne at liberty, will have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sometimes to thinke upon it.</p>
                  <p>And in the last of these, I have (though briefely) handled a matter, most needfull also (I am sure) for this present age to be acquainted with: it is the right temper and nature of the spirit of the Gospel: I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of it onely to mine owne Parish, but I pray for the
<pb facs="tcp:53473:4"/>
inlargement of it in all places, and I know your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and all others, that have religious and loyall hearts, truly aiming at the Gospels glory, and the Kingdomes peace, doe in like sort desire the same: to the end therefore that I might be a meane to awaken others more able, of my profession, to make more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple discoveries of it, as their duty to God, and their Prince commands, and these times require, I have beene here bold to publish my notes upon that subject also: And this (my Lord) is my first reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> My second is, to manifect by this occasion to the worlds eye, that true inward respect, which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of long time, to have duly owed unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; your Noble Grandfather of pious memory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickened by your most friendly solicitation, did freely bestow upon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, that place of maintenance, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as yet) I have my dwelling, upon this sole condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and charge, that I should truly labour to winne soules to Christ: which godly care of his, as it spake him a true friend of Christ, so it may expose him for a patterne to all Patrons, and your Lordship herein is his true successour: so that if these my first fruits of this nature, were of any worth, I am bound by a double tye to Dedicate them onely to your selfe, as to mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Noble friend, as to my present Honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.</p>
                  <p>But (my Lord) there is yet another reason that
<pb facs="tcp:53473:4"/>
doth challenge this duty from me of manifesting my selfe unto the world to be your servant, and that is this,</p>
                  <p>When I was questioned, and much menaced for the first of these Sermons, and did upon that occasion (to the end you might not be mistaken in the cause of my troubles) present a copy of it to your view: you were pleased upon the reading thereof, to proffer your selfe like a true Patron, to be my defender in that businesse; and you would also make use of all the friends you had in <hi>England,</hi> (that was your owne expression) in my behalfe, rather then I for that matter should suffer dammage.</p>
                  <p>Truly (my Lord) the consideration of that your Noblenesse, in being so freely ready to engage your selfe in the cause of Christ, for me so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ane a person, the times being then so conflicting, hath more deepely captivated my heart to your Lordships service, then my hand or tongue is able to expresse: yea, should some crafty <hi>Zibaes</hi> (unhappily) so farre prevaile (as I hope they never shall) against your poore <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi> as to move my Lord, in aftertimes, to thinke amisse of his servant, and as <hi>David</hi> did, to judge him unworthy of former favour, yet I would have all men know, that of necessity I am bound, and therefore must, and shall, from the remembrance of that your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for ever honour you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53473:5"/>
And (my Lord) whither now should that poore wounded Sermon retire her selfe, at this her second and more publike appearance? whither should shee flie for shelter? but onely to that wing which did not disdaine of its owne accord, at her first flight, to open it selfe unto her in the middest of dangers: And behold (my Lord) she comes unto you, and your free bounty hath made her bold, to bring three of her sisters with her, who have all in their measure tasted of her sorrowes, and desire now to partake of that rest, which she begges to enjoy under your shade, your protection is large enough to defend them all foure, wherefore bee pleased my Honourable Lord to give them all leave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Author to boast themselves still and for ever, in your Noble Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> And my last reason of publishing these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was and is, to rectifie (if it may be) those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions, which some hearers had of certaine passages in them, and still have of me for the same: I doe not intend to Apologize for my selfe, I am a man, and may transgresse, and doe so daily against my will, (the Lord be mercifull unto his servant;) And I know besides, that it is tedious even to good men sometimes, to heare wronged innocence beginne to speake in her owne behalfe, when themselves have had a hand in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of her, as appeares by <hi>David</hi>s words to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth, 2 Sam, 19. 29. Why speakest thou
<pb facs="tcp:53473:5"/>
any more of thine owne matters?</hi> but the Lord commands us to indeavour the reformation of those that erre, and therefore for the sake of such as did not at first rightly heare what J spake, J have now so spoken as they may see: <hi>Seneca</hi> saies, that people doe give better credit to their eyes then to their eares, and therefore here is <hi>Audibile</hi> turned to <hi>Visibile,</hi> what was transient, is become more constant, that (if they please) they may consider by seeing, whether they did not before mistake in hearing.</p>
                  <p>I hope in your Lordships judgement, an equall eye may herein discern such an impartiall spirit, as becomes a Minister of Christ to exercise in the discharge of his office: I blesse the Lord for it, I can say (with <hi>Elihu</hi>

loving, faithfull, and selfe-denying man: one <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus,</hi> a young man with whom himselfe was well acquainted, and whose conditions he so well knew, that he durst give his word for him, and pawne his credit that he would be most sincere in the worke of Christ, and most loving unto them, nay the truth was, hee did not know where to find his fellow, he was the best in the whole packe: for (saies he) I have no man like-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded who will naturally care for your state, <hi>for all seeke their owne, and not the things that are Jesus Christs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now (Brethren) as we goe along we may note by the way these few things.</p>
                  <p>First, that there was an Order of Superiours and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in the Church in the Apostles dayes, <hi>Paul</hi> had power over <hi>Timothy,</hi> for to send him, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> was ready to obey <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Sonne the Father, <hi>vers.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may observe, that it did (as may seem) chiefely belong to the Bishop or Supervisor, to appoint Pastors for particular Churches and Congregations: <hi>Paul</hi> sends and appoints <hi>Timothy</hi> to bee a Preacher to the Philippians.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we may observe what kind of men were preferred by them to such places: why such as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by experience knew to be learned, loving, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and selfe-denying; yea, and such of whose condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the people themselves were not altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for such a one was <hi>Timothy</hi> in all these respects as shall appeare.</p>
                  <p>First, he was a learned man, and that not in the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins or Schoolemen onely, but in the Scriptures, hee was a good Textuary, as may be seene, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. instructed in the Scriptures from a child.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he was a loving man, one that would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53473:9"/>
care for their state, even as though they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to him by nature, <hi>vers.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he was one that was no self-seeker, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Christ, as appeares by the text, with that which goes before: I have no man like-minded, <hi>for all these seek their owne, and not the things that are Jesus Christs,</hi> as (who say) <hi>Timothy</hi> is a man <hi>per se,</hi> one that seekes not himselfe in any thing, but onely the glory of God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he was one of whose honesty and sincerity the Philippians themselves had proofe as well as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle (or else it might be questioned whether he would have placed him over them:) ye know (saies he) ye know the proofe of him, that like as a sonne with the father, he se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ved with me in the Gospel <hi>(vers.</hi> 22.) It seemes hee had dwelt with the Apostle (not like a trencher Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine to say Grace and so forth, till a Living fell) but (saies he) he served with me in the Gospel: that is, hee and I went preaching the word of God up and downe together; as if some good Bishop and his Chaplaine should goe up and downe to every Church in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse (as both their duty and custome of old was) and preach the word of God together, the one in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, and the other in the afternoone.</p>
                  <p>Now the Philippians by these means had some proofe and knowledge of <hi>Timothy,</hi> they had heard him preach, and had seene his faithfulnesse, his zeale, and his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lership, and therefore the Apostle knew they could not disallow of him, especially too, being commended to them upon his approbation: I leave the application of these things to your selves and fall upon the text: <hi>for</hi> (saies the Apostle) <hi>all seeke their owne, and not the things that are Jesus Christs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are an <hi>AEtiologia,</hi> or rendring of a reason,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53473:10"/>
why he sent <hi>Timothy</hi> unto them, and it is a collation, from the comparing of him with others, wherein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers him before them, none were altogether of so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a stampe, nor of so pure a metall, so wholly sincere in the worke of Christ as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, they were a little more tainted with selfe-infection, somewhat more <hi>selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeking</hi> then he.</p>
                  <p>Whence we may observe who amongst many is to be preferred <hi>ad Curam Animarum,</hi> by them that have power thereunto, even such as they thinke in conscience, upon good experience, will aime most directly at Gods glory, and at the salvation of men: favour, friendship, base Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, flattery, affection, and the like, must beare no sway, but naked sincerity alone m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>st poyse the Ballance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All seeke their owne:]</hi> there be divers degrees of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity amongst Gods servants, no doubt but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had many more under him, that were sincere too, for the glory of Christ: but <hi>Timothy</hi> he was sincere in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, he went beyond them all, and therefore shall be preferred before them all.</p>
                  <p>Or it may be, this universall proposition is but Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, and taken for the most part, as that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22. speaking of Christ: it is said, <hi>No man received his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>testimony:</hi> that is, no body to speake on; Why, the Discipies did, and some few others did, that were his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; yea, but they were no body to speake on, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them that received it not: So here, no body but <hi>Timothy</hi> seekes that which is Jesus Christs, yes <hi>Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus</hi> did, of whom mention is made <hi>(vers.</hi> 25.) and some others doubtlesse; yea, but alas they are no body to speake on, in respect of the rest, that are more Christs in shew then they are in substance; and (if you please) let us take the words in that sense, which is indeed the most favourable interpretation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53473:10"/>
And I pray you observe in them the Apostles secret complaint, how in that first and golden age of the Church (as we may so call it) wherein Christian vertues did more then ever since flourish in the Clergy; for they were all then either of Christs owne, or of his Apostles owne ordination, who sure were carefull what they did in matters of this nature, they did not ignorantly (as in these later dayes) or rashly lay their hands upon every body, but onely on such, as by the spirit of discerning they foresaw were likely to prove the best: Now I say, if in those golden dayes, we heare and see by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles complaint, <hi>in Clero tam raros fuisse vere cordatos &amp; sinceros homines,</hi> that in respect of the others, they were as no body to speak on: then doubtlesse in these leaden, these clayey, and corrupt dayes of ours, wherein there are more men and lesse vertue, the condition is still the same, if not in a degree worse; at least we may <hi>(rebus sic stantibus</hi> as they doe) conclude from the words now, that which might have beene concluded then: namely this: It is the condition of the greater part of the Clergy to seeke themselves more then Christ. <note place="margin">Doctr.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The first proposition is: Most Ecclesiasticks seek their owne: I give it in these termes, because I desire to close <note place="margin">1. <hi>Propos.</hi>
                     </note> with the Apostle as neere as I can: and it is plain he here speakes of Ecclesiasticall persons.</p>
                  <p>But of these there are two sorts, which for want of other words I may call <hi>Directi,</hi> and <hi>Collaterales;</hi> so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and so onely by the bye: the first sort I confesse are principally here intended by the Apostle, though both sorts, as will appeare, are too much guilty of <hi>selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the first, they are the Ministers of the Gospel, ordained and appointed, as <hi>Timothy</hi> and the rest were, to preach Jesus Christ unto the people: now sayes the Apostle, these <hi>seeke their owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there be three ownes which a Minister is said to <hi>seeke,</hi> owne ease, owne praise, owne profit: <hi>All seeke their owne;</hi> that is, there be few Ministers but are guilty of <hi>selfe-seeking</hi> in one of these three respects.</p>
                  <p>First, some seeke their owne ease, and of these in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">1.</note> are three sorts: whereof the <note place="margin">Owne ease.</note>

I doe not speake (Brethren) but that there is both time and place for men to speake learnedly, if they are able, as in the University, or in such a place, or on such an occasion as this is. If I were able to speake learnedly, I thinke here I should: and I suppose for some reasons if a Sermon on such occasions were made all in Latin, it would not be much amisse: But to speake so Scholler-like (as they call it) to a company of ignorant people, it is for a man to discover himselfe to bee a vaine-glorious foole, even a plaine <hi>selfe-seeker.</hi> I remember a word, and I hope I shall never forget it, that my <hi>Noble Patron</hi> said <note place="margin">

                     </gap>eshed exceedingly with the same, if the very credit of it doth not strongly put him on to preach more often: for my owne part I have found it, when to my owne thinking I have done well, (though haply in another mans not so, for the Crowes bird is alwayes fairest in her owne eyes:) why, before the words have beene scarce out of my mouth, or I out of the Pulpit, I have felt vaine-glory within, suggesting secretly what respect and commendation I have deserved to my selfe, when it may be the next time, God Almighty by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a like assistance, cuts my combe againe, that I might know my glorying to be but vaine-glorying, soone got soone gone, having lost againe in my owne conceit, what before I thought I had deserved: Well, but this shall serve to note out the second sort that seeke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53473:14"/>
in their owne praise: they that affect a vulgar po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity.</p>
                  <p>Now the third sort that seeke themselves in their own <note place="margin">3.</note> praise, are they that affect respect from the people too, but they goe another way to procure it: namely, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying, maligning, despising, and enveighing against those that are, (and it may be deservedly too) more eminent and popular then themselves; the glory of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer is their disgrace, his Candle dimmes theirs, his paines discovers theirs and their Curats lasinesse, and they cannot abide it: Oh if he were obscured, then they should shine, if his light were out, their negligence would not be seene, if he were not so much followed, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as themselves thinke) should be more regarded; they would be famous too, but how shall they effect it? not by mending their owne diligence, but by indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the others silence, not by prayer to God, not by study, not by more painefull, and frequent, and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable preaching, but by slandering, by bitter enveighing, by privie persecuting, by secret writing to superiour pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the like.</p>
                  <p>And surely Brethren, so it is, they that are most often taxed of vaine-glory by these men, doe least affect it, and the taxers themselves are most guilty of it; it may so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare from both sides. First, from the parties taxed, who <hi>(ad plurimum)</hi> are men of more able gifts to whom God lends a greater power to dispense his Word withall, which people perceiving cannot but more affect them, and desire to heare them, (you know, <hi>where the carkasse is, the Eagles will be gathered)</hi> which for his part, it may be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 28.</note> the Preacher desireth not, but rather seekes to avoid, and (as some have done) doth haply forbeare to preach at that present, when he hath seene people flocking to that purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53473:14"/>
Nay, and further observe but the manner of such mens teaching, they seldome presse for respect to Preachers, they know they shall have it if they deserve it without preaching for it: honour followes merit as the shadow doth the body, and flies from them that follow it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the other parties (the taxers) who are ever and anon, calling for respect, for reverence, and love; which (as the case may be) may lawfully be done, for the Apostle did it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 17. yet ordinarily, doubtlesse, it is purchased by a better tenour if as to the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 17.</note> other it comes by desert without asking.</p>
                  <p>And besides (as I said) it is their custome of whom I am speaking, to enveigh bitterly against their neighbour Ministers that have more respect then themselves, and to present their poore people that give it to them, and what doth this secretly inferre but <hi>selfe-seeking?</hi> for if thou didst truly seeke Christ, and didst glory above all things, as thou oughtest in the prosperity of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, thou wouldst be glad to see it thrive by whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the builder, and wouldst rejoyce in the fruit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others labours, as in thine owne, if thine with his did tend to the service of the same Lord.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and further, as it is observed, those Ministers that are most bitter in complaining in that kinde are such as are either utterly unable to teach profitably them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or else are idle persons, and make no conscience to stirre up that gift which God hath bestowed upon them: Why man, if thou wouldst keepe thy people at home, do not fall a pounding, or presenting of them, nor doe thou fall to enveigh against those to whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, for that course will but drive that further from thee which thy soule gapes after: namely, respect and love: No, but fall thou to worke more diligently, study thou more carefully, pray thou more fervently, and teach
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53473:15"/>
thou more conscionably and profitably, and see what God will doe for thee: but if thou followest thine owne courses still, men will say that thou (though covertly) seekest thine owne praise, yea, and thou givest people more just occasion to judge so of thee, then thou canst finde to judge so of another: And thus you have seene as briefely as may be the second way wherein Ministers seeke themselves, namely in their owne praise.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the third way wherein they seeke their owne, and that is in profits, and of these as of the <note place="margin">3.</note> former are in like manner three sorts.<note place="margin">Owne profit.</note>

                  <p>It is very true, peoples conscience in tything even eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, is like some Ministers conscience in preaching, it alwayes comes short of duty, and yet (Brethren) let us observe it, of all sinnes, preaching is least prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this sinne, for whatsoever the Minister speakes in this case, they will judge to be spoken in his owne case, what ever he intends, they will taxe him of <hi>selfe-seeking,</hi> for it is a point called <hi>Nolime tangere,</hi> the very touch will infect, but to glance in the Pulpit upon the unconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of people in this kind is the very next way to spread the contagion, such are their natures and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>And yet (Brethren) this is a common place, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may the better speake it, and where there is one Lay-man here I would there were a hundred for to heare me: but here are the Church-wardens, that for the most part are the ringleaders to dishonesty in this kind, the Proverb holding true in them, The nearer the Church the farther from God, so soone as they have taken the Oath of Relation to the Church, then will they shew
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53473:17"/>
themselves injurious one way or other to the chiefe Churchman, and the Devill perhaps perswades them they may doe it that yeare by authority: But as I was saying, (and I pray you be pleased to marke it, you of the Laity, and tell your neighbours of it when you come at home) A Minister may and ought to seeke that which God and the Law hath alotted him for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and yet be no <hi>selfe-seeker,</hi> but may seeke Christ in it, and the soules of you his people in it: I warrant you will not beleeve this, but ile make it plaine unto you.</p>
                  <p>First, he seekes Christ in it, for Tythes are called Gods portion, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. the Ministers are but Gods Rent-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8.</note> and should they faile in their duty in this kind, we may well fore-see by the unconscionable conditions of men (who above all things love to cheate God of his due) that by the next generation, Christ would have cause to take up his old complaint, <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the aire have nests, but the Sonne of man</hi>

                  <p>Then secondly, they in this seeke not so much them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as they doe you their people, for (marke it) wouldst not thou say that that man did chiefely aime at thy good, that should bestow all his paines and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to save thee from the Gallowes, although he should get to himselfe there by the price for the Halter? Why, I tell thee, of all thefts, this is the most dangerous and dunnable, when thou doest withold or diminish that which is due to the Ministers of God: Now, that the curse which God threatens, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. might not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53473:17"/>
thou by his remisnesse shouldst pull the curle upon thine owne head: And I pray thee what doth hee get by it? even the price of a two peny halter, for thy Tythes and thy dues which thou payest to him, are but as of that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in respect of thy soule, the whole world is nothing in comparison of that, saies Christ, and I hope thou wilt not deny it if thou lovest thy soule: But indeed Brethren, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 26.</note> this is the truth of it, people doe not love their owne soules, it appeares in this, of all men, they doe not care for him that hath the charge of their soules, it goes most against the stomachs of many of them to doe him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courtesie. Any Lay-man shall have better dealings with them, and shall receive better Tythes from them (where Lay-men doe receive them) then he that hath the charge of their soules; yea, any other Minister, any Lecturer, shall have their affections, and it may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their monies too, but their owne Pastor that hath the charge of their soules, though he be never so carefull and painfull for their good, shall not get so much as his dues of them: Nay, which is more strange yet, if a Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer doth but turne Pastor, and take the charge of soules upon him, it is the very next way to lose many of the peoples loves, which haply before he did injoy, and this some Lecturers fore-see well enough, and therefore refuse to take any such charge upon them?</p>
                  <p>But what is the reason that people in this sort, affect not him that hath the charge over their soules, when as the Apostle also commands it so expressely, but even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12.</note> they doe not love their owne soules.</p>
                  <p>But (Brethren) I would you would but seriously in your retired thoughts, thinke upon that charge of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and read over with due considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</note> that place in the third of <hi>Malachi,</hi> where Tythes are called Gods portion, and where the curse is threatned to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53473:18"/>
light upon those that retaine them: and a gracious bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is promised to all the rest of their substance, to the free, willing, and liberall payers of them: I say, if you would but consider well of those two places, it would never goe so against your stomachs to doe your Minister a common courtesie, nor would you ever thinke ill of him, for looking after that which belongs unto him, nor would you ever put him off with the riffe-raffe of your things, as the worst fleece, the least sheafe, and the like, nor in your bargaining with him for your Tythes, would you desire to get a drinking penny as (you call it) by him, which according to the ballance of your owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (if you can) shall be at least halfe in halfe: no nor would you ever thinke you did wrong the Countrey in giving God his due in this or that particular: (what will they say, doth he thinke ile wrong the Countrey, pay him Tythes of that or that? no, never while I live) so they set God and the Countrey at oddes: yea, but woe be to thee and thy Countrey too if God be against thee: I say (Brethren) if you would but seriously, when you are alone, thinke well of the matter, these things would not be so taxable in you as they are.</p>
                  <p>But this is onely by the way: the third sort of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters I say, that seeke themselves in this ranke of profits, are they that plunge themselves overmuch in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, in respect of their temporall demeanes, and regard specially the fat and the fleece, that looke so over-scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingly to their Tythes and Offerings, (as too too many there are that exceed the meane both of discretion and honesty too in that kind) I say these are the third sort that seeke themselves in their owne profits.</p>
                  <p>So that (Brethren) consider all these kinds of men, all these sorts of Ministers, they that seeke their owne ease, in not preaching, not residing, in preaching plausibly;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53473:18"/>
they that seeke their owne praise, in ostentation of their learning and eloquence, in affecting popularity, in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them that are more eminent then themselves; they that seeke their owne profits in hunting after Pluralities, in basely begging contributions, in giving up themselves more openly to worldly mindednesse: I say joyn all these together, and substract them out of the generall number of the Clergy throughout the Land, and no doubt but the first proposition will be found true, that the greater part of the Clergy seeke their owne: Here are nine parts you see, haply I might name more, but I would gladly shew my selfe as charitable, as I would have my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours conscionable, and leave God the Tenth.</p>
                  <p>But these be onely the Clergy <hi>primi ordini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What shall I say of these, that they seeke their owne? (sure I should wrong them then) No, they seeke more then their owne, for some of their Courts (in regard of some of their consciences) are as unsatiable as Hell, wherein themselves play the Devill, and if they get a man in, they will hold him fast, either by right or wrong,

                  <p>And so now I have done with the first Proposition, I have shewed you that most Ecclesiastickes seeke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Propos.</hi>

                  <p>The things of Christ, what are they? why, surely in a word, they are nothing else but the Sheepe of Christ, the soules of men and women, these are the things of Christ, which he purchased you know with the price of his bloud: Now, the Ministers of the Gospel are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</note> for Christ and from Christ: to looke to these his Sheepe, to gather them together into his fold, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with his voyce, to keepe them within his pastures, to give all possible care and tendance to them for their good: so that to seek the things that are Christs, is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>First, we cannot seeke Christ and our owne ease to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (as you know) in the 34. <note place="margin">1.</note>

                  <p>And (Brethren) I beseech you all by that holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship that we have with one another in the worke of Christ, that you would seriously consider of these things, and as you desire that your people should apply unto themselves, such doctrines as you propound unto them, and take unto themselves such reproofes, as come from your mouthes, and doth concerne them; So doe you apply and take to your selves, that which I shall speake, and may concerne your particular persons.

in many Ministers shall be required at the Parishioners hands, for if they were not so full of fraud, and couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and unjust dealing, but would pay the Ministers their dues honestly and quietly, they would never be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so to looke after them, or to study the law to know their owne.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (my Brethren of the Laity) pray let me lose a few more words among you before I goe: you complaine that your Ministers are covetous, and close, and nigh and shrewd men for the world, you may thanke your selves for it, you make them so, for if you had but so much honesty to pay unto God the things that are Gods, that they are intrusted to looke unto, they would mind their bookes more and the world lesse.</p>
                  <p>But you would have your Minister keep a good house, and feast you all over from one end of the towne to the other, and in requitall of his kindnesse, you will cast all the burden of the poore upon his necke if you can, and very mannerly spare your own purse, &amp; cozen him of half his dues beside, &amp; when your consciences begin to croke, &amp; to grumble at your so dong, you can stop their mouths with your new found distinction, that you allow him as much as the tenth of the ground comes too, that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rent you pay for the Land: but he shall not have the tenth of your labours: and therefore you will pay your selves for them, you will steale from him so much as shall pay for the tenth of plowing, and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reaping, and mowing, for horse and man and all: and this you thinke you may doe, and with this chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting distinction, for the present you stop the mouthes of your consciences: But (by your favour) if this were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest dealing, then God Almighty was much to blame, when hee commanded the people, not onely to pay, but also to bring their tythes unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in that he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53473:28"/>
did not withall command the Priests to allow them somewhat backe againe for their labours; no, no, but your wisdome comes from a deeper bottome, then God, Almighties did, it comes from Hell, and to Hell it will carry you.</p>
                  <p>But you (my Brethren of my Clergy) when you heare any of your Parishioners nibling upon this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, crosse him in your books for a cheating knave, for I warrant you he hath cozened you already, or he meanes to cozen you.</p>
                  <p>And (my Brethren) we shall doe well to looke unto it, and prevent a danger before it comes, for doubtlesse these <hi>inconscionabiles coloni,</hi> doe intend to bring Ministers to take their Tythes according to the Rents of their Lands, and not according to the fruits of their Lands; yea, and let a man but for quietnesse sake yeeld unto them once, you shall have them come the next yeare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine they have a hard bargaine, and then you shall not get so much, and so in the conclusion it will come to this passe, we shall get nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>Ah, but my Brethren (you of the Laity) have a care of your soules for all that you had best, and expresse the same in loving your Ministers, and in paying them their dues, that they may be incouraged to have a care of your soules too, as of the things of Jesus Christ, you have a condition among you, but it is a very ill-favoured one, you will not above all doe your Minister a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, for feare of raising a custome, no, you will scarce be conscionable some of you, for feare of bringing it into a a custome, and you thinke it a great credit unto your selves to be the maintainers of a Towne-faction against your Pastors: O no, doubt but it will be very sweet and comfortable unto you, when you lie upon your death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, yea, and if you have never a foote of Land in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53473:29"/>
Towne of your owne, so much the more comfortable: O but (Brethren) in sober sadnesse, let me tell you it will be but poore comfort when sad death shall lay his cold clawes upon you, to summon you to the Judgement seat of him whose servants and stewards you have opposed: No, no, but beleeve it, it will be more comfortable, if y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nay, let me adde this, I thinke verily, if you were but as conscionable in punishing sin and evill (as your place requires) as you seeme to be be unconscionable in taking monies, your gaine would be much more then it is, and where you have one Presentment, you would have three or foure, for I am perswaded many Ministers had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Thus (Brethren) I have held you longer then I thought I should, but if you well consider: I had many sorts to speake unto, and to speake to every one a little, I could speake no lesse; and now I make no question, but with <hi>Sampson,</hi> I have pull'd a house upon mine owne head; I meane much secret dislike and evill will, from every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for my plainenesse, but if I have, it is no more then I fore-expected, and as <hi>Sampson</hi> did, if with my selfe I slay or wound the guilty, I care not: I say with him, let me lose my life, (my credit, my esteeme, or what you will) <note place="margin">

my servant shall deale prudently;</hi> may and shall in some sort be said of each of them, behold they shall deale pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, which prudence of theirs, they shall one way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, by keeping <hi>silence in evill times,</hi> as the text infers.</p>
                  <p>Many talk, that these times wherein we live are <hi>evill times,</hi> if they be, (as they say) it were well if they would shew themselves <hi>prudent</hi> by this marke, and keepe silence in them; some thinke it their wisdome to speake much and to write much, and to inveigh and exclaime much, and to find much fault whersoere they come, and to cast much blame upon them, that perhaps deserve it not, this they thinke their best wisdome, by this appeares their deepe insight: yea, but the Prophet here is of a cleane contrary opinion, he thinkes that prudence in such times doth best appeare by keeping silence.</p>
                  <p>Well, but whether the times are evill or no: it is not undertaken to be any part of my office at this time to determine, onely this I am sure, it were good that some people would keepe a little more silence then they doe, and therefore this text cannot be unseasonable or unsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for these times, especially if they be (as some cry out and doe suppose) to teach people good behaviour.</p>
                  <p>From the words we note these following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some times are worse then others, for the Prophet doth particularize in that time, which he cals <hi>an evill time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wise and godly men doe know these times, they are able to discerne them, and to distinguish of them, to behave themselves accordingly in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the property of wise and godly men, and their custome in evill times to keep silence, to say little, to bind their tongues to their good behaviours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And lastly, because wise men do so, we may conclude that silence is best and most safe in such times wherein
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53473:32"/>
prayers and teares are most needfull, and those are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous times: These be the observations, of which in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some times are worse then others: there be good dayes and bad, good times and evill, the Scripture notes both; <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. 21. there is mention made of times of refreshing, and of restitution, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. of times of reformation, and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. of times of redemption, wherein we are bidden to lift up our heads, that is, to be merry and joyfull, and then indeed we may be more free in our talking, for there is a time to speak as well as to <hi>keep silence,</hi> &amp; as evil times according to the text, are times to keepe silence in, so good times are times to speak in, for when things goe well with us, (unlesse we be worse then the brute Oxe that lowes not over his fodder) wee will not murmure nor complaine, nay, we will speake nothing but what is good, praise and thankfulnesse, if we have any grace in us: thus you see there be good times.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and so there be evill too, which the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so notes, times when the Bridegroome shall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. and those are times of mourning saies the text there, evill times indeed in respect of those fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, when our joyes, our comforts, and outward contentments, our spirituall blessings are gone or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, when the face of Jesus Christ in his ordinances is darkened or obscured, so <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 22. the dayes shall come, saies Christ, when yee shall desire to see one of the dayes of the sonne of man, and shall not see them, one of the dayes of light and liberty which now you doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; sure those are evill dayes and times whensoere they come, and <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 29. the dayes are comming in which they shall say, <hi>Blessed are the barren that beare not, &amp;c.</hi> when to have children shall be a griefe, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them a cause of sorrow, when the very sight of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53473:33"/>
sucking babes, and helplesse, harmlesse infants shall cause the parent to shed teares, when the loving husband and wife shall wish themselves b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rren, and shall count it a blessednesse to have no children, sure those times must needs be evill, great evils are hanging (at least) over head that causeth such sad thoughts, such desires, indeed such dayes and times are called the dayes of vengeance, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 22. dayes wherein sinne reigneth and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rageth: thus you see some times are worse then others.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason is not, that one time, or part of time is better or worse then other, but from the people, and <note place="margin">Reason.</note> their conditions that live in them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. and following verses, the Apostle saies, <hi>in the last dayes peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times shall come,</hi> for saies he (shewing the reason) <hi>men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, boasters, proud, &amp;c.</hi> thus and thus conditioned: so <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 12. our Saviour having spake of the evill of the last times, he addes the reason of the evill to be, <hi>because iniquity shall abound,</hi> men shall be full of sinne: and in the verses before the text, the reason of the evill time mentioned in the text is the plenty of evill men, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. men that cannot abide to be reproved, or reclaimed, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. men that would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the poore to spare their owne purses, <hi>vers:</hi> 11. men of manifold transgressions, that would afflict the just, take bribes, turne the poore from their right, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. men that would doe whatsoever themselves pleased, rich men that scorned to be controuled, and such kind of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes indeed there be in many places and times, that make both place and times naught wherein they live: such are those worldly chubs, that take upon them to be as Lords and Kings in the places and Parishes wherein they live, over their inferiour neighbours, that turne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>udgement and equity into wormwood, that hate to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53473:33"/>
rebuked, that tread upon the poore, laying their owne burdens upon their unable shoulders, that afflict the just, and take bribes, such are they that beare sway in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes where they live, and indeed these are they that make the times bad whensoever they be so, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels us that where the chiefe of the Parish be unjust, prophane, wicked, or carelesse to keepe good rule, there is much evill and sinne committed by all sorts, and when and where such men have to doe, the time and place is evill, such as are the Masters, such will be the men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours will conforme to the examples of them that goe before them.</p>
                  <p>Now, if you aske why God who governes all things and times, permits evill times to be, I answer among other reasons, it may be to try what benefit those that be good have made of better times, what meeknesse, and patience, and vertue they are furnished with, that they might have occasion to shew themselves prudent, and wise by their silence, as in good times they had, to shew the same by their speaking: and besides, all things in this world, and so time the measure of all things is mutable and changeable, it never continues in one stay: and thus briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you have the Reasons.</p>
                  <p>Marvell not then at evill times, there hath alwayes beene such, both in Church and Common-wealth; <hi>Eccl.</hi>

Hath there not beene evill times before? yes sure, therefore as 'tis, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 10. say not thou what is the cause the former times were better then these? for thou doest not wisely consider and understand, that the former times have beene in some respect as bad, if not worse then those that thou complainest of: there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53473:34"/>
have beene evill men before, and evill doings, there hath beene oppression, and injustice before, taking bribes, and trampling upon the poore, and hating reproofe, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Gods Prophets, all this this Chapter witnesseth; yea, there hath beene persecution in former times, even to the shedding of bloud; Church and Common-wealth, both are, and ever have beene alwayes like the Moone, they have had both their increase and wane, and that in all places: In <hi>Jury</hi> once was God well knowne, his name was great in <hi>Israel,</hi> and therein was that Lands happines above all others, and now it is most miserable of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in regard of the want of that happinesse: the seven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> and also the Church of <hi>Greece</hi> once did flourish and saw good dayes, now none but evill; <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe was once famous over all the world for her faith, now as stinking; poore <hi>Germany</hi> now wasted with misery, had once some good dayes as well as we, who must also looke for a change as well as shee, (though as yet (God be thanked) the Sunne shines most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly amongst us;) yea, and so must <hi>America, New-England</hi> too, where now perhaps the Sunne of comfort beginnes to appeare, and the glorious day-Starre to shew it selfe, <hi>sed venient annis secula seris,</hi> there will come times in after ages, when the clouds will over-shadow and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the skie there, as well as elsewhere, though now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many promise to themselves nothing but successive happinesse there, which for a time through Gods mercy they may injoy, and I pray God they may a long time: but in this world there is no happinesse perpetuall: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never thinke it strange if some times be worse then others: I confesse indeed we are fallen into the fagge end of the world, the last and old age thereof which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is most crasie and most full of imperfections, the base and iron age, or rather (as was signified by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars</hi>

                  <p>Remember from what was said concerning the occasion of evil times, that it is from the evil men that live in them, <note place="margin">

And so we have done with our first note: we come to the second.</p>
                  <p>Wise and godly men doe know these evill times, they are able to discerne them, to distinguish of them, and to <note place="margin">2.</note> behave themselves accordingly in them.</p>
                  <p>I say, wise and godly men: for some are wise and not godly, and some are godly, but not very wise; the first are not taught of God, the other are not ripe enough to practice what they are taught, therefore I say, godly and wise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I say, doe know these evill times to behave themselves accordingly in them: for there is (as was said before) a time for a wise man to speake, as well as to hold his peace, there is a time for both, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 7. now the time to speake in, is the time of prosperity, good times, for when a man is in prosperity, if he speakes, his words will be regarded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 29. 21. 22. but when the times are evill with a man, when he is poore, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, though he be never so godly, and speake never so wisely, yet his words are not heard, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 16. and this <hi>Job</hi> had experience of too, when hee was in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity: and therefore I say of these times, wise and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men can distinguish: for the proofe of this, see <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 9. a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53473:35"/>
and <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 3. <hi>A prudent man foreseeth the evill and hides himselfe,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>men of full age,</hi> that, is, (that have got some growth in Christ, which are wise as well as godly,) have their senses exercised to discerne both good and evill, and <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 43. Hee that is wise will observe and marke such things.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I confesse others cannot doe so, the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are more wise than naturall men in this: <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7. and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> sends such a one, whom he cals a foole, to the Pismire to learne this wisdome in discerning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6.</note> of times, take the words in our sense, and they make for our purpose, I confesse in a literall sense there is many a naturall man for worldly commodities can foresee the Winter in Summer, and provide for it; discerne of a hard time when 'tis come, to advance the price of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and before it comes to lay in against it, for the children of this world are wise in their generation; but to discerne of times as they are good or evil to the soule, is beyond their skill, to discerne of the vice of the times any farther then it makes to the hindring of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward commodities, or their corporall affaires, is more than they are able; this our Saviour noteth of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 54, 55, 56. they cannot discerne the times (saies he) that is, the danger of them in respect of the soule, but they rather sing peace, peace to themselves, being the servants of corruption, till sudden destruction comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>For indeed evill times are most sutable to the humours <note place="margin">Reason.</note> and tasts of evill men, they relish them best, sinne is sweet to the sinner, and sinfull times are sweetest to sinfull men, they thinke them the best times, for they call evill good, and good evill, bitter sweet, and sweet bitter, <hi>Es.</hi> 5. 20. although there is a woe belonging unto them for their so doing: nor are they indued with the spirit of discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53473:36"/>
as the godly are, for these things and times in this sense are spiritually discerned, and to this purpose God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes his Spirit upon his owne: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. there is mention made of the gift of discerning which the Lord bestowes; and then further they are taught of God, <hi>John</hi> 6. 45. It is written in the Prophets and they shall be taught of God, and <hi>James</hi> 1. 6. God gives them wisdome and prudence, and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 8. he abounds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in all wisdome and prudence, so that their spirits can discerne perverse things, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 30. their eares are open to heare, and their hearts to beleeve, what is threatned by Gods Prophets against sinne; and if sinne goes before, they know that without repentance judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will follow.</p>
                  <p>Whereas other men that are not godly, promise liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace to themselves and others, although they be the servants of corruption, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. and cannot abide to heare of judgements, or that the times are evill, when at any time they so be: you may remember to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the story of the old world, when <hi>Noah</hi> (no doubt) did preach of the insuing evill time that would come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but they beleeved it not: And the story of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> when <hi>Lot</hi> preached of the same point, and to as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpose; you may remember also the times wherein <hi>Jeremy</hi> lived, and into what troubles he came, for his fore-telling and speaking of the dangerous times that were to come upon the people, see <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 1. and <hi>chap.</hi> 26. 8, 9. and <hi>chap.</hi> 38. 4. Thus you see that some men, though wise enough in other matters, yet not to discerne ill times, nor can they abide to heare of them, they will not beleeve although they bee told, but hate them that speake of them: and indeed what was it they had to lay to <hi>Stephens</hi> charge, when they put him to death? why see, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 17. they pretended that he spake blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53473:36"/>
words <hi>against the holy place and the Law;</hi> and what blasphemy doe you thinke it was? why, I warrant you, he said that for their sinnes God would bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that place, and take away the Law from them, and give it to others, according to our Saviours doctrine in the Parable of the husbandmen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 41, 43. which at that time also was very ill taken by them whom it did concerne, as yee may see, <hi>vers.</hi> 45. 46. of that <hi>chap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now with the godly and wise it is not so, they like <hi>Mary,</hi> lay up what they see and heare to that purpose in their hearts, and wisely provide and fit themselves against those evill and dangerous times, some one way and some another, as it pleaseth the spirit of wisdome for to guide them: <hi>Jonadab</hi> the sonne of <hi>Rechab,</hi> wisely weighing the sinnes of the times, and the judgements threatned by the Prophets, and beleeving them to be true, that they should be carried away captive into a strange country, where they were like to have but course fare, small drinke, and hard lodging, therefore doth traine up his children accordingly before-hand, and sets them downe rules to live by, which they observed; they must drinke no Wine, dwell in no Cities, but lodge in Tents, &amp;c. that so they might be fitted for the hardship which they and their posterity in succeeding evill times were like to indure: so we reade in the booke of Martyrs, of two women that hearing of <hi>Boners</hi> cruelty in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, how little food in the prison was allowed to the poore prifoners of Jesus Christ, and expecting that ere long, themselves should be in that place, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand against that evill time accustome themselves to eate and drinke but the value of three farthings a day, whereby they did afterward indure his hard usage.</p>
                  <p>So we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. the Church foreseeing the

evill times did wisely apprehend the occasion (having a way made) for her safety and security in the Wildernesse, to <hi>Pella</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Jerusalems</hi> sacking; and, as some will have it, upon a like foresight many doe flie to <hi>New-England</hi> now: so the Spirit taught <hi>Noah</hi> to provide an Arke for his owne safety against the evill time that was comming upon the world, and some by the same Spirit are inabled with faith and patience to beare the brunt. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19. speaking of evill times, they were bid to possesse their soules with patience, inferring that by it as by a safe armour they might be secured and kept safe, for as in dangerous times the safety of some may consist in flying, so the safety of others may consist in sitting still, <hi>Es.</hi> 30. 7. their strength is to sit still, speaking of some, and <hi>vers.</hi> 15. of that <hi>chap.</hi> In rest shall yee be saved, in quietnesse and confidence shall be your strength, that is, in a silent waiting upon God: if God cals upon some to goe, yet no doubt but he commands others to stay, <hi>Esa.</hi> 26. 20. and as we judge not but some may beleeve that make haste to be gone, so let none censure but some may beleeve that make not such haste, for surely this is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase, <hi>He that beleeveth maketh not haste, Es.</hi> 28. 16. A beleever may with quietnesse sit still, were the times farre worse then now th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If the godly and wise are able to distinguish of evill times, inabled of God therunto, then we should not slight <note place="margin">Use.</note> their judgements concerning these matters, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent us of it afterward if we do, see <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 10, 11. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>v.</hi> 21. where was an evill time toward, a great tempest, and <hi>Paul</hi> warned them of it, but the Centurion beleeved the owner of the Ship rather then <hi>Paul,</hi> (for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53473:37"/>
commonly indeed of all men Gods Ministers are least beleeved, least credit is given to what they say, for feare of making them too proud, forsooth) but they had as good have heeded what <hi>Paul</hi> said, for I beleeve they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them afterward; for as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels them, If you had harkened to me, you had not gained this harme and losse: and so the Prophets, <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> were never beleeved when they spent their judgements of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and even so still for the most part, peace, peace, is best musicke to the carnall eare, and they that sing that, even when dangers are at the dore, shall be applauded by many a one; so were <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets; but if a man play <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and speake the truth, and tell the danger that is close by, then cast him into the prison-house, lay him by the heeles, feed him with the bread and water of affliction: But how ever men take the thing, yet God likes it well, for we may observe, though he often in his word finds fault with the Prophets for preaching smooth things, for crying peace, yet never for preaching his lawes and judgements, never for foretelling dangers.</p>
                  <p>And yet here too, though the godly are able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish of evill times, I doe not say, all that talke of evill times must needs be godly, for many are alwayes complaining of the badnesse of the times, wherein them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves live, and never any saw such bad times as they, though indeed they will not be known, that themselves, and such as they be, doe make them so bad as they are, they whisper and backbite, and slander, and persecute with all bitternesse in their way with their tongues, and so move and provoke others to crosse their minds an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way with their power: they will speake evill of dignities, of men in place and authority; And authority cannot abide to come under the lash of inferiour tongues, nor is it fit it should; if it doth, it will make them smart
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53473:38"/>
another way, and complaine for somewhat, as the Master will the servant, and the Father the child that speakes against him: Authority supposes (and well may) if men murmure against it, that they dislike of it, that they would not it should rule over them, and therefore it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts such as enemies unto it, and deales with them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as with such: you know the saying in the Gospel, <hi>Those mine enemies that would not I should raigne over them, bring them and slay them before me;</hi> and so then comes evill times, but of mens owne occasioning: Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority cannot abide to be forced if things be amisse, it cannot indure to be as it were compelled by the excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of any to amend them; it loves to be free, and to shew its owne goodnesse, which it will rather doe, through an humble seeking of redresse, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n by a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert finding of fault that things are not redressed: Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is suspitious, that men goe about to get to themselves those things which belongs to it, namely the hearts and affections of people, and an opinion of singular pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yea, of more zeale and piety and care for the safety of Church and Common-wealth, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>n Authority her selfe which sits at the sterne of both, thus I say Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority suspects, and well may, from those bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and loud out-cries, which many make of the evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the present times: Now I say (Brethren) all that thus complaine, are not the wisest men in so doing, how ever they thinke themselves, nor perhaps the most truly zealous, for true zeale is joyned with prudence, and it is not bitter; and were the times as bad as they pretend, why the prudent would be silent in them, and not tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kative, which is the third thing noted from the text, to which we now come.</p>
                  <p>It is the property of wise and godly men, and their custome in evill times to keepe silence, to say little, to <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53473:38"/>
bind their tongues to their good behaviour.</p>
                  <p>But before we prove the point, we must distinguish of wise and godly men, some are publike persons, and some are private, the publike are Magistrates and Ministers, I say not that it is their custome being godly and wise to <hi>keep silence in evill times,</hi> especially when they are in the discarge of their office, for the Magistrate, if he be right, will speake then in speciall, and doe too, for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of evill; and the Minister being a Watchman set as it were on a hill to give warning will so doe, both of the evill present, and of the danger comming; if he be of the true stamp; he neither will nor must spare to speak, though not his owne words, yet the words of God, out of Gods booke, in a discreet way, with due respect to those above him, that no disaffection by his meanes be wrought in mens hearts towards them, their persons or places: this I say he will doe, if wise and godly, when he is in place, I meane in the discharge of his office; though at other times and seasons, he be as a private man, and like such a one at such times demeanes himselfe; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of such I suppose the Prophet here speakes, of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, underlings as I may so call them, such as are liable to be afflicted by the mighty and turned from their right; for if you marke the former verse he there speakes of such so abused, the just afflicted, bribes taken against them, and the poore turned from their right in the gate, then he addes this verse of the text, and brings it in with an illative <hi>(therefore,)</hi> which notes a dependance, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall the prudent keepe silence in that time, for it is an evill time, (id est)</hi> those just ones so afflicted, those poore ones so oppressed, that have prudence in them, <hi>shall keepe silence in that time,</hi> that <hi>evill time,</hi> they shall poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket up the wrong, they shall goe their way and say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, binding their tongues to their good behaviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53473:39"/>
So you see the words are chiefely meant of private men, such as you here be, of which ranke and order no doubt but there be some that be godly and wise as well as of others; I say it is their custome, nay it is the condition (Brethren) if you be wise and godly, in evill times to <hi>keep silence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>silence</hi> is a token of wisdome <hi>Solomon</hi> affirmes in many places, take one or two for many, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 27, 28. <hi>He that hath knowledge is sparing in his words; Et frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus spiritu vir est intelligentiae,</hi> and a man of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is of a coole spirit; in the midst of provocations he can temper himselfe: nay, <hi>silence</hi> is such a token of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that even a foole when he holds his peace is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wise, and he that shuts his lips is a man of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>vers.</hi> the next: so <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>He that is voyd of wisdome despiseth his neighbour,</hi> that is, when he sees any thing in him that dislikes him, he is ful of his despightfull words against him, <hi>but a man of understanding holds his peace,</hi> a wise man is not clamorous, that is the meaning, and so <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 16. <hi>A fooles wrath is presently knowne,</hi> if he sees any thing that he mislikes, either in Church or Common-wealth, or among his neighbours, every body shall know it presently, and his dislike thereof; <hi>but a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man covereth shame,</hi> he sees more then he would have others see, and rather hides, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>n reveales the same, and therefore with <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet</hi> shall heire the blessing, when the prating foole like <hi>Cham,</hi> shall fall into the curse: so <hi>vers.</hi> 23. of that <hi>chap. A prudent man concealeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> what himselfe knowes, the knowledge of which would doe others no good, he concealeth, he loves not to teach or discover that to others, which might breed any disaffections against others, <hi>but the heart of fooles proclaimes foolishnesse,</hi> not onely what a foole sees, but also what his foolish heart conceives, and as it interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53473:39"/>
so he speaketh, yea, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>hee rageth and is confident,</hi> he rageth against those that himself dislikes, &amp; is confident that his raging will mend the matter, wherin he shewes himselfe but a starke foole, for as it is there in the verse, <hi>the prudent and wise man feareth, and departeth from evill,</hi> he feareth that his opposing will doe no good, while things be in their heat, and therefore departs from the evill, quietly rests, and confidently expects an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Gods hand.</p>
                  <p>Will you see examples of wisdome expressed by <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?</hi> it was the best point of wisdome that ever King <hi>Saul</hi> shewed, to hold his peace, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27. when some despised him; things being at an uncertaine stay, if hee had vented his distast at that time, and given ill language, he had done himselfe and his cause much hurt; but saies the text, he held his peace: Yea, but you will say, <hi>Saul</hi> was none of the best men, this might be but worldly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in him; the point is of those that be godly and wise.</p>
                  <p>Why then thinke upon <hi>David,</hi> he was both wise and good, you may see by his expressions, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 12. that the times were ill with him, and you may see his silent behaviour then, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. 14. So when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed at him, not a word spake he, but with patient silence put up all, the time for the present was ill with him, he was forced to flie the Kingdome, and therefore no time as he thought to revenge or right himselfe so much as by words. So <hi>Moses,</hi> that meeke, wise, and godly man, when he was among those mutinous people in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, in respect of whose conditions the times were evill with him, and dangerous, for sometime they talke of stoning him, sometime of turning him out of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it is noted that he was meek and silent, he said little, though they urged him much: So in the dayes of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> that good King, when times were very evill in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

of the neerenesse of judgements, when <hi>Senacheribs</hi> army compassed about the City, and <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> railed and blasphemed so egregiously, that it made their very eares glow to heare him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. yet the text saies, <hi>vers.</hi> 36. that the people held their peace, and the King had so commanded: nay, the example of all examples, that of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ confirmes the same, he in the time of his sufferings, those evill times when they urged him, and provoked him exceedingly, by their false accusations for to speake, yet the text saies,, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 63.

                  </p>
                  <p>Because they are godly, and so look upon evill times, as punishments for their owne proper finnes, they are <note place="margin">

conscious that they have not walked so even with God in prosperous dayes as they should have done, they did not make good use of their time of visitation, and therefore these evill times are come over them, and they are fallen into them, (as it is said to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 44. <hi>They shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee, &amp;c. because thou knewest not the day of thy visitation:)</hi> And so they suffering as they conceive for their sinne, their owne sinne, (for they look not so much on others, as on their owne) are silent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods hand, as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 39. <hi>I was dumbe and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not my mouth, because thou didst it,</hi> and the Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>I will beare the indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have sinned against him,</hi> and that is the first Reason, because they are godly.</p>
                  <p>The second is, because they are wise: and so see that <note place="margin">2.</note> speaking may doe more hurt; when men are hot in their way, opposing words do but increase the heat, and stir up the fire, and makes it burne the more; when fire beginnes to kindle in a barne of straw, the way to extinguish it, is not to kicke the sparkes about: the Pope hath often since the time (I beleeve) beshrewed himselfe for doing so: for when <hi>Luther</hi> beganne to kindle the good sire in <hi>Germany,</hi> then hee began to stirre, to prate, to curse, to kicke the fire about, and that did but increase it against it selfe, as (God be thanked) he hath found since to his owne cost: why so it is in this case, even with the fire of evill, when once kindled, the more it is stirred by the tongue, and blowne with the blast and wind of words, the more it flames and burnes to the hurt of the good and godly: which the <hi>prudent</hi> considering, neither will nor dare be otherwise th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The third is, because they are both wise and godly: and so know that by their silence they shall the sooner <note place="margin">3.</note> move the Lord to their helpe, to remove the evill, and to amend the times; Did not the Lord, thinke you, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the sooner in the behalfe of <hi>Moses,</hi> when they so moyled against him, even for his meeknesse and silence? and so did not the Lord presently appeare for the helpe of his people in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time, when they were silent, and <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> railed so? and so for <hi>Saul</hi> himselfe, did not God reward his wisdome and patience, in holding his peace, by giving him occasion to shew his valour in the next <hi>chap.</hi> and by giving him glory in the sight of them that despised him? and so <hi>David,</hi> did not he fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that very day, for his patience and silence at <hi>Shimeies</hi> railing? and in <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. when he had said, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>I was as a deafe man and hcard not (viz.</hi> the mischievous things which some spake against him, who laid wait for his life, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.) <hi>and I was as a dumbe man that opened not his mouth, &amp;c.</hi> he addes in the 15. <hi>vers. for in thee O Lord doe I hope, thou wilt heare or answer for me O Lord my God;</hi> as if he had said; my silence will make thee both heare and speake for me, my not answering for my selfe, will move thee and set thee a worke to answer for me: for indeed none that are wise will speake, while an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man is a speaking: God is a wise God, and if wee speake in our owne cause, he will not, but when we have done, when we are silent, then the Lord opens his mouth, or lifts up his hand, or something he doth for us: Thus you see the Reasons, we come to the Use.</p>

                  <p>But (Brethren) I know in these times to reprove these conditions, is for a man to make himselfe liable to condemnation for speaking Paradoxes, contrary to the minds and judgements, and practice of godly Professors. Indeed I know that truths are often Paradoxes to vulgar ears, &amp; that the tongues of some Professors are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est travellers; as their words are most blasting, &amp; give the deepest and the deadliest wounds, so they are most foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in evill times, and may often be farthest heard: yea, but I know it becomes Gods ministers to be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53473:42"/>
to reveale Gods whole counsell, and to tell Gods children of their faults as well as others, although wee fare the worser at their hands for it; as Christ did for the same cause at the hands of some that called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Gods children: to be sure God will not spare to punish his children for their faults as well as others, nay, them in speciall, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. and his Ministers must bee imitaters of him, and therefore must reprove his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when, or for wherein they doe amisse, as well as they doe others; yea, them in speciall: but concerning this particular I say no more then I am sure the text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres: were the times as evill as some say, yet they doe not as they ought to doe, for it is the part of wise and good men rather to be silent then talkative in them: And for the sufficient confirmation of this truth, I desire it may be remembred, that Christ overcame all evils, all evill men, all his opposers by his sufferings, to teach sure, that God hath ordained silent and patient suffering, which is the naturall effect of faith and selfe-deniall, to be the proper meane for Christians to overcome evill withall, and to wade through evill times withall; in their patience they may possesse their soules; yea, and get possession of the soules of others too, when they can no way else, God will blesse this course with a good successe when he will no other: and so much for the first sort.</p>
                  <p>The second sort that are reproved, are they that goe a degree further then the former, and are so far from pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising <note place="margin">2.</note> silence themselves, or from being of the Prophets mind, to account them that keepe silence in evill times, to be wise and godly, that they thinke them the only fooles, time-servers, persons to be suspected to be rotten at the core, that doe it, or perswade unto it; if any man hath more wisdome then themselves, and walkes more reservedly, and more silently, and hath a better command
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53473:43"/>
of his tongue then they, at such times as talking may doe hurt, why he is naught surely, one not to be trusted, a sider with the evils of the times, one that wants zeale and mettle, not worthy of any account or regard: though perhaps in the conclusion he may approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the wisest man.</p>
                  <p>We read in <hi>Livie</hi> of one <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> as wise and as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant a man as the world did then afford, yet living in evil times, in the <hi>Tarquius</hi> dayes, he concealed his worth under the cloak of base contempt, &amp; was content to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a foole for a season, till such due &amp; convenient time as occasion was offered, for his wisdome and courage to appeare: it was that <hi>Brutus</hi> which offered to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> a golden rod in a woodden staffe made hollow for that purpose, which was a type of his one naturall disposition: And no doubt but even now, some that are of meane account among others might be signified by a like resemblance, they are gold within, though wood without, though counted fooles, timerous, and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers, yet such in truth as are more wise, and more couragious, and lesse corrupt then those that judge them, they are content that what is in them, should lie hid till fitting and convenient times: it is the Apostles word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. A man must become a fool (that is) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be so accounted, that he may be wise, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in fit time, for God and for himselfe: and saies the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the next <hi>chap.</hi> to those vaine-glorious <hi>Corinthians</hi> that he speaks to: We (namely the Apostles) are fooles for Christs sake, <hi>viz.</hi> so accounted; but you are wise, that is, you are counted the wiser men; and I warrant you it was because they did talk more, for these <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were great talkers and great censurers of other men, and the common sort doe use to judge such the wisest, much wisdome and many words are unseparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as they suppose.</p>

Well, but let others thinke as they please, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here is of opinion, that the greatest talkers are not the wisest men: yea, but shall not losers have leave to speake (say some?) truly there were some reason they should, if thereby they could mend themselves, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of any loser that by bitter speeches recovered his losses: therefore to close this point, be you so farre from thinking evill of those that are sparing of speech in evill times, that rather doe you studie to be like them, for according to the next point, <hi>silence</hi> is best and most safe then, to which we are now come.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First it is best: because it is the practise of wise men, and they know what is best.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it hath been the practice of Saints, as hath been shewed, as in <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Shimeies</hi> case, andof <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> when he had that foule imputation laid upon him in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by his Mistris, when it was <hi>an ill time</hi> to be sure with him, but he was silent, he thought it best and most safe, he stood not upon his own justification in a wording way, though he might have done, he knew the Lord could doe it better, as he did in the end, cause his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to appeare as the light, and his innocency as the noone day for clearenesse: so the Church in <hi>Babylon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a lamentable condition, sat weeping silently and alone, by the rivers there, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. not wording or taunting at those that carried her away into captivity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is best, because hereby we imitate God and Christ, but Jesus held his peace as was shewed before, and <hi>Esay</hi> 42. 14. <hi>I have a long time held my peace</hi> (saies God) <hi>I have beene still and refrained my selfe.</hi>

                  <p>Fifthly, it is best, because God hath commanded in such times so to doe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Commune with y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And sixthly, it is best, because it is a meane to worke out the righteousnesse of God, to make the same and his power manifest, for if the wrath of man, which (for the most part) is expressed by wording worketh not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ighteousnesse of God, as Saint <hi>James</hi> saies, <hi>James</hi> 3. 6. then patient and silent bearing and forbearing may be available to effect this by the rule of contraries.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see <hi>silence</hi> is best, and as it is best, or because so therefore it is most safe: it will keep a man from wrath &amp; from a greater measure thereof, from wrath in his own breast, from a greater measure thereof upon his back (as I may say) for grievous words stirre up anger, namely on all sides, but <hi>silence</hi> and softnesse of speech appeaseth strife.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is most safe, for it will not on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, it is most safe, for it is a meane to procure long life and many good dayes; the spirit of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. propounds silence and government of the tongue as Physicke for the purpose.</p>
                  <p>And fourthly, if a man be silent in evill times, fewer advantages will be catched against him, then will be by speaking, and so it is safer: more reasons might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, but let these serve.</p>
                  <p>Now if you aske why I call evill times, times when prayers and teares are more needfull; I answer, because prayers and teares are most needfull then for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the evill of the times; and further, that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>an evill time</hi> in the text, is intimated to be a time of weeping and wailing, or a time for weeping and wailing, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. so they are called then, by the Prophet.</p>
                  <p>And in the conclusion, if any would know what kind of sinnes in speciall make the times more evill and more deplorable, I shall referre him to read over this <hi>chap.</hi> of the text, and in it he shall finde the Prophet noting three or foure in especiall, which made him make this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the text, that the time was evill, and no doubt but such sinnes whensoever they raigne doe make the time alwayes so.</p>

In the Prophets opinion, these are the sinnes that note evill times; to which let me adde but one more, and that is lying at the catch, lying in wait to mistake

words, to bring a man into trouble for a word speaking, let me speake in the Prophet <hi>Esaies</hi> words, <hi>Esa.</hi> 29. 21. where he speakes indeed of the judgement that was come upon such kind of sinners, the terrible one, the scorner, and al that watch for iniquity are cut off; that make a man (saies he) an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turne aside the just for a thing of naught: so it hath beene you see, and so it is still sometimes; a man when he is oppressed shall not speake a word of his owne wrong, but he is liable to be brought into trouble for it; an honest Minister shall not preach in any place, but he shall have one knave or other lie in wait to catch him, and on purpose to mistake him, as they did our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 54. they were evill times our Saviour lived in, and so sure are all such as are like them: and therefore people had need be watchfull over their tongues in such times, and speake no more then needs must: for such times are rather times for teares and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: yea, to be bewailed if possible with teares of bloud: Teares and wailing will move the Lord (who onely is able) to helpe his people that are afflicted. For indeed the Prophet having said in the latter end of the 15. v. that the Lord of Hoasts it may be will be gratious to the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his people; he addes in the 16. <hi>vers.</hi> as a meane to move him; therefore the Lord, the God of hoasts, the Lord saith thus, Wailing shall be in all streets, and they shall say in all high-wayes, Alas, Alas; as if he should say, if you would have me the Lord of Hoasts to appear gratious in your behalf, you must use weeping and wailing, you must cry Alas, Alas; I am pitifull, and that will move my pitifull nature; for the oppression of the poore, for the sighing of the needy, <hi>I will up saith the Lord, and set him at liberty from him that puffeth at him, Psal.</hi> 12. 5.</p>

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53473:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Well, to make an end, you have seene (in briefe) some of the signes of evill times noted by the prophet: and as I said at first, so I say againe; I will not put my selfe to be a publike Judge of those wherein we live, to say whether they be evill or no: I say but this, if they be, or whensoever they be, every honest man (no doubt) shall finde it by experience, he shall be catched at, he shall be oppressed, he shall be wronged, hee shall be hated for finding fault at the evils committed, and he may to <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> be an Idolater (at least) if he will, he shall have leave given him, and so forth, but I pray God give every honest man in such times, wisdome to hold his peace, and patience to suffer, and <hi>gratiam Lachrymarum</hi> as the Fathers call it, the grace to weepe, that his heart may bleed, and his eyes may runne faster then his tongue; and how evill soever the times shall then be for the present, yet in the end they will be good for him.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my course here the last yeare, I discoursed of <hi>Silence,</hi> and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that to your observance. I shall now through Gods help speake of its mother grace, namely of <hi>Patience,</hi> and commend that also unto your practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Methodus est duplex,</hi> there is a two-fold method: one from the cause to the effect, and another from the effect to the cause; you see we have followed the latter, which as we count, is <hi>(quoad nos)</hi> more sutable to vulgar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53473:48"/>
though perhaps in a case or subject of this nature, the former first had been the better: for can the streame be sweet, you will say, while the fountaine is bitter? you should first have cast the salt in here, indeavour to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the heart with some graines of <hi>Patience,</hi> and then with hope of better successe you might have perswaded the tongue to silence: Well, be it so: yet now we are in, we must proceed in our owne way.</p>
                  <p>For the coherence of these words read: you may see in the preceding verses, our Saviour speakes of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times, which in his judgement would be but evill, in respect both of the sinnes and sorrowes which they would bring forth.</p>
                  <p>The sinnes: or at least the maine one, which alwayes brings many after it, he notes <hi>vers.</hi> 8. of the <hi>chap.</hi> to be corruption of judgement; there should be deceivers and false teachers who should teach erroneous things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ and his presence: compare but that verse with its parallel in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 23, 24. and it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto you: and this they shall doe in his name; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon them as if they were Christ himselfe, and had authority to command the conscience, which is peculiar onely to him to doe.</p>
                  <p>Then the sorrowes, they are of two kinds, Nationall, and Personall; Nationall or more Generall, which should be common to people of all sorts, good and bad, tagge and ragge (as they say) all should be sensible of them, and these are <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10, 11. warres, seditions, insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nation against Nation, Kingdome against King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Earthquakes in some Countries, hunger, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rfull things in others.</p>
                  <p>The personall sorrowes are they that would in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular befall the Church and flock of Christ: which hee mentions <hi>vers.</hi> 12. as causes of those generall ones fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53473:48"/>
and they would be violent apprehensions, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, imprisonments, and arraignments before Kings and Rulers, for Christs name sake, that is, for his truth and religion sake: because they will not forsake that, for the perswasions and compulsions of the forementioned deceivers, and then to <hi>vers.</hi> 16. 17. he reckons up more of this sort, namely, treacheries of friends, of kindred and acquaintance, and hatred at all mens hands for the same cause.</p>
                  <p>Now against these errours and erroneous men, and also against these troubles and sorrowes our Saviour doth fore-arme his people, by his fore-warning them of the same, his promonitions he would have to be their premunitions: as <hi>John</hi> 16. 3, 4. <hi>These things have I told you, that when they come to passe, you may remember that I told you:</hi> namely, to this end, that you might not then bee much moved at them; as the Apostle in a like case, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 3, 4. I would not have you moved by these afflictions, for you know we were appointed to them: faithfull Ministers it seemes are appointed and ordained to suffer as well as to preach, (even as faithfull Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are, as well as to beleeve) and this yee know (saies <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29.</note> he) how did they know? why, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it was the manner of Christ and his Apostle you see to foretell the sowre as well as the sweet, the hardship as well as the comfort of Christianity: yea, and the sweet as well as the sowre, the comfort as well as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. <hi>in the world yee shall have trouble,</hi> (there is the sowre) <hi>but in me yee shall have peace,</hi> (there is the sweet) and in this <hi>chap.</hi> of the text he doth not onely tell them of the dolorous times, as hath been mentioned, but he doth also strengthen them against the same with the sweet promise of his assistance, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. 15. and of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53473:49"/>
his protection and preservation, <hi>vers.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>But withall he tels them in the text, of one thing that they must see unto, and that is that they be patient, they must not be malicious or revengeful, they must not plot or prate, they must not slander or provoke, they must not vex nor trouble themselves in any sort, onely let him alone to doe all, be they still, and say no more then he shall put into their mouthes, when they are called in <hi>coram,</hi> and he will keepe them well enough from all harme-taking: when they are judged or abused, not the value of a haires dammage shall their soules sustaine; let them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but rest in patience: In a word, as <hi>Moses</hi> the man of God said to his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13. <hi>Feare not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord,</hi> so saies Christ the sonne of God and our good Shepheard unto us, Feare yee not, be but still, patient, and quiet, and you shall see what salvation the Lord alone will worke for you.</p>
                  <p>Nay, moreover you shall hereby keepe your selves in possession of that which all your enemies aime chiefely to deprive you of, and that is your soules: your soule indeed is the prize they strive for, both by their cunning and by their cruelty, that is the <hi>Helena</hi> of their aimes, Satan and his servants desire above all things to have mens soules and consciences at their command: but saies Christ, you shall keepe them out of their hands by this one meane I tell you of: namely, by your patience: and the truth is, the adversaries are in a wrong box: the way to get soules is not that which they take; violence and struggling, opposing and contesting, bearing downe things with a strong hand, is the way to get possession of goods and bodies, but not of hearts and spirits, not of soules; it is the way to lose them, both their owne and others: the onely way to get possession of hearts and soules is patience, bearing and forbearing: this way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53473:49"/>
Christ kept possession of his owne, and got the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of all ours: and this way the blessed Martyrs kept their owne, and got the hearts of many to their religion, where of <hi>Justin</hi> Martyr professeth himselfe to be one, the patience of the Christians wanne his heart to them and their religion: yea, many persecutors themselves have beene taken this way: to be sure of this, every one may get and keepe the possession of, and the command over his owne soule, by this vertue and grace of patience: and this chiefely the text teacheth: <hi>By your patience possesse yee your soules:</hi> your owne soules: and so you have the context.</p>

                  <p>We will first speak of the purchase, then of the price: first what you shall have, then what you must pay; for in point of purchase, you will all know for what, before you will part with your money.</p>
                  <p>Truly the purchase is exceeding great, specially if compared with the price, it is as if the whole world should be compared to an halfe-peny: you have heard of Merchants, that for glasses, pins, and small hookes, things of little value, have bought of the Indians, gold, pearles, and precious stones: such a bargaine, nay, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is here offered you; What are tribulations, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which you must shew your patience, but as brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle glasses for short continuance, but as the prickings of a pinne for paine, but as small hookes, by which God puls us to himselfe, with a little sma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ting? and what is that you shall get by induring the same? why, your soules possession here, and a possession for your soules hereafter, the worth of either which doth exceed mans heart to conceive, or his tongue to expresse: our text speakes but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53473:50"/>
of the one, and of that onely must we speake, though we can never speake the worth of it: I meane of the soule, either in respect of its Author, its nature, or resemblance: the truth is, as one saies of Christ, the Redeemer of the soule, that he had divers names, as Jesus, Emanuel, Christ, Messias, Lord, &amp;c. because no one name was enough to expresse all his perfections: so may it be said of the soule which he redeemed, one name alone cannot intimate to us all its excellencies, and therefore it hath divers names: as <hi>Isiodore</hi> well, <hi>dum corpus vivificat anima est, dum vult animus, dum scit mens, dum recolit memoria, dum judicat ratio, &amp;c.</hi> in respect of its quickning power it is called the life, in respect of its desire the will, of its knowledge the mind, of its recordation the memory, of its judgement the reason, &amp;c. Indeed (me thinkes) our Saviours monition here to look to that, and to that only doth exceedingly set forth the excellencie of it, above all things else: and that shall be the Doctrine from this first part, even in these words:
<q>
                        <p>The soule above all things is to be cared for, to bee looked after.</p> 
                        <note place="margin">

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is onely <hi>possidete animas vestras:</hi> it is not <hi>vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las vestras,</hi> as <hi>August.</hi> notes: your villages, your houses and lands, your wealth and riches, for it had beene vaine to have advised to this, in times of trouble and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when such things are sure to goe to wracke: nor indeed had it beene worth the while to have looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such things, specially then; for what are they? <hi>nec ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, nec vestra,</hi> saies <hi>Bernard,</hi> neither true goods, for they bide not by you, nor your owne, for you cannot carry them away with you: and had he advised to the keeping of these, he would not have prescribed <hi>patience</hi> as the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53473:50"/>
meane: for that is the way rather to lose all; he should have said rather, bestirre your selves, put up no wrong, one injury will draw on another, talke and prate, scold and raile, lye and sweare, tugge and pull, (for this is the course that men commonly take to get and keepe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.)</p>
                  <p>Nor doth he say, <hi>possidete honores vestros:</hi> looke to your Honours, your Credits, your good esteeme, see you lose not an inch of that, for he knew that this was not in their owne hands to keepe, <hi>Honor est honorantis, non honorati;</hi> it is in the mouth of the people, and what is <hi>Vox populi?</hi> Why, <hi>Hosanna</hi> to day, and <hi>Crucifige</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? even honest mens credits are often forced to lodge upon the tongue of Knaves: and beside our Saviour knew also there was not so much need to advise to be carefull of this, for he foresaw that too too many, that would professe his name, would be more carefull of their credit, then they would be of their Conscience, yea they would be religious to no other purpose, and weare the Hood of Profession to no other end, but to get them a good esteeme among men.</p>
                  <p>Nor thirdly, tis not <hi>possidete amicos vestros,</hi> keepe your Friends, lose not the love of them however, for he knew that friends were slippery ware, and to keepe them, was more then could be done with a good conscience, as the world was like to goe with them, in those succeeding dayes, when one friend and brother would betray ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to death: unlesse they would resolve to humour them at all turnes, never contradict them, or reprove them, doe they, or speake they never so crossely: never speake against those faults which the world notes them to be guilty of: for example, if they be noted to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, slanderers, backe-biters, whisperers, censurers, evill speakers of Rulers, Governours, men of place and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53473:51"/>
why, never find fault with them for these things, never alleadge Scripture against these conditions, but rather animate them in their way, commend their zeale, and against Gods word and conscience, bee as they bee, and doe as they doe, or else no possibility of keeping them.</p>
                  <p>Nor fourthly, it is not <hi>possidete opiniones vestras,</hi> hold your opinions, sticke close to your owne fancies what ever reasons shall be brought against them, <hi>etiamsi sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, non persuadent tamen,</hi> though you be convinced never so, yet be sure you hold your owne, be resolute, for he knew indeed that men without bidding many of them, would hold faster their opinions then the faith it selfe, yea rather then they should sinke, they care not though religion and peace and all goe to wracke, they will turne every stone, but their owne conceits shall take place.</p>
                  <p>Nor fifthly it is not <hi>possidete delicias vestras,</hi> your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, your pleasures, see you abate not your selves of them, whatsoever plagues, and judgements, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and troubles come amongst you, follow your sports and pastimes, your feasts and pleasures still. Nor lastly, it is not <hi>corpora vestra,</hi> your bodies, looke well to them that they pine not, see they lie soft, and be well fed, drinke good store of Sacke and Sagar, that your bodies may looke plump and faire and fat, and be in good liking for all your troubles: No (Brethren) here is not a word of any of all these things, here is onely <hi>possidete animas vestras,</hi> looke to your soules, either because he fore-saw men were apt to be more carelesse of them then of other things, and so needed to be called upon, or else to teach them according to the doctrine, that your soule above all things is to be cared for, to be looked after.</p>
                  <p>And so it is, by reason of its excellencie above all things which you may take a glimpse of, from these three

                  <p>Secondly, consider how he that best knew, yea that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew the worth of a soule: for the truth is, no meere man while he is in his mortall condition is able to set a true value upon the soule, or to esteeme of it according to its worth; but he onely that paid the price for it, the Lord Jesus; he alone knew the worth of it: and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he preferres it above all the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>What will it profit a man to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How farre beside themselves then are they that make but little or no account of it? some there are that will scarce beleeve they have any soules at all, because they never saw them, for they are resolved to beleeve no more then they see, and they have the same opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God: indeed they thereby sufficiently declare, that their soules serve them onely in stead of Salt to keep their bodies from stinking.</p>

                  <p>And a third sort there is, that though perhaps they may beleeve that they have soules, yet they thinke them not worthy above all things to be cared for, their wealth shall have the upper hand, sixe whole dayes shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be imployed about that, and not one without grudging about the soule: I warrant if I should hold you two houres now in dispensing among you provisions for the soule, there would be more maundering, and it would irk some more, then if they should spend ten houres in some shop about their worldly imployments: and I pray what cheating, what couzening, what lying, what swearing, what injustice, what oppressing to get wealth and riches is every where practised? and (for Gods sake) what doth all this prove, but that men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the world before their soules?</p>
                  <p>And so for friends, will not too too many hazzard their soules to get or keepe the favour of them, of some rich worldly man, whom they hope may be a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to them? wil they not be ready to say what he would have them, yea, and perhaps to sweare to it too? And for credit, doth not many stand more upon that, then upon their soules safety: to have a name for great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, great professors; great gifted men, to be esteemed the holy ones <hi>(sans pere)</hi> without parallell; then to be truly gracious, humble, sincere, and secretly upright with God? I would they did not, for then we should not heare such vaunting bragges, nor see such wilfull uneven walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as sometime in private we doe, and in deed, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to name, because they would be thought incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; they being the conditions of some of them that are most famous for good.</p>

                  <p>Now alas, what simple men are these, that are thus all for the body, and (as I may say) thus nothing for the soule? Should a man have two children, the eldest a lusty, beautifull, hopefull, well-mannered child, likely to live

many a yeare: and the younger, a sickly, lame, crooked, unwholsome, leaprous, and ill conditioned thing, and foolish withall, and not like to live a yeare to an end: if the father should bestow all his care, to provide for the younger and sickly child, tie all his estate upon that, and doe onely for it, and take no care for the elder, which is the more lusty and lively, and likely to live, you would count him very unvise and foolish: why, this is the case of these men, the body is the sickly child, that shall die to morrow, which they take so much care for, and the soule the healthfull child that shall live for ever, which is not regarded.</p>
                  <p>Nay further: what doe I talke of riches, and friends, and credit, and opinions, and bodies, how many are there in the world, that set their soules below their sinnes? to satisfie a lust, suppose of malice, of pride, of revenge, what care they if they damne their soules, nay even to vexe and grieve the spirit of another? we thinke them fooles and mad, at least worthy of scorne, that to vexe another, will eate no victuals, or will hang or drowne themselves, as some sullen wives (to anger their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands) will sometime offer and threaten to doe, though before they doe it indeed, they will be better advised: But more mad are they, that to vexe and grieve another, will destroy their owne soules by running headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such and such courses, as are unlawfull, onely because they are by their friends or Minister perswaded to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the Minister, let him speake against their sinnes in the behalfe of their soules, what will they say, but hee speakes against them? and so make sinne and themselves all one, so dearely are they devoted to their sinnes: as <hi>Ahab</hi> said of <hi>Micaiah, he speakes no good of me,</hi> I dare say the honest Prophet never spake word of ill against

him all dayes of his life, he was his Prince and Ruler, and his conscience would not suffer him to speake ill of the Ruler of the people: He preached against his sinnes it may be sometime, when he preached before him: why that is all one (saies <hi>Ahab)</hi> touch my sinne touch me.</p>
                  <p>Why, so it is with many now, let a man speake against their sinnes, suppose it be the sinnes of slandering, railing, backbiting, whispering, or hypocrisie: why, he preaches against us, will some say: nay, they will adde further, he preaches against Gods children, as if Gods children were all guilty of such conditions, and as if they could not abide to be told of their faults any more then the wicked; but like them, did make sinne all one with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: (sweet creatures doe they make Gods children in the meane time, and an ill Father doe they make God, that can or will breed his children no better) doubtlesse they that are truly Gods, are willingly or wittingly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of no such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Those that be truly godly conceive that it is not so much the Ministers preaching against such and such sins, that makes carnall people judge so amisse of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as they doe; but rather it is the lives of hypocrites that call themselves Gods children, and their application of suchthings when they are spoken to themselves<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods children, their pepper taking at them: those that be truly godly conceive that of all others, Gods children

                  <p>The coyne <hi>patience</hi> is of two sorts, in the one is <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> Image, in the other is the Image of Christ: the one was in use among the Merchants of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Heathens and Gentiles, but the other onely among the Merchants of <hi>Israel:</hi> that former which they had, was not of like value with this latter; it carryed with it the like <hi>poena,</hi> it was <hi>circa res adversas,</hi> but not the like price, it was not seconded with the like hope, because not alike grounded upon precious promises, nor exercised to a like end, in obedience to God, nor was it from the same principle, for it was the fruit onely of well-ordered nature, and not of grace: as the Sooth sayers of <hi>Egypt</hi> could do the like miracles that <hi>Moses</hi> did, but not by the same spirit and power as he; so the Heathens could suffer many such affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as Christians doe with a like strength, but not with the same comfort, <hi>multa tulerunt animo forti, nulla tamen s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the <hi>patience</hi> which we intend, it is a divine grace wrought in mans heart by Gods spirit, whereby a man in obedience to Gods command, in expectance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and in consideration of his power and providence over all, his wisdome and goodnesse in all, doth meekly beare and quietly suffer all, the bitter of sowre, that doth befall him, or that is unjustly offered him, how grievous and har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But further you must note that <hi>patience</hi> in Scripture is also called long-suffering, though some distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two, and say the one signifies bearing, and the other for-bearing; bearing when we cannot revenge, for-bearing when we can, but doe not: <hi>Aretius</hi> also saies, the one is <hi>circa graviora pericula,</hi> about greater evils, and the other <hi>circa leviora,</hi> about lesser: but I here understand <hi>Patience</hi> to signifie both the one and the other, bearing and for-bearing, both the greater and the lesse wrongs; even wrongs of all sorts: and I say, this <hi>Patience</hi> is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of great consequence, and a grace most needfull for a Christian.</p>

1. That it is a vertue of great consequence, I prove thus:</p>
                  <p>First, that must needs be a vertue of great consequence, which to obtaine, a man should not onely be content, but also exceeding glad to fall into many miseries, into divers temptations: But such is <hi>Patience, James</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>v.</hi> Brethren, be exceeding glad when yee fall into divers temptations, knowing that such trials worke patience: therefore it is a vertue of great consequence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that must needs be a ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>tue of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, which being obtained, makes a man perfect, intire, and to want nothing: But such is <hi>Patience: James</hi> 1. 4. Let <hi>Patience</hi> have her perfect worke, that you may be perfect, intire, and wanting nothing: therefore it is a vertue of great consequence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That must needs be a vertue of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which preserves a man from all shame: But such is patience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>Patience</hi> brings forth experience, and hope which ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eth not ashamed: and hee that hath patience discovers not his nakednesse by his passions whereby he might be shamed: therefore it is a vertue of great consequence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is a grace most needfull, it is plaine from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. where it is said, you have need of <hi>Patience,</hi> it is not said, it were well if you had it, or it were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient thing; but you have need of it, you cannot be without it, and why? see there;</p>
                  <p>First, that doing the will of God you may inherit the promises: it seemes you cannot doe the will of God without it, indeed Gods will is done by patient suffering; Not my wil, but thine be done, saies Christ, when he went to suffer; nor as seemes, can we receive the promises without it; see them and touch them we may by faith, but by <hi>Patience</hi> we receive them, inherit and injoy them, for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53473:59"/>
promises are not received so soone as they are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, therefore <hi>patience</hi> is needfull, even as faith; indeed they stand together in the same ranke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. Be yee followers of them, that through faith and <hi>patience</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the promises.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is needfull, because without it a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be fruitfull, though his heart be honest and good: for even such a heart if it brings forth fruit from the Word heard, it must be by <hi>patience, Luke</hi> 8. 15. they that receive the word into an honest and good heart, keepe it, and bring forth fruit with <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is needfull, because our life is a race, and without <hi>patience</hi> we cannot runne it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Let us runne with <hi>patience</hi> the race that is set before us: nor without it, can we receive the reward at the end of it; for <hi>Rev. 2. &amp; 3. chap.</hi> to him that overcommeth, to him that indureth to the end, to him that is patient unto death, shall be given the things there promised, the Crowne, the new name, the white stone, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning starre.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is needfull, because our life, specially our Christianlife: Christianity is a warfare, where the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is gotten, <hi>non feriendo, sed ferendo,</hi> not by giving, but by bearing blowes by <hi>patience.</hi> In the <hi>Olympian,</hi> and so in all worldly combats, the Champion gets the day, and winnes the Garland that bestowes most blowes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Antagonist; but in the warres of the Lord, whose wayes and courses are alwayes contrary unto mans, he beares away the Crowne, and gets the day, that receives most blowes from the hands of his adversaries, and in lieu thereof returnes nought but good workes and words.</p>
                  <p>In a word, shall I tell you what <hi>Tertullian</hi> saies in the praise of <hi>patience,</hi> in his booke of that Subject, which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53473:59"/>
doth notably set forth the excellency &amp; necessity of it: <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem munit</hi> (saies he) <hi>pacem gubernat, dilectionem adjuvat, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatem instruit, &amp;c.</hi> it preserveth faith, it orders peace, it helpeth love, it teacheth humility, it rules the flesh, and serves the spirit, it bridles the tongue, and holds the hands, it treads upon temptations, and perfects martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it selfe, (for it is not suffering, but <hi>patience</hi> in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that pleaseth God) it comforts the poore, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the rich, it easeth the sickly, and maintaines the health, it delighteth the faithfull, it inviteth the unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it commendeth the servant to the Master, and the Master to the Lord, it beautifies a woman, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth esteeme to a man, it is loved in a child, praised in a youth, and honoured in the aged, <hi>in omni sexu, in omni <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But of all arguments, this in the text must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>patience</hi> preserves the soule, namely, from the hands of its enemies, and the peace of it from being broken: and therefore must needs be of that consequence and so needfull as wee say: for the soule is a thing of the greatest consequence in the world, and of which a man hath most need to be carefull: now by <hi>patience</hi> this is preserved and kept safe, for <hi>patience</hi> frustrates all the aimes of Satan, and the wicked against the same: and therefore most craftily doe they indeavour to deprive a man of <hi>patience,</hi> for if he lose this, they know he will lose God, and so in conclusion the soule it selfe: for the enemy knowes well, that as <hi>patience</hi> keepes God in the soule, so impatience thrusts him out. God will not dwell in perturbations: for as he came to <hi>Eliah</hi> in a soft still voyce, so he dwels onely in a quiet and still spirit; In all <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions, what was aimed at, but to breake his <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53473:60"/>
Job</hi> 2. 9. to make him curse God in a mood as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny use to doe; and so should he empty his soule of God and let the Devill in, in his stead, as anger and impatience alwayes doth: and therefore note the Apostles <hi>Caveat, Ephes.</hi> 4. 26, 27. Let not the Sun goe downe upon your wrath, not give place to the Devill: that is to say, if you grow wrathfull and impatient, you let the Devill in, and then farewell the soules possession: he will not so soone give it up againe.</p>
                  <p>And as Satan, so all his servants, in all their opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against Gods people and Ministers, have the same aime to deprive the soule of <hi>patience;</hi> A bad neighbour that comes to his Ministers house on Saturdayes in the afternoone, and there stands barking at his doore, and baying at his window, what can he aime at thereby but to move him unto impatience, to distemper his spirit, and so to unsute him for the doing Gods worke on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? And why are your foul-mouthed people so luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of their malicious foame against any Christian, but for the same cause to make a breach upon their <hi>patience?</hi> it appeares most plaine, for if they cannot prevaile there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but see their words and doings passed over with a carelesse neglect, how above measure are themselves vexed? as I have read of one that hang'd himselfe for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vexation that he could not by his railing speeches move another unto impatience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Patience</hi> indeed unto the soule, is as the lid unto the eye, or as a shield unto the head, it breakes the stroake of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crosse, and keepes the spirit harme-free, it is as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last of the ship, to make it stable, and therefore, <hi>James</hi> 5. 8. be patient, stablish your hearts: a ship well balasted is not easily ore-turned by waves or winds, whereas that which wants the same is tost every way: many will ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>last themselves with wealth, with riches, and friends,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53473:60"/>
but when winds, and stormes, and blowes come, these will not quiet the spirit, and keepe out feares so as <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> will: for he that is balasted, with <hi>patience</hi> how ever the world goes, though the wind blow and the stormes come, though his eares be loaded with revilings, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and reproaches, and his body beaten with stripes and buffets, yet his soule is unwounded, he is not dozed, nor at his wits end, his spirit is not straitned with griefe or feare, nor his faculties tied up, though his passions be; he hath the free command of himselfe and tongue, and lookes and speakes as he was wont to doe; his stomach swels not, his mouth vapours not, his eyes sparkle not, his bloud boyles not, nor doe his fingers itch, or his colour change, he is still the same, onely perhaps looking to Heaven-ward, saies in himselfe, <hi>Christus gravior a tulit,</hi> Christ indured more then this: or, <hi>omnia possum confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante me Christo,</hi> I shall, or I can beare my burden, through the strength of Christ: or, <hi>meliora spero,</hi> I hope better dayes are comming: or, <hi>dabit Deus his quoque fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> this world will not last alwayes.</p>
                  <p>Such is the temper of the soule wherin <hi>patience</hi> dwels, it is like Mount <hi>Sion</hi> which cannot be moved, or like a rocke on the Sea, on all sides disquieted with assaults<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yet still quiet in its scituation: whereas he that wants <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> doth <hi>laniare animam suam furore suo,</hi> as it is, <hi>Job</hi> 18. 4. teare and butcher his owne soule in his rage: whose picture you may see, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 5, 6. for as he there would not be tamed or bound with chaines or fetters, but broak all, and went raving about, and cutting himselfe with stones: so the impatent man being not himselfe, will be kept in with no bonds or ties of God or man, but breaks all to doe himselfe mischiefe; and it is a true saying, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p n="3">3. But there is one particular more in the Doctrine still to be further proved: and that is (to a Christian) it is a grace so needfull to none as to a Christian.</p>
                  <p>For he of all others hath most occasions of vexation: a Christian is a <hi>Crucian,</hi> a man of sorrowes, Christs youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother, he doth not onely take up, but also beare his crosse daily; by faith he takes it up, but by <hi>patience</hi> he beares it: The waters, yea, the bitter waters of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come daily in upon his soule, as <hi>David</hi> speakes, and <hi>patience</hi> is like the tree mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 25. which takes away their bitternesse from them; and therefore of all others to a Christian it is most needfull: and a Christian also is apt to fret and grieve at the occasions and sight of evill, as well as another man; and to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he sees cause, which he is forbidden to doe, as you m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But what are the occasions, you will say, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hath more then others of this nature? I answer, I cannot name them all, no more can any man, onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He hath occasions <hi>ab intra,</hi> and he hath oceasions <hi>ab extra,</hi> to use <hi>patience,</hi> which none else hath.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>ab intra,</hi> from within himselfe: for with many terrours and feares is he assaulted, with many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is he affronted, with many lusts is he haunted, which he apprehends increasing daily, and incroaching further in upon him, to his further paine of sense and feeling; which indeed is but onely in regard of the daily increase of life and light within him, so that his sight and feeling is of more capacity daily: now what supports him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these miseries? the Lord, in whom onely is his help,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53473:61"/>
perhaps hides his face for a season, is as it were gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a farre Countrey, and of the time of his returne, hee is uncertaine; what hath he to uphold him in the meane while, but onely <hi>patience?</hi> so that of all others he hath need of <hi>patience.</hi> I know that others are in a worser case, but because they feele not a like paine, they have not so much need of <hi>patience,</hi> for where is no paine, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need of <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>ab extra,</hi> from without himselfe, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad he meets with occasions in the world more then others doe, to try his <hi>patience:</hi> as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is hated for that which none else is hated for: namely, for his Christianity, and for his honesty.</p>
                  <p>First, his Christianity and Religion by some: <hi>Bonus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Caius, tantummodo malus, quod Christianus, Caius</hi> is an honest man, he hath but one fault, he is a Christian: and, I could love <hi>Seius</hi> with all my heart, setting aside his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; such speeches <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his dayes did over-heare the <hi>Gentiles</hi> use, concerning the innocent Lambes of Christ, that were daily sacrificed for their Religion: and so now, Such a one I could like well, but that he is a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan; and I could love such a one with all my heart, but for his precisenesse: thus some hate him on the one side for his Religion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, on the other side, there be others that hate him as much for his honesty, they like him well enough for his outward profession and precisenes, for in that he is like themselves, but they hate him for another thing, he will not juggle as they doe, and play the Hypocrite, he is not altogether of their opinions, he will not raile on whom they raile, nor slander whom they slander, or speake evill on whom they doe, but reprove these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rather, as our Saviour did in the Pharisees; and therefore they whisper him out of credit whersoere they

come, and shake their head when they heare him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and say, Gods people know not what to make of him, meaning by Gods people, onely their owne sweet selves: now I say none is thus hated for his Christianity and for his honesty and sincerity, but the since<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, therefore none hath so much need of <hi>patience</hi> as he.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath more need of it then others, because hee cannot side with the factions of the world as others can: they goe away with the wisdome, and he stands still with <hi>patience:</hi> the world you know runnes all upon factions, and he that cannot side with one faction or other is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a foole by both sides, and an enemy: as a worldly friend said once to a Minister that had played the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as <hi>Paul</hi> once did when he preached before <hi>Festus,</hi> had without partiality spared the corruptions of none, O saies he you must be wise; and be sure alwayes you keepe one side to your selfe to be your friend; if you preach against the corruptions of these of our side, be sure you meddle not with the corruptions of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, keep in with them, but if you preach against them, be sure you keepe us to be your friends, meddle not with any of our sinnes: But such counsell as this, an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Christian cannot follow: he that is truly godly dares not turne to the right hand, nor to the left: his tender conscience cannot yeeld to the powerfull imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of some on the one hand, nor can his noble and upright spirit allow of the peevish humours and uneven carriages of some on the other, he cannot fancie as their yellow fancies doe, but lookes upon things without spectacles: and therefore he suffers on both sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will be in the extreames with neither: that side crushes him with their power, this side rends him with their tongues, and each side incouraging other in their

way, both clap their hands at him, and cry he suffers just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his deservings; and to put his <hi>patience</hi> more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, they will adde further, that he desired to please both, and therefore it is Gods just judgement against him that he should please neither: no man meets with such occasions as these are to use his <hi>patience,</hi> but the true Christian, therefore <hi>patience</hi> is most needfull for him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath more need of it then others: because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one else is onely for himselfe, and so needeth <hi>patience</hi> to beare onely his owne private wrongs, but a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is for God and for his Church, and their wrongs are his griefes, as well as his owne: to see some abuse the Church and Spouse of Christ, in making their quarrels the Churches, and to see others as bold with God, to make their causes his, is very grievous to an honest heart.</p>
                  <p>For example, when <hi>Demetrius</hi> or any of the craftsinen, or crafty men, hath a quarrell against <hi>Paul,</hi> or any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minister, for preaching or any other matter, though the Law be open, and the Lawyer ready to plead for them in their names, yet they thinke it the furer way to interest <hi>Diana</hi> in the businesse, to make it the Churches cause though it concernes her nothing at all, for they know some are so devoted to their Goddesse, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus, Gaius, Paul</hi> and all, are like to smart for it, if it be but suggested, though upon no grounds, that they are disaffected unto her; now this is cause of griefe to a Christian heart to see the Church in this sort abused; and more specially if he shall see Christs spouse at any time so forgetfull and unnaturall, as through su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to prostitute her selfe unto the pleasure of a base ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon his malicious complaint to be an Executioner of his wrath upon her owne true Children and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53473:63"/>
So on the other side, when <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> or any of his prating crue that love preeminence, doe please to take distast against any man, why, God must be interessed in their cause, and he that offends them must be whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroad to be Gods enemy, and every one with whom they can prevaile, shall be stirred up to hate him as such a one; for those onely with whom themselves are pleased, must be the beloved of God; and so long as they are friends with them, God is friends with them, &amp; no longer; as if they were alwayes of as unerring a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the Pope conceits himselfe to be when he sits in Cathedra: for this is the Popes course to a haire: Story tels us, when he hath beene at oddes with the French King; why, presently he hath proclaimed him the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Christ, and all the Christian world must up in armes against him, as against Gods enemy: and the Frenchmen for their Kings sake were all dogs upon the sudden, and cleane remission of sinnes should he have that should kill one of them; but so soone as the Popes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was pleased againe, warres must cease forthwith, and the Fiench King is the most Christian King againe, and his subjects all good Christian men, and great pity it were to shed their bloud.</p>
                  <p>Now (as I was saying) to observe men that professe so much hatred to the Pope, as some pretend they doe, and yet be so like him in conditions, is matter of much vexation to an honest heart.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath more need of <hi>patience</hi> then others, because he sees more evill in the world then others in regard of a more inlightned eye: for what the eye sees not, the heart rues not, saies the Proverb: but what the eye doth see, the heart doth rue, if rufull: Ile name but one particular, which for Religion and Gods childrens sake doth much afflict his heart to see it: and that is a notable tricke of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53473:63"/>
the Devill whereby he much prevailes against Gods people: and it is this. He puts upon some of his owne servants the names and titles, which the prophane world by his meanes puts upon Gods children, that so by the evill conditions of his owne birds, he might make those that are truly godly to become odious, that go under the same name and habit: Because the prophane world by his setting on, cals the godly, Puritans, and Precisians, therefore shall some of his brats call themselves so too, and so for their advantage another way, take upon them the reproach of Christ, whereof they are not worthy: and bring disgrace upon Gods dearest ones.</p>
                  <p>For by the way (Brethren) you must alwayes remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that though the world cals all Gods children, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans: yet all that call themselves Puritans are not Gods children: for then many of your railers, slanderers, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers, backbiters, censurers of all others but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, would be Gods children; yea, and many of the cheaters too: the couzening Merchants and Tradesmen; for a great many doe weare Christs livery onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, when all other shifts faile: some will turne Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house-keepers, but some more vile will turne Professors, (as Master <hi>Bolton</hi> notes) that under an Israelitish garment they may the better cheat the Egyptians: and if they be convinced it is a sinne (which will be hard to doe) why yet they can with a bold forehead maintaine that it is the sinne of the trade then, and not the sinne of the man: O how these stinkers doe vexe the spirits of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones, and no one thing is more apt to breake their <hi>patience,</hi> then these very conditions of these men, for like the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> they cannot bear or indure the sight of such things.</p>
                  <p>And indeed there is no way better to remove this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of offence from the eyes of Gods faithfull ones, then
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53473:64"/>
to take the course which the Angel there did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. He tried them that said they were Apostles, but were not, and found them liars: so we should try them that say they are Gods children, but are not, and find them liars; search them out, strip them and whip them, wee Ministers should doe so in every Sermon: if Rogues be stripe and whipt in every towne they passe through, they would not be so bold and so brazen-faced, as to coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit themselves to be whom they are not: so if these wretches were but stript and discovered by their markes in every Sermon, and well lashed by the word of God, they would not be so bold as to take upon them to be whom they are not.</p>
                  <p>But as it is not one man that can strip and whip a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of incorrigible persons, they will quickly knocke him downe, then they will quickly stab him with their secret weapons, many therefore must put to their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands. So it is not for one or two Ministers to goe about this businesse, it wil not be for their safety: they wil soon have their credit knocked down or stabbed: every one of those wretches carries a secret weapon in his mouth more sharp then any sword, wherewith they can soone dispatch themselves of their single opposites: No, it must be a combination therefore, the Ministers of Gods word must joyne together, and resolve upon it, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the vile from the precious, to strip them, and to whip them: and those Ministers they must be, whose lives and doctrines are both consonant to Gods word, for if such onely that smell too ranke of superstition, or that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for loosenesse of life and carriage, speake against the vices of such persons, why, all shall bee taken to bee but Gall and bitternesse, and they will thinke but the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of themselves for such mens invectives: therefore (I say) others that are of a more allowed stampe, should
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53473:64"/>
for the credit of Gods poore children take the matter in hand, and discover the Devils brood from the precious ones: it was the maine of our Saviours labour in all his preaching, as we all know, to discover hypocrites: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they themselves will well and diligently inveigh against the prophane crue, and so they easing us of part of our labour we may the better attend to them.</p>
                  <p>But truly friends, goodnesse is so rare and geason in these dayes, that honest Ministers are glad to see the shadow of it in any body; which when they discerne, for to incourage such persons in a progresse of good, they are sparing of them, and preach onely against others sinnes, till indeed they have spoyled them (spare the rod, and spoyle the child, saies <hi>Solomon)</hi> for they hereby grow so proud, so well conceited of themselves, so pure in their owne eyes, and so stiffe-necked, that they often prove the onely murderers of our names and credits, if ever after we goe about to deale with them.</p>
                  <p>But at leastwise, if we feare to be so venturous as to deale with them, to discover the vile from the precious, yet let us at least distinguish the precious from the vile, discover the properties of Gods true children: who are alwaies harmlesse, holy, well-spoken, humble, scarce da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring oft-times to owne so high a title as the title of Gods child: yea, we Ministers find it, that it is as hard some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to perswade one of them that they are so, as to perswade one of the other that they are not.</p>
                  <p>But we must not runne any further this way, we have gone too farre already some will say: you have seene now foure reasons why a Christian hath more need of <hi>patience</hi> then other men; more might be alleadged, but we must not be too tedious: we descend to the Use which shall be onely of exhortation to get <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see of what consequence <hi>patience</hi> is, and how
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53473:65"/>
needfull, and for a Christian in speciall; wherefore mind your owne good, sirs, and store your selves with it, that you may keepe the possession of your soules, that you may be perfect, and want nothing, that you may be fruitfull, that you may doe the will of God, and inherit the promises that you might be armed against all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that you might have a salve for every sore, an Antidote for every malady: these are motives now: I need not give you any more then you have had already: onely one, and that is this; <hi>Patience</hi> can ease your mind when nothing else can.</p>
                  <p>There be many sorrowes and griefes which something beside <hi>patience</hi> may haply afford help and ease unto: but there be others, and such as Christians are often liable to meet withall, that nothing but <hi>patience</hi> can ease: and for those things sake, you should store your selves with <hi>patience:</hi> I will instance in a case or two of this kind and nature.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps here you see one exalting a humane invention by his more diligent observance, before a Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; there you see one that can swallow a Camell without coughing, and stand straining at a Gnat; in one place you see Pastors most unkindly hunting and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their owne flocke; in another you see people most cruelly hunting and persecuting their owne Shepheard; sometimes you meet with men of such inlarged charity, that they can wish well to all places, yea to <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, though under Gods curse: excepting onely to <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> sometimes againe perhaps you meet with others of such contracted bowels, that they can wish well to no place but onely that: now this grieves your hearts, but what remedy have you, but onely <hi>patience?</hi> it is not in your powers to temper the differing spirits of men; no more then to rule the winds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:53473:65"/>
Againe, perhaps you see men set upon vexing one the other, and to this end they will preferre themselves and their opinions before Christ and peace, with our power we will prevaile (cry some on the one side) and make these Puritans stoope, yea that we will: no, but with our tongues we will prevaile, cry some on the other, and mouth it against them, yea that we will: we have long reaching hands (cry they) and we have loud sounding Cymbals cry these; and would to God they were but as well tuned may you say, when with griefe you behold these passages, but no remedy can I tell you for your griefe but onely <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So againe, perhaps you see sinne flourish and spread it selfe to the disgrace of Christ and of his Church, in some of them that should suppresse it, who are more apt for money-sake to commit folly, Hermaphrodite like, with both sexes, with all sorts, then to punish any; and then perhaps you observe further, some of them that should looke to these, to be <hi>Gallio</hi> like, quite regardlesse of any complaint that is made to them, especially against such their owne Beadsmen: and this vexeth the spirits, but what remedy, save onely <hi>patience?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or againe, perhaps you see some that professe <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, and thereupon are in the Briars as he was, but doe cleane contrary to what he did for deliverance, not trust Christ with his owne cause; but because corrupt <hi>Felix</hi> looks for mony, they will feed his appetite, &amp; so flesh the greedy Hound with the bloud of their purses, that he will never leave hunting &amp; sucking, till he hath undone many a poor Christian, that according to example must stretch too, beyond the compasse of ability, or else <hi>ab inferno nulla redemptio:</hi> and this moves your minds, but where is your help? onely in <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, perhaps you see Christ wounded in the house

of his friends, as in the precedent verses, brother betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brother; one professor by the mediation of a second, a third, or a fourth man, delivering up another for some private spleene into the hands of the common enemy, as the Jewes did Christ unto the Romanes, and when the mischiefe is done, the contrivers crying out (as they of Christ) he is justly smitten of God, and Gods just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is fallen upon him for his dissent with them and their humours, though in the meane time he hath done nothing amisseas, they are told by their owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet they feele no remorse for their bringing him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to trouble, their consciences are so seared; for the blind Pharisee thinkes, if he doth but in forme, give in false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and suborne false witnesse, so he doth not kill or draw bloud, he is no transgressour. And Judge <hi>Pilat,</hi> he conceives if he doth but prosecute according to present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and passe sentence according to information, though false in the judgement of his owne conscience; why, he may wash his hands, and cry, <hi>I am free from the bloud of this just person:</hi> and the souldiers, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-officers, they beleeve they doe but their duty to inflict punishment according unto sentence, though upon the most holy: and so betwixt them all, Christ and his members goe to wracke, and none of them will be a whit to blame, such is their stupid blindnesse: these things are grievous to a Christan heart, but what remedy? only <hi>patience.</hi>

                  <p>Once againe, when you see some under the names of Christians goe up and downe rending and tearing the names and credits of their brethren, and taking all occasions to speake evill, and to publish mens faults to the world when they are not urged; nay, coyning faults of them to make them odious to others, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thus doe fome Christians deale with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, wrap them up in beasts skinnes, that is, in beastly vices by their false and criminous imputations, to the end that worldly and carnall men might be provoked to abuse them, who otherwise would deale more friendly with them: these call themselves Christians, but these conditions prove them rather to be like Butchers dogges, whose lips are alwayes bloudy with the slaughter of one thing or other: O how it g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A hundred such occasions might be reckoned up, but these may serve: therefore I say, seeing <hi>patience</hi> is such a soveraigne grace, with all your getting get <hi>patience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How, you will say? Ile propound but three meanes: and they briefely.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Accustome your selves to the reading of Gods blessed Book, which is called the word of <hi>Patience, Rev.</hi> 3. 10. because it ingenders this grace first in the heart, and then doth nourish it with the promises: that sets forth to you the Lord Jesus in all his sufferings as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident for you, that discovers the way to Heaven, to lie through tribulations, that shewes that all afflictions comes from God, and for good ends: that discovers to you the natures wayes and ends of all the wicked, which being fore-known may make you patient, &amp; that also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens your eyes and gives you light to see into their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to be such as in the Word they are deciphered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Acquaint your selves with bearing daily crosses, small wrongs, which will be a meane to inable you with <hi>patience</hi> for the bearing of greater: you know the Story of <hi>Milo,</hi> he by accustoming himselfe to carry a Calfe, became able to carry an Oxe; and of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who by using to eate poyson, made his body unpoysonable; and you know the fable of the old and new Cart loaded with sheaves, the old Cart which was accustomed to the burden, that alone went without creaking, so by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoming your selves to beare, you will be able to beare without complaining.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Preserve your innocence: that you be not justly plagued for your transgessions: however men will say [If I had deserved it, it would never have grieved mee,] yet I assure you, desert is the cause of griefe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: Guiltnes is the cause of impatience, both in cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and in reproofes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 13, 14. He that was guilty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53473:67"/>
that did the wrong was the impatient man when <hi>Moses</hi> spake unto them, the gald Jade onely kicks, the begger onely is offended to be called bankrupt, not the rich man, and the deceiver to be called hypocrite, not the sound Christian: those that are guilty of slandering, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, reviling, evill speaking of Rulers and Governours, these onely are offended to heare these sinnes reproved, these are they that on such occasions pelt and puffe, and chafe, and figge up and downe as if they were nettled: and did you heare what stuffe we had to day (cry they) how bitter the Preacher was against Gods people? their guiltinesse doth cause this impatience: whereas the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Christian, should he be railed upon, and reviled ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so, yet with a mild spirit he can reply as the honest servant did to his passionate Master, calling him knave, and couzening knave; Sir, saies he, you may speake as you please, but I beleeve not a word you say concerning this particular, for I know my selfe to be an honest man: therefore I say preserve your innocence: so much for the meanes.</p>
                  <p>Now in the close of all, that you might not thinke you have got the Grace when you have it not: let mee tell you, it is not <hi>patience</hi> to be quiet when none offends you: nor when you are not able to right or revenge your selves: many thinke themselves to be patient, because when no body angers them, they be quiet; and so is the Devill: but let them be but touched with a small injury, or any angry word, they are but briars and thornes, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 4. the very best of them is a briar: and many beare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries because they know not how to revenge; they have a will, but they want power. But Christian <hi>patience</hi> is such as Christs was, who had power to revenge, but did not: therefore know you must beare injuries, when you are able to revenge your selves, else you are not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53473:68"/>
this was intimated in the words of our Saviour the night before he suffered: He that hath no sword, let him sell his coat and buy one; Why Lord, saies <hi>Aug.</hi> what should thine doe with swords? thou wilt not suffer them to draw them; <hi>Peter</hi> must not use his sword in defence of thee, much lesse of himselfe; why, they must have swords, that their <hi>patience</hi> might appeare more fully, that being wronged, and having swords, yet doe not offer to draw them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You must not onely beare present, but also be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to indure future wrongs, if you be truly patient; this was intimated in those words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 39. to have the other cheeke ready for another blow, if the one be stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for as <hi>Aug.</hi> well, it is to be understood not so much <hi>de parte oper is,</hi> as <hi>de praeparatione animi:</hi> a Christian must be a Crucian, till he is landed in Heaven.

You must not onely beare and forbeare, but also give and forgive, before you can be truly patient: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the evill offered, and give blessing for cursing, pray for those that slander, censure, persecute, and hate you: for though <hi>Laban</hi> deale ill with <hi>Jacob, Jacob</hi> must deale well with him: though <hi>Saul</hi> hunt for <hi>Davids</hi> life, yet <hi>David</hi> must not lay hands on him: though <hi>Ahab</hi> bee an Idolater, and a naughty man, and one that had sold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to worke wickednesse, yet must not <hi>Obadiah</hi> plot treason against him: he did all the good he could in so corrupt a time, and yet no ill to his Master: men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are like those servants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 28. think they cannot deale badly enough with ill men, pluck up the tares presently, doe any thing to them that are none of Gods, couzen, defraud, rob, steale from the Egyptians, these are but usurpers: but what said the Master to these servants? no, let them alone till the harvest: friend you must hold your hands, your time of commanding and adjudging is not yet come, and in the meane time you must be commanded, ruled, and adjudged your selfe; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened, defrauded, and cheated, and have your goods ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and you must be patient, and returne good to those that offer these things to you: O this is brave do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I have knowne a Minister by preaching peace and <hi>patience,</hi> preach many of his people theeves and cheaters, they would wrong him to his face, and then tell him he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53473:69"/>
must be patient and peaceable, else he would contradict his owne doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that is truly patient, must not onely returne good for evill, and for beare to revenge when he hath power, but he must be content to have the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him: namely, that he returnes evill for good, and is patient perforce, because he cannot helpe himselfe. I tell you this is a hard lesson, yet you must learne it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can enter Heaven gate, whose motto is this, Do good and heare ill; none but such enter there: it alwayes was, and ever will be the worlds custome; to father their owne vile conditions upon Gods people. <hi>Tacitus</hi> tels us, that when <hi>Nero</hi> had set <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, he laid it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Christians.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You must also be content that men should beleeve your enemies so reporting: for men will so doe, whether you be content or no if the Viper leaps on <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, though he be the honestest man, in the company, yet all will conclude him to be the worst: so if a viperous slanderer, railer, or whisperer, laies hold of any honest Christian, all hereby will conclude him to be according to what they see or hear: the Psalmist saies, every man is a lie: and like loves like: they will therefore naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lies before truths: and this vile people know &amp; will brag of, as one told his Minister to his face, that he could be beleeved before him, by his betters: you know the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, The more knave, the better lucke: well, this you must be content wi thll, if you be truly patient.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And lastly, you must be content that not onely the worser and common sort and strangers should beleeve of you, the contrary to truth, but that the better sort also, even Christians, and friends should beleeve such lies as the wicked raise and whisper against you, and that they should suspect you to be guilty of all that is reported,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53473:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and thinke amisse, and also speake amisse of yo: that they should breake your head with their precious balms, that their tongues which should heale your griefe should wound you, and make your griefe bigger: that they should also lay to your charge things you are not guilty of, and interpret every thing at the worst, and charge iniquity upon you: thus <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, good men, honest men did by him: and this you must be content to suffer: it is more irksome to be ill thought of, or ill reported, by those that are good, then by those that run into all excesse of riot; it is matter of comfort rather, that these like us not: but I say if you be Gods, he will try your patience even by the others, by the best; and you must bee content with it: and wait with patience till the day come when hee shall make your righteousnesse appeare as the light, and your just dealing as cleare as the noone day: and in the meane time you must be content to live neglected and suspected: you must be last and the least in mens esteeme, but then the last will be first, and the first last.</p>
                  <p>And thus Brethren I have taught you <hi>patience,</hi> and I have tried your <hi>patience,</hi> if I have done amisse, ile doe so no more: for thus much shall serve for this text, this time, and this place.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words doe note unto us, Christs entertainement of a certaine motion that was made unto him by two of his Disciples in the former verse: it was we see entertained with dislike, for he turned and rebuked them for it; and then he tels them the reason why he did dislike it; because it proceeded from ignorance, namely of themselves, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of him: of themselves, or of their owne spirits, you
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53473:72"/>
                     <hi>know not what spirit ye are of:</hi> And of him, of the end of his comming, <hi>for the Sonne of man came not to destroy mens liues</hi> (according to the supposall of your motion) <hi>but to save them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before we fasten directly upon the Text, we must for our better proceeding, a little consider of the motion, and of the occasion of it: The motion we have in the foregoing words, <hi>Lord, wilt thou tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>s did;</hi> And the occasion which stirred their spirits, to make such a cruell motion, was the sight of the churlishnesse of the Samaritans; for as appeares in <hi>ver.</hi> 52, 53. Christ was travailing towards Jerusalem, and being benighted, he sent his servants before him to take up a lodging in a village of the Samaritanes, but they would let him have no lodging there, because he was going to Jerusalem; this was their churlishnesse.</p>
                  <p>And the roote of it (as we may conceive) was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nationall hatred betweene the Jewes and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans, which did arise from difference in opinion, for as you may reade, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20. The Samaritans faid, God must be worshipped after their fashion, on their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but the Jewes said (and they were in the right) that God must be worshipped at Jerusalem: And this same difference was the ground of their quarrell, which was so great, that the Jewes in generall, and the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans in generall, would have no dealings one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as appeares, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9.</p>
                  <p>Now our Saviour was a Jew, and he was going to Jerusalem to worship there, according to the Law, the Passeover was neere at hand, and this these Samaritans apprehended, by his habit, or his carriage, in some sort, they perceived that his face was toward Jerusalem, and therefore no lodging should he get among them: which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53473:72"/>
when the Disciples saw, their blood began to rise, and their spirits began to worke, and they thought to shew themselves Jewes, as the other had shewed themselves Samaritans, and be as cruell, as those were churlish, wherefore, sayes the Text, when the Disciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> saw this, they said, <hi>Lord wilt thou that wee command fire to come from Heaven, and destroy them, as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as did?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here let us observe by the way, what Spirits difference in opinion will make men of: how unkinde <note place="margin">Observ.</note> and cruell one to another: be they Jewes, doe they goe to Jerusalem to workship there? will they kneele at the Sacrament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>out upon them, let them have neither meat, drinke, nor lodging, that is in plaine tearmes, starve them: On the other side, be they Samaritans, Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, will they sit at the Sacrament? O fie upon them, pitty they should live, let us banish them out of the world, put fire to them and burne them: O these be fine doings among people that worship the same God; the devill haply may delight in them, but I am sure Christ doth not.</p>
                  <p>These be the fruits of difference in opinions, abuse of each others, mutuall, and mortall hatred, neglect of all Humanity and Divinity on both parts; thus it was you see of old, and I wish from my soule, we had not cause to fay, thus it is now: but where will these things end thinke you?</p>
                  <p>These two in the Text, the Samaritan, and the Jew, made not an end of this their difference, untill it had made an end of both them, for we read in the Jewish stories, that such a like quarrell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>as this was, such a like discourtesie as was here offered, made way to the Jews warres, whereby both Jewes and Samaritans were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. And I pray God these differences of opinion,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53473:73"/>
in our Church doth not bring a like destruction: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle notes it as a fearefull <hi>omen,</hi> by way of caveat, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15. if ye bite and devoure one another, ye are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be consumed one of another.</p>
                  <p>Observe also from the Samaritans churlishnesse, and inhospitality to Christ, and his Disciples: that where <note place="margin">Observ.</note> hatred is, there is churlishnesse, and where churlishnesse is to any the Messengers and servants of God, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there is a hatred of them, they hate them that will not receive them, or that deale uncivilly with them: And remember what reward these Samaritans at last did get for this their churlishnesse, in not receiving Christ, and his followers: God suffered the devill to send <hi>Simon Magus</hi> amongst them, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 9. that did most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly seduce the whole Nation, small and great adored him: And so God often punisheth such people, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not Christ and histrue Ministers, he lets Satan send some paltry fellowes, some wicked and worthlesse men with delusions among them, whereby they are seduced, and perhaps brought to ruine: It were possible to give you examples of this in these times, but I passe on.</p>
                  <p>When the Disciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> saw this, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courtesie denyed, a nights lodging, and that to Christ Jesus their Master, whose wrong and abuse they could not but lay to heart, more then if it had beene of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered onely to themselves: And to see him thus abused for his Religion sake, (because his face was toward Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem) and that a little while after they had seene him in his glory, on the Mount of Transfiguration, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Heaven, to see him thus despitefully used, by a company of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>maritan Heretickes, in a base paltry. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, can you blame them if they were angry? surely they had reason for it, and as they thought Scripture too, for say they, Master, <hi>Wilt thou that we command
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53473:73"/>
fire to come from Heaven, and consume them, as Elias did?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which motion of theirs, we see they take it for granted, that these Samaritans deserve to be destroyed, and that in the sharpest manner, and in the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way that might be, even by fire, onely they take Christs advise about the matter, and aske his leave to doe it, and they bring in the Example of <hi>Elias</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant their motion, although our Saviour approves, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their motion, nor yet of their warrant, as we shall see anon.</p>
                  <p>But first, Observe what a woefull thing it would be <note place="margin">Observ.</note> if one man should sit in Judgement upon another, for the sinnes committed against God; if the best men that are, should censure sinners, or if Christ should be of the same minde as these his Disciples here were of, and presently punish every indignity of this nature that is offered unto him, we might say with <hi>David, O Lord, who could abide it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, we may conclude out of all question, if Christ should not be more mercifull then man, to sinfull men, that entertaine him not, the whole world would long ere this have beene burnt to ashes, not onely these Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans here, but the Jewes of Jerusalem too, yea <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> among the rest, and the whole universe, a great while agoe had beene like Sodome.</p>
                  <p>As for the Samaritans here, they had beene burnt up presently, without more adoe, for denying Christ a lodging: and for Jerusalem, he was worse used there then at Samaria, they shut him out of their City, and on the Mount without the City gates, they murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; so then Jerusalem soone after had beene burnt to Ashes too, as being throughly guilty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariaes fault: And then for the Disciples themselves, indeed we will doe them no wrong, time was, that they had received him, but then afterward, when most need
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53473:74"/>
was, they forsooke him againe, they ran away from him, renounced him, denyed him, and some of them swore too they never knew him, then if Christ should have beene of their mindes, more fire must have beene fetched from Heaven to consume them, the Disciples, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as well as the rest.</p>
                  <p>Nay, further yet, we read <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10, 11. that the whole world was made by Christ, and yet it knew him not, nor received him, then also the whole world had long agoe beene at an end, even turned into a heape of Ashes: And (I pray) now adayes who doth receive Christ as he should, nay, who doth not at one time or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to receive him? surely then, if Christ were of the same minde with these his Disciples, he should not so much as leave himselfe one man to save, but should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all.</p>
                  <p>Blessed therefore, and ever blessed be the Divine goodnesse, and blessed be Christ, that hee is a better friend to poore sinners, and more mercifull then wee should ever be to our selves, or to one another: Christ invites them to come to him, whose hearts suggest most evill against themselves, and promises ease and helpe: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29.</note> O that this sweet goodnesse of Christ could make us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and draw us to repent, and to love him, as it ought to doe, for it is shewne to that end; but wicked we are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14.</note> rather thereby incouraged to sinne, because judgement is not speedily executed upon the workers of iniquity, therefore the hearts of men are even set in them to doe evill (sayes the Preacher;) well, I am sure we have cause <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11.</note> to praise God for his goodnesse, and to make better use of it.</p>
                  <p>But we returne to the Disciples: Master (say they) <hi>Wilt thou that we command fire to come from Heaven, and consume them, as Elias did?</hi> if we marke it, herein they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53473:74"/>
approve themselves Disciples indeed, they make their Masters will their law, (Master, <hi>wilt thou)</hi> they will not doe it on their owne heads, what they doe shall be done on Gods name.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is the proper condition of Gods true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to take advise of him, by Prayer, in all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and this course keepes them from doing any knowne evill, yea, it helpes them to know the evill of their intentions when they are ignorant of it.</p>
                  <p>First, It keepes them from doing any knowne evill, for their consciences will not suffer them to crave his aid in any knowne sinfull way, or worke: the Disciples here did not yet know that this their motion was evill, for if they had, they would have beene ashamed to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to Christ to approve on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It helpes them to know the evill of their desires, when they are ignorant of it, thus the Disciples came here to discover their error by asking Christs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice about their conceived intentions, so we may come to see our errors, whereof we are ignorant, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with him by Prayer, about our businesses, for Christ by his Spirit will one way or other discover the same, if we advise with him, consult therefore with Christ in all things.</p>
                  <p>But then for the Scripture that is alledged, <hi>(as Elias did.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Precepts are the proper rules for doings, but the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples alledge no Precept here, but onely a President of <hi>Elias,</hi> taken out of 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 9. where hee called for fire from Heaven, to consume those mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 2.</note> (nor was <hi>Abel</hi> without sin, but because he was the first and most expresse type of innocent Christ, to shew what a one Christ should be, namely without guile, voyd of sin, an Innocent Lambe, a true Shepherd, a pure Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, therefore for this cause is not <hi>Abel</hi> noted of sin; but I say he had sin in him, and did commit it, for he was his Fathers Sonne, as well as all the other Saints) now we must not imitate the godly in their sinnes, not <hi>Abraham</hi> in telling of an untruth to escape a danger, nor <hi>David</hi> in his adultery, and in his making <hi>Uriah</hi> drunke, as some wicked ones will doe.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps the godly will say, We know this well, but we may imitate them in all their good actions; I answer, no, not in all the good and commendable things they did doe, for they did doe many things by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary instinct of the Spirit, which is not common to all, what they did by speciall inspiration, they had a particular commission, a privy seale for it; which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to them, and not to others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phineas</hi> by the speciall inspiration of God, did kill <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> when he saw them in the act of sinning
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53473:75"/>
against God, shall any man therefore when he sees o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers committing sin, fall upon them and kill them? And <hi>Ehud,</hi> by a speciall warrant from God, killed <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> shall the Papists therefore conclude from thence, that it is lawfull for men to kill Kings? <hi>Elias</hi> here being moved by the speciall Spirit of God, called for fire from Heaven, to consume the Captaines with their fifties, may the Disciples doe so too against the Samaritans? no, sayes our Saviour, that they may not.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I say, the examples of godly men must not simply in all things be followed or imitated: but two things we must consider of in such a case.</p>
                  <p>First, Whether they whom we desire to imitate, did doe well, or no, in the thing that we would be like them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether our office is to imitate them; for in the Prophets of old, we must alway difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene what they did, by their generall calling, and therein, if we be in like office, we may imitate them; and what they did by immediate warrant, and such acts passe not from the persons, no precedents are to be made of them.</p>
                  <p>The use of this shall be onely to informe us, that it is most safe to hold to the rule, <hi>Legibus standum, non exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis,</hi> we must live by precept, not by example: we have many now adayes that will neglect the obedience to good Lawes, to follow the example of such and such good men; verily I commend them not, in thus making Popes of good men, as if such were not subject to erre; the Lawes are, and ought to be our Masters, and they are fugitives that run from their Masters: but we come to the second.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Good men through ignorance may mis-apply</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note> 
                     <hi>Scripture:</hi> These good men here in the Text did so, we
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53473:76"/>
will goe no further, they mis-applyed this example of <hi>Elias,</hi> for that act which <hi>Elias</hi> did, was not like that which they would have done, and for which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Elias</hi> example; for the fire which <hi>Elias</hi> called for, was against none but delinquents, who ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, malepertly, and without all shame indeavoured and intended, to bring the holy Prophet bound to the wicked King, and one of them was as deepe in the fault as another, they were all alike guilty: But the Disciples here would have called for fire to consume a whole Towne, wherein were a great many women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were (likely) no way accessory to this chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse offered unto our Saviour: now it was never Gods minde or way to punish the innocent with the guilty: Sodome it selfe had beene saved, had but ten innocent persons beene found there; and Niniveh was spared, because there were so many in it that knew not their right hand from their left: Therefore you see the example of <hi>Elias</hi> was not rightly alledged, and good men may through ignorance misapply Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And if good men may, then no doubt but evill men may and will too; indeed not an Heretique or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique that ever was, but they would alledge Scripture for their opinions, but it was Scripture mis-applyed and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We have many now adayes of this ranke, whom the Apostle describes by their conditions, and by their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. from the first to the tenth verse: and among other their conditions, he sayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. That they have a forme of godlinesse: that is, they can alledge Scripture to their owne ends, though they deny the power of it in their lives. Secondly, he sayes they are men of corrupt mindes, and reprobate concerning the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53473:76"/>
true faith: and he compares them to a couple of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> that withstood <hi>Moses,</hi> the true called servant of the Lord. Thirdly, he sayes further, they are housecreepers, they love to worke in secret.</p>
                  <p>And then their followers, with whom they most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, are silly women, that are not able to withstand them, that through their sillinesse do admire them, these they take captive; and so they doe some men too, that are as silly, and as weake as those women, laden with sinnes, and divers lusts: And Oh how fast such corrupt hearers doe drinke in corrupt Doctrines! Indeed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts will always swallow downe corruptions and errours, faster then truths: How many yeares have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods faithfull Ministers beene painefully Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truthes in publique, as Christ did to some people, and yet they have not received the same? but now of late we have had a brood of Sectaries, and they have whispered up and downe in corners, (men that have come in their owne names,) and what abundance of followers have they gotten upon the suddaine? It was a true saying of our Saviour to such kind of followers, I am come in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, and ye receive me not, if another shall come in his owne name, him ye will receive. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 43.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, you may alwayes know an error, by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples readinesse to receive it, like will to like, a corrupt Doctrine will quickly take a corrupt heart: and you may discover evill men and false teachers by this: they that cannot, or doe not apply Scriptures to themselves, for the humiliation of their owne hearts, and for the sanctification of their owne tongues and lives (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these doe not) cannot rightly apply them for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers instruction, at least, they may be suspected in their allegations, for the Spirit of truth is the Spirit of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; good men may be mistaken in alledging
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53473:77"/>
Scriptures, therefore much rather may evill.</p>
                  <p>But I will hold you no longer in the Context, I come to the carriage and words of our Saviour, in the Text it selfe, wherein we have two things,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Our Saviours dislike of their motion.</item>
                     <item>2. His confutation of it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>His dislike in the first words, <hi>He turned and rebuked them:</hi> His confutation in the rest: And first of the first, <hi>He tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and rebuked them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse, the Apostles expected another kinde of <note place="margin">

                  <p>When men out of their private spirits, will goe about to revenge Gods quarrell upon sinners, they shall have no thanke at his hand for their labours; here was sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God committed, and as great a dis-respect offered to Christ, as almost could be, yet we see he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their desires to revenge it.</p>
                  <p>Men of blood that have cruelty in their hearts, and mouthes, and hands too, if they have advantage, against their owne enemies that have used them ill, or against
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53473:77"/>
Christs enemies, that have used him ill, are to be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, we Ministers may, nay, we must rebuke such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and such motions.</p>
                  <p>And a great many such spirits have we now adayes, whom, if we should rebuke, as Christ here did his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they would cry out upon us for no friends of Christ, or of his cause; no, but friends of Publicans and sinners rather, as the Pharisees said that Christ was when he rebuked them; The Pharisees indeed would have had Christ rebuked none, but those that themselves called and counted Publicans and sinners, and never to have meddled with them, though they were never so hypocriticall and vile, for if he did at any time, they would be sure to defame him, and exclaime upon him: and miscall him: so now we have many that would have us Ministers, Preach onely against the sinnes of Drunkards, and prophane persons, and superstitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but by no meanes they would not have us touch the sinnes of Professors, be they never so blameable, for they cannot, they will not beare it at our hands; our good names at least, shall surely smart for it, if we doe; the least glaunce in a Sermon against their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, or headlong zeale, is a sufficient ground with many of them, to make them whisper us about the Country, to be men of most bitter spirits, against all goodnesse, and against Gods people: Indeed few men doe we meete withall, that will take rebuke as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples here did, specially when they are rebuked for their rash zeale, in the cause of God or Christ, for which they expect commendation rather, and perhaps it is that onely which many of them ayme at, but it shewes that such are Professors rather of the Pharisees stampe, then of the Disciples: However our S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

commendation, but rebuke rather.</p>
                  <p>Observe againe that Christ doth not bid his Disciples consider, whether the good that might come by bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Towne would out-weigh the losse thereof, as the Powder Traitors, when the case was propounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, whether the Popish Lords, and Knights, in the Parliament house, should be blowne up among the rest, they consulted whether the good that might come to the Catholique cause by that deadly blow, would not out-weigh the losse of them, and finding in their hellish thoughts, that it would, they concluded to blow up them too.</p>
                  <p>No, our Saviour Christ did not go that way to work here, with his Disciples; for we grant that flesh and blood might have found reasons enough to burne the Towne, had they beene consulted with: for,</p>
                  <p>First, Hereby there would such a feare have beene strooke into all the Townes about, that Christ should have beene the more respected ever after, he should never have beene denyed a lodging more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hereby Christ should have salved his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among his owne Country-men, who thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly of him for being so courteous to the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, they suspected him to love them too well, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they called him Samaritan.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It might have beene much to Christs repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to have had Disciples that could doe as great things as <hi>Elias,</hi> and fetch fire from heaven with a word, as well as he.</p>
                  <p>But none of these reasons could sway with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the act being evill of it selfe, he would by no meanes allow of it, and thereby he teacheth us, that we must not doe any evill that good may come thereon.</p>

                  <p>But who doe you thinke will beleeve this report? how long may we Preach before this Doctrine will be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? yet you see our Saviours carriage in this businesse of the Text, doth warrant it for good, he would not have any man hurt by any of his servants for his sake; and so at another time, when <hi>Peter</hi> drew his sword in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and strooke of <hi>Malchus</hi> eare, He bad <hi>Peter</hi> put up his sword againe, and he healed <hi>Malchus</hi> eare againe, for sayes he, the end of my comming was not to hurt men, but to doe them good, to save and not to destroy, Christ would have no man hurt for his sake.</p>
                  <p>No, no, But we, many of us, will rather approve of the Jesuites and Popish way, as being more agreeing to our reasons, and to flesh and blood then this is, and if by destroying and ruinating such and such, we may but further the cause, (though not the Popish or Catholique cause, as they terme it, but perhaps the Puritan cause, Christs cause, as we call it) why then we conclude it lawfull to doe any thing, lye, slander, defa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But yet againe observe; this motion of the Disciples was a revengefull motion, they would have payed the Samaritans their owne againe, and that with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusse, they would have required churlishnesse with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and therefore our Saviour doth utterly distaste their motion, and thereby doth further teach us, that, They that will returne like for like (inpoint of wrong) or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worse then is offered them, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53473:79"/>
and what punishment is thereupon by them inflicted on our Enemies, is done mediately by the hand of God, to whom alone vengeance belongeth: And yet neither must we make use of the Magistrates helpe purposely to revenge our selves upon an adversary, for that were to make the Law, the Magistrate, and God himselfe too, the instruments of our vile, and malicious spirits; no, but onely to have Justice in a case of wrong; as we must not rejoyce <hi>De malo inimici,</hi> in the hurt of an eneny when we see it done, so we must not ayme thereat before-hand, but onely at the manifestation of Truth and Justice in our complainings: But let me say this, I am confident, that at the great day, that man shall have most honour, and most comfort, that hath put up his complaints im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to God, and referred most wrongs to him.</p>
                  <p>This therefore in a word discovers unto us, that those <note place="margin">Use.</note> spirits are not right and Christian, that resolve upon it concerning others, to give them as good as they bring, and to deale with them, as themselves by them have beene dealt withall, and will be sure to indeavour it, to the uttermost, so long as, or whensoever, as power is in their hand: they will persecute those that when time was, did persecute them; and be as mercilesse now, as those were cruell when they were in place: surely it becomes not Gods Children, to walke in condemned paths, to tread in those steps which themselves formerly did true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censure as Antichristian; if cruelty and revenge be a sinne in any, then most of all in Christs Disciples, in Gods children, whom it beseemes to approve themselves by their carriage toward their enemies, to be of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spirit then other men: But I conclude this with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> advice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 29.

                  <p>I proceed in the Text, to our Saviours confutation of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Part</hi> 2.</note> their motion: and of their abuse of <hi>Elias</hi> example, which they brought to warrant it: and this he doth by a double Argument.</p>
                  <p>First, from the calling of the Apostlcs themselves, <hi>you know not what spirit ye are of;</hi> as if he had said, desire of revenge is not sutable to men of your spirits, or of your calling, you are Ministers of the Gospell, and you are my Disciples, and you must doe onely that which sutes with my spirit, which becomes the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the end of his owne comming, who was their Master, which was to save mens lives, and not to destnoy them, as if he had said, What doe you tell me of burning Townes, or of <hi>Elias</hi> example, in calling downe fire from heaven to doe hurt? is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene me and <hi>Elias?</hi> betweene the end of my comming and his? if he came to destroy men, and to pray against <hi>Israel,</hi> yet I came to save men, and to pray for <hi>Israel,</hi> therefore a very unfit motion this is, which you propound unto me, and very impertinently doe you propound the example of him: But I know you doe it ignorantly, <hi>Nescitis, you know not what spirit ye are of,</hi> or of what spirit you ought to be, ignorance is the cause of your Errour, and your motion is naught, because it springs from ignorance; ignorance of your selves and of me too, of your owne spirits, and of the end of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Hence we gather these observations:</p>

And so <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2. the Apostle speakes of a zeale without knowledge, and disallowes of it as not good, ignorance is no mother of devotion, or of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noffe (as the Papists teach, but rather of all errour,) of bloodshed, persecution, blasphemy, oppression, and of all filthy lusts, of all ill motions, as I could make good by <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 29.

O that this truth were beleeved, and remembred in these dayes, for then perhaps people would not follow <note place="margin">Use.</note> ignorant and unlearned teachers so fast as they doe, of whom the Apostle speakes, that they neither understand what they say, nor whereof they affirme: none more bold then the blind, and none more ready to follow the <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 7.</note> blinde, then those that are like them, but if the blinde lead the blinde, both will fall into the ditch, sayes our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 14.</p>
                  <p>But be it knowne from hence, that the zeale of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not good, nor the prayer of ignorance, nor the preaching of ignorance, nor the worship or devotion of ignorance, nor any motion that proceeds from ignorance, alisnaught that comes from this roote; ignorance is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and darknesse hath relation to Hell: these Apostles here (I warrant you) after they knew this, they were but little taken with this their owne motion, nor did they delight to start any more of the like kinde: I wish that all men were like the Apostles herein, to take notice of their owne ignorance, and to curbe and keepe in the fruites thereof.</p>
                  <p>But we proceed; what ignorance was it that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour blames here in these his Disciples? why, it was first the ignorance of their owne spirits, <hi>You know not what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit you are of:</hi> and hence arises our second observation.

                  <p>God is the Father of Spirits, and the giver of all good <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9.</note>

Spirits, and you must know that God gives to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants spirits sutable to the times and seasons: the same spirit may be good at one time, and not at another, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> spirit was good in his time, but the times being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, his spirit, or the temper of his spirit, may not be so good now, Jesus Christ the Son of God being come, by his comming he made a change of the times, and so by consequence of the spirits too, as we shall shew anon: And indeed the Disciples inconsideration, of the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times, was the occasion that they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (in this fort) of their owne spirits.</p>
                  <p>And so still ignorance of the times and seasons, and places where men live, is often the cause that good men are ignorant of their owne Spirits, or of what spirit they ought to shew, a spirit that may be good at one time, or in one place, may not be so, at, or in another; for example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luthers</hi> spirit was good in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, God did fit him with a spirit according to the time and place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lived, and to the worke he had to doe: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Luthers</hi> spirit be so good now, and in these Realmes; or whether all they that boast themselves to be of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> spirit, are so indeed, and have it from God, as he had, many wise men, both doe, and well may, make a question.</p>
                  <p>But if we should grant that <hi>Luthers</hi> spirit were as good in these times, as it was in his owne; yet whether <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolostadius</hi> his spirit, that was never good in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, be good now or no; is, and may be a further question.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Carolostadius</hi> was an ignorant Doctor in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, that loved popularity, and to be counted some body as well as <hi>Luther,</hi> in the great worke of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: (He was indeed a pretty tolerable man, according to the condition of those times, onely he had two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and they were want of wit, and want of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

learning,) and therefore he fell to Preach and stirre up the people, of their owne heads and accords, to pull downe Images and pictures in Churches, and glasse win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, in a most disorderly way, and not to stay till they might be removed with quietnesse by Authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Luther</hi> writ against him, and called him ignorant dunce for his labour.</p>
                  <p>And by that very tricke of the devill, in stirring up <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolostadius</hi> to doe so, Images stand to this day in the, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches, for <hi>Luther</hi> writing and preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Carolostadius</hi> his folly and disorder, some have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted him thereby to write in the defence of Images, and his followers doe still maintaine them as approved by him, which surely is but a mistake, for had <hi>Luther</hi> lived longer, no doubt but he would have used meanes to have had them abolished too, as wel as other Popery, but in an orderly way, by the hand of the Magistrate, and not by popular fury and folly: but now I sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the spirit that was never good, be good in these dayes, I thinke there is good cause to question it.</p>
                  <p>Nay (my friends) if any man should act with <hi>Carolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadius</hi> his spirit, and boast that he were of <hi>Luthers</hi> spirit, you would say here were ignorance indeed, and injury too, thus grossely to abuse <hi>Luther,</hi> in attributing unto him such a spirit, which (as all men of reading know) he did both write and speake against, and sure, if <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> himselfe were now alive, he would say, that the loome, or the shop board would better become such teachers then the Pulpit: <hi>Luthers</hi> spirit, I am sure, was a peaceable spirit in the Common wealth, his indeavours were, that reformation might be wrought orderly, by them that were appointed thereunto, and not by the mad hare-brained, drunken multitude.</p>
                  <p>Well therefore we may conclude, that it is a matter
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53473:82"/>
of great consequence, to know the times and seasons wherein we live, and to know what temper of spirit doth best sute the same; it was the Apostles errour in the Text, they were ignorant of the time and season, at least, inconsiderate of the same; and hence it came to passe, that they were ignorant of their owne spirits and the effect of this their ignorance was, that evill or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in the motion that proceeded from them, and that is our third observation.

                  <p>The Disciples ignorance of their owne spirits, or their distemper in regard of their present passion, at the sight of the Samaritans churlishnesse, was the cause that they did not see the sinfulnesse of this their motion; when the eye is yellow, it thinkes all things to be of the same colour; so when the minde is evill, it app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> from whence it proceeds.</p>
                  <p>There be divers sorts of spirits in the world, or divers tempers of spirit, (if you will) and we are bidden to try them, whether they be of God or no; and why? even to the end that we may know whether that which comes from them be good or no; for one and the same act, proceeding from divers spirits, or divers tempers of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be good or bad, this act of <hi>Elias</hi> from him was good, because he had a spirit inflamed only with divine zeale of Gods glory, at that time much darkned in <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> but if the Disciples had done the same, it had not beene good in them, for their spirits were some what too carnall, and did looke too much toward private revenge: so prayer is a good act from a sincere spirit, but from a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53473:83"/>
proud and Pharisaicall spirit, it is not so, for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Gospell condemnes such prayers, for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits sake they proceeded from; so Almes is a good act, from a tender-hearted selfe-denying spirit, but from a selfe-seeking spirit, it is not so; fasting from an humble-broken spirit, is a good duty, but not so from an high selfe-conceited spirit, as appeares also from our Saviours <note place="margin">Mat. 6. v. 2. 5. 16.</note> rebuke of those duties from such spirits: zeale from a knowing spirit is good and commendable, but not from an ignorant spirit, as the Text shewes: and the like may we say of all actions and motions, they are good or bad, according to the temper of the spirit from which they proceed.</p>
                  <p>O that this were well weighed, and considered of in <note place="margin">Use.</note> these times, for then I doubt not, but many of our now a day motions, much of our fond zeale, and many of our furious expressions, against those we know not, and against the things we are not acquainted with, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the mad carriages of private men, in ordering, as they call it, or rather in disordering of things in Church and Common-wealth, would be found not to be very good or commendable, as not comming from such spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as becomes the followers of Christ to be guided by, and to worke withall.</p>
                  <p>Well, let us all be admonished to set a watch before our hearts, and to examine all those actions, and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that proceed from us, whence they come, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they goe, from what spirit they proceed, and to what end and purpose they tend, even as a carefull watchman that is set to watch at a doore, will examine all passengers, whence, and whither, and what about they come and goe; for by this we shall come to have some knowledge of our spirits, and when we once know our spirits to be right, and good, we shall have a great
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53473:83"/>
deale more comfort in our actions and motions then else we can have: And truly we have great reason to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after the knowledge of our owne spirits, for we shall never know our selves, nor God, nor Christ, as we ought to doe, to aime at Gods glory in all we doe, till we know our owne spirits. And so much the rather too, should we study this point, because we see two great Apostles here ready to precipitate themselves into a bloudy act, from their ignorance of this point, and if such as they did, then very easily may we, if they were ignorant of their owne spirits, then may we be ignorant of ours, notwithstanding that great good conceit we have of our selves; but how we shall know our spirits to be right indeed, I shall intimate to you anon, when I come to the Use of the next point, which is this.
<q>
                        <p>All motions that are unsutable to the end of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">Observ. 4.</note> are sinfull motions.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may observe that our Saviour doth dislike the Disciples motion here, because it did not sute with the end of his owne comming, it did not looke that way, it was a destructive motion, and his comming was to a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving end, and had saving effects, therefore I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what ever motion sutes not herewith is not good, but blameable.</p>
                  <p>And I may warrant my conclusion, by those faulty motions which have beene exemplified in already, as that which was about a place of temporall preferment, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 21.</note> a matter that suted not with the end of his comming, and therefore our Saviour rejects it as naught: so, when <hi>Peter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 52.</note> beganne to move and stirre with his sword, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bade him put it up into its place, for he came not to move that way, not to fight against, but to fight for his enemies, not to kill them, but to save them: And so
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53473:84"/>
now adayes, we see the world is full of motions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of commotions, many active stirring spirits this age hath brought forth, if their motions and stirrings doe tend to the destruction and hurt of others, and not to the good of men, if they looke not the way Christ looked, if they sute not with his end, they are naught and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>But in very deed, as in our Saviours time men were much mistaken in the end of Christs comming, they thought hee came to destroy his enemies, and to restore againe the kingdome to <hi>Israel,</hi> and to advance his servants to temporall honours, and therefore (as you heard) hee had motions made to him tending to that purpose: so in these our dayes men are much mistaken in the same, at least they doe not remember it as they ought to doe, whereas it is a matter of the greatest consequence to bee knowne and thought upon, as appeares by those many inculcations thereof in Scripture: I shall therefore for the better remembrance thereof, and comfort therein, a little inlarge my selfe in the discovery of it from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>The end of Christs comming (saies the text) was not to destroy mens lives, but to save them; and saies the spirit in another place, God sent his Sonne not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <note place="margin">

him a Helper, and a Defender: the similitudes used to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse him by, are of harmlesse and helpfull creatures: He is called a Lamb, not a Wolfe that devoures, a Hen, not a bird of prey, a Vine, not a Bramble, out of which came fire to consume the trees of the Forrest, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
                  <p>The manner of his comming did also teach the end of it; he came not in thunder and lightning (as the Law did) causing feare and trembling, but as raine on a fleece of wooll, or on the mowen grasse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 6. that is, gently and with out noyse: and <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 19. it is said, He neither strived, nor cryed, nor was his voyce heard in the streets: at his Baptisme the holy Ghost sate on him like a Dove, to shew that he should be a Dove-like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and of Dove-like conditions. In the execution of all his offices, he onely aimed to further the comfort and salvation of men: By his propheticall office, hee taught us in the way, and doth so still by his word and spirit, he dictated a forme of prayer for us, he put words into our mouths, and his spirit into our hearts, and still himselfe intercedes for us, and with us: by his Priestly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he died for us, to heale our soules with a plaister of his bloud, and to save us from that death which our selves had procured: and by his Kingly office, he defends and fights for his people, as a meeke King he admits mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to his presence, he hath both beames of Majesty, and bowels of mercy, he is the Prince of peace: yea, all his actions from first to last doth prove that he came only to doe good: How sweet, and helpfull, and affable he was in all his carriages; How willing to acquaint himselfe with these churlish Samaritans, to the end that he might have occasion to doe them good? He vouchafed to discourse with a meane woman of that Countrey, to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Disciples <hi>(John</hi> 4. 7.) and sent his servants to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53473:85"/>
buy meat of them, as it is shewne in that Chapter; and here he would have taken up his lodging amongst them; and after this discourtesie was offered to him, he cured a Samaritan of his leprosie, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 16. and was so cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to that Nation, that the Jewes call'd him Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan for his labour: And how lovingly did he cure <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> ear, that came to apprehend him? and how fervently did he pray for them that put him to death? he came with blessings in his mouth at his first publike appearance and manifestation, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he departed the world with prayers in his mouth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. Father forgive them: In a word, Christ never did hurt or mischief to any man, he never revenged himselfe on any, though he had more power then any, and was more wronged and abused then any, but he was alwayes, and to all, meek, gentle, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, helpfull: a man might even drown himselfe in Divine pleasures by thinking and speaking of Christs conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of the comfortable end of his comming.</p>
                  <p>But I come to the Use: which shall bee to advise all men to acquaint themselves well with the end of Christs <note place="margin">Use.</note> comming: it is worthy of all acceptance, saies the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of all mens knowledge, to be acquainted with this, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to doe good to unworthy and undeserving persons: it is a matter of the greatest consequence that is, to know it, for thereby we shall come to know Christs spirit, we shall come to know our owne spirits, and we shall come to know other mens spirits.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We shall know Christs spirit, which else we shall not doe, as appeares in the Disciples here, for had they knowne and remembred the end of Christs comming, they would also have considered, that he had had a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit onely driving thereunto, and so would never have made such an unsutable motion as here they did, they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53473:85"/>
might easily have concluded that Christ would never so farre have allowed of <hi>Elias</hi> spirit, as to doe, or to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to be done that which did contradict the end of his owne comming, they would never have begg'd of the Prince of meeknesse a licence to be cruell, for had he given way to this he should have seemed to come rather to destroy then to save.</p>
                  <p>Now this our knowledge of Christs spirit, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and temper of it, may be usefull to us for consolation, and for instruction.</p>

For consolation, we being all men and women of a sinfull dye: when we be apprehensive of our danger by sinne, and how unkindly we have carried our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards good Christ, how we have many a time denied him a lodging in our hearts (as the Samaritans here did in their Village) when by his motions he hath sent unto us: I say, when with griefe and sorrow we thinke of these miscarriages; we cannot but be comforted to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber withall, that Christs spirit is cleane contrary to the spirits of angry and revengefull men, as hath appeared by the end of his comming, and this passage with his Disciples: It was a great comfort to the <hi>Syrian</hi> King and his Nobles, when they were in the King of <hi>Israels</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to remember that the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were mercifull Kings; so may it be to us being in Christs danger, to consider that he is a Prince of a mercifull spirit: onely let us be carefull not to abuse his goodnesse in after times, and doubt not but we shall taste of the sweetnesse of his spirit not withstanding what is past.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For instruction and information; that we doe not henceforth molest and grieve the spirit of Christ with such unsutable motions as the Disciples here did, and as we sometimes use to doe; you know it is the condition of many a man, if he be but crossed in his way, and vext

by an enemy, especially unjustly, presently he is ready to desire that ruine and destruction might fall upon him, and perhaps by prayer or imprecations is bold to request Christs aide in the businesse; nay such is the weaknesse of some, that if any man or creature, dogge, or horse, or hawke, offends them, they will curse the same, and call upon the name of God and Christ, to send some judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Heaven upon it, to joyne with them in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mischiefe: well, I say we should never doe thus, never should we make any revengefull motions to Christ, to grieve his sweet spirit, did we well know Christs spirit and the end of his comming: therefore I say, note well the nature and temper of Christs spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By being well acquainted with the end of Christs comming, and with the nature of his spirit, we shall come to know our owne spirits, and whether the motions that come from them be good or no: the Disciples here were ignorant of the evill of that motion that came from themselves, because they considered not the end of Christs comming.

of others: would Jesus Christs spirit allow of it? would he if he were here, and in my case, doe it? and even as he thinkes Christ would doe in such a case, so doth he doe and no otherwise: (but more of this in the next point.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We shall know the spirits of others, (by being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the end of Christs comming, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his spirit) which naturally we desire to doe, more then to know our owne: nor indeed is it unlawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and indeavour to discerne them: we are bidden to try the spirits whether they be of God o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Lord (saies he) hath given us power to edification, and not to destruction; and therfore in another place, I became all things to all men, that I might winne some: in a word, the spirit of the Gospel is in all the children of the Gospel, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it their duty to doe nothing but what is sutable to the spirit of the Gospel, which also is a matter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes all that live under the Gospel: and that is our last point.

This also is manifest from the text, by our Saviours dislike, and confutation of his Disciples motion, because it did not savour of a Gospel-like spirit: what doe you tell me, saies he, of <hi>Elias</hi> his spirit, now the Sonne of man is come?</p>
                  <p>Now to informe you somewhat of the nature of the times of the Gospel, and of the spirit thereof: I must tell you that there is a great difference betweene the former times and these, not in respect of time it selfe, for that is alwayes the same, but in respect of a new spirit which Christ by his comming brought with him: we have a phrase of speech, the Genius of the times, or the spirit of the times: some times are turbulent, and then we say, a turbulent spirit is in the times; some times are more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and then we say, a more peaceable spirit ruleth; in some times the vulgar sort of men generally are more bold and impudent with their betters and superiours, then is decent and comely, and then some will say, the Genius of the times is a sawcy fellow; sometime the world travels with perversnesse, sometime with envie and hatred, sometime with one domineering sinne, and sometime with another, and men in their language will attribute it to the spirit of the times: But indeed such as the spirits and conditions of men are, such are the times, for men denominate times to be good or bad; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of good men, make good times, and abundance of wicked men, doe make the times abundantly wicked: But concerning the difference between the former times and these.</p>
                  <p>The times before Christ, were times of ignorance and darknesse, men were bad and did not know it, but when Christ came, he brought with him a spirit of light and knowledge, to discover sinne, and to convince the world thereof, and so the times were changed to be times of

Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that the Disciple and the Master must both have one spirit, if we be Christs Disciples, we must shew Christs spirit in all our wayes, if we live in the times of the Gospel, it is our duty to mind, speake, and doe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which sutes with the spirit thereof.</p>
                  <p>When we purpose any thing in our hearts, or rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of any thing in our thoughts, we must aske our owne consciences, Is this purpose, are these cogitations suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the spirit of the Gospel? are they gratefull to Christs spirit? would Jesus Christ, were he in my case, purpose the same thing? would he ponder and meditate upon such thoughts as I now doe? So for our words, we must consider whether they doe become the Gospel of Christ, whether they be gracious and seasoned with the right salt, and doe tend to the edification of others, (for such words onely become the Gospel) a man should aske himselfe, Was it Christ Jesus his manner to speake thus, to use such words as I now doe? so when we act a thing, we must consider and ask our consciences, Whose worke is it? is it such a worke as the Gospel allowes of, or as Christ was wont to exercise himselfe in? I live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, and it is my duty to thinke, speake, and doe, onely that which becomes the spirit thereof, I am a member and a servant of Christ, and it is my duty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my selfe onely such a one.

Beleeve it, it is our duty to sift our selves in this sort; nay, if the spirits be truly Gospel-like, it is your customes to do thus, and so from hence all that ever proceeds from you, will savour of meeknesse and love, of sweetnesse and goodnesse, all your indeavours will tend the same way as Christs did to save and helpe others, to doe good to all, hurt to none, onely your labour will be to destroy sinne, and the workes of the Devill in all, for to this end Christ came, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. lying, slandering, malice, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, churlishnesse, unkindnesse, disobedience, and the like, these are the workes of the Devill, and these Christ laboured to destroy, and of the same minde and indeavours are all his servants.</p>
                  <p>Yea, if your spirits be right, you will alway beleeve, that you were borne into the world to this very end, to imitate Christ, to set forth his conditions to others eyes by your life and carriage, to be an instrument of mercie, as he was the author of it, to manifest your strength and power even as Christ did, namely, in bearing wrongs, in pardoning offences, and in praying for offenders: I say, if your spirits be right indeed, this is their temper, for God doth frame a mans heart to the same end for which hee sends him: even as he did furnish Christ himselfe with a spirit su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

he hath wrought the effects of his comming in us, to be of his mind, of his conditions, and of his spirit, and to intend the same things as he did: examine your selves by this.</p>
                  <p>We have many in these dayes, that thinke and say they have the spirit of Christ, onely because they are professors of Christ, although they discover none of his conditions; nay, I wish they did not rather discover themselves to be enemies unto them, as they are in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: shall I instance in a few particulars?</p>
                  <p>We have some (even of those that professe Christ) if they see a man of a good nature, of a patient and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding spirit, that is for peace, and that indeavours to gaine them as Christ did, by love and suffering, and selfe-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; why, they will be sure to lay on load enough, like those unreasonable men, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> desires to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from, they will never leave burdening him with injuries and unkindnesses; that so, if possible, they may turne his love into hatred, and his patience into passion, and so force him to be weary of his good way, and to doe something in a distemper, as may helpe to confirme in mens minds their fore-vented slanders of him: Christ did not doe thus, nor doe such doings savour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; it is not our profession therefore, or our pretensions, but our conditions that must prove us right.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Christ found men bad, and made them good, and opened all the wayes of good for them to walke in; but we have many that say they are for Christ, who if they doe not find men bad, will take a course to make them so, at least in others eyes; they will invent evill, and cast it upon them, as that holy King complained they dealt with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 3.

                  <p>Againe, Christ hides our blemishes, he covers our sinnes; yea, if we have once truly with griefe confessed them, he quite forgets them, and blots them out of his remembrance for ever, this was his way of winning men: but we have some that goe for the best in their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes, who if they get a matter against another that deserveth blame (as what man liveth and sinneth not?) they will be sure to lay it up (as they say) till a rainy day, that is, they will remember it, and upon all occasions, for their owne conceived advantage, and the others vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, dammage and disgrace, repeat and publish it, though perhaps it hath beene confessed on the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents part, againe and againe, both to God and them with sorrow: Sure this was not Christs way, not is it a way of winning, but rather of making an everlasting se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, although before there was never so neere a conjunction. <hi>Tegens praevaricationem persequitur charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>

                     <hi>Elias,</hi> some <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and some, one of the Prophets; but rather they would have said, Some say you are a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, some say you have a Devill, and some say you are a friend and companion of Publicans and sinners, as supposing that the hearing of these kinde of reports would have beene more galling to his harmelesse spirit.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, in a word, Christ did not delight in trampling upon those that were already downe, he joyed not in the fall of any of his enemies, no, he wept at the foresight of their ruine that sought his, he would take advantage from mens miseries, and misfortunes, to shew the graciousnesse of his spirit, in doing them good; when his servant had cut off his enemies eare, he healed againe the eare of his enemy: he was to his last, of a most meeke and peaceable spirit; never was he turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the Common-wealth, never outragious, cruell, or bloody, he never in all his life wished for bloody dayes, he never said, Better <hi>Jerusalems</hi> streetes runne downe with blood, then that these Pharisaicall High Priests should still stand, or then one old tradition should still continue; No, no, Christ wished the reformation of things as truely as any of us can do, in such a case; and he could as little away with the manners of those men, as any of we, and he did as much distaste humane, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ceremonies in Gods service; but he valued mens lives at a higher rate then to desire the abolition of such things with so much humane blood, as that the streetes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53473:96"/>
should swimme therewith: Christ knew the price of mens lives, and it cost him more to redeeme them, then to have them destroyed so lightly, he knew that it was never Gods minde, that his <hi>Sion</hi> should be built with the blood of Brethren, as <hi>Rome</hi> was: Christ would rather hope and pray, that all offensive things might be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a peaceable manner, for he came not to destroy, but to save mens lives; and the same minde, (as I have heard) have all they that have the spirit of Christ, the true spirit of the Gospell; of what manner spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those are of, that are contrary-minded, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I leave to you to judge, from that which hath beene spoken, and come to the other use, which is of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>
                  <p>I will direct my Exhortation in the first place, to my <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Use</hi> 2.</note> Brethren of the Ministery in particular, and then with them, unto all Christians in generall.</p>
                  <p>First, My Reverend Brethren, you in speciall, whom God hath restrained and guided by his Spirit, from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into those scandalous faults, and offensive wayes, which too too many of our Order are reported to have slipped into; you who have beene lately under burdens and pressures of troubles and molestations, whom God hath now delivered; you, to whom he hath given fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the eyes of men; (if Providence shall ever bring these weake lines unto your Christian view) I beseech you in the bowels of Jesus Christ, and by the vertue of the true Spirit of the Gospel, which I hope is both in you and me, that you all indeavour both by your teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and practice, to discover at large, that which hath here but in briefe beene discoursed upon: even the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this holy, sweete, and gracious Spirit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell: and to perswade you hereunto, be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of these few particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:53473:97"/>
First, the times require this at your hands; how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted and broken they are, your eyes are able to see better then I am to expresse: and there is no other meane to make up the breaches of our Sion, and to prevent the lamentable ruines that are threatned unto our <hi>Israel,</hi> but onely this Spirit of the Gospell; and this yeelding, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, loving, humble selfe-denying, and obedient Spirit, is able to set all right againe, both betwixt God and us, and amongst our selves were this spirit but well planted in every heart that we Preach unto, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bosome we converse withall, there would be both a generall, and a particular fitnesse, both for divine Mercy, and for a mutuall closing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Your relation to God calls for these indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, the Lord hath put you in place to advance this Spirit, nay, he hath intrusted you to dispence the same, you are intituled Ministers of the Gospell, and your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration is called the Ministration of the Spirit; and you are alwayes beside your Text, and out of your Office, when you are not labouring to plant the same, nay, you should be, not friends, but enemies to God, and to the soules of men, if you should not oppose and discover the seeds-men of schisme, and the waterers of sedition, if you are favourers of factions, you are makers of fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and God in the end will neither blesse you, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Your bounden duty, and sworne Allegeance to your Prince, and Soveraigne, under the wing of whose gracious government, you have already both done and received much good, to the advancement of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent comfort and future Crowne, doth challenge you to move with all your strength, to the implanting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Gospell, in the hearts of all his subjects, that their piety and loyalty, their obedience and love to God,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53473:97"/>
to him, and to each other, may speake him to all the world, to be the happyest King of the truest and best Christians; yea, and his Majesty too, thus seeing his Saviours Spirit and his owne, in all his people, shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with comfort amongst us prolong his dayes, and the good pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand; I am confident, and dare boldly say it, it is in your powers to compose and settle all our distractions and divisions, if you would all worke one way, and let that one way be this way; it being Gods way, he would helpe you and blesse you in it, he hath already given some of you the hearts of men, for an ingagement hereof, and he would doubtlesse incline them to goe with you.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Pity may begge this favour at your hands, (if it be a favour, and not a duty) pity to the poore spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Gospell it selfe, which hath of late (as some of you have thought) beene wounded, slandered, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, yea, almost banished the Land, for a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, factious, and seditious spirit, and some of you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have beene banished with it, by the enemies of it; but now God hath removed them, and remembred you, and why thinke you? surely that you should be meanes to recall, and relieve that, to justifie its Innocency, its Humility, and its Loyalty, which was so much traduced that you might by your Preaching, and by your Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, raise up againe (as it were) unto life, this holy, sweete, and gracious spirit of the Lord: And know this, if you faile herein, and doe conceale the beauty of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now power to discover and inlarge the same, God may, and will for this, bring you under hatches againe, and your latter condition shall be worse then your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Never had you the like occasion as now, to honour Gods Spirit in the eyes of your enemies; and to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53473:98"/>
put forth the vertue of it for their conversion; what know you but that the sight and taste of the Spirit of the Gospell, in and from you, may cause some of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, (that haply now are in that darkenesse and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, wherein they would gladly have kept you) to looke upon their owne spirits with indignation and shame; surely, (Brethren) as we should alwayes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret an enemy his injury, to be Gods call to us, to pray for him; so we should apprehend the sight of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies misery to be an indigitation of God to us, to doe him good; and to discover to his eyes (which at such a time are at best leasure to see it) the nature and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs Spirit in our selves; And thereby we may haply (as was said) bring such a one out of love with that spirit which he formerly traded withall, when he compares the present sweetnesse of our spirit, with the bitternesse of that, and hereby we may bring them to love our Master Christ, that rules us with a better spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit then their Master ruled them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, and lastly (though I might propound many particulars more) if you doe not study and indevour to shew forth Christs Spirit, the contrary thereunto both must and will discover it selfe in you, even that which before you disliked so much in other men, God will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven give you up unto it; now consider how uncomely it will appeare for Gods Ministers to walke in condemned paths, you censured such and such men for their cruelty, for their mercilessenesse and want of compassion, for their pride, their harshnesse and superciliousnesse towards their Brethren, and for these things sake (I suppose) you counted them antichristian but if you now tread in those their steps, wise men will think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> you to be as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian as they, and that most truely, for (what ever some say) doubtlesse it is not Prelacy, but sin, that makes men Antichristian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:53473:98"/>
And suppose those your enemies were altogether as bad as you thought them then, those their conditions will worse become you then they did them: it is cruelty in the Wolfe to hurt the Sheepe, but more naturall, then for the Sheepe to pursue the Wolfe; they say, revenge is sweet, and the taste of bloud will make even a Sheepe Wolvish, he that once hath drunke the bloud of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, will afterward thirst for the bloud of his friend upon a small occasion.</p>
                  <p>Doe you thinke it will be comely, to heare people say of us, it seemes the Lambes are let out to play the Wolves? Christs Ministers are call'd from prison and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to revenge themselves, to persecute those that hunted them, their former afflictions wee had thought had meekened their spirits, and taught them to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their enemies, and to them in misery, as Christ was, we beleeve Gods providence laied them upon them for that end, but we see they have done them little good: surely (brethren) such speeches will be but little for our credits: and let us know if we turne rampant now we are got loose, and deale with others as they did with us, and not shew the spirit of Christ to our enemies, God the great Shepheard, hath an hooke to catch us by the legge againe, and to hamper us worse then ever, if the Wolfe could not run from him, the Sheepe cannot.</p>
                  <p>Therfore I say from these considerations, let us onely preach and practise the spirit of the Gospel, be pitifull, be courteous, pity the sorrowes of our enemies, but most of all their sinnes that have brought them into the same, if ever we loved them according to Christs command, we shall now pity them, for true love alwayes turnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pity when the parties loved fall into misery, let us not delight to spur on others against them, let us not aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and inlarge their faults, let us not repeat them; it is a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53473:99"/>
sad thing to heare Ministers or any others to publish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and with joy, how many hundreds of their scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous brethren have beene complained of: I doe not read that ever Christs spirit delighted in such like publications; Christ was mild to offenders, let not us be rugged, Christ indeavoured to draw men from their sinnes unto himselfe by love, let not us thinke ever to doe it by currishnesse, our enemies could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile by this meane, they that thinke by force of feare, or unkind dealings, to draw men either to God or to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, will sooner drive them both from God and from themselves, we must trade for Christ in Christs way, else let our aimes and ends be never so good, though God may haply accomplish them, yet he will crosse and shame us: in a word, (my Reverend Brethren) if some of our calling and function, have stumbled and fallen, if they like those branches <hi>(Rom.</hi> 11.) are for a season bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and any of us are ingraffed in their stead, and doe now partake of the favour, and fatnesse of the times, let us not boast our selves against these branches, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we stand onely by mercie; be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded (saies the Apostle) but feare: Breathing times of the Church, unthankfully entertained, or too wantonly, proudly, or unprofitably imployed, have beene hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followed with most sharp and sad calamities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But now last of all, a word more to all Christians in generall, and then an end.</p>
                  <p>You redeemed of the Lord, whom in mercie he hath reserved till these last dayes, to live under the Gospel, and to partake of the spirit thereof, and to manifest the fruits of it to the honour of his name: I beseech you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, even by the mercies of Christ, and for that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake which you are bound to advance, that you would lay aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53473:99"/>
and evill speakings, and that you would study by all meanes to glorifie the Gospel which you professe, that you would, according to your duty, onely minde, speake, and doe that which is sutable to the spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: let your intentions, words, and actions, be mild, gentle, tender, and compassionate towards all men: and to this end let me propound to your considerations also, these few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These Gospel-like conditions are the onely markes that doe difference you from other men: If, saies our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. you love them onely that love you, and do good only to your friends, what doe you more then the Heathens or Publicans? what goodnesse of spirit do you shew more then they? but saies he, if you be my servants, I must have you excell other men, therefore I say unto you, love your enemies, those that hate, curse, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute you, those whom none else will love, that so you may shew your selves to have such a spirit as none else have, and to be the children of the most High, who doth doe good to the unthankfull, and to the evill: Christ would that the carriages and conditions of his servants should speake as loud to the world whose they are, as the conditions of the wicked doe speake to whom they belong: doth not the mercilesse, cruell, and bloudy dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Papists in <hi>Ireland,</hi> speake them to be the very members of Antichrist, and limbs of him that was a murderer from the beginning? O let the mercifull, tender, and gentle carriages of the Protestants in <hi>England,</hi> speak them also, to be the members of Christs, and children of him that loved us from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>In the Primitive times the Christians were knowne from all other men, onely by their discovery of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Gospel in them: the story saies, that in the time of that great Famine and Pestilence under <hi>Maximinus,</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:53473:100"/>
that the Christians onely did shew compassion to the Heathen, their persecutors, travelling up and downe, some in burying the dead, and some in helping the sicke, when they were of their owne sort forsaken; yea, and other some of the Christians call'd and gathered the company together which were in danger of death by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and distributed bread unto them, whereby they ministred occasion to all men to glorifie the God of the Christians.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, you are their successers in profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, let it appeare that you are also their successors in the possession of the same holy and loving spirit, by your not degenerating from their conditions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider you are called of God into the state of Christianity, for this very end, to discover to the Age wherein you live these Gospel-like conditions: see 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8, 9. Finally, saies the Apostle, be all of one mind, have compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitifull, be courteous, not rendring evill for evill, or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing, knowing that you are there unto called, that you should inherit a blessing; there you see, first, that you are called to manifest these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: and secondly, that your manifestation of them doth fit you to inherit the blessing of God: And I pray (friends) who should set forth and shew the sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the spirit of the Gospel, if you should not who are called there unto? your enemies will not, they are all for the contrary spirit, for railing, lying, hatred, bloud, revenge, rebellion, nor doth God call them to so holy and so cleane a worke as this is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider it is a great honour which God hereby doth call you unto; even the greatest that is, namely to present his owne selfe, and his Sonne to the darke world; Jesus Christ was the Image of the everlasting Father,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53473:100"/>
in whom was cleerely discovered all Gods fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and dispositions, his meeknesse, patience, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse, mercie, pity, and all his lovely graces and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as you may see and observe in the story of Christ, and his carriage in the Gospel: And (Brethren) you are appointed to be the Images of Christ to discover the same things to other men: and is not this a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? therefore you must walk as Christ walked, and manifest to the world all those lovely graces and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were transparent in him: there be many men that cannot read the Bible to observe Gods and Christs affections and conditions there, many will not, they care not for it, now the Lord therefore in pity to these poore creatures, hath ordained you to be living Bibles to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to their view what ever in the written word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and commanded, he would have you alwayes in a visible sort to represent to their eyes, himselfe and his Christ by your carriages: O therefore behave your selves worthy of the honour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider that your neglect of duty herein will make you above measure sinfull, and answerably distastfull, both to God and man: God threatned to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets more vile and contemptible then others, because of their unworthy walking in so high a calling; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Vineyard which hee had honoured with his cost and care, from which he expected good, brought forth wild Grapes, he exposed it to utter r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Lord deliver me (will they say) from having dealings with such a one, his blowes are more bloudy then other mens, they pierce deeper, his profession puts a sharpe edge upon a slander, and more poyson into it: wherefore (as the Apostle saies)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53473:101"/>
Shall I take the members of Christ, and make them the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15.</note> members of a Harlot? God forbid: so doe thou that art a professor say, Shall I take the tongue of Christ, and make it the tongue of a railer, of a slanderer, of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. Consider that by the carefull performance of this yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ur duty, you shall have honour both from God and man, He that honours me, saies God, I will honour: and he that confesseth me, saies Christ, before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father: Who honours God, and confesseth Christ aright, but he that imitates Gods and Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

6. And lastly, Whereas there is much talke now adayes, and men pray that Christ alone might rule in his Church: consider and know, that by acting one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his spirit, and by manifesting the conditions thereof, in your words and wayes, you advance him faster into his Throne, then all the Bookes that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for, or against Church governement are able to doe; whereas on the otherside, by pride, and contention, and faction, and cruelty, and divisions, and the like, Christ is kept out of the chaire of his Kingdome: surely, the spirituall Government of Christ is chiefely exercised o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the spirit or inward man, and therefore it is a matter of more concernment, to indevour the Introduction of that into your hearts, that so there may be a fitted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to busie your heads with fancyes about exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Administrations: God would quickely advance Christ into the Throne of his Church, if he were first well enthroned in all our hearts, if his spirit were but all in all there, himselfe would quickely be all in all else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and every where; but while men will hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-head, doe all themselves, revenge themselves, pull downe their enemies themselves, and thinke nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will be done, or can be well done, unlesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have a finger in the businesse, and suffer Christ to doe nothing alone, or in his owne way, leave nothing to his power, wisdome, and providence, to be effected in his time; for my part, I cannot see any such unjust keepers of Christ out of the Throne of his Kingdome, as are these themselves: But you (beloved of the Lord) be you wise, and waite upon Christ in his way, submit your selves wholly to the governement of his sweet spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, let it command all your members, let it order all your carriages, let your thoughts, words, and actions, savour of it, and so you shall approve yourselves the
