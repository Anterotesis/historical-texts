         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and informed him of that
horrid and wicked deſign of the Papiſts, who
promiſed this <hi>Informant</hi> a Protection.</p>
            <p>And though this <hi>Informant</hi> Petitioned of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for the ſame, yet he was refuſed inſomuch
that he was neceſſitated to go diſguiſed in a

to all Parrish Prieſts for to make a diligent
inquiry after this <hi>Informant.</hi> who finding
him at <hi>Carrigfergus</hi> above Fourſcore Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from <hi>Dublin</hi> he was there commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Goal</hi> by one Captain <hi>Davis</hi> a Juſtice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107455:4"/>
of the peace, where he remained for three weeks,
until this Informant ſent him the ſaid <hi>Davis</hi> word,
that he was taking the advice of the <hi>Fryer</hi> that was
in his Houſe for to deſtroy the Kings Evidence.
Upon which he diſcharged this Informant.</p>
            <p>And this Informant coming at leaſt Eighty
Miles diſtant, an other way backwards for to ſhelter
himſelf to one Eſquire <hi>Lamberts,</hi> in the County of
<hi>Meath,</hi> where he worked for his living about a Months
time, and underſtanding the deſign of the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
going on apace went to one Serjeant <hi>Osborne</hi> one of
the Kings Council, and diſcovered to him a great
deal of the ſaid Plot, but inſtead of acting as the
Kings Council or Loyal Subject, he to the contrary
ſent this Informant to the Goal of <hi>Trinn</hi> in the
County of <hi>Meath,</hi> where he remained for 3 weeks
in a ſtarving condition in Irons, until he was removed
from thence to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and his Leggs tied under the
Horſes belly, and then was brought before Sir <hi>John
Davis</hi> Secretary of State, who at the firſt ſight
called this Informant a Rogue, and ſaid that he was
in Priſon at <hi>Carrickfergus;</hi> this Informant replied
that it was by the unjuſt means of his Brother for
diſcovering the Truth againſt him; This Informant
being brought to the Council Board, the Lord
Chancellor and Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> came to examine
this Informant, who told them, he was not
willing to be examined by them, by reaſon the one
was Sir <hi>William Davis</hi> his Brother and the other
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107455:5"/>
his Father in Law; yet however to avoid all that
they ſhould pretend, this Informant told and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
more to them than they were willing to
hear; for which they returned this Informant to
Priſon, who was diſcharged the next day, but
by whoſe means he cannot tell, neither could he
get any protection or ſafety; but expoſed to the
Malice of his Enemies, this Informant went
to another remote part of the Kingdom in the
County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> with an intent to take
Shipping and to come for <hi>England,</hi> for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all their villanie, but being there diſcovered
was apprehended and brought to Juſtice <hi>Crocker,</hi>
who ſent this Informant to Sir <hi>William King,</hi> who
committed him to the Marſhalſea at <hi>Limerick,</hi>
until ſuch time as he would ſend to <hi>Dublin</hi> to know
how he was diſcharged there; But Sir <hi>William
Davis</hi> coming Judge of that Circuit, and coming
to <hi>Limerick,</hi> Ordered this Informant to be ſent
to the Dungeon, where he continued for Eight
Months in a periſhing condition, until ſuch time
as the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Hinne</hi> came that Circuit,
and coming to <hi>Limerick,</hi> this Informant could
not get a Petition delivered to him, but was forced
to tie it on the top of a ſtaff, and as the Judge was
paſſing by reached it to him out of a window, and
the Judge having peruſed it, and underſtanding
the cauſe of his Commitment was to ſuppreſs his
Evidence, which this Informant declared often, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107455:5"/>
would ſooner ſuffer Death than conceal ſuch a
bloody deſign, though he was often tempted by
offering him great Sums of Money to conceal what
he knew.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popiſh</hi> partie, to proſecute their bloody
intent, did moſt barbarouſly Murther the ſaid
<hi>Keadagh Meagher,</hi> who was their Treaſurer, when
they underſtood he deteſted their deſign, and turned
<hi>Protestant,</hi> and was reſolved to diſcover all their
horrid and bloody deſigns.</p>
            <p>This Informant hath more to diſcover, but firſt
humbly deſires that he may have his Pardon and
Security.</p>
