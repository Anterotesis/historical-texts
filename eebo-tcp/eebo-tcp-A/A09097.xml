            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE EARLE OF ESSEX, OF HER MAIESTIES PRIVY COVNCEL.</head>
            <p>VVo principal causes among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (right honorable) are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to inuite me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to dedicate any booke or treatise to a person in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the one priuate duty &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other publiquevtility, in respect that the matter may concearne that person for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse the truth, both of these ioyntly, haue moued me at this tyme, to present vnto your honour aboue others, the two bookes ensuing, which conteyne a conference had in Holland not long since, about the pretences &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the crowne of Ingland, as your honour shall perceaue by the preface of each booke, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herof I shall need say no more, but only declare the fore said two causes of this dedication.</p>
            <p>First then I saye, that my particuler obligation towards your honours person, riseth partly of good turnes and benefites receaued by some frendes of myne at your Lordships handes, in your last voyage &amp; exploits in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but principally of far greater fauours receaued from your noble ancestors, I meane not only your father whose untimely death
<pb facs="tcp:14519:3"/>
was to Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no smalle wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, but of your gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also, that worthy Knight Sir VValter Deuorax who though he liued not to come to those titles of honor, wherunto he was borne; yet left he behinde him so rare a memory for his excellent partes of lerning, wit, feuter of body, curtesie, &amp; other such noble comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations, as none in Ingland perhapps the lyke in our tyme, wherin also hath liued your honours great grandfather Sir Henry Deuorax <hi>visconde Ferys</hi> wel remembred yet by diuers of my said frendes obliged vnto him, as also recorded by our Inglish histories, as well for his merits &amp; worthines, as in lyke manner for his match with the heyre of the most famous &amp; noble house of the Bourchers earles of Essex, wherof also your honour <note place="margin">Polyd in vita H. s.</note> is knowne to be disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, &amp; to hold at this day as wel their nobilitie of bloode as dignitie of title, &amp; this shall serue in this place for my perticuler obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, wherof perhapps here-after vppon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, I may giue further relation and testimony to the world, in token of my gratitude.</p>
            <p>But for the second pointe of publique vtilitie, I thought no man more fitt then your honour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate these two bookes vnto, which treate of the succession to the crowne of Ingland, for that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in more high &amp; eminent place or dignitie at this day in our realme, then your selfe, whether we
<pb facs="tcp:14519:3"/>
respect your nobilitie, or calling, or fauour with your prince, or high liking of the people, &amp; consequently no man like to haue a greater part or sway in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of this great affaire (when tyme shall come for that determination) then your honour, and those that will assist you &amp; are likest to follow your fame and fortune.</p>
            <p>And for that it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for your honour to be vnskillfull in a matter which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth your person &amp; the whole realme, so much as this doth, and finding this conference had by two learned Lawyers, to handle the question very, pithely and exactly, and yet with much modestye, and without offence of any, and with particuler affection and deuotion to her Maiestie, &amp; with special care of her safetye: I thought not expedient to let it lye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>published, as also I iudged that no ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were fitter to receaue the same, nor any protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more secure or plausible, then that of your honour, whom God long preserue in all true honour and felicity, to the comfort of your Lordships faithfull seruants &amp; clyents, &amp; to the publique benefite of your country: from my chamber in Amsterdame this last of December. 1593.</p>

            <p>Of the great reuerence and respect dew to kings, and yet how diuers of them, haue bine lawfully chastised by their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthes for their misgouerment, &amp; of the good and prosperous suecesse that god commonly hath giuen to the same; and much more to the putting back of an vnworthie pretender. Cap. 3. fol. 37.</p>
            <p>VVherin consisteth principally the lawfulnes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding agaynst Princes, which in the former chapter is mentioned, what interest Princes haue in their subiects goodes or liues: how othes do by nde or may be broken by subiects towardes their Princes: and finally the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a good king &amp; a Tyrant. Cap. 4. fol. 63.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE, CONTEYNING THE OC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CASION OF THIS TREATIS, with the subiect, purpose, and partes therof.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THER</hi> chaunced not long ago (I meane in the monethes of Aprill and May of this last yeare 93.) to mete in Amsterdam in Holland certayne Gentlemen of diuers nations, qualities and affections, as wel in religion as otherwise: (yet the most part Inglish and Irish) and they had bine in diuers countries, studied different ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and followed vnlike professions: some of souldiars, <note place="margin">Occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> some of lawyers both temporal &amp; ciuil, others of meere trauelors to learne experience and pollicy: And for that the aduises which dayly came from Ingland at that tyme, (the parlament being then in hand) gaue occasion to discourse of Inglish affaires, they fell into diuers poyntes concerning the same: but yet none was treated so largly or so seriously, as was the matter of succession <note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession discussed.</note> and competitors to the crowne, for that it was presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a great while, that some thing would be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereof in that parlament, though one or two of the wisest of that company, held euer the contrary opinion. But when at lenght newes was brought, that nothing
<pb facs="tcp:14519:6"/>
at al had bin done therin, but rather that one or two (as was reported) had bin checked or committed for <note place="margin">M. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely M. V Ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorth.</note> speaking in the same: then came it in question among thes Gentlemen, what should be the causes of such proceding in a matter so waighty and so necessary for al Inglish men to know?</p>
            <p>But two Gentlemen Lawyers of the company, one <note place="margin">Tvvo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvers.</note> of the common law, and the other a Ciuilian, alleaged so many reasons for iustifying the Queenes Maiesties doings in this behalfe, as al did seeme satisfied: for that it was made playne, that it could not stande with the safety eyther of her Maiesty, or of the realme, or of the party himselfe who should be preferred, that any declaration of heyre apparent should be made, during the life of her Maiesty that now is, how dangerons soeuer the delay therof may be estemed for the tyme to come.</p>
            <p>And so the end of this speach, brought in presently the begining of an other, to wit, what weare like to be thes dangers, and who might be likest of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendors to preuaile after her Maiestie, about which matter, ther was much discoursed by diuers parties, but the conclusion of al, was, that both thes poyntes remayned very doubtful, but much more the second, who should preuaile, of the competitors, which they said, did make the former poynt lesse doubtful of the multitude of dangers, that therby did hang ouer the common wealth of Ingland, though it wanted not doubt also in particuler, what and where they should fal, for (said they) whersoeuer many pretenders of the blood royall are knowne to be competitors to a crowne,
<pb facs="tcp:14519:6"/>
ther cannot chuse but many perilles also must be immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the realme.</p>
            <p>To this, one of the company said, that he did not see how ther could be eyther so many pretenders to the crowne as the day before had bin spoken of in that place (for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawyer before named newly come <note place="margin">Many pre tendors to the crovvne of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> out of Ingland, had tould them that he had hard of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me 9. or 10. or more plotts that were debated within the realme, for so many pretenders) or yf ther were any such great number descended of the blood royall, yet their titles could not be so doubtfull, seing it was an easy matter to discerne, who was next in discent of blood, and who not.</p>
            <p>Not so easy, quoth this Gentleman lawyer, for that although it cannot be denyed, but that ther is among al such as may pretend at this day: a certayne knowne order and degree of neernes in blood to some king or Queene that hath possessed the crowne before them: and in this discent it is knowne also commonly, who descendeth of the elder house, and who of the yonger, and other such like vulgar circumstances: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding for that ther be many other poyntes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in this affaire, as the right of the first stock, <note place="margin">Successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubtful &amp; vvhy.</note> wherof ech part doth spring, the disabling of the same stock afterwards by attainders or otherwise: the bastardies or other particuler impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that may haue fallen vppon ech discent or branch therof: al thes thinges (said he) may alter the course of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon supposed right, in him or her, that is taken to be next in blood, as prouing them not to be truly and lawfully the nerest, though they be the next in degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14519:7"/>As for example (said he) the whole multitude of <note place="margin">Three or fovver principal heades of praeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</note> competitors or pretenders which I conceaue may come in consideration, or haue action or clayme to the crowne after her Maiesty that now is, may be reduced to three or fower first heads or principal stocks, to wit, to the house of Lancaster a part, as descendcd of Iohn of Gant Duke of Lancaster by his first wife <hi>Blanche,</hi> sole heyre of the Duchie of Lancaster. And of this branch or stock the most knowne of-spring in thes our dayes are <note place="margin">1. Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> thos Princes that are lineally discended of <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the first surnamed <hi>de boa memoria,</hi> tenth king of Portugal, who marryed with Philip the eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the saide Iohn of Gant by his first wife <hi>Blanche:</hi> and thes Princes are king Phillip of Spayne now king also of Portugal, &amp; the Dukes of Parma and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza, who descended of the same race, as also the Duke of Sauoy one degree after them.</p>
            <p>The second stock is of the house of yorke a part, <note place="margin">2. Yorke.</note> descending of George the Duke of Clarence second brother to king Edward the fourth, who being put to death by the kings order in Cales left a daughter by whom are descended the Earle of Huntington with his brothers, which also haue children, and the ofspring of Geffrey Pole and Sir Thomas Barrington who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the other sister of her that was marryed to the Hastings.</p>
            <p>The third stock was in king Henry the seuenthe who being himselfe of the house of lancaster and <note place="margin">3. The tvvo houses ioyned.</note> warying the eldest daughter of Edward the fourth of the house of yorke, is presumed to haue ioyned thes two houses together, and from this man by his two
<pb facs="tcp:14519:7"/>
daughters (for of his sonne who was king Henry the eight ther remayneth only the Queeue that now is) ther hath proceeded the house of Scotland deuided into the famylies of the king of Scots and Arbella, as also the progeny of the two Earles yet liuing of Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Darby. Vnto thes three heads, which are commonlie knowen to al men, some of ourdayes do add also a fourth, which may seeme more ancient then ether of al thes three, to wit by the Dukes of Brytaine, who are discended dyuers wayes of the blood royal of Ingland as maye easely be declared, whose heire at this day by lineal discent is the Enfanta of Spaine named Dona Ysabella Clara Eugenia daughter to king Philipp. So that heerby wee come to discouer, no lesse then ten or eleuen famylies that may pretend, and haue al of them frends in Ingland, and els wher (as yesterday I told you) who do not fayle in secret to negotiat and lay plotts for them, for that ther are none of thes, so far of, but to their frends it seemeth (the tymes standing as they do) that reasons may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for their preferment, and good hope conceaued of preualying.</p>
            <p>You do wel to adde (said a Captayne ther present) <note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the tyme present.</note> the tymes standing as they do, or at least wise as they are like to stand, when this matter must come to trial, at what tyme, I beleue, not you lawyers, but we souldiars must determyne this title, and then (no doubt) if ther were not only thes tenn by you named, but twenty moore also of the blood royal, that would pretend, and had frends and money to stand by them, we should admit their causes to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:14519:8"/>
and perhapps giue sentence for him, that by your lawes would sonest be excluded, for whe matters come to snatching, it is hard to say who shal haue the bet ter part.</p>
            <p>I do not ad this circumstance of the tyme (said the lawyer) as though it were the only or principal poynt which maketh doubtful the matter of successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though I confesse that it helpeth ther-vnto greatly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the great variety of mens affections, at this day in religion, which do incline them commonly to iudge for him, whom they best loue: but besids this I do say, that were the tymes neuer so quiet, and religion neuer so vniforme: yet are ther great doubtes in many mens heades, about the lawfulnes of diuers pretentions of the famylies before named: but if you adde vnto this, the said wonderfull diuersity in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, which this tyme yealdeth: you shal finde the euent much more doubtfull, and consequently it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though many may remaine in hope to preuaile, seing that wher many are admitted to stand for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, ther diuers may haue probality also of spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>An example you may take, (said the Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawyer) in the Roman Conclaue, at the popes election, wher, <note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claue.</note> among three or sower score Cardinales that enter in for electors, few ther are, that haue not hope also to be elected, not for that they see themselues, all as well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, as others: but because oftentymes when diuers that are more forward by, likely hode cannot be agreed vppon: it falleth to the lott of hun that is fardest of, and so it may among your pretender's (quoth he) in Ingland.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14519:8"/>Your example (said the temporal lawyer confirmeth somewhat of that I meane though it be not al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather in like matter, or maner for that the pope is made by electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; here we talke of a king by succession.</p>
            <p>Your succession, said the Ciuilian, includeth also an election or approbation of the common wealth and so <note place="margin">Successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> includeth also some kinde of election.</note> doth the succession of al kings in Christendome besides, as wel appeareth by the manner of their new admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at their coronations, wher the people are demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded agayne, <hi>if they be content to accept such a man for their King:</hi> thoughe his title of neernes by <note place="margin">Of this more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvards Cap 4. &amp; 5.</note> blood, be neuer so cleere. And therfore much more it is like to be in this case of Inglish pretenders now, wher their lawful neernes in blood is so doubtful as you haue signified, &amp; so I do come to confirme your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proposition, of the doubtfulnes of the next successor in Ingland with an other reason besids that which you haue alleaged of the ambiguity of their true propoinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in blood: for I say further, that albeit the neernes of each mans succession in blood, were euidently knowne, yet were it very vncertayne (as things now stand in Ingland and in the rest of Christendome rownd about) who should preuaile, for that it is not enough for a man to be next only in blood, therby to pretend a crowne, but that other circumstances also must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, which if they want, the bare propinquity or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetrie of blood may iustly be reiected, and he that is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <note place="margin">Neernes only in blood not sufficient.</note> third, fourth, fifth or last, may lawfully be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the first, and this by al law both diuine and humane and by al reason, conscience, and custome of al nations, christian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14519:9"/>To this said the temporal lawyer, you go further (Sir) then I had meant to doe or did conceaue of the matter, for my meaning only was to shew howe many pretenders ther be to the Inglish crowne at this day, &amp; how doubtful the pretentions of diuers of the chiefe of them be, in respect of the many exclusions, stoppes and barres that their aduersaryes or fellow competitors do lay against them: and now you do adde further, that albeit thes stoppes were taken away, and their propinquity in blood were manifest, yet for other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations the course of their next succession by birth may be iustly altered, vppon such considerations as you insinuate, that the Inglish may haue in the admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their next king or Queene, after her Maiesty that now is, which in deede (if it be true) maketh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of succession much more doubtful, then I pretended, which I confesse I haue not so much studied or thought of, for that our common law goeth no further ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, then to the next successor in blood, to consider whether he be lawfully descended or no, therby to giue him the crowne.</p>
            <p>I confesse (said the Ciuilian) that ordinarily nether your law, nor ours doth go any further, especially in thos realmes wher the gouerment goeth by succession <note place="margin">More to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendors.</note> of blood, which I thinke to be the best of al other wayes, but yet ther may happen out such extraordinary cases some tymes, agaynst this ordinary rule, as your common law must needs take also consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them except it wilbe contrary to al other law and reason both diuine and humane, as for example, if it should fal out, that the next in blood should be a natural fool
<pb facs="tcp:14519:9"/>
or a madd man: if he should be taken by Turkes or Moores in his infancy &amp; brought vp in their religion aud would mayntayne the same in your countrey, with al his forces; and other like vrgent cases, wherin it is not probable, but that your common law must needs haue further consideration, then of the bare propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of blood only, for that otherwise it should be a very imperfect law, that hath not prouided for accidents so weighty and important, as thes are, for sauing and conseruing of your common wealth.</p>
            <p>At this speach, the residew of the company began to smile, to see the two lawyers grow into some heate and comparison of their professions. But yet for that both their asseuerations, did tendc to proue one thing, which was the first proposition set downe, to wit, <hi>that the next successor of Ingland must needs be very doubtful:</hi> they requested them both with very great instance, that ech one would be content to proue his <note place="margin">Tvvo prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipal poin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led in this booke.</note> assertion a parte, to wit, the temporal lawyer to shewe that the titles and pretensions of al those ten or eleuen familyes of the Inglish blood royal, which remayne at this day, are ambiguous and doubtful, according to the common lawes of Ingland: aud the ciuilian to declare that albeit their titles by successiou were cleare, yet that as things stande now in that realme, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes neere adioyning, ther may be a great doubt which of them shal preuaile.</p>
            <p>This I say, was the request of the whole company, and the lawyers were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to take it vppon them, and according to thes two poynts it was agreed that the whole speach or conference, should be deuided into two
<pb facs="tcp:14519:10"/>
parts, and that the ciuil lawyer, should begin first, for <note place="margin">Tvvo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of this conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> that it seemed, that his assertion, being wel declared and proued, would giue much light to the other, and so he promised to do, and to be as brief, clere &amp; perspicuous as he mighte, and to reduce al that he would say to certayne principal heades and chapters therby the better to be vnderstood &amp; remembred, and so he began in manner and forme following.</p>

               <p>THE examples before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (said the ciuilian lawyer) of a madd or furious heyre apparent, or of one that were by education a Turke or Moore in religion, or by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depriued of his witt, or senses, do playnely proue that propinquity of birth or blood alone, without other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, is not sufficient to be preferred to a crowne: for that no reason or law, religion or wisdom in the world, can admitt such persons to the gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth by whom, no good, but distruction may be expected to the same, seing that gouerment was ordeyned for the benefit of the weale publique and not otherwise.</p>

               <p>Hereof it doth ensew, that some other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions also must needs be requisit, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">Not only successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sufficient.</note> to gouerment by succession, besides the only propinquity or prioryty in blood, and that thes condicions must be assigned and limited out by some higher authority then is that of the Prince himselfe, who is bounde and limited therby, and yet it seemeth euident they are not prescribed by any law of nature or diuine, for that then they should be both immutable and the selfe same in al countries, (as God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are one, &amp; the same to al, without chainge) wher nothwithstanding we see, that thes condicions and circumstances of succeding by birth, are diuers or different in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, as also they are subiect to changes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuersity of kingdomes, realmes, &amp;

people, as after shalbe shewed more in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, wherby we are forced to conclude that euery particuler countrey and common wealth hath prescribed thes condicions to it selfe and hath authority to do the same.</p>
               <p>For better profe wherof, it is first of al, to be supposed, that albeit sociability or inclination <note place="margin">That no perticuler forme of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is of natu re.</note> to liue togeather in company, man with man, (wherof ensueth both city and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth as Aristotle gathereth in his first booke of politiques) be of nature, and consequently also of God, that is author of nature: though go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment in lyke maner and iurisdiction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestrats which doth follow necessarily vppon this liuing to gether, in company: be also of nature; yet the particuler forme or manner of this or that gouerment, in this or that fashion, as to haue many gouernors, few, or one, and thos eyther Kinges, Dukes Earles, or the like: or that they should haue this or that authority more or lesse, for longer or shorter tyme, or be taken by succession or election, themselues and their children, or next in blood: al thes things (I say) are not by law ether natural or diuine, (for then as hath bine said they should be al one in al countryes and nations, seing God and nature is one to al) but they are ordayned by particuler positiue lawes of euery countrey as afterwards more largely shalbe proued. <note place="margin">To liue in company, is natural to man &amp; the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of al com mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.</note>

benefit of al: is an easy thing, to proue, seing that al ground of realmes and common wealthes dependeth of this poynt, as of ther first principle, for that a common wealth is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the good gouerment, of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude gathered together, to liue in one, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al olde philosophers, law makers, and wise men, that haue treated of gouerment or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes, as Plato in his ten most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bookes, which he wrot of this matter inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling them <hi>of the commou wealth,</hi> and Marcus <note place="margin">Plato de repub.

and feeleth not that natural instinct, which man hath to liue in conuersation, which is a signe rather of a beast then of a man.</p>
               <p>Cicero doth add an other reason for this <note place="margin">4.

               <p>And I haue bin the longer in speaking of this natural instinct to society, for that it is the first fountaine of al the rest, that enseweth in a common wealth, as hath bine said: for of this come familyes, villages, townes, castles, cyties, and common wealthes, al which Aristotle in his bookes before named, doth proue to be of nature, for that this first inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (wherof al thos other things do spring) is of nature, as hath bin declared.</p>

               <p>The like might be said of Carthage in Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca <note place="margin">Africa &amp; Greece.</note> and many cityes and common wealthes of Greece, which in diuers seasons and vppon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers causes haue taken different formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment to themselues.</p>
               <p>The like vve see in Europe at this day, for in <note place="margin">Italie.</note> only Italye what different formes of gouerment haue you?

that common vvealth. Venice and Genua, haue senators &amp; Dukes, but litle authority haue ther Dukes. Florence, Farara, Mantua, Parma, Vrbin and Sauoy, haue their Dukes only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out senators, and there power is absolut. Milan vvas once a kingdom but now a Dukedom, the like is of Burgundy, Lorayne, Bauire Gasco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <note place="margin">Dukes for kings and kings for dukes.</note> and Britayne the lesser, al which once had their distinct kings, and now haue Dukes, for their supreme gouernours. The like may be said of al Germany that many yeares together had one king ouer al, which now is deuided into so many Dukedomes, Earldomes &amp; other like titles of supreme Princes.</p>
               <p>But the contrary is of Castile, Aragon, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, Barcelona, and orher kingdomes this day in Spayne, which vvere first earldomes only and after Dukedomes, and then kingdomes, and <note place="margin">Spayne.</note> now a gayne are al vnder one Monarchy. The like is of Boeme and Polonia which vvere but <note place="margin">Boeme. Polonia.</note> Dukedomes in old tyme, and now are kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. The like may be said of France also after the expulsion of the Romans, vvhich was first a monarchy, vnder Pharamond their first king, and so continued for many yeares vnder Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion, Merouys Childrik and Clodouaeus ther first christened kings, but after they deuided it into fower kingdomes, to vvit one of Paris an other of Suessons, the third of Orleans, and the fourth of Metts, and so it continued for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeares, but yet aftervvards they made it one monarchy agayne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:14519:16"/>England also vvas first a monarchy vnder the <note place="margin">England.</note> Britaynes, and then a prouince vnder the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and after that deuided into seauen king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes at once vnder the Saxons, and novv a monarchy agayne vnder the Inglish and al this by Gods permission, and approbation, vvho in token therof, suffred his owne peculier people also of Israel to be vnder diuers manners of gouerments in diuers tymes, as first vnder Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarques <note place="margin">The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves lib.

               <p>So as of al this, ther can be no doubt, but that the common vvealth hath power to chuse <note place="margin">The real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth her forme of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> their owne fassion of gouerment, as also to change the same vppon resonable causes, as we see they haue done in al tymes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, and God no doubt approueth vvhat the realme determineth in this poynt, for otherwise nothing could be certaine for that of thes changes doth depend al that hath succeeded sythens.</p>
               <p>In like manner, is it euident, that as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth hath this authority to chuse and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14519:16"/>
change her gouerment, so hath she also to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite the same vvith vvhat lavves and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions she pleaseth, wherof ensueth the great diuersity of authority and power vvhich ech <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> one of the former gouerments hath, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Consuls of Rome vvere but for one yeare, other officers and Magestrates vvere for more, or lesse tyme, as their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth did alott them: The Dukes of Venice at this day are for their liues (except in certayne cases wherin they may be deposed) &amp; thos of Genua only for two years and their power (as I haue said) is very smal and much limited, and their heyres haue no clayme or pretence at al after them to that dignity, as the children and next of kinne of other Dukes of Italy haue, though in different sort also: for that the Dukedomes of Ferara, Vrbin and Parma are limited only to heyres male, and for defect therof to returne to the pope or Sea of Rome, Florence and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua for like defects are to returne to the empire and do not passe to the heyrs femal or to the next of kynne as Sauoy and some others do.</p>
               <p>Aud now if we respect God and nature, as wel, might al thes gouerments follow one law, as so different, for that neyther God not nature prescribeth any of thes particuler for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, but concurreth with any that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth it selfe appoynteth, and so it is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued, that God and nature concurred as vvel with Italy when it had but one Prince, as now when it hath so many, and the like with Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14519:17"/>
and the like also with Swizerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which once was one common vvealth only vnder the dukes and Marqueses of Austria and now are deuided into thirtene Cantons or common wealthes vnder populer Magestrates of their owne, as hath bin said: so as when men talke of <hi>a natural Prince or natural successor</hi> (as many tymes <note place="margin">A Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> I haue hard the vvord vsed) if it be vnderstood of one that is borne within the same Realme or countrey and so of our owne natural blood, it hath some sense, though he may be both good or badd, (and none hath bin worse or more cruel many tymes then home borne Princes:) but if it be ment as though any Prince had his particuler gouerment or interest to succeed by institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, it is rediculous, for that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giueth it not as hath bin declared, but the particuler constitution of euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth with-in it selfe, and so much for this first poynt which must be the ground to al the rest that I haue to say.</p>

               <p>First of al then, is to be considered, that of al <note place="margin">A monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy the best go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment.</note> other formes of gouerment the monarchy of a king in it selfe, appeareth to be the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and perfect, and so do hold not only Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle in his fornamed bookes of pollitiques, &amp; namely in his third (with this only condicion that he gouerne by lawes) but Seneca also and Plutarch in his morales &amp; namely in that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <note place="margin">A rist. li. 4. pol. a. c. 9.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14519:18"/>
perfect for that it hath most commodities and least inconueniences in it selft, of any other gouerment, and it is the fitst of al other, for that al people commonly made their choise at the begining of this kind of gouerment, so as of al other it is most ancient, for so we read that among the Sytians, Medes, and Persians <note place="margin">The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> their first gouernours were kings and when the children of Israel did aske a kynge at the hands of Samuel, which vvas a thousand yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Christ, they alleaged for <note place="margin">1 Reg. 8.</note> one reason that al nations round about them had kings for their gouernours, and at the very same tyme, the chiefest cyties and common vvealths of Greece, as the lacedemonians, Athenians, Corinthians, and others, wherof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers afterwards tooke other gouerments vnto themselues, for the abuses in kingly gouermet committed, at that tyme vvere gouerned by kings as at large proueth Dyonisius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseus, <note place="margin">Dionys.

               <p>The Romans also began vvith kings as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue noted, and the reason of this is, for that as our Christian doctors do gather, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>S.

choose vnto themselues a kinge, and do liue vnder a monarchy as the most excellentest of al other gouerments, to which purpose also I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue hard alleaged somtymes by diuers those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of S.

Out of which wordes some do note two points, first that as one the one side the Apostle doth plainely teach that the magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes authority is from God, by his first institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">Tvvo poyntes to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> in that he sayeth, vve must be subiect to them for Gods cause, so on the other side, he calleth it a <hi>humane creature</hi> or a thing created by man, for that by mans free choise this particuler forme of gouerment (as al other also) is appoynted in euery common wealth, as before hath bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: and that by mans election and consent, the same is layd vppon some particuler man or vvoman, according to the lawes of euery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, al which maketh it rightly to be called both a humane creature, and yet from God.</p>
               <p>The second poynt which diuers do note out of thes wordes, is, that S. Peter calleth a king <note place="margin">Hovv S. Peter calleth a king most excellent.</note> most excellent, which thoughe it may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in rcspect of the Dukes authority, wherof immediatly ther followeth mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet may it seeme also to be taken and verified of kingly authority in respect of al other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14519:19"/>
seing that at this tyme when the Apostle wrote this epistle, the chiefe gouernour of the world, vvas not called king but emperour, and therfore seing in such a tyme S. Peter affirmeth the state of kingly gouerment to be most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, it may seme he meant it absolutly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying therby that this is the best kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment among al others, though to confesse the truth betwene the title of king and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ther is litle or no difference in substance, but only in name, for that the authority is equal, euery king is an Emperor in his owne kingdome.</p>
               <p>And finally the excellency of this gouerment aboue al other, is not only proued by the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therof in it selfe, as for that it is most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient simple and conforme vnto nature, &amp; most resembling the gouerment of God himselfe, as hath bin said, but by the effects also and vtility that it bringeth vnto the subiects, with farr <note place="margin">Vtilites of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and in conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> lesse, inconueniences then any other forme of gouerment what-soeuer if vve compare them together: for in the monarchy of one king, ther is more vnity, agreement, and conformity, and therby also celerity commonly in dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of busines, and in defending the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vvealth, then vvher many heades be: lesse pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions also, in one man then in many: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Democratia,</hi> vvher the common people do beare the cheife sway, which is <hi>bellua multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum capitum</hi> as Cicero wisely said, that is, a beast <note place="margin">Cicerol. x offic.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14519:19"/>
trouble, tumults, outrages, and iniustices com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vppon euery litle occasion, especially vvher crafty and conning men may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to incense or assuage them with sugred vvords, such as were the Orators in Athens, and other cyties of Greece, that had this gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r, and the Tribunes of the people of Rome, and other such populer and plausible men, vvho could moue the vvaues, rayse vp the windes, and inkindle the fier of the vulgar peoples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, passions or furies at their pleasure, by which vve see that of al other common vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, these of populer gouerment, haue soonest come to ruine, vvhich might be shevved not only by old examples of Greec, Asia, and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, but also of many cyties in Italy, as Florence, Bolonia, Siena, Pisa, Arezzo, Spoleto, Perugia, <note place="margin">Miseries of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Italy.</note> Padua and others, vvhich vppon the fall or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the Roman Empire (vnder which they vvere before) tooke vnto themselues po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puler gouerments, vvherin they vvere so tossed vvith continual sedition, mutines, and ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of factions, as they could neuer haue ende therof, vntil after infinite murthers massacres and inundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of blood, they came in the ende to be vnder the monarchy of some one Prince or other, as at this day they remayne: so that of al other gouerments this is the vvorst.</p>
               <p>The second forme, which is called Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia or Aristocratia (for that a few and those presumed to be the best, are ioyned together in <note place="margin">Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratia.</note> authority) as it doth participate some thinge

of both the other gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to wit, of monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia and Democratia, or rather tempereth them both: so hath it both good and euil in it; but yet inclineth more to the euil, for the disunion that commonly by mans infirmity &amp; malice, is among thos heades, for vvhich cause the states before named of Venice and Genua, vvhich were wont to haue simply this gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Aristocratia, in that their regiment was by certaine chose senators, were inforced in the end, to chuse Dukes also, as heades of their senates, for auoyding of dissention, and so they haue them at this day, though their authority be but smale as hath bin said.</p>
               <p>We see also by the examples of Carthage &amp; Rome wher gouerment of Aristocratia, tooke place, that the diuision and factions among the senators of Carthage, was the cause why ayde and succor was not sent to Hanibal, their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">

               <p>Euident then it is, that of al other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the monarchy is the best, &amp; least subiect to the inconueuiences that other gouerments
<pb facs="tcp:14519:20"/>
haue, and if the prince that gouerneth alone &amp; hath supreme authority to himselfe, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth God in this poynte of sole gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se vvhy lavves be added to Kings.</note> so could he resemble him also, in wise, discret, and iust gouerment, and in ruling without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: no doubt, but that nothing more excellent in the world could be desired for the prefect fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of his subiects: but for that a king or Prince is a man as others be, and therby not only subiect to errors in iudgment, but also, to passionat affections in his wil: for this cause, it was necessary that the common vvealth, as it gaue him this great power ouer them, so it should assigne him also the best helpes that might be, for directing and rectifying both his wil and iudgment, and make him therin as like in gouerment to God, whom he representeth, as mans fraylty can reach vnto.</p>
               <p>For this consideration they assigned to him first ofal, the assistance and direction of law, wherby to gouerne, which law Aristotle saith. <hi>Est mens quaedam nullo perturbata affectu,</hi> it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <note place="margin">Arist. l. 3. pol. c. vlt.</note> mynde disquieted with no disordinate affection, as mens myndes commonly be, for that when a law is made, for the most part, it is made vppon dew consideration and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without perturbation of euil affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as anger, enuy, hatred, rashnes, or the like passions, and it is referred to some good end and commodity of the common vvealth, which law, being once made, remayneth so stil without alteration, or partial affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14519:21"/>
indifferent to al and partial to none, but telleth one tale to euery man, &amp; in this it resembleth the perfection as it were of God himselfe, for the which cause the said philosopher in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me place, addeth a notable wise sayng, to wit, <hi>that he which ioyneth a law to gouerne with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>

               <p>And first of al, if we vvil consider the tvvo most renoumed and allowed states of al the world I meane of the Romans and Grecians, vve shal finde that both of them began vvith kings, but yet vvith far different lawes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints, about their authorityes: for in Rome the kings that succeded Romulus, their first <note place="margin">Roman Kings.</note> founder, had as great and absolute authority as ours haue now a dayes, but yet their children or next in blood succeded them not of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but new kings were chosen partly by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and partly by the people, as Titus Liuius <note place="margin">Liu. lib. 1. dec. 1.</note> testifieth, so as of three most excellent kings that ensewed immediatly after Romulus, to wit, <hi>Numa Pompilius, Tullius Hostilsus, &amp; Tarqninus Priscus,</hi> none of them were of the blood royal nor of kyn the one to the other, no nor yet Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans borne, but chosen rather from among straingers, for their vertue and valor, and that by election of the senate and consent of the people.</p>

what men commonly haue succeded in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such as haue bin deposed, as namely in Ingland, in the place of thos fiue kings before <note place="margin">A point much to be noted.</note> named that vvere depriued, to vvit, Iohn, Edward the second, Richard the second, Henry the sixt, and Richard the third, ther haue succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the three Henryes, to wit, the third, fourth, and seuenth, &amp; two Edwards, the third and fourth, al most rare &amp; valiant Princes who haue donne infinit importanr acts in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>And this may be sufficient for proofe of the two principal poynts, which you required to be discussed in the beginning of this spech, to wit, that lawful Princes haue oftentymes by their common wealthes bin lawfully deposed, for misgouerment, and that God hath allowed and assisted the same, with good successe vnto the weal publique, and if this be so, or might be so, in kings lawfully set in possession, then much more hath the said common wealth power &amp;

the gouerment of the high Prieste vnder whom at that day they were.

               <p>Out of al vvhich discourse and spech of the Prophet, thes men do gather, that a king is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so restrayned in his power or limited to law as you haue affirmed, but rather that his law is his own vvil, as by thes vvordes of the Prophet may appeare, and much lesse may the common vvealth chastice or depriue him for exceding the limites of law, or doing his vvil, seing that here in this place, God doth foretel that Princes oftentymes shal commit excesses and iniuries, and yet doth he not therfore wil, them to chasten or depose them, for the same but rather insinuateth that they must take it paciently, fot their sinnes, and cry to God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

               <p>Wherunto answered the Ciuilian, that he confessed that Belloy &amp; other his companions that vvrote in flattery of Princes in thes our dayes, did nor only affirme thes things, that the temporal lawyer had alleaged, <hi>and that Princes were lawlesse and subiect to no accompt, reason, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whatsoeuer they did,</hi> but also (vvhich is yet more absurd and pernicious to al common vvealthes) <hi>that al goods, chattels, possessions and</hi>

               <p>For first to say that a king is subiect to no law or limitation at al, but may do vvhat he <note place="margin">Great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities and flate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> wil, is against al that I haue alleaged before of the very institution of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvealth, which vvas to liue together in iustice and order, &amp; as I shewed out of Cicero speaking of the first kings, <hi>Iustitiae fruendae causa bene morati Reges olim sunt constituti.</hi> For enioying of Iustice were kings <note place="margin">Cic. lib. 2. offic.</note> appointed in old tyme that vvere of good life, but if they be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to no iustice at al, but must be borne and obeyed, be they neuer so wicked, then is this end and butte of the common wealth, &amp; of al royal authority, vtterly frustrat:

then may vve set vp publique murderours ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishers theeues and spoylers to deuowre vs in steed of kings, and gouernours to defend vs, for such in deede are kings that follow no law, but passion and sensualitie, and do commit iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, by their publique authority, &amp; then final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vvere al thos kings before mentioned both of the Iewes, gentiles, and christians vnlawfully depriued, and ther successors vnlawfully put vp in their places, and consequently al Princcs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Christianity at this day, who are des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of them, are intruders and no lawful Princes.</p>
               <p>By the second saying also, that al temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes are properly the Princes, and that subiects <note place="margin">An other absurdity.</note> haue only the vse therof without any interest of their owne, no lesse absurdityes do follow, then of the former assertion, for that first, it is against the very first principle and foundation of our ciuil law, which at the first entrance <note place="margin">Institut. imperial l. 2.

               <p>Besides al this, so absurd a saying is this, as it <note place="margin">Slaues &amp; freemen.</note> ouerthroweth the whole nature of a common wealth it selfe, and maketh al subiects to be but very slaues: For that slaues and bondmen, as Aristotle sayeth in this do differ from freemen, that slaues haue only the vse of things vvithout <note place="margin">Arist. lib. 1. polit. c. 4. &amp; 5.</note> property or interest, and cannot acquire or gett to themselues any dominion or true right in any thing, for that what soeuer they do gett, it accreweth to their master, &amp; not to theselues, and for that the condition of an oxe or an asse, is the very same in respect of a poore man, that hath no slaue, for that the oxe or asse getteth nothing to himselfe, but only to his master, and can be lord of nothing of that for which he laboreth: for this cause wittely also sayed Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, that <hi>bos aut asinus pauperi agricolae pro seruo</hi>

               <p>Last of al (for I vvil not ouerlode you vvith <note place="margin">Diuers euident reasons against Belloy.</note> reasons in a matter so euident) if al subiects goods be properly the kings, why then vvas Achab and <hi>Iezabel</hi> king and Queene of Israel, so reprehended by Elias &amp; so punished by god, for taking away <hi>Nabothes</hi> vineyard? seing they tooke but that vvhich was ther owne? nay why vvas not <hi>Naboth</hi> accused of iniquity rebellion and treason, for that he did not yeald vp present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">3.

How haue parlaments oftentymes denyed to their Princes such helpes of money, as they demaunded? Why are their iudges appoynted to determyne matter, of sutes and pleas between the Prince and his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, if al be his and the subiect haue nothing of his owne? And last of al why doth the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, which is a part also of my profession, and receaued in most countries of the vvorld, so straightly inhibit al Princes vppon payne of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, <note place="margin">Cap. ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uamusio. de causi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp;c. super qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And hereby also vve may gather, what the Prophet Samuel meant, when he threatned <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvere to the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of the pro phet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</note> the Iewes with the disorders of kings, that should raigne ouer them, not, that thes disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were lawful or appertayned to a rightious king, but that seing they refused to be vnder the moderate gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their high priests, &amp; other gouernors which God had giuen them hitherto, and required to be ruled by kings as other heathen nations of Egypt, Babilon, Syria, and Persia were, whos manner of gouerment, not only Historiographers, but Philosophers also, and Aristotle among the rest, doth note to <note place="margin">Arist. 1. 5. pol. c. 11.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14519:46"/>
highly displeased almighty God, and this is the true meaning of that place, if it be vvel conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and not to authorize herby iniustice or wickednes in any king, seing the principal poynts recorded to al Princes &amp; kings through out the whole course of scripture, are <hi>diligere iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictum &amp; iustitiam, apprehendere disciplinam, &amp; face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re veritatem,</hi> that is to saye to loue iudgment and iustice to admit discipline &amp; to execute truth, and this is the instruction that God gaue to the Iewes in <hi>Deutronomy</hi> for their kings when they should haue them, which God foretould many <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 3 Reg. 2. &amp; 10. Psal. 2.</note> yeares before they had any, and this is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition that king Dauid left vnto his sonne and successor <hi>Salomon,</hi> at his death, and by him to al other kings and Princcs, and for want of obseruing thes points of <hi>iudgment, iustice, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> &amp; truth vve see not only <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabel.</hi> Before mentioned greuiously punished, but many other kings also by God himselfe, as <hi>Achaz Manasses, Ioachim,</hi> and the like, which had not bin iustice on Gods part so to punish them if it had bin lawful for them to vse that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding towards their people, as thes good instructors of Princes in our dayes, most fondly and wickedly do affirme, and thus much for that place.</p>
               <p>But to the first point which you asked, by vvhat law the common wealthes that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <note place="margin">By vvhat lavv Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are punished</note> in the former chapters, did punish their euel Priuces: I haue answered you before, that it is by al law both diuine and humane: diuine,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14519:47"/>
for that God doth approue that forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment which euery common vvealth doth chuse vnto it selfe, as also the conditions, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and limitations vvhich it selfe shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt vnto her Princes, as largely before hathe bin declared. And by al humane law also: for that al law both natural, national, and positiue, doth teach vs, that Princes are subiect to law &amp; order, and that the common vvealth which gaue them ther authority for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good of al, may also restrayne or take the same away agayne, if they abuse it to the common cuel.</p>
               <p>And vvheras thes men saye, that like as if a <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene a priuat ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealth.</note> priuate man should make his inferior or equal to be his Prince, he could not after restrayne the same agayne, and so nether the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth hauing once deliuered away her authority: I answere, first, that the comparison is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like, for that a priuat man though he giue his voice to make a Prince, yet he being but one maketh not the Prince vvholy as the common vvealth doth, and therfore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though it lye not in a particuler mans ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to vnmake him agayne, besides this, a priuat man hauing giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his voice to make his Prince, remayneth subiect and inferior to the same, but the vvhole body though it be gouerned by the Prince as by the head, yet is in not inferior but superior to the Prince, nether so giueth the common vvealth her authority and power vp to any Prince, that she depriueth her selfe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of the same, vvhen neede shall require, to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14519:47"/>
vse it for her defence, for vvhich shee gaue it.</p>
               <p>And finally (which is the cheefest reason of al, &amp; the very ground and foundation in deede of al kings authority among christians) the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and anthority vvhich the Prince hath from the common wealth is in very truth, not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but <hi>potestas vicaria or deligata,</hi> as vve Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <note place="margin">The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces autho rity but subdele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat.</note> cal it, that is to say, a power delegate, or power by commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, which is giuen vvith such restrictions cautels and conditions, yea, vvith such playne excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, promises, and othes of both parties, (I meane betwene the king and common wealth at the day of his admission or coronation) as if the same be not kept, but vvilfully broken, on ether part, then is the other not bounde to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his promise nether, though neuer so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly made or sworne, for that in al bargaines, agreements and contracts, wher one parte is bound mutually and reciprocally to the other, by oth, vow, or condition, ther, if one side go from his promise, the other sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not obliged to performe his: and this is so notorious by al law, both of nature and nations, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>form to al reason and equity, that it is put among the very rules of both the Ciuil and cannon law, vvher it is said, <hi>frustra fidem sibi quis postulat seruari ab eo, cui sidem à se prestitam seruare recusat.</hi>

               <p>Nay not only, in this case, that is so euident, <note place="margin">VVhen an oth bindeth not.</note> and palpable by nature it selfe: but in many other also, is it both lawful honest and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to leaue some tymes the performance of our oth, as namely vvhen the fulfilling therof, should conteyne any notable hurt or inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience against religion, piety, iustice, honesty, or the vveal publique, or against the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to whom it vvas made, as if a man had sworne to restore a sword to a madd or furious man, wher with it vvere likely he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy himselfe and others, and other like cases, which Cicero putteth downe in his first booke <note place="margin">Cicero li. 1. offic.</note> of offices, and deduceth them from the very ground of nature, and reason it selfe, &amp; sayeth, that it were contrary to the dewty of a good or honest man, in such cases to performe his promise.</p>

                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:14519:61"/>First then touching the acte of coronation <note place="margin">The man ner of French corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and admission of the king of France, euen as be fore I haue said of Spayne, so also in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do I find two manners of that action, the one more ancient which the French do say hath indured in substance from ther first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian king named <hi>Clodoueus,</hi> vnto this day, which is about eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred yeares, for that <hi>Clodoueus</hi> vvas christened the yeare of our Lord 490. in the cytie of Rheims by S.

At vvhat tyme (which is about 500. yeares a gone) both the Chroniclers and Cosmographers of France do teftifie, that ther was a peculier booke in the <note place="margin">Belfor. l. 3 c. 20.

Which order, for so much as toucheth the solemnitie of officers in the coronation and other like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, vvas far different at that tyme, from that which is now, for that in those dayes ther were no peeres of France, appointed to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the same coronation, which now are the chiefe and the greatest part of that solemnirie. Yea <hi>Girard du Hailan</hi> secretarie of France in his third booke of the affaires and state of that <note place="margin">Gerand l. 3 del. b. estat fol. 238.</note> kingdome, sayth, that the ceremonies of crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

their old kinges were much after the fashion which I haue noted a litle before, in this very chapter, out of the law of <hi>Don Pelayo</hi> first king of Spaine, after the Moores, for that they were lifted vp and caried a-bout vppon a target by the chiefe subiects ther present as the spaniards were.</p>
               <p>But as touching the principal point of that action which is the substance of admitting the king vnto his royal authority, and oth by him made of gouerning wel and iustly, and of the reciprocal oth of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made to him againe by his subiects, it was not much different from that which now is, as shal appeare by the coronation of the foresaid Phillip the first, who was crowned in the life and presence of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, king Henry, after the fashion then vsed in the yeare of Christ 1059. and it was in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following, as <hi>Nangis</hi> and <hi>Tillet,</hi> both autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res <note place="margin">Francis Belfor. hist. fran. lib. 3. c. 20 in vita Philip. 1.</note> of great authoritie among the French, do recount it, and Francis Belforest, out of them both repeateth the same at large, in thes words following.</p>
               <p>King Henry the first of this name, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very old and feeble, made an assembly of <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of King Phillip the first.</note> al the states of France in the cytie of Paris in the yeare of Christ 1059. <q>wher bringing in his yong sonne and heire Philip that vvas but 9. yeares of age, before them al, he said as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

but now by myne age and disposition of body, I do wel perceaue, that ear it be long I must be seperated from you, and therfore I do desire you that if euer you haue loued me, you shew it now in giuing your consent and approbation that this my sonne may be admitted for your king, and apparaled with the royal ornaments of this crowne of France, and that you wil sweare fealtie vnto him, and do him homage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus said the king, and then hauing asked euery one of the assistance in particuler for his consent a part, and afterwards the whole assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in general, whether they vvould sweare obedience to him or no, and fynding al to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vvith a good wil, he passed ouer the feast of the assention vvith great ioy in Paris, and after vvent to Rhemes vvith al the court and trayne, to celebrate the coronation vppon the feast of vvhit-sonday.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far are the wordes of William de Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis <note place="margin">Notes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the kings speaches.</note> alleaged in the story of France by Belforest, and it is to be nored first, how the king did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the nobility &amp; people to admit his sonne, and secondly how he did as ke ther consents a part, for that thes two pointes do euidently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <q>This oth was read by the king, holding his handes betwene the handes of the Archbishop of Rhemes, and the bishop of <hi>Syen</hi> and <hi>Bisanson,</hi> legats of the pope standing by, vvith a very great number of other bishops of the realme.

               </p>
               <p>Thus far do French stories recount the old &amp; ancient manner of anointing and crowning ther kings of France, which had endured as I haue said, for al most 600. yeares that is to say, from <hi>Clodoueus</hi> vnto this king Phillip the first, vvho was crowned in France 7. yeares before our William conquerer (who also was present at this coronation, &amp; had the third place amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <note place="margin">The later order of coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in France.</note> the temporal Princes as Duke of Normandie) entred into Ingland, but after this tyme the manner and ceremonies was somwhat altered, and made more maiestical in outward shew, &amp; this especially by king Lewis surnamed the yonger, nephew to the foresaid king Phillip, who leauing the substance of the action as it vvas before, caused diuers external additions of honor and maiestie, to be adioyned therunto, especially for the coronation of his sonne
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14519:64"/>
Phillip the seconde surnamed <hi>Augustus,</hi> whom he caused, also to be crowned in his dayes, as his grand father Phillip had bin, and as himselfe had bin also in his fathers dayes.</p>
               <p>This man among other royal ceremonyes ordeyned the offices of the twelue peeres, of France, 6. Ecclesiastical, and 6. temporal, vvho are they which euer since haue had the chiefest <note place="margin">The 12. peeres of France &amp; ther offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> places and offices in this great action, fot that the fore said Archbishop of Rhemes intituled also Duke of Rhemes, hath the first and highest place of al others, and annoynteth &amp; crowneth the king. The bishop &amp; Duke of Laon beareth the glasse of sacred oyle. The bishop &amp; Duke of Langres the crosse: The Bishop and earle of Beuais the mantel royal, The Bishop &amp; Earle of Noyon the kings girdle, and last of al, the Bishop and Earle of Chalons, doth cary the ring, and thes are the six ecclesiastical peeres of France with their offices in the coronation.</p>
               <p>The temporal peeres are the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie, deane of the order, vvho in this day of <note place="margin">Temperal peeres.</note> coronation holdeth the crowne: the Duke of Gasconie &amp; Guyene the first banner quartered, the Duke of Normandie the 2. banner quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Earle of Tholosa rhe golden spurres, the Earle of Champanie, the banner Royal or standerd of warr, and the Earle of flanders the sword royal, so as thet are 3.

               <p>But to say a vvord or two more of Phillip Augustus before I passe any further, which <note place="margin">The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vsed at this day.</note> happened in the yeare 1179. and in the 25. of the reigne of our king Henry the 2. of Ingland, who as the French stories say was present also at this coronation, and had his ranck among <note place="margin">Francis Belf. in vita Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</note> the peeres as Duke of Normandy, and held the kings crowne in his hand, &amp; one of his sonnes had his ranck also as Duke of Gasconie, &amp; the forme vsed in this coronation was the very same which is vsed at this day in the admission of the kings of France, in recounting wher-of I wil let passe al the particuler ceremonies Which are largely to be read in Francis Belfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, in the place before mentioned, and I vvil repeate only the kings oth, which the said au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor recounteth in thes wordes.</p>

vnto the seat royal, wher the crowne is put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his head, and many other large ceremoneies vsed vvhich may be read in the author a fore said, and are to long for this place.</q> And yet haue I bin the larger in this matter of France, for that I do not thinke it to be improbable which this author and others do note, to wit, that most nations round about haue taken their particuler formes of anoynting and crowning their kings, from this ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t custome of France, <note place="margin">The man ner of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronations take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from France.</note> though the substance therof, I meane of ther sacring and anoynting, be deduced from exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of far more antiquity, to wit, from the very first kings among the people of Israel, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God <note place="margin">1. Reg. 10. &amp; 16.</note> caused to be anoynted by his priestes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14519:67"/>

               <p>Probable then I say it is, that albeit the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this ceremony of anoynting kings be much elder then the christian kingdome of France: yer is this partic uler and maiestical manner of doing the same by waye of corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the most ancient in France aboue al other kingdomes round about, especialy if it began vvith ther first christian king <hi>Clodouaeus</hi> not ful 500. yeares after Christ, as french au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do hold. At what tyme also they recount a great miracle of holy oyle sent from heauen <note place="margin">The holy oyle of Rhemes.</note> by an angel for anoynting <hi>Clodouaeus,</hi> vvherof they say they haue stil remaining for the anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their kings at Rhemes, vvhich point I vvil not stand to treat or discoursein this place, but rather wil refer my reader to the foresaid chapter of Francis Belforest chonicler of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vvho alleageth diuers vvriters of almost 500. <note place="margin">Belfo. l. 3. cap. 57.</note> yeares antiquitie that write of the same, but howsoeuer that be, very probable it semeth that al the ceremoneys of coronation in Germany &amp; Polonia before recited (which had ther begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning long after the reigne of <hi>Clodouaeus</hi>) might be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, and so the affinity and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the one to the other doth seeme to agree, and <hi>Garribay</hi> also the chronicler of Spayne, and of Nauarra, in his 22. booke talking of this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome <note place="margin">Esteuan.

When <hi>Ferdinande</hi> surnamed the Catholique king of spayne entred ther-vppon, for that the Spanish kings are neuer anoynted nor crowned but otherwise admitted by the common vvealth as before I haue declared.</p>
               <p>But among al other kingdomes it semeth that Ingland hath most particularly taken this custome, and ceremony from France, not only for the reason before alleaged that diuers of our Inglish kings haue come out of France, as William Conqueror borne in Normandy, king <note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch.</note>

               <p>For first of al, that the Archbishop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury doth ordinarily do thes ceremony in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14519:68"/>
as the Archbishop of Rhemes doth it in France, ther is no doubte, &amp; with the same so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and honor, according to the condition and state of our countrey: and Polidor Virgil in <note place="margin">Polid. lib 13. hist.</note> his story noteth that pope Alexander did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and suspend the Archbishop of Yorke, <note place="margin">Angliae in vita Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici.</note> with his two assistants the bishops of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Salisbury, for that in the absence of Thomas Becket Archbishop of Canterbury, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his licence, they did crowne king Henry the seconds sonne, named also <hi>Henry,</hi> at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perswation, and diuers do attribute the vnfortunate successe of the said king Henry the yonger that rebelled against his father, to this disorderly and violent coronation by his fathers appointment: secondly that the first thing which the said Archbishop requireth at the new kings hands at his coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is about religion, church matters and the cleargie (as in France vve haue seene) it appereth euidently by thes vvords which the same Archbishop Thomas (surnamed commonly the martyr) remayninge in banishment vvrote to the same king Henry the second which are thes. <hi>Memores sitis confessionis quam fecistis &amp; posuistis super altare <note place="margin">In vita D.

               <p>The very like admonition in effect I finde made by an other Thomas Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, <note place="margin">The speech of an other Arch-bushop of Canter bury to the King.</note> to an other king Henry, to wit by Thomas Arundel to king Henry the fourth, vvhen in a parlament holden at Couentry, in the yeare 1404. the king vvas tempted by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne temporal men, to take away the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralityes from the cleargie, Wherunto vvhen the said Archbishop Thomas had answered by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reasons, at last turning to the king he besought him (saith Stow) <hi>to remember the oth which he voluntarily made, that he would honor &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi>

succession, as after more at large I shal shew you in a particuler spech vvhich of this point, I shal make unto you, and very specially it may be seene, in the two examples before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the admission of the two kings Henry and Edward, both surnamed the fourth, vvhos entrances to the crowne, if a man dovvel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, he shal find that both of them, founded the best part and most surest of their titles, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the election consent, and good wil of the people: yea both of them at their dying dayes hauing some remorse of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science (as it semed) <note place="margin">See ther lastvvords to ther frendes in Sir Tho Moore &amp; Stovv.</note> for that they had caused so many men to dye for mayntenance of ther seueral rightes and titles, had no better way to appease ther owne mynds, but by thinking that they were placed in that rome by the voice of the realme, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly might lawfully defend the same, &amp; punish such as went about to depriue them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer you shal finde, if you looke into the doings of Princes in al ages, that such kings as vvere most politique, and had any lest doubt <note place="margin">VVhy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kings caused ther son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be crovvned in ther ovvne dayes.</note> or suspicion of trobles about the title, after ther deathes, haue caused their sonnes to be crowned in their owne dayes, trusting more to this, then to their title by succession, though they vvere neuer so lawfully &amp; lineally discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And of this I could alleage you many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of diuers countryes but especially in France, since the last lyne of Capetus came vnto that crowne, for this did Hugh Capetus himselfe procure to be donne, to Robert his

               <p>And for this very same cause of securitie, it is not to be doubted, but that alvvayes the prince of Spayne is sworne and admitted by the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, during his fathers reigne, as before hath bin said. The same consideration also moued king Dauid, to crowne his sonne Salomon in <note place="margin">3.

Henry, to be crowned in his life time, so as ingland had two king Henries liuing at one tyme, vvith equal authoritie, and this was done in the 16. yeare of his reigne, and in the yeare of our lord 1170. but his deuise had no good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, for that king Henry the yonger made war soore after vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> king Henry the elder, &amp; had both the kings of France and Scotland, &amp; many nobles of ingland and Normandie, to take his part, for which cause it is thought, that this thing hath neuer bin put in practise againe since that tyme in Ingland, but yet heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euident, what the opinion of the world vvas in those dayes, of the force of coronation, and admission of the common vvealth, &amp; how litle propinquitie of blood preuaileth vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that.</p>

And if I should bring forth any presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and examples of holy scriptures, some other might chance to reply, that this was by particuler priuilege, vvherin God almightie would deale and dispose of things against the ordinary course of mans law, as best liked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, whose wil is more then law, and whose actions are right it selfe, for that he is lord of al, and to be limited by no rule, or law of man, but yet that this is not properly the acte of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth as our question demanndeth.</p>

Reg. 8.</note> you in mynd before I passe any further, that it is a matter much to be marked how god delt in this poynt vvith the people of Israel, at the beginning, after he had graunted to them, that they should hauve the same gouerment of kings, that other nations round about the had, vvhos kings did ordinarily reigne by succession as ours do at this day, and as al the kings of the Iewes did afterwards, and yet this not-vvith standing, God at the beginning, to vvit, at the very entrance of their first kings, vvould shew playnely that this law of succeding of the one the other, by birth and propinquity of blood, (though for the most part, it should preuaile) yet that it was not so precisely necessary, but that vppon iust causes it might be altered.</p>
               <p>For proofe wherof, we are to consider, that albeit he made Saule a trew and lawful king ouer the lewes, &amp; consequently also gaue him al kingly priuileges benefites and prerogatiues belonging to that degree and state, wherof one <note place="margin">King Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.</note> principal (as you know) is to haue his children succede after him in the crowne: yet after his death God suffred not any one of his generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to succed him, though he left behinde him many children, and among others <hi>Is boseth</hi> a prince of 40. yeares of age vvhom <hi>Abner</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <note place="margin">2.

               <p>And if you say heere that this vvas for the <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severed.</note> sinne of Saule, vvhom God had reiected, I do confesse it, but yet this is nothing against our purpose, for that vve pretend not that a prince that is next in blood can iustly be put back, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for his owne defects, or those of his ancestors. And moreouer I vvould haue you consider, that by this it is euident, that the fault of the father may preiudicate the sonnes right to the crowne, albeit the sonne haue no parte in the fault, as vve may se in this example not only of <hi>Isboseth</hi> that vvas punished and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the offence of Saul his father (not with standing he had bin proclay med king as hath bin said) but also of Ionathas Saules other sonne, vvho vvas so good a man, and so much praysed in holy seripture, &amp; yet he being slayne in warr, and leauing a sonne named <hi>Miphiboseth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Reg. 9.</note> he vvas put back also, though by nearnes of blood he had great interest in the succession as you see, and much before Dauid.</p>

vvil deny, but that he had giuen vnto him ther whith, al kingly priuileges preheminences and regalities, euen in the highest degree, as vvas conuenient to such a state, and among other, the scripture expresly nameth, that in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler it vvas assured him by God, that <hi>his seede should regine after him: yea and that for euer,</hi> but yet <note place="margin">Psal. 131.</note> vve do not finde this to be performed to any <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14519:89"/>
yet shal vve find this ordinance and succession oftentymes to haue byn broken vppon seueral considerations, as this author himselfe in that very chapter, confesseth.</p>
               <p>As for example, after foure discents from this man, vvhich were <hi>Don Ordonio</hi> the first, this mans sonne, and <hi>Don Alonso</hi> the third, <hi>Don Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia</hi> and <hi>Don Ordonio the second,</hi> al fower kings by orderly succession, it happened that in the yeare <note place="margin">K.

               <p>But after a yeares reigne, this king <hi>Fruelae</hi> dyed also, &amp; left diuers children at mans estate, and then did the spaniards as much agaynst them, as they had done for him before, against the children of his elder brother.

               <p>Furthermore, after this noble king <hi>Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ramiro</hi> the second, succeded as heyre apparent to the crowne his elder sonne, <hi>Don Ordonio</hi> the third, <note place="margin">Don Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donio 3.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14519:90"/>
reason (so often before alleaged) for that the infant or yong Prince <hi>Vermudo,</hi> vvas a little child, and not sufficient for gouerment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the countrey.</p>
               <p>Truth it is, that after this <hi>Don Sancho</hi> had reigned, and his sonne and heyre named <hi>Don Ramiro</hi> the third, after him, for the space of 30. yeares in all, then was this youth <hi>Don Vermudo</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mor. l. 17. c. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> (that is now put back) called by the realme to the succession of the crowne, and made kinge by the name of king <hi>Vermudo</hi> the second, vvho left after him <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> the 5. and he agayne his sonne <hi>Don Vermudo</hi> the third, who marying his sister <hi>Dona Sancha</hi> (that was his heire) vnto <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> first earle, &amp; then king of Castile, (who was second sonne to <hi>Don Sancho Mayor</hi> king of Nauarr as before hath bin said) he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thes meanes the kingdomes of Leon and Castile together, which were seperat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">The end of the race of Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layo.</note> and so ended the line of <hi>Don Pelayo,</hi> first Christian king of Spaine, after the entrance of the Moores, which had endured now three hundreth yeares, and the blood of Nauarr en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred as you see, and so continued therin vntil the entrance of those of <hi>Austria,</hi> as before hath bin said, which was almost 5. hundreth yeares together.</p>
               <p>And thus much I thought good to note out <note place="margin">Of the disceues follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vving.</note> of the stories of Spaine, for this first discent of the spanish kings, after the entrance of the Moores, nether meane I to passe much further, both for that it would be ouer long, as also for

as the Prince their father was named, vvhich father of thers dying before the king, the grand father left them commended to the realme as lawful heyres apparent to the crowne, yet for that a certayne vncle of thers named <hi>Don Sancho</hi> yonger brother to their father which <hi>Do Sancho</hi> was surnamed afterward, <hi>el brauo</hi> for his valor and vvas a great warrier, and more like to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage vvel the matters of warr then they: he was madde heyre apparent of Spayne and they put back in ther grand fathers tyme, and by his and the realmes consent, (ther father as I haue said being dead) and this was done in a general par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament holden at <hi>Segouia,</hi> in the yeare 1276. and <note place="margin">The Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das put bark from the crovvne 1276.</note> after this, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was made king in the yeare 1284. and the two Princes put into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but afterward at the sure of there vncle king Phillip the third of France, they were let out agayne and endued with certayne landes, and so they remaine vnto this day, and of thes do come the Dukes of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> and al the rest of the house of Cerda, which are of much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in Spayne at this tyme, and king Phillip that reyneth cometh of <hi>Don Sancho</hi> the yonger brother.</p>

howsoeuer this was the victory vve se he gat, and God prospered his pretence, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his of spring in the crovvne of Ingland more then 500. yeares together, so as now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from the death of king Edmond Ironside, vnto this man, we shal finde (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue said) in lesse then 50. yeares, that 5. or 6. kings vvere made in Ingland one after another, by only authority and approbation of the common wealth, contrary to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course of lineal succession by propinquitie of blood.</p>
               <p>And al this is before the conquest, but if vve should passe any further downe, we should finde more examples then before.

And seing that they only are to be iudges of this case, (as now I haue said) vve are to presume that vvhat they determyne, is iust and lawful for the tyme, and if at one tyme they should determine one thing, &amp; the contrary at an other, (as they did often in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland during the contention betwene York &amp; Lancaster and in other like occasions) vvhat can a priuate man iudge otherwise, but that they had different reasons and motions to leade them at different tymes, and they being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly lords and owners of the vvhole busines, committed vnto them, it is enough for euery particuler man to subiect himselfe to that vvhich his common vvealth doth in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and to obey simply without any further inquisition, except he should see that open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice vvere donne therin or God manifestly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14519:111"/>
offended, and the fealme indangered.</p>
               <p>Open iniustice I cal (said he) when not the <note place="margin">Open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice to be resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</note> true common wealth, but some faction of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should offer to determine this matter, vvithout lawful authority of the realme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and I cal manifest offence of God, and danger of the realme, when such a man is preferred to the crowne, as is euident that he wil do vvhat lyeth in him to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of them both, I meane bothe of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the publique wealth, as for example, if a Turke or Moore (as before I haue said) or some other notorious wicked man, or tyrant, should be offered by succession or otherwise to gouerne among Christians, in which cases euery man (no doubt) is bound to resist vvhat he can, for that the very end and intent for which al go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvas first ordeyned, is herein manifestly impugned.</p>
               <p>Thus the Ciuilian discoursed, and the whole company seemed to like very vvel therof, for that they said his opinion appeared both pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and pious, and by this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it came also <note place="margin">VVhat are the cheete pointes to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a princes ad mission.</note> presently in question, vvhat vvere the true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and principal points, which ought to be chiefly regarded, as wel by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth as by euery particuler man, in this great action of furthering or hindering any Prince towards a crowne. And they said vnto the Ciuilian, that if he vvould discusse in like manner this pointe vnto them, it would be a very apt and good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion to al his former speach and discourses,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14519:111"/>
vvhich hauing bin of the authority that weale publiques haue ouer princes titles, this other of the causes and considerations that ought to lead them for vse and excercise of the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would fal very fit and necessary for the vp short of al.</p>
               <p>Heerunto the Ciuilian answered, that he wel saw the fitnes and importance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore that he was content to speak a word or two more therof, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that much had bin said alredy therin, to witt, in al those pointès which had bin disputed about the end of gouerment, and why it vvas appoynted, which ende (said he) seing it is (as largely hath bin proued before) to defend, preserue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifite the common wealth, heer hence, that is, <note place="margin">VVhence the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or re iecting a prince are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> from this consideration, of the weal publique, are to be deduced al other considerations of most importance, for discerning a good or enel prince. For that whosoeuer is most likely to defend, preserue, and benifite most his realme and subiects, he is most to be allowed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred, as most conforme to the end for vvhich gouerment was ordeyned.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary side, he that is least like to do this, deserueth least to be preferred, and heer (quoth he) you see doth enter also that consideration mentioned by you before, which diuers common vvealthes had in putting back oftentymes children &amp; impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t people (though otherwise next in blood) from succession, and pteferring more able men though further of by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14519:112"/>
discent, for that they were more like to defend well ther realme and subiects then the others were.</p>
               <p>But to proceede (said he) more distinctly and more perspicuously in this matter, I would haue you cal to mynde one point among others which I alleaged before, out of Girard the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch author, to wit, that the king of france in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation <note place="margin">Girard li. 3. de l'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star pag. 242.</note> is new apparaled three tymes in one day, once as a prieste, &amp; then as a iudge, and last as a king armed. Therby to signifie three thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges committed to his charge, first religion, then <note place="margin">Three principal points to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> iustice, then man-hood and chiualry, for the defence of the realme.</p>
               <p>This diuision semeth to me very good and fitt (quoth he) and to comprehend al that a wealpublique hath neede of, for her happy state and felicity, both in soule and body, and for her end, both supernatural and natural. For by the first which is religion, her subiects do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto their end spiritual &amp; supernatural, which is the saluation of their soules, &amp; by the second and third, which are iustice and defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they enioy their felicity temporal, which is to liue in peace among them selues, and safety from their enimyes, for which cause it seemeth that these are the three points which most are to be regarded in euery Prince, that commeth to gouerment, and much more in him that is not yet admitted therunto, but offreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the common wealth for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:14519:112"/>And for that the later two of thes three points <note place="margin">VVhy he resolueth to treat of religion principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> which are iustice &amp; man-hood, hath bin often had in consideration, in the examples of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before mentioned, and the first point which is religion, hath rarely or neuer at al byn talked of, for that in former tymes the prince and the people were alwaves of one and the same reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and scarse euer any question or doubt fel in that behalfe (which yet in our dayes is the principal differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and chiefest difficultie of al other) for thes causes (I say) shal I accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date my selfe to the circumstance of the tyme, wherin we liue, and to the present case vvhich is in question betwixt vs about the succession of Ingland, and leauing a side those other two considerations of iustice and chiualry in a king, vvhich are far lesse important, then the other (though yet so highly regarded by ancient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes as you haue hard) I shal treate principally of religion, in this place, as of the first and highest, and most necessary pointe of al other, to be considered in the admission of any prince, for the profit of his subiects: for that without this, he destroyeth al, and vvith this, albeit he should haue defects in the other two pointes of iustice and manhode, yet may it be holpen, or his defect or negligence maye be supplyed much by others, as after I shal shew more in particuler, but if he vvant feare of God, or care of religion, or be peruersly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded therin, the domage of the weale publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que is inestimable. First of al then, for better
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14519:113"/>
vnderstanding of this point, vve are to suppose, <note place="margin">The cheef end of a common vvealth superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</note> that the first cheefest, and highest ende that God and nature appointed to euery common wealth, vvas not so much the temporal felicity of the body, as the supernatural and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of the soule, and this vvas not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to the Iewes by holy scripture, but also vnto the gentiles and heathens by the instinct and light of nature it selfe. For by this light of natural reason, the learned sort of them came to vnderstand the immortality of the soule, &amp; that her felicity perfection and ful contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they called her final ende and <hi>summum bonum,</hi> could not be in this life, nor in any thing created vnder heauen, but must needs be in the life to come, and that by atteyning to enioy some infinite endles &amp; immortal obiect, which could fully satisfie the appetite of our soule, &amp; this could be no other then God, the maker of al himselfe. And that consequently al other things of this transitory life, and of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane common wealth, subiect to mans eyes, are ordeyned to serue and be subordinate &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the other higher ende, and that al mans actions in this vvorld, are first of al, and in the highest degree, to be imployed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognising, seruing, and honoring of this great Lord that gouerneth the whole, as author and end of al. <note place="margin">Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and lavv ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers vvhat end they had of ther doings.</note>
               </p>

that wrote of framing a good common vvealth as <hi>Socrates, Plato, Plutarch, Cicero,</hi> and others, nether lawmaker among them that left ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces for the same purpose, as <hi>Deucalion, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos, Zaleucus, Licurgus, Solo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ion, Numa,</hi> or the like, vvhich besides the temporal ende of directing thinges wel for the body, had not especial care also, of matters apperteyning to the mynde, to vvit, of nourishing, honoring, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarding of vertue, and for restrayning and punishing of vice, and vvickednes, vvherby is euident that their end and butt was to make their cytizens good and vertuous, which vvas a higher end, then to haue a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of temporal and bodily benifits only, as many gouernours of our dayes (though Christians in name) seeme to haue, vvho pretend no higher end in ther gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then bodily vvealth, and a certayne temporal king of peace and iustice among ther subiects, vvhich diuers beasts also do reach vnto, in ther congregations and common <note place="margin">The com mon vvealth of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note> wealthes, as is to be seeme among emetts and bees, cranes, lyons, and other such creatures, that by instinct of nature are sociable, and do liue in company, and consequently also do maynteyne so mnch order and pollicy in ther common vvealth, as is needful for their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and continuance.</p>

                  <hi>suauitatis,</hi> and God receaued the smel, of thes sacrifices, as a sweet smel. Which is to say, that God was highly pleased therwith, and the like vve reade of Iob that vvas a gentile, and liued before Moyses, <hi>Sanctificabat filios consur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensque diluculo offerebat holocausta per dies singulos.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> He did sanctifie his children, and rising early in the morning did offer for them holocastes or burnt sacrifices euery day.</p>
               <p>This men vsed in those dayes, and this they were taught by law of nature, I meane both to honor God aboue al things, and to honor him by this particuler way of sacrifices, vvhich is proued also euidently by that which at this day is founde and seene in the Indians, vvher

               <p>And albeit in the particuler meanes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring this God, as also in distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene false Gods and the true God, thes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Indias haue fallen into most grosse &amp; infinite errors, as also the gentiles of Europe, Asia, &amp; Africa did, by the craft &amp; subtilty of the diuel, which abusing their ignorance, did thrust him selfe into the place of God, and deriued &amp; drew those sacrifises and supreme honors vnto himselfe, vvhich vvere dew to God alone, yet is it euident heerby (and this is sufficient for our purpose) that by God &amp; nature, the highest and chiefest end of euery common vvealth, is <note place="margin">The chife end of a common vvealth &amp; magestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes is reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note>

               <p>This oth did al the gouernours of christian countryes take in old tyme, vvhen christian Emperors did florish, and it hath remayned for a law and president euer since to al posterity. And if we ioyne this vvith the other othes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set downe in the fift chapter, vvhich Emperors and kings did make themselues (vnto their ecclesiastical Prelates, at their first admissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) about this point: vve should see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vvas so much respected in admission of a prince, or Gouernor (nor ought to be) as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for that (as I haue said before) this is the chiefest, greatest, &amp; highest ende, of euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealth, entended both by God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to assist their subiects to the atteyning of their supernatural ende, by honoring and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God in this life, and by liuing vertuously, for that otherwise God should draw no other srute or commodity out of humane common

               <p>But the end of man being far higher then this: it followeth that what-soeuer prince of <note place="margin">Hovv great a defect is vvant of religion in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestrate.</note> magestrate doth not attend vvith care to assist and helpe his subiects to this ende, omitteth the first and principal part of his charge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth high treason against his lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in whose place he is, and consequently is not fitt for that charge and dignity, though he should performe the other two partes, neuer so vvel, of temporal iustice and valor in his person, vvhich two other poyntes do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne principally to the humane felicity and baser ende of mans weale publique, and much more of a christian.</p>

For if S.

yet shal I be guyltie of al this, for that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing and persuading my selfe, that he is like, or in disposition to do it, yet for feare, flattery carelesnes, kinred, emulation against others, vaine pretence of title, lacke of zeale to gods cause, or for other the like passions or temporal respects, I do fauour further or sooth him in his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, or do not resist him, when it lyeth in my power, by al vvhich I do iustly make my felfe guyltie of al the euills, hurts, miseries and calamities both temporal and spiritual, vvhich afterward by his euel gouerment do or may ensew, for that I knowing him to be such a one, did notwithstanding assist his promotion.</p>

            <p>THE Ciuilian had no sooner ended his discourse, but al the company being most desirous to here what the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lawyer had prepared to say, about the seueral titles of the present pretendors to the crowne of Ingland, began with one accord to request him earnestly for the performance of his promised speach in that behalfe, who shewing himselfe nether vnwilling nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for the same, told them, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to yeald to their desyers, but yet with one condition, which was, that he would take in hand this matter with the same asseueration and protestation, with the Ciuilian in some occasions had vsed before him, and it liked <note place="margin">A prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvyer.</note> him wel, to wit, that hauing to speak in this discourse of many princes, peeres, and nobles of the royal blood of Ingland (to al which by law of nature equity and reason he said that

            <p>And so much the rather he said that he would do this, for that in very truth the Ciuiltans speech had put him in a great indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matter of successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of his head many scrupulosites about nyse points of <note place="margin">VVhy the vvil not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne of any one title.</note> neernes in blood, by the many examples &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that he had alleaged of the proceeding of Christian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes in this affayre, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring oftentymes him that was further of in blood, vppon other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of more waight &amp; importance, which point seemed to him to haue bin so euidently proued, as no man can deny it, &amp; much lesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the same, without the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces before alleaged &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned,

of calling al in doubt that now is established in the world, considering that not only foraine countries, but Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also it selfe so often hath vsed the same putting back the next in bloode.</p>
            <p>VVherfore he said, that for as much as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes, and the consent, wil, and desire of each realme was proued to haue high and soueraine authority in this affayre, and that as on the one side, nerenes of blood was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected so on the other, ther wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted not sundry considerations &amp; circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of as great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this, or rather greater, for that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes these considerations had bin preferred before neernes of blood, as hath byn declared, I do not know quoth he, who of the pretenders may next obteyne the garland, what soeuer his right by propinquity be, so he haue some (as I thinke al haue that do pretend) and therfore I meane not to stand vppon the iustification or impugning of any one title, but rather to leaue la to God and to them, that must one day try &amp; iudge the same in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to whome I suppose this speech of myne, can not be but grateful &amp; commodious, for the better vnderstanding &amp; discerning of those matters, wherof of necessity er it be longe they must be iudges &amp; vmpires, when God shal appoint, and consequently

for them to be ignorant or vnaquainted with the same (as men say that commonly most in Ingland at this day are) cannot be but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient and dangerous.</p>
            <p>In this manner he spake, and after this he began his discourse, setting downe first of al the sundry bookes and treatises which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood had bin made or written hitherto of this affaire.</p>

And the reasons which this book did alleage for the same were principally two, the first, that the lawes of Ingland did not <note place="margin">First rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> admitt any sttainger or allien to inherit in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, to vvit, any such as were borne out of the alleageance of our realme (for so are the wordes of the law) and for that the Queene
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14519:124"/>
of Scotts and her sonne are knowne to be so borne, therfore they could not succeed, and consequently that the house of Suffolck des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of the second daughter, must enter in ther place.</p>
               <p>The second reason is, for that ther is giuen authority to king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the eight by two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">2. Reasun</note> acts of parlament in the 28. and 36. yeare of his reigne to dispose of the succession by his last will &amp; testament, as he should think best, among those of his kinred that did pretend after his children, and that the said king accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his commission, did ordeyne that if his owne children did dye vvithout issue, then the of-spring of his yonger sister Mary that vvere borne in Ingland should be preferred before the issue of the elder that vvas Margaret mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed into Scotland, and this was the effect of this first book.</p>
               <p>Against this booke were vvryten two other soone after, the first by one Morgan a diuine (if <note place="margin">The booke of M. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and iudge Browne</note> I remember vvel) some-tymes fellow of Oriel College in Oxford, a man of good accompt for learninge amonge those that knew hym, &amp; he vvas thought be haue written the saide book, by the aduise and assistance of the forsaide Iudge Browne, which thinge is made the more credible, by the many authorites of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law vvhich therin are alleaged, and the partes of this booke (if I forget not) vvere three, or rather they were three bookes of one treatise, the first wherof dyd take vppon it to cleare the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14519:125"/>
saide Queene of Scottes for the murder of the lord Darly her husband, which by many vvas layde against her. And the seconde dyd handle her tytle to the crowne of Ingland: and the third dyd answer the booke of Ihon Knox the Scott, intituled, <hi>against the monstruous gouerment of women.</hi> Of al vvhich three pointes, for that the second that conserneth the tytle, is that vvhich properly appertayneth to out purpose, and for that the same is handled agayne and more largely in the second booke set out not longe after by Ihon lesley lord bishope of Rosse in Scotland, vvho at that tyme was Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for the saide Queene of Scottes in Ingland, and handled the same matter more abundantly vvhich M. Morgan had donne before hym, I shal saye no more of this booke of M. Morgan; but shal passe ouer to that of the bishope, vvhich in this point of succession conteyneth also vvhat soeuer the other hath, so as by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the contentes of the one vve shal come also to see vvhat is in the other.</p>
               <p>The intent then of this book of the bishope of Rosse, is to refute the other booke of Hales and Bacon, and that especially in the two points before mentioned, which they alleaged for their principles, to witt, about forrayne birth, and king Henries testament. And against the first of these two pointes the bishop alleageth <note place="margin">Ansvver to the 1. reason.</note> many proofes that ther is no such maxima in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes of Ingland to disherit a prince borne out of the land from his or her right of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14519:125"/>
succession, that they haue by blood. And this first, for that the statute made for barring of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens to inherit in Ingland (vvhich was in the 25. yeare of the reigne of king Edward the third) is only to be vnderstood of particuler mens inheritance, and no wayes to be extended to the succession of the crowne, as by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of many other like cases is declared: and secondly for that ther is expresse exception in the same statute of the kings children and of spring: and thirdly for that the practise hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bin contrary both before and after the conquest, to vvit that diuers princes borne out of the realme haue succeded.</p>
               <p>The other principle also concerning king Henryes testament, the bishop impugneth, first <note place="margin">To the 2. reason.</note> by diuers reasons &amp; incongruities vvherby it may be presumed that king Henry neuer made any such testament, and if he did, yet could it not hold in law. And secondly also by vvitnes of the Lord Paget that was of the priuy councel in those dayes, &amp; of Sir Edward Montague lord chiefe iustice, and of one VVilliam Clark that set the kings stamp to the writing, al which anowed before the councel and parlament in Queene Maryes tyme, that the said testament vvas signed after the king vvas past sense and memory.</p>
               <p>And finally the said bishop concludeth that the line of Scotland is the next euery way, both in respect of the house of Lancaster, and also of York, for that they are next heyres to K. Henry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14519:126"/>
the eight, who by his father was heyre to the house of Lancaster, and by his mother to the house of york.</p>
               <p>But after these three bookes, was vvritten a <note place="margin">Heghing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons booke.</note> fourth, by one Robart Highinton secretary in tyme past to the Earle of Northumberland, a man wel read in storyes and especially of our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, who is said to be dead some yeares past in Paris. This man impugneth al three formet bookes in diuers principal points and draweth the crowne from both their pretendors, I meane as wel from the house of Scotland as from that of Suffolk, and first against the booke of Hales and Sir Nicholas Bacon, writen (as hath bin said) in fauour of the house of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk Heghington holdeth with the Bishop and Morgan that thes two principles layd by the other, of forayne birth, and of king Henries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament against the Scotish line, are of no Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, as nether ther reasons for legitrimating of the Earle of Hartfords children, vvhich after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shalbe handled.</p>
               <p>And secondly he is against bothe Morgan &amp; the Bishop of Rosse also in diuers important points, and in the very principal of al, for that this man (I meane Highington) maketh the king of Spayne to be the next and most righful pretender by the house of Lancaster, for proofe vvherof he holdeth first that king Henry the 7. had no title in deede to the crowne by La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caster; but only by the house of York, that is to saye; by his marriage of Queene Elizabeth elder
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14519:126"/>
daughter to king Edward the fourth, for that albeit himselfe were discended by his mother from Iohn of Gaunt duke of Lancaster, yet this vvas but by his third vvife Catherin Swyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and that the true heyres of Blanch his first vvife duches and heyre of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caster (to whom sayth he apperteyned only the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the death of king Henry the sixth, and his sonne, with whom ended the line male of that house) remayned only in Portugal by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Lady Phillip, daughter of the foresaid Blanch, to kinge Ihon the first of Portugal, &amp; that for as much as king Phillip of Spaine saith this man, hath now succeded to al the righte of the kings of Portugal, to him appertayneth also, the only right succession of the house of Lancaster, and that al the other discendents of king Henry the 7. are to pretend only by the title of Yorke, I meane aswel the line of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as also of Suffolk and Huntington, for that in the house of Lancaster king Phillip is euidently before them al.</p>
               <p>Thus holdeth Heghington, alleaginge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers stories arguments and probabilities for the same, &amp; then adioyneth two other propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, which do importe most of al, to vvit, that the title of the house of Lancaster was far better, then that of York, not for that Edmond Crokback first founder of the house of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, vvho was sonne to king Henry the third and brother to king Edward the first, was eldest to the said Edward and iniurioufly put
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14519:127"/>
back for his deformity in body, as both the said bishop of Rosse and George Lylly, do falsly <note place="margin">George Lilly in fine Epit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronic. Anglic.</note> hold, and this man refuteth by many good arguments, but for that lohn of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster being the eldest sonne that King Edward the third had a liue when he dyed, should in right haue succeded in the crowne as this man holdeth, and should haue bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Richard the second that was the black princes sonne, vvho vvas a degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of from king Edward the third his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, then vvas lohn of Gaunt, to whom king Edward vvas father, and by this occasion this man cometh to discusse at large the opinions of the lawyers, vvhether the vncle or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew should be preferred in the succession of a crowne, to vvit, vvhether the yonger brother or the elder brothers sonne, if his father be dead vvithout being seased of the same (which is a point that in the ciuil law hath great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and many great authors on each side as this man sheweth) and the matter also wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not examples on both pattes in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of diuets Inglish kings, as our frend the ciuil lawyer did signifie also in his discourse, &amp; vve may chance to haue occasion to handle the same agayne, and more largely heerafter.</p>
               <p>These poyntes toucheth Highinto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoughe diuers other he leaue vntouched, vvhich are of much importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the resolusion, as whether after the lyne extinguished of kinge Henry the 4. vvhich vvas the eldest sonne of Ihon of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14519:127"/>
Gant, ther should haue entered the line of lady Philippe the eldest daughter lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of Blanch first wyfe of Ihon of Gant, or <note place="margin">Sundry importag pointes.</note> els the race of Ihon Earle of Somersett yonger sonne by his third vvyfe, which then was base borne, but legetimated by parlament, for of Phillip do come the kinges of Portugal, and of Ihon came king Henry the seuenth. And againe these pointes had byn to be disputed as vvel touching the succession to the dukedom of Lancaster alone, as also to the crowne ioyncely, all which articles shal seuerally after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be handled in ther places, and thus much of this booke.</p>
               <p>More then these fower bookes, I have not <note place="margin">Diuers other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes.</note> seene vvitten of his affaire, though I haue hard of one made in Flanders in the behalfe of the Duke of Parma, that is now, vvho by his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disceudeth of the same line of Portugal, that the king of Spaine doth, and as this book pretendeth (if we respect the ordinary course of Inglish lawes in particuler mens inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances) he is to be preferred before the said king, or any other of the howse of Portugal for that his mother descended of the yonger sonne, and the king of the elder daughter, of the king of Portugal: and albeit according to the law of Portugal the king vvas adiuged next heyre to that crowne, yet say they by our lawes of Ingland he cannot be, vvhich after must be examined.</p>
               <p>Thus sayth that book, and he alleageth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14519:128"/>
many reasons for the same, as it hath bin told me (for as I said I neuer came to haue a viewe of the vvhole booke) but diuers of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I haue seene laid together, which I shal afterwards in place conuenient alleage vnto you, vvith the answers censures and replies that the contrary parties do make therunto.</p>
               <p>Diuers other papers notes and memories I haue seene also (said he) as wel touching the succession of those vvhom I haue named as of others, for that <hi>Syr Richard Shelly</hi> who dyed some yeares a gone in Venice, by the name of Lord <note place="margin">Sir Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Shelly.</note> prior of S. Iohns of Ingland, had gathered diuers points touching these affayres: &amp; many more then he had M. Francis Peto that dyed in Millan, and vvas a very curious and wel readen <note place="margin">Franc.

Their vvant not also diuers in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d who haue trauailed much in this busines, and I haue had the perusing of some of their labors, though I dare not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ther names lest therby I should hurt them, vvhich vvere not conuenient. But one great trouble finde I in them al, that euery man seeketh to draw the whole water vnto his owne mill, and to make that title alwayes most clere, whom he most fauoreth, and this vvith so great probability of reason and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity many tymes, as it is hard to retayne a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s consent from that which is said, vntil he haue read the reasons of the other party, and this also is a great proofe, of the wonderful ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14519:128"/>
and doubtfulnes which in this most important affaire is to be founde.</p>
               <p>And by the way also I had almost forgotten <note place="margin">A treatise in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta of spaine.</note> to tel you, how that of late I haue lighted vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certayne new discourse and treatise, made in the behalfe of the king of Spaines eldest daughter, whom he had by his wife, Isabel the eldest sister of the last king of France, vvhich Isabel and her daughter the infanta of Spaine called also Isabel, are presumed to be the lawful heyres to the state of Britany, and to al other states that by that meanes of Britany or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by vvomen haue come to France, or haue or may fal vppon a vvoman of the house of France, as the states of Ingland and other states therunto annexed may, for that they follow not the law salique of France, and so this treatise proueth that by diuers vvayes and for sundry considerations, this princesse of Spaine is also of the blood royal of Ingland, and may among others be intituled to that crowne, by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer title of her owne, beside the pretence vvhich her father the king or her brother the prince of Spayne haue for them selues, by the house of Portugal, al vvhich reasons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I shal alleage afterward in ther place &amp; tyme, or at least-wise the chiefe &amp; principal of them.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14519:139"/>
now againe I shall briefly proue it by these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s following, for that it importeth very muche for deciding the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie between the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Lancaster and yorke.</p>
               <p>The first reason then is, for that al ancient historiographers of Ingland and among them <note place="margin">That Edvvard vvas the elder.</note> Matheus Westmonasteriensis that liued at the same tyme do affirme the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, and do make <note place="margin">Matheus vvest in vit Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici 3. &amp; bollings. Ibidem pag. 654.</note> Edward to be elder then Edmond by six yeares and two dayes, for that they appointe the birth of Prince Edward to haue bin vppon the 16. day of Iune in the yeare of Christ 1239, &amp; the 24. of the reigne of his father king Henry, and the birth of Lord Edmond to haue followed vppon the 18. day of the same moneth 6. yeares after, to wit in the yeare of our lord 1245. and they do name the godfathers and godmothers of them both together, with the peculier so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities and feastes, that were celebrated at ther seueral natiuities, so as it seemeth ther can be no ertor in this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>The 2. reason is, for that we read that this Lord Edmond was a goodly vvise and discreet prince, notwithstanding that some authors cal him crokback, and that he vvas highly in the fauour both of his father king Henry, as also of his brother king Edward, and employed by them in many great warres, and other affayres of state, both in France &amp; other where, vvhich argueth that ther was no such great defect in him as should moue his father and the realme to depriue him of his succession.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:14519:139"/>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly vve reade that king Henry procured by diuers waies and meanes the aduancement of this L.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly we see that at the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther king Henry the third, this Lord Edmond vvas principally left in charge with the realme, his elder brother prince Edward being scarsly returned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warr of Asia, at what tyme, he had good occasion to chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his owne right to the crowne, if he had had any, seing he wanted no power theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, hauing three goodly sonnes at that tyme aliue, borne of his wife Queene Blanch dowager of Nauarre, vvho had bin marryed before to Henry king of Nauarre, and contie of Champaine, to whom she had borne only one daughter, that vvas marryed to Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip le bel king of France.</p>
               <p>But vve shal neuer reade that either he, or <note place="margin">Edmonds line ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the crovvne.</note> any of his children, made any such clayme, but that they liued in very good agreement &amp; high grace vvith king Edward the first, as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did also vvith king Edward the second, vntil he began to be mis-led in gouerment, and then the two sonnes of this Lord Edmond

               <p>A fift reason is, for that if this had bin so, <note place="margin">5. Note this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</note> that Edmond earle of Lancaster, had bin the elder brother, then had the controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two houses of York and Lancaster, bin most cleare and vvithout al doubt at al, for then had the house of Yorke had no pretence of right in the vvorlde, and then vvere it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the heyres general of Blanch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Lancaster vvife of Iohn of Gaunt, to wit, the discendentes of lady Phillip her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that vvas marryed into Portugal, these I say, and none other, were apparent and true heyres to the crowne of Ingland at this day, and al the other of the house of Yorke vsurpers, as wel king Henry the 7. as al his posterity &amp; ofspring, for that none of them haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the said Blanch as is manifest.</p>
               <p>And therfore lastly the matter standeth (no <note place="margin">6. The elder ship of Edmond a fiction.</note> doubt) as Polidor holdeth in the later ende of the life of king Henry the third, vvhere hauing me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned these two sonnes Edward &amp; Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he addeth these wordes. <hi>Ther wanted not certayne men long tyme after this, that affirmed this Edmond to</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus saith Polidor in this place, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard in the begining of the life of the said K.

               <p>Novv then it being cleere that of these two sonnes of king Henry the third, prince Edward vvas the elder and lawful heyre, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth only that vve set downe, their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral discents vnto the tymes of king Edward the third, and his children, in whose dayes the dissention &amp; controuersie betweene these royal houses of Yorke and Lancaster, began to break fourth.</p>
               <p>And for the issue of Edward that vvas king after his father, by the name of king Edward <note place="margin">The issue of king Edvvard the first.</note> the first, it is euident that albeit by two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral vviues he had a dosen children, male and femal, yet only his fourth sonne by his first vvife called also Edward (vvho vvas king after him by the name of king Edward the second) left issue that remayned, which Edward the second being afterward for his euel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment deposed, left issue Edward the third,

vvho vvas made king by election of the people in his place, and after a long and prosperous reigne, left diuers sonnes, vvherof after vve shal speak, and among them his third sonne named Iohn of Gaunt, married lady Blanch daughter and heyre of the house of lancaster, and of the fornamed Lord Edmond Crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, by vvhich Blanch, Iohn of Gant became duke of lancaster: so as the lines of these tvvo bretheren Edward and Edmond did meete and ioyne againe in the fourth discent, as novv shall appeare by declaration of the issue of the foresaid L.

               <p>Iohn of Gaunt third sonne of king Edward <note place="margin">The issue of the 3. sonne duke of Lancan.</note> being duke of Lancaster by his wife, as hath bin said, had three wiues in al, and by euery one of them had issue, though the bishop of Rosse in his great Latin arbor of the genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the kings of Ingland, printed in Parris in the yeare 1580. assigneth but one wife only to this Iohn of Gaunt, and consequently that al his childen were borne of her, which is a great and manifest error and causeth great confusion in al the rest which in his booke of the Queene of Scots title he buyldeth hereon, for that it being euident, that only the first wife vvas daughter and heyre of the house of Lancaster, and Iohn of Gant duke therof by her, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that the children only that vvere borne of her, can pretend properly to the inheritance of that house, and not others borne of Iohn of

Gaunt by other wiues as al the vvorld vvil confesse.</p>
               <p>First then (as I haue said) this Iohn of Gaunt marryed Blanch daughter and heyre of Henry <note place="margin">The issue by Lady Blanch.</note> duke of Lancaster, and had by her one sonne only and two daughters.

by him had issue Raffe Neuill third earle of Westmerland, whose lineal heyre is at this day Lord Charles Neuill earle oft Westmerland, that liueth banished in Flanders.</p>
               <p>And this is al the issue that Iohn of Gaunt had by lady Blanch his first vvife, sauing only <note place="margin">The issue of King Henry the 4.</note> that I had forgotten to prosecute the issue of Henry his first sonne, surnamed of Bolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brok, that vvas afterward called king Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the fourth which king had 4. sonnes and tvvo daughters, his daughters vvere Blanch and Phillip, the first marryed to William duke of Bauaria, and the second to Erick king of Denmarke, and both of them dyed without children.</p>
               <p>The four sonnes vvere first Henry that reygned after him by the name of Henry the fift, and the second vvas Thomas duke of Clarence, the third vvas Iohn duke of Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and the fourth vvas Humfrey duke of Glocester, al vvhich three dukes dyed vvithout issue or vvere slaine in vvarres of the realme, so as only king Henry the fift their elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had issue one sonne named Henry also, that vvas king, and reigned 40. yeares by the name of Henry the sixt who had issue prince Edward &amp; both of them (I meane both father &amp; sonne) were murthered by order or permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Edward duke of Yorke, vvho afterward tooke the crowne vppon him; by the name of king Edward the fourth, as before hath bin said

so as in this king Henry the 6. and his sonne prince Edward, ended all the blood royal male of the house of Lancaster, by Blanch the first wife of Iohn of Gaunt, and the inheritance of the said lady Blanch returned by right of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession as the fauorers of the howse of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal affirme though others deny it, vnto the heyres of lady Phillip her eldest daughter, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed into Portugal, vvhose nephew named Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonsus the fift kinge of Portugal liued at that day when king Henry the 6. and his heyre were made away, and this much of Iohn of Gaunts first marriage.</p>

which vvas in the 21. yeare of his reigne, commonly called <hi>the euel parlament,</hi> he would needs haue al authority absolute graunted to certaine fauourits of his, which Thomas Walsingham saith, were not aboue 6. or 7. to determine of all matters vvith al ful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as if they only had bin the vvhole realme, vvhich vvas nothing in deede but to take al authority to him selfe only, and Stow in his chronicle hath these wordes following. <hi>This parlameut began about the 15. of September in the yeare 1397. at the beginning wherof, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

               <p>Fourthly and lastly, those of Lancaster do alleage for iustifying of this depriuation, that <note place="margin">The duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easter cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by common request.</note> duke Henry vvas called home by expresse let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres of the more and better part of al the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, and that he came vvholy (in a manner) vn-armed considering his person, for that fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sard sayeth he had but three shippes only out of Britanie, and Walsingham saith he had but 15.

in the county of Yorke, he had but three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score men in al to begin the reformation of his realme against so potent a tyrant, as King Richard was then accompted, and yet vvas the concourse of al people so great and general vnto him, that within few dayes he achiued the matter, and that without any battaile or bloodshed at al, &amp; thus much for the iustnes of the cause.</p>
               <p>But now if we vvil consider the manner and forme of this act, they of Lancaster do affirme <note place="margin">VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the manner of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing King Richard vvere good.</note> also that it could not be executed in better nor more conuenient order. First for that it vvas done by the choise and inuitation of al the realme or greater and better parte therof as hath bin said. Secondly for that is vvas done vvithout slaughter, and thirdly for that the king vvas deposed by act of parlament, and himselfe conuinced of his vnworthy gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brought to confesse that he vvas vvorthely depriued, and that he vvillingly and freely resigned the same: nether can their be any more circumstances required (saye these men) for any lavvful deposition of a Prince.</p>
               <p>And if any man wil yet obiect and saye that notwithstanding al this their vvas vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for that duke Henry was armed and by force of armes brought, this to passe, they of Lancaster do answere, that this is true, that he brought the matter to an

to take armes against his said king, and against his mother the Queene, and to depriue them both, not only of their kingdomes but also of their liues, and so he did, for the scripture saith, <hi>Coniurauit ergo Iehu contra Ioram.</hi> Iehu did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure <note place="margin">4.

               <p>And in the same booke of kings within two chapters after, there is an other example how <note place="margin">5.

trouble of armes, &amp; bloodshed, if God vvould, but he appointed this seueral meanes for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his wil, and for releeuing of common wealthes oppressed by euel princes. And this seemeth sufficient proofe to these men, that king Richard of Ingland might be remoued by force of armes, his life and gouerment being so euel and pernitious as before hath bin she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</p>

               <p>And first of al it is to be vnderstood, that at that very tyme vvhen king Richard vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the house of Yorke had no pretence or little at al to the crowne, for that Edmond Mortimer earle of march, nephew to the lady Phillip, vvas then aliue, with his sister Anne Mortymer marryed to Richard earle of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brige, by vvhich Anne the howse of Yorke did after make their clayme, but could not do so yet, for that the said Edmond her brother was liuing, and so continued many yeares after, as appeareth, for that wee reade that he vvas aliue 16. yeares after this, to witt, in the third yeare of the raigne of king Henry the fift vvhen his said brother in law, Richard earle of Cambrigs vvas put to death, in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton

vvhom this Edmond appeached as after shalbe shewed, and that this Edmond vvas now earle of March when king Richard vvas deposed, and not his father Roger (as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidot mistaketh) is euident, by that that the said <note place="margin">Polidor L. 20. in vit.

eldest sonne, the duke of Aumaile, and they said no, he asked the third tyme, yf they would haue his yongest-sonne, Richard earle of cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and they said no. Thus writeth Stow, vvher-by it is euident. that albeit this earle of Cabridge had married now the sister of Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Mortimer, by whom his posterity claymed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, yet could he not pretend at this tyme, her brother being yet aliue, who after dying vvithout issue, left al his right to her, &amp; by her to the house of Yorke: for albeit this earle Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard neuer came to be duke of Yorke, for that he vvas beheaded bv king Henry the fift at Southampton as before hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>So that the question now is, whether after the deposition of king Richard, Edmond Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer <note place="margin">VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the earle of march or duke of Lancaster should haue luc ceded to king Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</note> nephew remoued of Leonel (which Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel vvas the second sonne to king Edward) or els Henry duke of Lancaster, sonne to Iohn of Gaunt (which Iohn vvas third sonne to king Edward) should by right haue succeded to king Richard, and for Edmond is alleaged, that he was heyre of the elder brother, and for He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry is said, that he vvas neerer by two degrees to

came home into Ingland againe, kinge Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard thought no better way to vveaken him, then to banish his sonne, Henry duke of Herford, and so he did.

               <p>And these vvere the causes, say the fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the house of Lancaster, why king Richard caused this acte of parlament to passe in fauour of Roger Mortimer, &amp; in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of the house of Lancaster, and not for <note place="margin">VVhy Ro ger Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared heyre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</note> that the right of earle Mortimer, vvas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that of the duke of Lancaster.

               <p>Touching our common lawes, the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <note place="margin">Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the common lavv of Ingland.</note> of lancaster do say two or three things, first that the right of the crowne and interest ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is not decided expresly in our lavv, not it is a plea subiect to the common rules therof, but is superiour and more eminent,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14519:168"/>
and therfore that men may not iudge of this as of other pleas of particuler persons, nor is the tryal like, nor the common maximes or rules alwaies of force in this thing, as in others, which they proue by diuers particuler cases, as for example, the vvidow of a priuate man shal haue her thirdes of al his landes for her dowry, but not the Queene of the crowne. Againe if a priuate man haue many daughters, and dye <note place="margin">Different rules in successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the crovvne and of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> seazed of any landes in fee simple, vvithout heyre male, his said daughters by law shal haue the said landes as coparteners equally deuided betweene them, but not the daughters of a king, for that the eldest must carry away al, as though she vvere heyre male. The lyke also is seene, if a baron matche vvith a femme that is an inheretrix, and haue issue by her, though she dye, yet shal he enioye her landes during his lyfe, as tenant by curtesie, but it is not so in the crowne if a man mary with a Queene, as king Phillip dyd with Queene Marye: and so finally they saye also that albeit in priuate mens possessions, the common course of our law is, that if the father dye seazed of landes in fee simple, leauing a yonger sonne and a nephew, that is to say a child of his elder sonne, the nephew shal succede his grandfather, as also he shal do his vncle, if of three bretheren the elder dye without issue, and the second leaue a sonne: yet in the inheritance and succession of the crowne it goeth otherwise, as by al the former eight examples haue bin shewed, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14519:168"/>
this is the first they saye about the common law.</p>
               <p>The second pointe which they affirme is, <note place="margin">The common lavv grounded in custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> that the ground of our common lawes, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth principally and almost only, about this pointe of the crowne, in custome, for so say they we see by experience, that nothing in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is written therof in the common law, and al old lawyers do affirme this pointe, as vvere <hi>Ranulfus de Granuilla</hi> in his booke of the lawes and customes of Ingland, vvhich he vvrote in the tyme of king Henry the second, and Iudge <hi>Fortescue</hi> in his booke of the prayse of Inglish lawes, vvhich he compiled in the tyme of king Henry the sixt, and others. Wherof these men do inferr, that seing there are so many preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and examples alleaged before, of the vncles case preferred before the nephew, not only in forayne countryes, but also in Ingland, for this cause (I saye) they do affirme, that our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes, cannot but fauour also this title, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently must needs like vvel of the interest of Lancaster, as they auouch that al the best old lawyers did in those tymes: &amp; for example they do record two by name, of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous learned men vvhich those ages had, who not only defended the said title of Lancaster in <note place="margin">Ancient lavvyers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the house of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster.</note> those dayes, but also suffred much for the same.

Some agayne wil seeme to pretend from both howses ioyned together, as al those that descende from king Henry the seuenth, vvhich are the houses of Scotland and Suffolke, albeit (as before hath appeared) others do deny that these families haue any true part in the house of Lancaster, which pointe shal afterward be discussed more at large. And fourthly others do pretend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two houses of Yorke and Lancaster were deuided, as the Infanta of Spayne, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Sauoy, the prince of Lorayne &amp; such others, as haue descended of the house of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny and France, of al vvhich pretences &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendors, vve shal speake in order, and consider vvith indifferencie vvhat is said or alleaged of euery side, to and fro, begining first with the house of Scotland, as with that which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of vulgar men, is taken to be first and neerest (though others denye it) for that they are desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the first and eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of king Henry the seuenth, as before in the third chapter hath bin declared.</p>
               <p>First then two persons are knowne to be of <note place="margin">Of the house of Scotland.</note> this house at this daye that may haue action &amp; clayme to the crowne of Ingland, the first is, Lord Iames the sixt of that name presently king of Scotland, who descendeth of Margaret

eldest daughter of king Henry the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, that vvas married by her first marriage to Iames the fourth king of Scots, &amp; by him had issue Iames the fift, and he agayne the lady Mary mother to this king now pretendant.</p>
               <p>The second person that may pretend in this house, is the lady Arbella, descended of the selfe <note place="margin">Arbella.</note> same Queene Margaret by her seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d marriage, vnto Archibald Douglas earle of Anguis, by vvhom she had Margaret that vvas married to Mathew Steward earle of Lenox, and by him had Charles her second sonne earle of Lenox, vvho by Elizabeth daughter of Syr William Candish knight in Ingland, had issue this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella now aliue.</p>
               <p>First then, for the king of Scots, those that do fauour his cause, (wherof I confesse that I haue <note place="margin">In fauour of the king of Scots.</note> not founde very many in Ingland) do alleage, that he is the first and cheefest pretendor of al others, and next in succession, for that he is the first person that is descended (as you see) of the <note place="margin">1.</note> eldest daughter of king Henry the seuenth, and that in this discent ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no bastardy or other lawful impediment be auowed, vvhy he should not succeede according to the priority of his pretention and birth: And moreouer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they do alleage that it would be greatly for the honor and profit of Ingland, for that <note place="margin">2.</note> hereby the two Realmes of Ingland and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, should come to be ioyned, a pointe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge sought for, and much to be wished, and finally such as are affected to his religion do adde <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:14519:177"/>
that hereby true religion wil come to be more setled also and established in Ingland, which they take to be a matter of no smale conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and consideration, and this in effect is that vvhich the fauourers of this prince do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage in his behalfe.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, there want not many that do accompt this pretence of the king of Scots neither good nor iust, nor any waye expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient <note place="margin">Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against the king of Scots.</note> for the state of Ingland, and they do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere largely to al the allegations before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in his behalfe.</p>

this discourse is set downe, and especially by the testimonie of the L.

               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:14519:179"/>A fourth argument is made against the king of Scotts succession, by al the other competitors <note place="margin">The king of Scots excluded by the starute of associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> iointly, and it seemeth to them, to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath no solution or reply, for that it is grounded vppon a playne fresh statute, made in the parlament holden in the 27. yeare (if I erre not) of her Maiesty that now is, vvherin is enacted &amp; decreed, that whosoeuer shalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Vppon which statute, seing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the lady Mary late Queene of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, mother of this king, was condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the authority of the said parlament, it seemeth euident, vnto these men, that this king vvho pretendeth al his right to the crowne of Ingland by his said mother, can haue none at al.</p>
               <p>And these are the reasons proofes &amp; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which diuers men do alleage against the right of succession, pretended by the king of <note place="margin">Other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But nowe if we leaue this pointe which concerneth the very right it self of his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession by blood, &amp; wil come to examine other reasons and considerations of state, and those in particuler vvhich before I haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that his fauourers do alleage, for the vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and common good that may be presumed will rise to the realme of Ingland by his admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14519:180"/>
to our crowne, as also the other point also of establishment of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by them me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, then I say, these other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are against his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance do produce many other reasons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations also, of great inconueniences, as to them they seeme, against this pointe of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and their reasons are these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>First touching the publique good of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish common wealth, by the vniting of both realmes of Ingland &amp; Scotland together, these men do saye, that it is very doubtful and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table whether the state of Ingland shal receaue good or harme therby, if the saide vnion could be brought to passe. First for that the state and <note place="margin">Ioyning of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and Scotland to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> condition of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, it seemeth, that it can bring no other commodity to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, then increase of subiects, and those ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to participate the commodities and riches of Ingland, then to impart any from Scotland. And then secondly, the auersion and natural <note place="margin">1.</note> alienatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n of that people, from the Inglish, and their ancient inclination to ioyne with the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch &amp; Irish against vs, maketh it yery proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that, that subiection of theirs to the crowne of Ingland, vvould not loug indure, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petience we haue feene, since the tyme of king Edward the first, vvhen after the death of their king Alexander the third, without issue, they chose king Edward to be their king, deliuered their townes and fortresses into his hands, did sweare him fealty, receaued his deputy or vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14519:180"/>
(as Polidor at large declareth). And yet al <note place="margin">Polydor. lib. 17. in vit. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardi primi.</note> this serued afterward, to no other effect but only slaughter, bloodshed, and infinyt losses and charges of Ingland.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly they saye, that if the king of Scots should come to possesse the crowne of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,  he cannot choose (at least for many yeares) but to stand in great ielousy of so many other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors of the Inglish blood royal, as he shal finde in Ingland, against whom he must needes fortifie him selfe by those other forayne natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that may be presumed to be most sure vnto him, though most contrary by natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; least tollerable in gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Inglish men, as are the Scots of whom he is borne, and <note place="margin">Inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into Ingland.</note> danes vvith vvhom he is allyed, and French of vvhom he is descended, and of the vnciuil part ofIreland, vvith vvhom one great piece of his realme hath most coniunction, the authority &amp; sway of which fower nations in Ingland, and ouer Inglish-men, vvhat trouble it may worke euery vvise man may easely coniecture. Besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that; the Scots-men themselues, (specially those of the nobility) do openly professe, that they desire not this coniunction and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto Ingland, which in no wise they can beare, both for the auersion they haue, to al Inglish gouerment ouer them, as also for that their liberties are far greater, as now they liue, then in that case it would be suffred, their king coming heerby to be of greater power to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14519:181"/>
force them to the forme of Inglish subiection, as no doubt but in tyme he would.</p>
               <p>And seing the greatest vtility that in this case by reason and probability can be hoped for by this vnion, is that the Scotish nation should come to be aduanced in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and to be made of the nobility both temporal and spiritual, &amp; of the priuy councel, and of other lyke digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of credit and confidence (for otherwise no <note place="margin">A consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> vnion or amitie durable can be hoped for) and considering that the king, both for his owne safetie (as before hath bin said) as also for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and loue to his owne nation, and allied frends, must needs plant them about him, in chiefe place of credit, vvhich are most opposite to Inglish natures, and by litle &amp; litle through occasion of emulations and of controuersies, that vvil fal out daylie betwixt such diuersity of nations, he must needes secretlie begin to fauour and fortifie his owne, as we reade that William Conqueror did his Normannes, <note place="margin">Polydot. hist. Ang. l. s. &amp;. 9.</note> and Canutus before him his Danes, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible calamity of the Inglish nation (though otherwise neither of them vvas of themselues either an euil king, or enimye to the Inglish blood (but driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hereunto for their owne saftie) and for that it vvas impossible to stand neutral in such national contentions: if al this (I say) fel out so then, as vve know it did, and our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors felt it to their extreme ruine, what other effect can be hoped for now, by this violent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:14519:181"/>
vnion of nations, that are by nature so disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and opposite, as are the Inglish, Scotish, Irishe, Danishe, Frenche &amp; other on them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, vvhich by this meanes must needs be planted together in Ingland.</p>
               <p>And if vve reade, that the vvhole realme of Spayne did refuse to admitt S. Lewis king of <note place="margin">Example of Spaine.</note> France, to be their king in Spayne (to vvhom yet by law of succession it vvas euident, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the spaniards themselues, as their chronicler Garibay writeth, that the right most <note place="margin">Garibay l. 20 c 42. An Dn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i 1207.</note> clearly dyd appertayne by his mother lady Blanch eldest daughter and heyre of K. Alonso the nynth) and that they dyd this only for that he vvas a Frenchman, and might therby bring the french to haue chiefe authority in Spayne: and if for this cause they did agree together, to giue the kingdome rather to Ferdinando the third that was sonne of Lady Berenguela, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sister to the said lady Blanch, and if this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination vvas thought at that tyme to be vvife and prouident (though against al right of lineal succession) and if vve see that it had good successe, for that it indureth vnto this day: what shal vve say in this case (say these men) vvhere the king in question is not yet a S. Lewis, nor his title to Ingland so cleere, as that other vvas to spayne, and the auersion betwixt his nation and ours, much greater then vvas that betwixt the french and Spanish, thus they do reason.</p>
               <p>Agayne we heard out of the discourse made <note place="margin">Example out of Portugal.</note> by the Ciuilian before, how the states of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal

And this is that in effect which these men do answere in this behalfe, noting also by the way, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s themselues vvith al their power, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bring vnion or peace betweene thease two nations of Ingland &amp; Scotlande, nor hold the Scots and North-Irish in obedience of any authority residing in Ingland, and so in the end they vvere enforced to cut them of, &amp; to make <note place="margin">Stovv. pa. 54. 59. 95. 76.</note> that famous walle begun by Adrian, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by other Emperours to diuide them from Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and barre them from ioyning, as al the vvorld knoweth, and much lesse shal any one king liuing in Ingland now, hold them al in obedience, let him be of vvhat nation, he vvil, and this for the vtility that may be hoped by this vnion.</p>
               <p>But now for the other pointe alleaged by the fauourers of Scotland, about establishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:14519:182"/>
of true religion, in Ingland, by entrance of this king of Scots, these other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do hold that this is the vvoorst and most dangerous pointe of al <note place="margin">Of the religion of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> other, considering vvhat the state of religion is in Scotland at this day, and how different or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opposite to that forme which in Ingland is mainteyned, and vvhen the Archbishopes, bishopes, deanes archdeacons, and other such of ecclesiastical and honorable dignities of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, shal consider that no such dignity or promotion is left now standing in Scotland, no nor any cathedral or collegiate church is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned on foote, vvith the rents and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therunto apperteyning, and vvhen our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilytie shal remember how the nobilitie of Scotland is subiect at this day to a few ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and common ministers, vvithout any head, vvho in their synodes and assemblies haue authority to put to the horne, and driue out of the realme any noble man vvhatsoeuer, vvithout remedy or redresse, except he vvil yeald and humble himselfe to them, and that the king himselfe standeth in avve of this exorbitant and populer povver of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and is content to yeld therunto: it is to be thought (say these men) that few Inglish be they of vvhat religion or opinion so-euer, vvil shevv themselues forvvard to receaue such a King, in respect of his religion, that hath no better order in his ovvne at home, and thus much concerning the King of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:14519:183"/>Now then it remayneth, that we come to <note place="margin">Of the title of lady Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</note> treat of the lady Arbella, second branch of the house of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, touching whose title, though much of that vvhich hath bin said before, for or against the king of Scotland, may also be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode to apparteyne vnto her, for that she is of the same house, yet shal I in this place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat in few wordes the principal points that are alleaged in her behalfe or preiudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>First of al then, is alleaged for her, and by her fauourers, that she is descended of the foresaid lady Margaret, eldest daughter of king Henry the seuenth, by her second marriage vvith Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald Duglas earle of Anguys, and that she is in the third degree only from her, for that she is the daughter of Charles Steward vvho was sonne to Margaret Countesse of Lenox, daughter to the said lady Margaret Queene of Scots, so as this lady Arbella is but neece once remoued, vnto the said Queene Margaret, to vvit in equal degree of discent vvith the king of Scots, vvhich king being excluded (as the fauorers of this vvoman do affirme) by the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and arguments before alleaged against hym, no reason (say they) but that this lady should enter in his place, as next in blood vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly is alleaged in her behalfe, that she as an Inglish vvoman, borne in Ingland, and <note place="margin">2. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish vvoman.</note> of parents vvho at the tyme of her birth vvere of Inglish alleageance, vvherin she goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king of Scots, as hath bin seene, as also in this other principal pointe, that by her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14519:183"/>
no such inconuenience can be feared of bringing in strangers, or causing troobles &amp; sedition vvith-in the realme, as in the pretence of the Scotish king hath bin considered, and this in effect is al that I haue heard alleaged for her.</p>
               <p>But against her, by other competitors and their frendes, I haue hard diuers arguments of <note place="margin">Against Arbella.</note> no smale importance and consideration produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, vvherof the first is, that vvhich before hath bin alleaged against the king of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, to wit, that neither of them is properly of the house of Lancaster, as in the genealogie set downe in the third chapter hath appeared. And secondly that the title of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caster is before the pretence of Yorke, as hath bin proued in <note place="margin">1. Not of the house of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster.</note> the fourth chapter, wherof is inferred, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there the king of Scots nor Arbella, are next in successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for that of these two propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ther hath bin much treated before, I remitte me therunto, only promising that of the first of the tvvo, vvhich is how king Henry the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th vvas of the house of Lancaster, touching right of succession, I shal handle more particulerly afterward vvhen I come to speake of the house of Portugal, vvherby also shal appeare playnly vvhat pretence of succession to the crowne or duchy of Lancaster the discendentes of the said king Henry can iustely make.</p>
               <p>The second impediment, against the lady <note place="margin">2. The testa ment of king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

could not be lawful, vvhich they do proue also by an other meane, for that they saie it is most certaine, and to be made euident, that the said Archibald Duglas earle of Anguis had an other vvife also aliue, vvhen he married the said Queene, vvhich points they say vvere so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique as they came to king Henries eares, vvhervppon he sent into Scotland the lord William Howard, brother to the old duke of Norfolke, and father to the present lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Ingland, to enquire of these pointes, and the said lord Howard founde them to be true, <note place="margin">The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the lord Vvillian hovvard.</note> and so he reported not only to the king, but also aftervvards many tymes to others, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely to Queene Mary to vvhom he vvas lord Chamberlayne, and to diuers others, of vvhom many be yet liuing, which can and will te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stefy the same, vppon the relation they heard from the-sayd lord Williams owne mouthe, vvheruppon king Henry vvas greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and would haue letted the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his said sister and Duglas, but that they were married in secret, and had consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their marriage, before this was knowne, or that the thing could be preuented, vvhich is thought, vvas one especial cause and motiue also to the said king afterward, to put back the issue of his said sister of Scotland, as by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named testament is pretended, and this tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Arbellas title by propinquitie of byrthe.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes mentioned since, how that the house of Suffolk is so called, for that the lady Mary seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d daughter of king Henry the seuenth, being first married to Lewis the 12. king of France, vvas afterward married to Charles Brandon duke of Suffolke, who being sent oner to condole the death of the said king, gat the good will to marry the widow Queene, though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame of al men vvas; that the said Charles had a vvife lyuing at that day, and diuers yeares after, as in this chapter vve shal examine more in particuler.</p>
               <p>By this Chatles Brandon then duke of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, this Queene Mary of France had tvvo <note place="margin">The issue of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> daughters, first the lady Francis, married to Syr Henry Gray marques Dorset, and aftervvard in the right of his vvife, duke also of Suffolke, vvho vvas afterward be-hedded by Queene Mary, and secondly lady Elenor married to Syr Henry Clifford earle of Cumberland.</p>
               <p>The lady Francis elder daughter of the <note place="margin">Issue of lady Fran cis.</note> Queene and of Charles Brandon, had issue by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:14519:186"/>
her husband the said last duke of Suffolke, three daughters, to wit, Iane, Catherin, and Mary, which Mary the yongest vvas betrothed first to Arthur lord Gray of wilton, and after lefte by hym, she was marryed to one M.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14519:187"/>
for attempting such a match with one of the blood royal, without priuity and licence of the prince, they were committed both of them to the tower, vvhere they procured meanes to meete againe afterward, &amp; had an other childe, vvhich both children do yet liue, and the elder of them is called lord Henry Beacham, and the other Edward Seymer, the mother of whom liued not long after, nether married the earle againe, vntil of late that he married the lady Francis Howard, sister to the lady Sheffeild, and this is all the issue of the elder daughter of Charles Brandon, by lady Mary Queene of France.</p>
               <p>The second daughter of duke Charles and <note place="margin">The issue of L. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anor.</note> the Queene, named L.

               <p>First of al, both of these families do ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this one pointe, to exclude the house of Scotland both by foraine birth, and by the foresaid restament of king Henry authorized by two parlaments, &amp; by the other exclusions
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14519:187"/>
which in each of the titles of the king of Scots <note place="margin">Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Darby &amp; hartford the one against the other.</note> and of lady Arbella hath bin before alleaged. But then secondly they come to vary betweene themselues, about the priority or propinquitie of their owne succession, for the children of the earle of Hartford, and their frendes do alleage, that they do discend of lady Francis the elder sister of lady Elenor, and so by law and reason are to be preferred, but the other house allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth against this, two impediments, the one, that the lady Margaret countesse of Darby now lyuing, is neerer by one degree to the stemme, that is to king Henry the seuenth, then are the children of the earle of Hartford, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently according to that which in the former <note place="margin">Charles Brandon had a vvyse a lyue.</note> fourth chapter hath bin declared, she is to be preferred, albeit the children of the said earle vvere legitimate.</p>
               <p>Secondly they do affirme, that the said chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">First ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardie against the issue of hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> of the eatle of Hartford by the lady Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin Gray, many waies are illegitimate. First for that the said lady Catherin Gray their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was lawfully married before to the earle of Penbrok now liuing, as hath bin touched, and publike recordes do testifie, and not lawfully seperated nor by lawful authority, nor for iust <note place="margin">Stovv in vita Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard. An. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> causes, but only for temporal and wordly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, for that the house of Suffolk was come into misery &amp; disgrace, vvherby she remayned stil his true wife in deede and before God, &amp; so could haue no lawful children by an other whiles he liued as yet he doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:14519:188"/>Agayne they proue the illegitimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these <note place="margin">2. Bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</note> children of the earle of Hartford, for that it could neuer be lawfully proued that the said earle and the lady Catherin were married, but only by their owne assertions, vvhich in law is not holden sufficient, for which occasion the said pretended marriage vvas disanulled in the court of arches, by publique &amp; definitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, of Doctor Parker archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, and prymate of Ingland, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth of the said children.</p>
               <p>Further-more they do add yet an other ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy also, in the birth of lady Catherin her <note place="margin">3. Bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</note> selfe, for that her father lord Henry Gray mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Docset, was knowne to haue a lawful wife aliue vvhen he married the lady Francis, daughter and heyre of the Queene of France, &amp; of Charles Brandon duke of Suffolke, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this lady Catherin, for obteyning of which great marriage, the said marques, put away his foresaid lawful vvife, vvhich was sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the L. Henry Fytzallen earle of Arondel, vvhich disorder was occasion of much vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and hatred betweene the said marques and earle euer after. But the power of the marques and fauour vvith king Henry in womens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, vvas so great at that tyme, as the earle could haue no remedie, but only that his said sister vvho liued many yeares after, had an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitye out of the said marques lands during her life, &amp; liued some yeares after the said marques
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14519:188"/>
(aftervvards made duke) vvas put to death in Queene Maries tyme.</p>
               <p>These then are three waies, by vvhich the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Darby do argue the issue of Hartford to be illegitimate, but the other two houses of Scotland and Clarence, do vrge a former ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy also that is common to them both, to <note place="margin">The fourth be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines of Suffolk.</note> wit, both against the lady Francis and the lady Eleanor, for that the lord Charles Brandon also duke of Suffolk had a wife a liue, as before hath bin signified, when he married the lady Mary Queene of France, by vvhich former wife he had issue the lady Powyse (I meane the vvife of my lord Powyse of Poystlandes in VVales) &amp; how long after the new marriage of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Charles Brandon, this former vvife did liue, I cannot set downe distinctly, though I think it were not hard to take particuler infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation therof in Ingland, by the register of the church wherin she vvas buried, but the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the countesse of Darby do affirme, that she died before the birth of L. Eleanor the second daughter, though after the birthe of lady Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and thereby they do seeke to cleare the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of Darby of this bastardye, and to lay al foure vppon the childen of Hartford before mentioned, but this is easy to be knowne &amp; verified by the meanes before signified.</p>
               <p>But now the frendes of Hartford do answere <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvere of those of hartford to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resaid ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardies.</note> to al these bastardies, that for the first two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the marriages of the two dukes of Suffolk, they saye that either the causes might

be such, as their deuorces with their former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               <p>But as for the third illegitimation, of the contract betweene the lady Catherin and the earle of Hartford, by reason of a precontract made betweene the said lady Catherin and the earle of Penbroke, that now liueth, they saye and affirme, that precontract to haue bin dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued afterward lawfully and iudicially, in the tyme of Queene Mary.</p>
               <p>There remayneth then only the fourth obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, about the secret marriage made betweene the said lady Catherin and the earle of Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, before the birth of their eldest sonne, now called L.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14519:189"/>
to the other, to be man and vvife, and vvith that mynde and intention had carnal copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhich thing is also allowed by the late councel of Trent it selfe, which disanulleth <note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Sess. 24. cap. 1.</note> otherwise al clandestine and secret contracts in such states and countries, vvher the authoritie of the said councel is receaued, and admitted, yet to iustifie these kide of marriages in the face of the church, and to make the issue therof le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and inheritable to estates and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: it is necessary by al law, and in al nations, that there should be some vvitnes to testifie this consent and contract of the parties before their carnal knowledge, for that otherwise it should lye in euery particuler mans hand, to legitimate any bastard of his, by his only woord, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of others that might in equitie of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession pretend to be his heyres, and therfore (no doubt) but that the Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury had great reason to pronounce this contract of the lady Catherin, and the earle of Hartford to be insufficient and vnlawful, though themselues did affirme that they had giuen mutual consent before, of being man &amp; vvife, and that they came together, <hi>animo mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali,</hi> as the law of wedlock requireth, but yet for that they were not able to proue their said former consent, by lawful vvitnesses, their saide coniunction was rightly pronounced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and so I conclude that the first sonne of these tvvo parties, might be legitimate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and yet illegitimate before men, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14519:190"/>
consequently incapable of al such succession, as otherwise he might pretend by his said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And this now is for the first begotten of <note place="margin">Hovv the second sonne of the earie of hart ford mav be legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</note> these two persons, for as touching the second childe, begotten in the tower of London, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers learned men are of opinion that he may be freed of this bastardy, for that both the earle and the lady being examined vppon their first child, did consesse and affirme that they vvere man and wife, and that they had meaning so to be, and to continew, vvhich confession is thought to be sufficient, both for ratifying of their old co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract, and also for making of a new yfthe other had not bin made before. And seeing that in the other former pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and marriage, their wanted nothing for iustifying the same before men, and for making it good in law, but only external testimony of witnesses, for prouing that they gaue such mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual consent of myndes before their carnal knowledge (for the presence of priest or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is not absolutly necessary) no man can say that their wanted witnesses for restifying of this consent, before the second copulation, by vvhich vvas begotten their second sonne, for that both the Queene herselfe and her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and as many besides as examined these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vppon their first acte and child birth, are vvitnesses vnto them, that they gaue their ful consents and approbations, to be man &amp; vvife, vvhich they ratified afterward in the tower by

the begetting of their second child, and so for the reasons afore-said, he must needes seeme to be legitimate, vvhatsoeuer my lord of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury for that tyme or in respect of the great offence, taken by the estate against that act, did, or might determyne to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And this is the somme of that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is treated, about these two families of the house of Suffolk, to wit of Hartford and <note place="margin">Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the house of Darby.</note> Darby, both vvhich families of Suffolke, the other two opposite houses of Scotland and Clarence, do seeke to exclude by the first ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy, or vnlawful contract betweene the Queene ofFrance and duke Charles Brandon, as hath bin seene: of which bastardye the house of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>HAVING declared the claymes, rightes and pretences, which the two noble hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Scotland and Suffolke, descended of the tvvo daughters of king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the seuenth, haue or may haue to the succession of Ingland, with intention afterward to handle the house of Portugal a part, vvhich pretendeth to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in it selfe the whole body, or at least the first and principal branch of the ancient house of Lancaster, it shal not be amisse, perhaps by the way, to treate in this one chapter, so much as appartayneth to the tvvo seueral houses of Clarence and Britanie, for that there is lesse to be said about them then of the other.</p>
               <p>And first of al, I am of opinion, that the earle of Huntington, and such other pretendors as <note place="margin">VVhy the earle of Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s house is said to be of the house of Clarence.</note> are of the house of Yorke alone, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of both houses by king Henry the seuenth, may be named to be of the house of Clarence and so for distinction sake, I do name them, for not to confound them vvith the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Scotland and Suffolke, which are termed also by the Lancastrians to be of the houfe of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14519:192"/>
Yorke alone, for that they deny them to be of the true house of Lancaster, but principally I do name them to be of the house of Clarence, for that in deed al their clayme and title to the crowne, doth discende from George duke of Clarence, as before in the third chapter and other vvhere hath bin declared, which duke George being brother to king Edward the fourth, and put to death by his order, left issue Edward carle of Warwick and of Salisbury, vvhich vvas put to death by king Henry the <note place="margin">Issue of the house of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> seuenth in his youth, and Margaret countesse of Salisbury, which Margaret had issue by Syr Richard Poole, Henry Poole lord Montague, afterward behedded, and he agayne Catherin, married to Syr Francis Hastings earle of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington, by whom she had Sir Henry Hastings, now earle of Huntington, Syr George Hastings his brother yet liuinge, &amp; others, so as the earle of Huntington vvith his said bretheren be in the fourth degree from the said George duke of Clarence, to wit his nephewes twice remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>The faide Margaret countesse of Salisbury had a yonger sonne also, named Syr Geffrey <note place="margin">Issue of S. Geffrey Poole.</note> Poole, vvho had issue an other Geffrey, and this Geffrey hath two sonnes that liue at this day in Italie, named Arthur and Geffrey, vvho be in the same degree of distance, with the saide earle of Huntington, sauing that some alleage for them, that they do discend al by male kinde from Margaret, and the earle pretendeth by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14519:192"/>
a Woman, vvherof vve shal speake after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Hereby then it is made manifest, how the earle of Huntingto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commeth to preteud to the crowne of Ingland, by the house of York only, vvhich is no other in deede, but by the debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and disabling of al other former prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dors, <note place="margin">The inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the earle of Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> not only of Portugal, and of Britanie, as stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but also of the houses of Scotland &amp; Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, that hold likewise of the house of Yorke, and that for the reasons and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vvhich in the former two chapters I haue set downe in particuler, against euery one of them, and shal here-after also againe those that remaine, vvhich arguments and obiections, or any of them, if they should not be founde sufficient, to exclude the said other houses, then is the clayme of this house of Huntington therby made voide, for that it is (as vve see) by the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger childe of the house of Yorke, that is to saye, by the second brother: so as if either the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Lancaster in general be better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of Yorke, or if in the house of Yorke it selfe, any of the fornamed pretenders descended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> K. Edward the fourth as of the elder brother, may hold or take place, then holdeth not this title of Clarence, for that (as I haue said) it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the yonger brother, must needes be grounded only, or principally vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the barring and excluding of the rest, that ioyntly do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: of which barres and exclusions laid by this house of Clarence against the rest, for that I
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14519:193"/>
haue spoken sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in the last two chapters, going tefore, for so much as toucheth the two houses of Scotland and Suffolk, and shal do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards about the other two of Britanie and Portugal, I meane in this place to omit to say any more therin, &amp; only to consider vvhat the other competitors do alleage against this house of Clarence, and especially agaynst the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns against the earle of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington. 1.</note> of the earle of Huntington, as chiefe tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler therof, for to the excluding of him, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr not only those other of opposite houses, but also the Pooles of his owne house, as now vve shall see.</p>
               <p>First then, the contrary houses do alleage ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally against al this house of Clarence, that seing their clayme is founded only vppon the right of the daughter of George duke of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, second brother to K. Edward the fourth, euident it is, that so long as any lawful issue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth of any elder daughter, of the said king Edward the elder brother (as they say much doth and cannot be denyed) no clayme or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the yonger brothers daughter, can be admitted, and so by standing vppon this, and answering to the obiections alleaged before, against the elder houses, they hold this matter for very cleere, and al pretence of this house of Clarence vtterly excluded.</p>
               <p>Secondly the same opposite houses do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage <note place="margin">2. Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the house of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington.</note> diuers attainders against the principal heades of the house of Clarence, vvherby their vvhole interests vvere cut of, as namely it is to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14519:193"/>
be shewed in three discents, the one after the other, to vvit in duke George himselfe, the first head &amp; beginner of this house, that was attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and executed, and then in the lady Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret his daughter and heyre, countesse of Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and in like manner attaynted and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: thirdly in her sonne and heyre Henry Poole lord Monrague put also to death, from vvhose daughters both the earle of Huntington &amp; his brethren, vvith the children of Syr Thomas Barrington do descende, and albeit some may say, that the said house of Clarence hath bin since those attainders, restored in blood, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply these men, that except it can be shewed that particuler mention was made of reabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same to this pretence of succession to <note place="margin">Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be in blood vvithout restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> the crowne, it vvil not be sufficient, as in like manner they affirme, that the same restoring in blood (if any such were) hath not bin sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to recouer the ancient landes and titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which this house of Clarence had before these attainders, for that they were forfeited therby to the crowne, and so say these men was their forfeited therby in like manner vnto the next in blood not attainted, this prerogatiue of succeeding to the crowne, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe by any general restauration in blood, except special mention be made therof, euen as vve see, that many houses attainted are restored daylie in blood, without restoreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their titles and dignities, and a present example we haue in the earle of Arundel restored in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14519:194"/>
blood but not to the title of duke of Norfolke, and this saye the opposite houses against this house of Clarence.</p>
               <p>But now thirdly entreth in also against the <note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Pooles against Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> earle of Huntington, the opposition of some of his owne house, vvhich is of the issue of Syr Geffrey Poole, brother to his gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d father, vvho say, that vvhen the lord Henry Montague vvas put to death vvith his mother the countesse of Salisbury, and therby both their pretences and titles cut of in them, then fel al such right as they had or might haue, vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the said Sir Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry Poole, and not vppon his neece the lady Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin daughter of the lord Henry his elder brother, and mother of the earle of Huntingto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and this for three causes. First for that he was not attainted, and so vvhether we respect his grand-father duke George of Clarence, or his great grand father duke Richard of York, the saide right in this respect discended to him, and secondly for that he vvas a degree neerer to the said dukes his ancestors, then vvas at that tyme his neece Catherine, vvhich right of nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest propinquitie, say these men, is made good &amp; lawful by al the reasons, examples, preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and authorities alleaged before in the fourth chapter of this conference, in fauour of vncles before their nephewes, and it shal not neede that vve speake any thing more of that matter in this place, but only to remit your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to that vvhich herein hath bin said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:14519:194"/>Fourthly they proue the same in fauour of Syr Geffrey, for that the lady Catherin vvas a vvoman, and Syr Geffrey a man, vvhose priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is so great in a matter of succession (as also hath bin touched before) that albeit they had bin in equal degree, and that Syr Greffrey were not a degree before her as he vvas, yet seing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor their fathers vvere euer in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the thing pretended, Sir Geffrey should be preferred, as hath bin shewed before by some presidents, and shalbe seene afterward in the case of Portugal, wherin the king of Spaine that now is vvas preferred to the crowne, for that respect only that his competitors vvere vvomen, and in equal degree of discent vvith him; and he a man. And the very like allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of propinquitie, I haue hard produced for the lady Wenefred vvife of Syr Thomas Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington (if she be yet a-liue) to wit, that she is before the earle of Huntington and his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by this reason of propinquitie in bloode, for that she is one degree neerer, to the stock then they.</p>
               <p>Fiftly and lastely, both these and other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors <note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> do alleage against the earle of Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton as an important and sufficient barr against his pretence, the qualitie of his religion, vvhich is (as they say) that he hath bin euer knowne to fauour those which commonly in Ingland are called <hi>Puritanes,</hi> and not fauoured by the state, but yet this stoppe is alleaged diuersly by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors of diuers religions: for that such as are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14519:195"/>
followers and fauoures of the forme of religion receaued and defended by publique authoritie of Ingland at this daye, vvhom for distinction sake, men are vvont to call by the name of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate protestants,</hi> these (I saye) do vrge this exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against the earle of Huntington, not vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any certaine law or statute, extant against the same, but <hi>ab aeqno &amp; bono,</hi> as men are vvont to say, and by reason of state, shewing infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences hurts damages and dangers, that must needes ensew, not only to the state pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of religion in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but also to the whole realme and body politike, if such a man should be admitted to gouerne. And this consideration of state in their opinion is a more forceable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for excluding such a man, then any sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute or particuler law against him could be, for that this comprehendeth the very intention, meaning, and drift of al lawes and lawmakers of our realme, vvhose inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sions must needes be presumed to haue bin in al tymes, to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded so great and manifest incoueniences, &amp; thus say they.</p>
               <p>But now, those that are of the Roman reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and contrary both to puritan and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant do vrge a great deale further this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, against the earle, and do alleage many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, ordinances, decrees, and statutes both of the Canon and imperial lawes, as also out of the old lawes of Ingland, vvhich in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, do debarr al that are not of their religion, and consequently, they would hereby exclude
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14519:195"/>
both the one and the other of these pretende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And in fine they do conclude, that seing their vvanteth not also some of their owne religion (called by them the Catholique) in the house of Clarence, they haue so much the lesse diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to exclude the earle of Huntingtons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for his religion, if one of that house were to be admitted of necessitie.</p>
               <p>And this is so much as seemeth needful to be spoken at this tyme and in this place, of this house of Clare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and of the pretenders therof. It resteth then that I treate something also of the house of Britanie and France, which tvvo <note place="margin">The house of Britanie.</note> houses are ioyned al in one, for so much as may apperteyne to any inheritance or pretence to Ingland, or vnto any parcel or particuler state therof, at home or abroade, that may follow the succession or right of women, vvhich the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in it selfdoth not, as is knowne, and consequently a vvoman may be heire to the one vvithout the other, that is to say, she maye be heyre to some particuler states of France inheritable by women, though not to the crowne it selfe, and so do pretende to be the tvvo daughters of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that were sisters to the late king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the third, which daughters were married, the one to the king of Spaine that now is, by whom he had issue, the Infanta of spayne yet vnmarried, and her yonger sister married to the duke of Sauoy, and the other to vvit the yonger daughter of the king of France, vvas married to the duke of Loraine, yet liuing, by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14519:196"/>
whom she had the prince of Lorayne, &amp; other children that liue at this day.</p>
               <p>This then being so cleere as it is, first, that according to the common course of succession in Ingland, and other countries, and according to the course of all common law, the Infanta of <note place="margin">The course of inheritan ce in the crovvne of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> Spaine, should inherite the whole kingdome of France, and al other states therunto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, she being the daughter and heyre of the eldest daughter of king Henry the second king of France, whose issue male of the direct line, is vvholy now ended, but yet for that the French, do pretend their law Salik to exclude vvomen, (which we Inglish haue euer denied to be good vntil now) hereby commeth it to passe, that the king of Nauarr pretendeth to enter, &amp; to be preferred before the said Infanta or her sisters children, though male, by a collateral line. But yet her fauourers say, I meane those of the Infanta, that from the dukedomes of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie, Aquitaine, and the like, that came to the crowne of France by women, and are inherita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she cannot be in right debarred, as neyther from any succession or pretence in Ingland, if either by the blood royal of France, Britanie, Aquitaine or of Ingland it selfe, it may be proued that she hath any interest therunto, as her said fauourers do affirme that she hath, by these reasons following.</p>
               <p>First, for that she is of the ancient blood <note place="margin">First pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Infan ta to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> royal of Ingland, euen from the conquest, by the elder daughter of William the conqueror
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14519:196"/>
married to Allayne Fergant duke of Britanie, as hath bin shewed before in the second chapter, and other places of this conference, and of this <note place="margin">1.</note> pointe they inferr two or three consequences. First that vvhen the sonnes of the Conqueror vvere dead without issue or made vncapable of the crowne (as it vvas presumed at least wife of king Henry the first, last sonne of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he lost his right for the violence vsed to his elder brother Robert, and vnto William the said Roberts sonne &amp; heyte) then say these men, ought the said duchesse of Britanie to haue entred as eldest sister. <note place="margin">2.</note>And secondly they saye that when duke Robert that both by right of birth and by expresse agrement with Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam <note place="margin">Polydor. in vita Guliel. Rufi.</note> Rufus, and with the Realme of Ingland, should haue succeded next after the said Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus, came to dye in prison, the said lady Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance should haue succeded him, for that his brother Henry being culpable of his death, could not in right be his heyre. <note place="margin">3.</note>And thirdly they say that at least vvise after the death of the said king Henry the first, she and her sonne I meane lady Constance and Conan duke of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie, should haue entred before king Stephen, vvho was borne of Adela the yonger daughter, of William Conqueror.</p>
               <p>Secondly they do alleage, that the Infanta of <note place="margin">Second pretence of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta of Spaine.</note> Spayne desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth also lineally from lady Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor eldest daughter of king Henry the second, married to king Alonso the nynthe of that name king of Castile, vvhose eldest daughter &amp;
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:14519:197"/>
leesing by this forfeit, al right he had in the kingdome of Ingland it followeth, that the same should haue gone to his said sister, &amp; by her to this lady Blanch her heyre, and eldest daughter, married into france as hath bin saide, which forfeit also of king Iohn, these men do confirme by his depriuation by the Pope that soone after ensewed, as also by an other depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation made by the Barrons of his realme, as after shalbe touched.</p>
               <p>Further more they saye that when Arthur <note place="margin">3. Pretence by Arthur duke of Britanie.</note> duke of Britanie (whom to this effect they do hold to haue bin the only true heyre at that tyme to the kingdome of Ingland) vvas in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the castle of Roan, suspecting that he should be murthred by his said vncle K. Iohn, he nominated this lady Blanch his cosen ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, to be his heyre, persuading himselfe that she by the helpe of her husband prince Lewis of France, and her father the king of spaine, should be better able to defend and recouer his or her right, to the crowne of Ingland then Eleanor his owne sister, should be, who vvas also in the handes of his said vncle: for that he supposed that she also should be made away by him shortly after, as in deede the french chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle affirmeth that she vvas: and howsoeuer <note place="margin">Belforest I. 3. cap. 71 hist. Fran.</note> this matter of duke Arthurs testament were; yet certaine it is, that vvhen he and his sister vvere put to death, the next in kynne, that could succeede them in their right to Ingland, vvas this lady Blanch, and her mother Queene
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14519:197"/>
Elenor, that was sister to Arthurs father, Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey duke of Britanie. For that king Iohn their vncle was presumed by al men to be vncapable of their inheritance, by his putting of them to death, and child yet he had none, and this is the second pointe that these men do deduce for the lady Infanta of Spayne, by the title of Queence Eleanor and her daughter Blanch, to whom the Infanta is next heyre.</p>
               <p>A third interest also the same men do deriue <note place="margin">Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Levvys the 8. to be King of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> to the Infanta, by the actual deposition of king Iohn by the Barons and states of his Realme in the 16. yeare of his reigne, and by the election and actual admission of Lewis prince of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, husband of the foresaid lady Blanch, whom they chose with one consent, and admitted and swore him fealtic and obedience in London, for him and for his heyres and posteritie, in the yeare 1217. and gaue him possession of the said citie and Tower of London, and of many other <note place="margin">Polydor. l. 15. hist.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14519:198"/>
who came to be king especially, vppon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne title that one of his ancestors named Odo earle of Parris, had, by being once elected king of France, and admitted and sworne, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he were deposed agayne, and yong Charles surnamed the simple was admitted in his place, as Henry the third was in England after the election of this Lewis. But yet as the other continued euer his right and clayme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was restored to Hugo Capetus one of his race, so say these men, may this Infanta co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew and renew now the demaund of this right of king Lewis her ancester, for that titles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terestes to kingdomes, once rightly gotten, do neuer dye, but remaine euer for the posterity to effectuate when they can, &amp; thus much of this matter.</p>
               <p>But after this againe, these men do shew, how that the said Infanta of Spayne, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende <note place="margin">Pretence by dissent from He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>By this third coniunction then, of the house of Britanie with the blood royal of Ingland, the frendes of the Infanta do argue in this manner, that seing she discendeth of the sister of these two brothers which were the heades of the two opposite houses of Lancaster and Yorke, and considering that each of these hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hath oftentymes bin attainted, &amp; excluded from the succession by sondry actes of parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at this present are opposite, and at contention among themselues: why may not this right of both houses (say these men) by way of composition peace and comprimise, at <note place="margin">Admissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> least, be passed ouer to the issue of their sister vvhich resteth in the Infanta.</p>
               <p>Agayne they saye that al these three bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the lines of Inglish kings, to wit by the lady Constance daughter of king William Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, by the lady Elenor daughter of king Henry the second, and by the lady Beatrix daughter of king Henry the third, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that this lady the infanta of Spaine, is of the true and ancient blood royal of Ingland, and that diuers wayes she may haue clayme to the same, vvhich being graunted, they inferr, that seing matters are so doubtful at this day, about the next lawful succession, and that diuers of the pretendores are excluded, some for bastar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14519:199"/>
some other for religion, some for vnaptnes to gouerne, and some for other causes, &amp; seing the common wealth hath such authoritie to dispose in this affaire, as before the Ciuil la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyer hath declared, why may there not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration be had among other pretenders, of this noble princesse also (saie these men) especially seing she is vnmarried and may therby co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date many matters, and salue many breaches, &amp; satisfie many hopes, and giue contentment to many desires, as the vvorld knoweth.</p>
               <p>And this is in effect as much as I haue hard <note place="margin">Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against the Infan tas pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> alleaged hitherto in fauour of the Infanta of Spayne, but against this pretence, others do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce diuers arguments and obiections, as first of al, that these her claymes be very old and vvorne out, and are but collateral by sisters. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that she is a stranger, and allien borne. Thirdly that her religion is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the state. vnto al which obiections, the fauourers afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said do make their answeres, and to the first they say, that antiquity hutteth not the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a title, vvhen occasion is offred to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the same, especially in titles apperteyning to kingdomes, which commonly are neuer presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to dye, as hath bin said, and <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi</hi> saith our law. And as for collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lines, they say, that they may lawfully be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter when the direct lynes do eyther fayle or are to be excluded, for other iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, as in our case they hold that it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. And as for the second pointe of forraine
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14519:199"/>
birth they saye there hath bin sufficient answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, before in treating of the house of Scotland, that in rigor it is no barr, by intention of any Inglish law, yet whether in reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of state &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique gouerment, it may be a iust impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or no, it shal after be handled more al large vvhen we come to treat of the house of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal. To the last pointe of religion they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that this impediment is not vniuersal, not admitted in the iudgment of al men, but only of those Inglish that be of different religion from her. But to some others (and those many as these men do vveene) her religion vvil rather be a motiue to fauour her title then to hinder the same, so that on this ground no certaintie can be buylded, and this is as much as I haue to say at this tyme of these two families of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Britanie.</p>

               <p>IT hath bin oftentymes spoken before vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon occasions offred, that the princes of the house of Portugal at this day, do persuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Iohn of Gaunt vvas duke of Lancaster by the right of his first vvife lady Blanch, and had by her only one sonne, as also one daughter, of vvhom vve neede heere to speake, for that the other hath left no issue now liuing. The sonne vvas king Henry the fourth, vvho had issue king Henry the fift, and he agayne Henry the sixt, in vvhom vvas extinguished al the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this sonne Henry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:14519:200"/>The daughter of Iohn of Gaunt by lady <note place="margin">The issue of lady Phillip Queene of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</note> Blanch vvas called Phillip, vvho vvas married to Iohn the first king of that name of Portugal, vvho had issue by him king Edward, and he agayne had issue king Alfonsus the fift king of Portugal, and he and his ofspringe had issue agayne the one after the other vntil our tymes, and so by this marriage of lady Phillip, to their first king Iohn, these princes of the house of Portugal that liue at this day, do pretende that the inheritance of Lancaster is only in them, by this lady Phillip, for that the succession of her elder brother king Henry the fourth, is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long ago. This is effect is their pretence, but now vve vvil passe on to see vvhat others say, that do pretend also to be of the house of Lancaster by a latter marriage.</p>
               <p>Iohn of Gaunt after the death of his first vvife lady Blanch, dyd marrye againe the lady <note place="margin">Issue of Iohn of Gaunt by his later vviues.</note> Constance daughter of king Peter surnamed the cruel of Castile, and had by her one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only named Catherin, vvhom he married afterward back to Castile againe, giuing her to vvife, to king Henry the third of that name, by vvhom she had issue king Iohn, and he others, so as lineally king Philippe king of Spayne is desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded from her, vvhich king Phillip being at this day king also of Portugal, and the cheife titler of that house vnto Ingland, he ioyneth <note place="margin">Sce the arbor in the end of this booke.</note> the inheritance of both the two daughters of Iohn of Gaunt, in one, &amp; so we shal not neede to talk of these two daughters hearafter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14519:201"/>
but only as of one, seing that both their discents do end in this one man.</p>
               <p>The only difficultie and dissention is then, <note place="margin">The point of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.</note> about the issue of the third marriage, vvhich vvas of Iohn of Gaunt vvith lady Catherin Swinford, whom he first kept as a Concubine, in the tyme of his second wife lady Constance, as before hath bin shewed in the third chapter, and begat of her fower children, and after that his wife lady Constance vvas dead, he tooke her to vvife for the loue he bare to his children, a litle before his death, and caused the said chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be legitimated by authority of parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for that none of these fower chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his, haue left issue, but only one, that vvas Iohn earle of Somerset, we shal speake only of him ommitting al the rest.</p>
               <p>This Iohn then earle of Somerset had issue an other Iohn, which was made duke of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set <note place="margin">Issue of Catherin Svvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> by king Henry the sixt, who vvith his three sonnes, vvere slayne by the princes of the house of Yorke, in the quarrel of Lancaster, &amp; so left only one daughter named Margaret, who by her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Edmond Tydder, earle of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, vvas Countesse of Richmond, &amp; had by him a sonne named Henry earle of Richmond, that was after king, by the name of king Henry the senenth, and from him al his discendents both of the house of Scotland and Suffolke, do pretend also to be of the house of Lancaster, which yet can be no otherwise then now hath bin declared, to wit, not from Blanch first wife

But yet to the title of the crowne <note place="margin">Duchie of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caster.</note> of Inglande, which came by Iohn of Gau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in that he vvas third sonne of K.

               <p>But to this the princes of the house of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal do reply, and say, first, that by this it is <note place="margin">Replies of the house of Portugal.</note> euident at least, that the dukedome of Lancaster vvherof the lady Blanch vvas the only heyre, must needs apperteyne to them alone, and this vvithout al doubt or controuersie, for that they only remaine of her issue after extinguishing of the posterity of her elder brother K. Henry the fourth, which vvas extinguished by the death of king Henry the sixt, and of his only sonne <note place="margin">The duke dome of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>caster.</note> prince Edward, and for this they make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or controuersie, assuring themselues that al law, right and equity, is on their side. <note place="margin">The legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin Svvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords children not lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly touching the succession and right to the kingdome, they saye, that Iohn earle of Somerset being borne out of Wedlock, and in adultery, for that his father had an other vvife
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14519:202"/>
aliue vvhen he begatt him, and he continuing a bastard so many yeares, could not be made le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate afterward by parlament to that effect of succession to the crowne, and to depriue Queene Phillip of Portugal, and her children borne before the others legitimation, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their right and succession, vvithout their consents, for that Iohn king of Portugal, did marry the said lady Phillip, vvith condition to enjoy al prerogatiues that at that day vvere due vnto her, and that at the tyme vvhen Iohn of Gaunt did marry the said lady Catherine Svvinford, &amp; made her children legitimate by act of parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (vvhich vvas in the yeare of Christ 1396. and 1397.) the said lady Phillip Queene of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, <note place="margin">Stovv in vit. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardi 2.</note> had now tvvo sonnes liuing, named don Alon so, and don Edwardo, vvhich vvere borne in the yeares 1390. and 1391. that is six yeares <note place="margin">Garibay his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal. l. 33 cap. 4.</note> before the legitimation of Iohn earle of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset, and his brethren, and therby had <hi>ius acquisitum,</hi> as the law saith, vvhich right once acquired and gotten, could not be taken away by any posterior act of parlament afrervvard, vvithout consent of the parties interressed, for vvhich they do alleage, diuers places of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law, vvhich for that they hold not in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, I do not cite, but one example they put to shew the inconuenience of the thing (if it should be otherwise determined then they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme) <note place="margin">Note this example. Stovv in vit. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici 8.</note> vvhich is, that if king Henry the eight that had a bastard sonne, by the lady Elizabeth Blunt, vvhom he named Henry fitzroy, &amp; made
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14519:203"/>
him both earle of Notingham, and duke of Richmond and Somerset in the 18. yeare of his reigne, at vvhat tyme the said king had a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful daughter a liue, named the princesse Mary by Queene Catherin of Spayne; if (I say) the king should haue offred to make this sonne le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate by parlament, with intent to haue him succeede after him, in the crowne, to the preiudice and open iniury of the said lawful daughter, these men do say that he could not haue done it, and if he should haue done it by violence, it would not haue held, and much lesse could Iohn of Gaunt do the like, being no king. Nor was the act of parlament sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for this pointe, it being a matter that depended especially (say these men) of the spiritual court, and of the Canon law which law alloweth this legitimation no further, but only as a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this so farforth only as it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the right of any other.</p>
               <p>Nether helpeth it any thing in this matter, the matriage of Iohn of Gaunt with lady Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin, <note place="margin">Iohn of Gauntes marriage vvith Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin Svvinford helpeth not the legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for to make better this legitimation, for that as hath bin said, their children vvere not only <hi>naturales</hi> but <hi>Spurij</hi> that is to saye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in playne aduoutrie and not in simple fornication only, for that the one partie had a wife a liue, and consequently the priuelege that the law giueth to the subsequent marriage of the parties for legitimating such children, as are borne in simple fornication, that is to say betweene parties that vvere single and none of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14519:203"/>
them married, can not take place here, so as these men conclude, that albeit this legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parlament, might serue them to other purposes, yet not to depriue the princes of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal of their prerogatiue to succede in their mothers right, which she had vvhen she vvas married to their father.</p>
               <p>And this they affirme to haue bin law and right at that tyme, if the said Queene Phillip &amp; earle Iohn had bin aliue together, vvhen Henry the sixt and his sonne vvas put to death, &amp; that this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bin then moued at the deathe of king Henry the sixt, whether of the two, to vvit either the said Queene Phillip or her yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother Iohn earle of Somerset by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveene lord Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip and Iohn of Somerset.</note> side only, should haue succeded in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of king Henry the sixt, in vvhich case these men presume for certaine, that the said Queene Phillippe legitimatly borne, and not Iohn made legitimate by parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, should haue succeded, for that by common course of law, the children legitimated by fauour, albeit their legitimation vvere good and lawful (as this of these children is denyed to be) yet can they neuer be made equal, and much lesse be preferred before the lawful and legitimate by byrthe.</p>
               <p>But now say these men, the case standeth at this present somewhat otherwise, and more for the aduantage of Queene Phillippe, and her ofspring, for vvhen king Henry the sixt, &amp; his sonne were extinguished, and Edward duke of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14519:204"/>
Yorke thrust hym selfe in to the crowne (which vvas about the yeare of Christ 1471) the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said two princes, lady Phillip and earle Iohn, vvere both dead, as also their children, and only their nephewes vvere aliue, that is to saye, their liued in Portugal king <hi>Alfonsus</hi> the fift of that name, sonne to king Edward, vvhich Edward vvas child to Queene Phillip, and the death of king Henry the sixt of Ingland hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the 38. yeare of the reigne of the said king Alfonsus: and in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d liued at the same tyme, lady Margaret Countesse of Richmond, mother of king Henry the seuenthe and neece of the foresaid Iohn earle of Somerset, to vvit the daughter of his sonne duke Iohn of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset, so as these tvvo competitors of the house of Lancaster, that is to say, king Alfonsus and lady Margaret, were in equal degree from Iohn of Gaunt, as also from king Henry the sixt, sauing that king Alfonsus vvas of the vvhole blood, as hath bin said, and by Queene Phillip that vvas legitimate, and the countesse of Richmond vvas but of the halfe blood, as by Iohn earle of Somerset, that vvas a bastard le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimated.</p>
               <p>The question then is, which of these tvvo <note place="margin">The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveene the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phevves.</note> should haue succeded by right, of the house of Lancaster, immediatly after the death of king Henry the sixt, and the lady Margaret allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that she vvas descended from Iohn earle of Somerset that vvas a man, and therfore to be preferred, and king Alfonsus alleaged that he

being in equal degree of neernes of blood with the same countesse (for that both vvere nephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes) he vvas to be preferred before her, for that he was a man, and of the vvhole blood, to the last kings of the house of Lancaster, and that she was a vvoman and but of the halfe blood, so that three prerogatiues he pretended before her. First that he vvas a man and she a vvoman, and secondly that he descended of the lawful and elder daughter, and she of the yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther legitimated, and thirdly that he vvas of vvhole blood, and she but of halfe, and for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortifying of this proofe of his title, these men do alleage a certayne case, determyned by the learned of our dayes as they say, vvherin for the first of these three causes only, the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to a crowne vvas adiudged vnto king Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip of Spayne, to vvit the succession to the kingdome of Portugal, vvhich case was in al respects correspondent to this of ours: for that Emanuel king of Portugal had three children, for so much as apperteyneth to this affaire (for afterward I shal treat more particulerly of his issue) that is to say, two sonnes and one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in this order, Iohn, Elizabeth and Edward, euen as Iohn of Gaunt had He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry, lady Philippe, and Iohn.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14519:205"/>
had issue K. Phillip of Spayne that now liueth. Edward also yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger brother to Elizabeth or Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel had issue two daughters, the one married to the duke of Parma, &amp; the other to the duke of Bragansa, so as king Phillip vvas in equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree vvith these ladies in respect of king Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, for that he vvas sonne to his eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the two duchesses vvere daughters to his yonger sonne, &amp; vppon this rested the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, vvhich of these should succeede, and it vvas decided that it apperteyneth vnto king Phillip, for that he vvas a man, and his mother vvas the elder sister, though if king Phillips mother and the two duchesses father I meane lord Edward of Portugal had bin aliue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no doubt but that he beinge a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should haue borne it away, vvhich these men say, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in our case, but is much more to our aduantage, for that it hath bin shewed before, that if Queene Phillippe had bin aliue vvith earle Iohn of Somerset at the death of king Henry the sixt, she should haue bin prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as legitimate, by birth, and therfore much more ought her nephew king Alfonsus to haue bin preferred afterward in that he vvas a man, before the neece of the said earle Iohn of Somerset, that vvas but a vvoman, thus farr they. <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of K.

               <p>First, for that he had byn euer so taken al the tyme of his fathers life, and no man euer dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therof, or called the matter in question,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14519:208"/>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly that his father the lord Lewis had often tymes both by word and writing testified the same, that this Antonye vvas his bastard, and had signified also so much in his last vvil &amp; testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly the said Cardinal as of himselfe, also affirmed, that if his brother the lord Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis, had euer do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne any such thinge, as to marry this Woman, who was but base in birth, and of the Iewish race, as these stories do affirme: that it is like, that he would haue made some of his owne frendes &amp; kynred acquainted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as a matter so much important for them to know, but he neuer did, though the said Cardinal auowed that himselfe was present vvith him at his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Fiftly he said, that if Don Antonio had bin legitimate, how happened that he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the succession before the Cardinal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, next after the death of king Sebastian, seing that he vvas to haue gone before the said Cardinal by as good right, as his other nephew Sebastian did, if he had bin legitimate, for that

he vvas sonne also to the Cardinales elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as hath bin saide.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6.</note>Sixtly &amp; lastly, the said king Cardinal auow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against Don Antonio, partly the disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and partly the open confessing of the vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that they were suborned by him, vppon al vvhich causes and considerations, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the iudicial sentence before alleaged.</p>
               <p>Thus passed the matter in the case of Don Antonio, vvho if he had bin legitimate, no doubt, but by al right he should haue bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before al the other pretenders to the crowne of Portugal, and must be at this day, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Ingland.</note> the crowne of Ingland, before al those that pretend of the house of Portugal, if vve graunt him to be legitimate, and much more clearly may he pretend to the dukedome of Lancaster, as before hath bin declared, for that it must discend to the lawful heyre of lady Phillip Queene of Portugall, wherof enseweth also, one consideration not impertinent to vs in Ingland, that seing we hold him there for true king of Portugal, I see not how we can denye him his right to the said dukedome, at least of Lancaster, wherof if vve would giue him but the possession with al the appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as they lye, it were no euel interteynme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for him in our country vntil he could gett the possession of the crowne in his owne.</p>

               <p>And first of al, for that the eldest of these two <note place="margin">Pretence of the duke of Parma.</note> Ladyes to vvit, Mary duchesse of Parma, vvas now dead, her eldest sonne lord Ranutio now duke of Parma, entred in her place, and allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that he represented his mother, and she her father lord Edward, which Lord if he had bin aliue, he should (no doubt) haue bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before his elder sister, lady Elizabeth mother of king Phillip, and consequently that the said lord Edwards issue ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before her issue, and this he alleaged against king Phillip.</p>
               <p>And against the duchesse of Bragansa he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, that his said mother vvas the elder si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and for that cause he vvhich now possessed her right and represented her person, vvas to be preferred before the said lady Catherine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of Bragansa, so that the foundation of this pretence, of the duke of Parma vvas, that he vvas nephew to the lord Edward, by his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest daughter, and that to king Emanuel he was nephew, once remoued, by his sonne, vvheras king Phillip vvas nephew but by his daughter only, and that the lady Catherine of

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:14519:210"/>
he was of the right discendant lyne of K. Iohn, and the Cardinal vvas but of the collateral or transuersal lyne, and that al law alloweth that the right lyne shal first be serued and preferred, before the collateral shalbe admitted, so that heerby representation is nothing furthered.</p>
               <p>This exclusion of representation, did greatly further and aduance the pretence of king Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, for the excluding of both these ladyes, and <note place="margin">K. Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippes pre tence to Portugal.</note> their issues; for that supposing (as this answere auoucheth) that their is no representation of father or mother or predecessors to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that euery pretender is to be considered only in his owne person, then it followeth, (said these men which plead for the king) that king Phillip being in equal degree of propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of blood, with the two ladyes, in respect as wel of K. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry yet liuing (for that they were al three children of brother and sister) it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that he was to be preferred before them both, as well in respect that he was a man, and they both Women, as also, for that he was el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in age, and borne before them both. And albeit the duke of Parma alleaged that he was also a man, yet was it answered that he was one degree further of from the foresaid kings, then was king Phillip, so as not respecting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of their parentes, that is to say, not considering at all, that king Phillip discended of a Woman, &amp; the two duchesses, of a man, but only, respecting their owne persons, as hath bin declared, these men auouched, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14519:210"/>
king Phillipps person was euidently to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, for that he was a degree neerer in blood then the duke of Parma, and superior in sex &amp; age, to the lady Catherine of Bragansa.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the lawyers of king Phillipps side affirmed, that he was neerer also in propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of blood to king Sebastian, the last king, then vvas the very king Cardinal himselfe, &amp; much more than any of the other two pretenders, for that he was brother to the said king Sebastians <note place="margin">Diuers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations for king Phillip.</note> mother, and the Cardinal was but brother to his gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather. And besides this, they alleaged, that Portugal did belong to the crowne of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil by diuers other meanes of old, as for that it could not be giuen away by kings of Castil in marriage of their daughters, as the principal partes therof had byn, as also for that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>king Iohn the first, that was a bastard, was made king of Portugal, by election of the people, the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance therof did euidently apperteyne to king Iohn of Castil, that had to wife, the lady Beatrix daughter and heyre of Ferdinand king of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, from which inheritance of that crowne, by open iniurye, both she and her posteritie (vvhose right is in king Phillip at this day) vvere debarred, by the intrusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the said Iohn, master of Auis, bastard brother of the foresaid king Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>These reasons alleaged diuers lawyers in the behalfe of king Phillip, and those not only Spaniards but also of diuers other countryes &amp; nations, as my authors before named do anow,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14519:211"/>
and many bookes were written of this matter, <note place="margin">Hieron. Fraki, lo Pet. Vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ianus.</note> and when the contention vvas at the hotest, then died the king Cardinal, before he could decide the same controuersie, vppon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, the king of Spaine, being persuaded that his right vvas best, &amp; that he being a Monarch and vnder no temporal iudge, vvas not bound to expect any other iudgment in this affayre, not to subiect himselfe to any other tribunal, but that he might by force put himselfe in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, of that which he tooke to be his owne, if otherwise he could not haue it deliuered vnto him (for so write these authors by me named) seing also don Antonio to pretend the said kingdome, by only fauour of some popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler partie, that he had In Lisbone; the said king Phillip entred vppon Portugal by force of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as al the world knoweth, and holdeth the same peaceably vnto the day.</p>
               <p>And I haue byn the longer in setting downe <note place="margin">The case of pretece of the hovvle of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note> this contention about the succession to the crowne of Portugal, for that it includeth also the very same pretence and contention for the crowne of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For that al these three princes before named, may in like manner pretend the succession of that interest to the house of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster, and by that to the crowne of Ingland, which doth discend from Queene Phillippe el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest daughter of Iohn of Gaunt, duke of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster, and sister of king Henry the fourth as hath largely bin declared.</p>
               <p>And albeit that some men Wil saye, that this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14519:211"/>
matter is now decided, which of these princes of the house of Portugal hath the interest to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, for that king Phillip being now prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the succession of Portugal, entreth also therby to the other right of succession of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, yet others vvill say no, for that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of succession in Portugal and Ingland be different. For that in Ingland representation ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth place, so as the children of the sonne <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vvith the ansvver.</note> though they be women, shal euer be preferred before the children of the daughter, though they be men, vvherof these men do inferr, that seing the lady Phillipps right before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the dukedome of Lancaster, and therby also to the crowne of Ingland, is to be preferred according to the lawes of Ingland, and not by the lawes of other forrayne countryes; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the selfe same right of succession that is pretended at this day by the princes of Portugal for succeding the said lady Phillippe, should be determined only by the lawes of Ingland, where representation taketh place, and not by the lawes of any other nation: Thus say they.</p>
               <p>But against this, others do alleage, that the question is not heer, by vvhat law this pretence of the blood royal of Portugal to the crowne of Ingland, is to be tried, but rather vvho is the true and next heyre and successor vnto K. Iohn the first, and to his wife Queene lady Phillippe, heyre of the house of Lancaster, which two priuces vvere king and Queene of Portugal, &amp;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14519:212"/>
their true heyre at this day hath the forenamed pretence, to the crowne of Ingland, which true and next heyre, being once knowne, it litle importeth by what law he pretendeth his said right to Ingland, whether by that of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or by this of Portugal, or by bothe, thoughe to determine this first and chief point, vvho is the next and true heyre vnto these foresaid king &amp; Queene of Portugal, the lawes of Portugal must needes be iudge &amp; not those of Ingland, and so, seing that by these lawes of Portugal, the king of Spayne; is now adiudged for next heyre, to the said princes, and is in possession of their inheritance at this day, I meane of the crowne of Portugal; these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say, that he must consequently inherite also al other rightes dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and prerogatiues belonging to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said princes, or to their posteritie.</p>
               <p>And thus you see now how great diuersitie of arguments and obiections, are and may be alleaged, on different sides, about this affayre, wherby also is made manifest, how doubtful &amp; ambiguous a matter this pointe of Inglish suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, is, seing that in one only branch of the pretenders, vvhich is in the house of Portugal alone, their are so many difficulties, as heere hath byn touched.</p>
               <p>But now the common obiection against al <note place="margin">Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</note> these titles and titlers, is, that they are old and out of vre, and not to be brought in question againe now, especially seing that both king Henry the seuenth and his issue, haue enioyed

so long the title of the house of Lancaster, as it hath, and secondly that these titles do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne vnto strangers vvhose gouerment may be dangerous many wayes vnto Ingland, and especially in that which toucheth the king of Spayne, who being so great and mightye a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch as he is, may preiudice greatly the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish libertye, and easely bring them into serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if his pretence should be fauoured, as by some it seemeth to be.</p>
               <p>This is the speach of many men in Ingland, and abroad at this day, wherunto yet some <note place="margin">An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvers.</note> others do answer, that as concerning the first obiection of the oldnes of the pretence, &amp; title, it hath bin shewed before, that by law no title to a kingdome dyeth euer, but may take place vvhensoeuer the partie to vvhom it belongeth, is able to auouch it and gett possession, and as for this pretence of the line of Portugal, they say, that it hath not such great age, but that very vvel it may shew it selfe, and be had in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion, especially at this tyme, vvhen now the issue male of king Henry the seuenth is ended, and that of necessitie, vve must returne to haue consideration of the issue of his daughters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvhich daughters, good reason (say these men) is it, that the issue of lady Phillippe Queene of Portugal should be admitted, for that albeit vve vvould haue that respect to the issue male of Iohn Earle of Somerset, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr it, or suffer it to enioy the crowne, before the issue of Queene Phillippe (and so they say
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:14519:213"/>
it seemeth that it was, for that king Henry the seuenth vvas crowned king, his mother being <note place="margin">Note this.</note> a liue, vvhich yet by ordinary course of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should haue gone before him) yet say they, it is no reason that the issue female of Iohn of Somerset, or of king Henry the seuenth should be preferred before the issue male of the said Queene Phillippe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer they saye, that the house of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Huntington do pretend a title more old and stale at this day, then this of Portugal, for that they pretend from George duke of Clarence, that neuer had the crowne, and these of Portugal pretend to be next heyre to king Henry the sixt, that did vveere the crowne of Ingland, for 40. yeares togeather, after whose death, if king Alfonsus of Portugal (who vvas then old &amp; vvearied with euel successe of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) had bin so able to preferr and follow his title, as some of that house be at this day, he vvould neuer haue suffered the house of York to haue entred, nor king Henry the seuenth to haue enioyed it after them, by the title of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster, vvhich title yet of Lancaster (say these men) king Henry the seuenth could not haue in himselfe any vvay, vvhether we respect Queene Phillippe, or Iohn of Somerset, for by Queene Phillippe, they of Portugal were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <note place="margin">By vvhat title king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the 7. did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> before him, and by waye of Iohn of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset the countesse his mother vvas as cleerly before hym, nether could he haue any title, as yet, by the house of Yorke, for that he vvas not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14519:213"/>
yet married to the daughter of king Edward; so as his crowning in the feild, and whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the kingdome, vvas without any actual title at al, but only the good will of the people, as these men do hold.</p>
               <p>To the other obiection of forraine princes &amp; <note place="margin">About forrayne povver in Ingland.</note> strange gouerment, that may come to Ingland by these pretences of the princes of Portugal: diuers men do answer diuersly, for some do graunt that it may be so, that by this meanes Ingland may come to be vnder forayne kinges, and that no hurt, or inconuenience at al would ensue therof to Ingland, but rather much good and commoditie: but other that like not vvell of this assertion, do say further, that if these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne pretence should take place, yet that al matters might be so compounded, that albeit the prince himselfe which is to rule, should be forrayne borne (vvhich they take to be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience) yet that his forces and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, should be only of the Inglish, for that he should not bring in any strainge powers into the land, no more them did king Stephen or king Henry the second, that were borne in France, or then did king Phillip of Spayne in Queene Maryes dayes, or as it is thought Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur of France should haue done, if he had married her Maiestie that now is, as once it was supposed he should.</p>
               <p>To this said one of the companie, and is it <note place="margin">About forrayne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> possible, that any man, should be of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that forrayne gouerment in what manner or kinde

so euerit be, should not be iuconuenient and hurtfull to Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, wher the people are vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye bent against it: you remember (quoth he) as concering the last two examples, that you haue alleaged, what tumult and sture their vvas raysed by some kynde of men, about the comming in of king Phillip, and what their vvas like to haue byn, about the entrance of Monsieur, if that purpose had gone for-ward.</p>
               <p>I remember wel said the Lawyer, and these men that are of this opinion, vvil say to this, that it vvas but a populer mutiney without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or any good grounde at all, and only raysed by some crasty heades, that misliked the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the princes that were to enter, and for some other driftes of their owne, but not of any sound reason or argument of state, which these men thinke rather to be of their side, &amp; in good sooth they alleage so many argumentes for their opinion, that if you should heare them, you would say it weare hard to iudge which opinion had most truth, but they are to longe for this place and so (said he I shall make an end of the matter that I haue in hand and leaue this pointe, for others to discusse.</p>

But yet to speake only of France, the rage and fury of the french vvas generally so great and implacable, against the Inglish that gouerned theare, in the reigne of king Henry the sixt, as both Polidor &amp; other stories do note (at what tyme, partly by the dissentions of the houses of York &amp; Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster in Ingland, and partly by the valour of their owne new king Charles the seuenth, they <note place="margin">The rage of the french against Inglish.</note> had hope to be ridd of the Inglish dominion) as no persuasion or reason, no feare of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no force of armes, no promisse or threat, no danger, no pittie, no religion, no respect of God nor man, could repres or stay them from rysing and reuolting euery where against the Inglish gouerment and gouernours, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring those of the Inglish nation in al partes and corners, whersoeuer they found them, without remorse or compassion, vntil they were vtterly deliuered, of their dominion.</p>
               <p>So as this matter is taught vs (say these men) euen by nature her selfe, that strangers gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

reasons before alleaged against the king of Scotlands pretence, together vvith the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and iudgements of the realmes of Spayne and Portugal, vvho resolued rather to alter the true order and course of their succession, then to admit strangers ouer them, do playnely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same.</p>
               <p>And last of al (say these men) the authoritie of holy scripture is euident, in this behalfe, for that vvhen God in Deutronomie, did fortell by <note place="margin">Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture against strangers.</note> Moyses, that the Iewes in tyme would come to change their gouerment, and to desire a king as other nations rounde about them had, he added yet this expresse conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he should be only of their owne nation, for he sayeth. <hi>Constitues eum quem Dominus Deus tuus elegerit de numero fratru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuorum, non poteris alterius gentis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem</hi>

                  <hi>regem facere, qui non sit frater tuus:</hi> that is, thow shalt make king at that tyme, such a one as thy lord God shal chuse for that dignity, out of the number of thy brethren, but thovv mayst not make a king of any other nation, but of thy owne brethren. Thus say these men, against admitting of strangers, and it seemeth that their opinion and affection, hath many followers, for that generally we see most men affected and inclined this way.</p>
               <p>But yet on the other side there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not other men vvho appeare bothe wise dis passionate &amp; <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvere in defence of fortai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> graue, that vvil seeme to consider this matter far otherwise, and do say, that al this, is but a common vulgar preiudice, of passionate men,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14519:217"/>
against strangers, rysing partly by corruption of nature, vvherby men are inclined to thinke euil of others, and to beare them little affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, especially, such as gouerne and beare rule ouer them, and so much the lesse by how much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of, they are from vs in kynred and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and partly also they saye that the same ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of lacke of dew consideration in the most parte of men, for that they weigh not the true reasons, causes, or effects of things, but only the outward shew, and so do runne away vvith the opinion and apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the populer, which for the most parte hath no other ground or foundation in it but only fancy and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, orincitation of others, that indeuour to procure tumults, and so they say it falleth out in this pointe, as vppon examination it shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>And for proofe and declaration of this their assertion, they do require first of al, that this ordinarie and common preiudice against stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or strang gouerments, be laid a side, so long at least, as the matter is in disputation, and that only the true effects, of good and profitable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, without that other circumstance, whether these frutes do come from stranger or hom-borne prince, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects <note place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of go uerments to be con sidered &amp; not the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> are peace, rest, iustice, defence of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, punishment of the wicked, vvealth, secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and other such benefites, that good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment is wont to bring with it, to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.

vveighed indifferently and vvithout passion, by wisemen, and vvheresoeuer these effects are more abundantly to be founde, their the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is best, and their the subiects are in best case, vvhatsoeuer the gouernours be, or of what nation or country, soeuer they be. And this they shew by this example following.</p>
               <p>If in two countryes or common wealthes, <note place="margin">An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> lying nigh together, the subiects of the one, should liue in al ease, vvealth and prosperity, vnder a strainger, as diuers states did vnder the Romans, and in the other they should be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, whipped, and afflicted vnder a hom-borne prince, as vve reade the Sicilians were vnder Phalaris and Dionisius their countrymen ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunts, cleare it is, (say these men) that the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and afflictions vvould not seeme the easyer, for that they come from a natural prince, but rather the heauier, and the others happye case vnder the strainger, must needs seeme to be the better, and consequently his gouerment rather to be wished: for that in very truth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; defect of euery gouerment, is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the effects there of, that redound vnto the subiects, for vvhose good it vvas first ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as oftentymes our frend the Ciuil lawyer hath touched and proued before. And vvhen the subiects do liue vvel, and prosperously, are defended and maynteyned in peace, saftie, and vvealth, when iustice is done equally to al men, the vvicked punished, and the good aduanced and rewarded: when God is honoured, and true

                  <note place="margin">VVho are properly straingers</note> of the vulgar people, be aparted in this matter, from truth and substance, as also say they, vve ought to desire and determine vvho are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly straingers, or forrainers, seing that some do take for straingers and forayners, al those that are not of the same dominion and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, though otherwise they be of the same nation, and language, according as those other men that are enimyes to straingers, saide a litle before (if you remember) that the princes of the house of Guyse, and their kynred are taken for straingers in france, by them that by that meanes, would make them odious to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for that their ancestors in tymes past came out of Lorayne, vvhich is a prouince ioyning hard vppon france, of the same nation, la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, and manners, but only vnder an other prince. And so I my selfe noted in my traueling throughe Italie, that the Flora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines are hated &amp; called straingers in Siena, vvhere they gouerne, albeit the one state be not 30. myles from the other, and both of one nation language man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14519:219"/>
and education. And on the contrary side, vve shal se, that some of different language &amp; nation do hold themselues for country men, as for example, the Biscayns in Spaine, do not hold the Castilians for straingers, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be ruled by them, as by their owne countreymen, albeit they be a different nation and haue different language aud manners, and the same I do note in the Britaynes and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans towards the French, in the welsh also towards the Inglish, vvho are a different people and of different language, and yet are they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned peaceably by the Inglish, &amp; the Inglish againe do accompt them for their country me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as may appeare by that, vvhen king Henry the seuenth, came to be king of Ingland, I do not finde, any resistance made against him by the Inglish, for that respecte that he vvas of that nation, as euidently he vvas by his fathers side, that vvas of the Tidders of vvales, so as this pointe also vvho be straingers and vvho be not, seemeth to be a thing that dependeth much of the opinion and affection of each people &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one towards the other.</p>
               <p>And this being so, these men come to treate <note place="margin">Diuers manners of being vnder strangers.</note> more particulerly of the purpose in hand, and do saye that in two or three manners a nation may come to be vnder the gouerment of strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or forrayners, first as a prouince, that is to saye as a peece or member of an other domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as Ingland vvas in tymes past vnder the Romans, and as Ireland is vnder Ingland at
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14519:220"/>
this day and as the Brittons are vnder France, and as many states of Italie, be vnder the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Aragon, and Castile. And this may come to passe either by Conquest and force of armes, as the Welsh came to be vnder the Inglish, and the Inglish to be vnder the Normans and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and as Sicilia and Naples came to be vnder the Spaniards, and as Normandye and Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine came to be vnder the French, &amp; as almost al the world in old tyme was brought to be vnder the Romans: or otherwise the same may come to passe by inheritance, as Aquitaine and Normandie in tymes past came to Ingland, &amp; as Flanders vvith the states therof came to the house of Austria, and as Britany to the crowne of France, or els thirdly it may happen by mixt meanes, that is to say, partly by force and partly by other meanes of composition, as Milla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came to Spayne, and Ireland to Ingland, according as the Irish do hold, and so Portugal hath in out dayes come to the king of Spaine, for that besides his pretence and right of inheritance, he vsed also force of armes for getting the same.</p>
               <p>Of al these three vvayes then euident it is, <note place="margin">To be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by Coquest.</note> that Conquest is the hardest, and most preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the subiects, for that theare, al standeth at the wil and clemency of the Conqueror, vvhom either anger or feare, or ielosie of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, may often driue to hold a hard hand ouer the conquered, at least vvise for a tyme, vntil his estate be better setled, so that I maruaile

not though no people or country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly would willingly be conquered, but yet pollicye also teacheth such a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror, vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be, that as on the one side, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to be watchful &amp; so to fortyfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as the vnquiet can do him no hurt, so on the other side, is it necessarie by the same rule of pollicie to vse al fauour and sweete meanes to content &amp; gayne those that be or may be made quiet, for better establishing of his state, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a Phisition after a vehement purgation, doth minister lenitiues and sofre medicines, to calme and appease the good humors left, and to strenghten the vvhole body againe that it may hold out.</p>

For better explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vvhich point yet, I haue thought good to cite in this place, the woordes of a certaine learned kinght, that in our dayes hath written the liues of al the <note place="margin">Pedro Mexia en vit. de Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Pio.</note> Roman Emperors, and in the life of one of them, that vvas an excellent gouernour, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> the said kinght hath this discourse ensuinge.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14519:229"/>
false vvaight of fond affection,</p>
               <p>And thus much may be sayd of the first waye of being vnder strangers and forayne gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is that, which vulgar men do most abhorre and inueigh against, to vvit, to be vnder a forraine Prince, that liueth absent and ruleth by his gouernours.</p>
               <p>But besides this, their is an other manner of being vnder a forraine Prince, as vvhen an <note place="margin">The seeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vvaye of being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Prince.</note> allien Prince cometh to dwel among vs, and this by either of two vvayes, to vvit, that either this Prince cometh without forces, as did king Stephen, and king Henry the second, that were frenchmen, as hath bin saide, and came to liue and gouerne in Ingland, but vvithout external forces: and as king Phillip of Spayne, came afterwards when by marriage of Queene Mary he became king of Ingland: and as the last king Henry the third of France vvent into Polonia, by the free election and inuitation of that nation, and as his brother Monsieur Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis duke of Alenson, should haue entred after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard to haue bin king of Ingland, if the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage pretended betweene her maiestie and him had gone forvvard and taken effect, as many thought once that it should. This I say is one way, and an other is, that this Prince do bring forces vvith him, for his owne assurance, and these either present, as the Danish kings <hi>Sweno, Canutus, Haraldus,</hi> and <hi>Hardicanutus</hi> did, and as after them the Norman Princes also vsed, I meane not only William Conqueror,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14519:230"/>
himselfe, but also his two sonnes Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rufus, and Henry the first, who either by help of the Normans, al ready in Ingland, or by others brought in by them afterward, vvrought their vvil, or els that this Prince so entring haue foraine forces, so at hand, as he may call and vse them vvhen he vvil, for that they haue no sea to passe, vvhich is the case of the king of Scotts, &amp; of both these waies these men do giue their sentence distinctly.</p>
               <p>For as concerning the former vvay, vvhen a <note place="margin">A fortay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Prince vvithout forces not preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</note> forraine Prince entereth vvithout any forces atal, and with intention to liue among vs, they hold, that their is no danger, nor yet any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience can iustly be feared: for that in this case he subiecteth himselfe, rather to the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and nation, then they to him, and if he liue and marry in Ingland, both himselfe and his children, wil become Inglish in a little space. And for his owne assurance he must be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fauour, and cherish, and make much of the Inglish nation, and be liberal gentle, and frendly to al, for gaining their good willes and frendship. And in one very great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant pointe, his condicion is different, and better for the Inglish, then any Inglish kings can be, which is, that he entreth vvith indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <note place="margin">Note this vtilitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14519:231"/>
being vnder forrayne Princes. To the third, <note place="margin">A third vvay of being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment</note> they confesse, that it standeth subiect to much danger, and inconuenience, to admit a forayne Prince, to liue among vs, with forces, either present or so neere, as that without resistance he may call them when he listeth, and of this their needeth no more proofe (say these men) then the examples before alleaged of the Danes and Normans, and the misery and calamity which for many yearee, the Inglish passed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and further more the reason heerof is euident, say these men, for first in this third kinde of admitting a strainger king, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued by his dwelling amongest vs, of those vtilities before mentioned, which Ireland, Flanders, Britanie, Naples, and other states, enioy by liuing far of from their Princes, which commodities are, much more libertie, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, lesse payments, lesse punishments, more imployments of the nobility and others in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, and the like. And secondly, by his comming armed vnto vs, we cannot expect those commodities, vvhich before I touched in the second kynd of forraine gouerment, but rather al the incommodities and inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are to be found either in domestical or foraine gouerments al (I saye) do fall vppon this third manner of admitting a stranger, as easily shalbe seene.</p>
               <p>For first of al the greatest incommodities that can be feared of a domestical Prince, are, pride, crueltie, partiality, pursuing of factions,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14519:231"/>
and particuler hatred, extraordinary aduansing <note place="margin">Dangers of domes tical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment.</note> of his own kynred, pressing, pynching, and ouer rigorous punishing of his people, without feare, for that he is euer sure of his partie to stand whith him within the realme, and so hath he the lesse respect to others, and for that al these inconueniences, and other such like, do grow for the most part, by the Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual presence among his subiects, they are incident also to this other, though he be a strainger, for that he is also to be present, and to liue among vs, and so much the more easely he may fall into them, then a domestical Prince, for that he shal haue both external cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of a people that hateth vs, to prick him forward in it, as also their external power to assist him in the same, which two motiues euery domestical Prince hath not.</p>
               <p>Agayne they say, that the woorst &amp; greatest incommodities of a forraine gouerment, that <note place="margin">Inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of this go uerment.</note> may be feared, are, tyranny and bringing into seruitude, the people ouer who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gouerne, and filling of the realme with straingers, and deuiding to them, the dignities, riches and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments of the same, al which they say, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident also by al probability to this third kinde of forraine gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where the Prince strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lyueth present and hath forces at hand to woorke his vvil, and this is the case, say they, of the king of Scotts, who only of any forraine pretender, semeth may iustly be feared, for these and other reasons alleaged before, when
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14519:232"/>
we talked of his pretence to the crowne.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, these men are of opinion, that of al these three manners of being vnder straingers, or admitting forraine gouerments, this third kynde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> as it vvere to the kinge of Scottes case, is to be only feared, and none els, for as for the second they say that it is not only not to be feared, or abhorred, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much to be desyred, for that of al other sortes, it hath the least inconueniences, and most commodities, for which causes, we read <note place="margin">Strang gouer nours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired in some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alines.</note> and see, that wher kings goe by election, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they take straingers, as the Romans and Lacedemonians did often at the beginning, and after the beginning of the Roman Monarchie, their forraine borne Emperors, were the best and most famous of al the rest, as Traian and Adrian that were Spaniards, Septimius Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus borne in Africa, Constantine the great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural of Ingland, and the like, and the very woorst that euer they had, as Caligula, Nero, Heliogabolus, Commodus, and such other like plagues of the weale publique, were Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and in our dayes, and within a few yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, we haue seene that the Polonians, haue chosen three kings straingers, one after an other, the first Stephen Battorius Prince of Transiluania, the second Henry of France, and last of al the Prince of Swecia, that vet liueth, and the state of Venetians by way of good pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liei, haue made it for a perpetuall Law, that when they haue warr to make, and must needs

               <p>As for the first manner, of being vnder forai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne gouerment, as a member or prouince of an other bigger kingdome, and to be gouerned by a deputie, viceroy or strange gouernour, as Ireland, Flanders, Naples, and other states be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned be, vvith certayne and stable conditions of liberties, and immunities, and by a forme of gouerment agreed vppon on both sides, these men do confesse also, that their may be arguments, reasons, and probabilities allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on both sides, and for both parties; but yet that al things considered and the inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, hurtes, and dangers before rehearsed, that subiects do suffer also oftentymes, at the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of their owne natural Princes, these men are of opinion, for the causes alredy declared, that the profittes are more and far greater, then the damages or dangers of this kynde of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are, and so they do answere, to

same: and as for Demosthenes no maruaile <note place="margin">Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes.</note> though he were so earnest against king Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip of Macedonia his entry vppon the citties of Greece, both for that he was wel feede on the one side, by the king of Asia (as al authors do affirme) to the end he should set Athens and other Grecian citties against king Phillip, as also for that his owne common wealth of Athens vvas gouerned by populer gouerment wherin himselfe held stil the greatest svvaye by force of his tonge with the people, and if any king or Monarch of what nation soeuer, should haue come to commaund ouer them, (as Phillipps sonne king Alexander the great did soone after) Demosthenes should haue had lesse authority, as he had, for that presently he was banished, and so continued all the tyme that Alexander lived. But if vve do consider how this state of the Athenians passed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnder the great monarchy of Alexander and other his followers, in respect that it did before when it liued in libertye, and vnder their owne gouerment only, he shal finde their state much more quiet, prosperous, and happie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commandement of a strainger, then vnder their owne, by whom they vvere conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tossed and turmoyled with bralles, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and seditions, and oftentymes tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, by their owne people as the bluddy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions <note place="margin">The troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome state of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.</note> of their Captaines Aristides, Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles, Alcibiades, Pericles, Nicias, and others do declare, and as it is euident amonge other

               <p>AFter the lawyer had ended his discourse, about forraine gouerment, he seemed to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14519:235"/>
be somwhat wearied, and said he vvould passe no further in this affaire, for that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els to saye but only to note vnto them that besides these principal titlers, of the fiue houses mentioned, of Scotland, Suffolke, Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Britanie and Portugal, their were other secondary houses and lines also issued out of the houses of Lancaster and Yorke, as also of Glocester Buckingam, and some other, as may <note place="margin">Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dary Lines.</note> appeare by the genealogies set downe before in the 2. and 3. chaptres, of which lines (sayd he) their may be perhapps consideration had also by the common wealth when tyme shal come of choise or admission, the matter stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so as the Ciuilian hath largly declared &amp; shewed before, which is, that vppon such iust occasions, as these are, the common vvealth may consult what is best to be done, for her good and preseruation, in admittinge this or that pretender, seing that this is the end why al gouerment was ordeyned, to benefite the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique.</p>
               <p>And for so muche as their is such variety of persons pretende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or that may pretend, in the fiue houses alredy named, as before hath byn declared, (which persons at least do make some dosen more or lesse) and that besides these, their want not others also of secondary houses, as is euident as vvell by the former discourse, as also by the arbor that of these matters is to be seen, the lawyer turned to affirme againe, that the euent must needes be excedinge doubtful, who
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14519:235"/>
shall in the ende preuaile, for that besides the multitude before named of pretenders, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched very seriously, that after al this his speech, he could not vvell resolue with him <note place="margin">Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guite of preuailin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.</note> selfe, vvhich of al these titles in true right of succession, was the best, and much lesse, which of the tytlers vvas likest to preuaile, and this I presume the lawyer told them of himselfe, for that he did easely forsee and imagine, that after al these arguments, on euery side alleaged, he should be requested by the company (as vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently he vvas) to put downe his opinion what he thought and iudged of al the whole matter hitherto discussed, and of euery mans pretence in particuler.</p>
               <p>Which in no case he could be brought to do for a longe tyme, but refused the same vtterly and craued pardon, and yeilded many reasons why it was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, &amp; might be odious. But al would not serue to acquiet the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, which with all earnest importunitie vrged hym to satisfie their request, &amp; so vppon large, and earnest intreaty, he vvas content in the ende to yeeld to this only, that he would lay together by way of discourse, the probabilities of euery side, and lastly set downe in two or three propositions, or rather coniectures, his priuate ghesse vvhich of them in his iudgment vvas likest to preuaile.</p>
               <p>First then he began to say, that the probali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">Tvvo groundes of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of speeding.</note> of preuailing or not preuailing of euery one of these pretendors in the next succession,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14519:236"/>
of the crowne of Ingland these pretendors, maye be considered and measured either in respect of the partie of religion, that vvas like in Ingland to fauour him, and his pretence, or els in respect of his owne particuler familie, frends, and allies, both at home and abroad. And for that the partie of religion is like to weigh most, and to beare the greatest swaye, and most potent suffrage and voice, in this action, and that with reason, according to that the Ciuilian hath proued at large in the last of his discourses: therefore shal I also (quoth the lawyer) first of al treat of this pointe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this my last speeche.</p>
               <p>It is wel knowne (said he) that in the realme <note place="margin">Three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in Ingland.</note> of Ingland at this day, there are three different and opposite bodies of religion, that are of most bulk, and that do carry most sway, and power, which three bodies, are knowne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in Ingland by the names of Protestants, Puritanes, and Papistes, though the later tvvo, do not acknowledge these names, and for the same cause would not I vse them neither, if it vvere not only for cleernes and breuities sake, for that as often I haue protested, my meaning is not to giue offence to any side or partye.</p>
               <p>These three bodies then (quoth he) do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in effect al the force of Ingland, and do make so general a diuision and separation, through-out the whole lande, in the hartes &amp; myndes of their frends, fauourers, &amp; followers, as if I be not deceaued, no one thing is lyke so
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14519:236"/>
much to be respected, in each pretender, for his aduancement or depression, as his religion or inclination therin, by them that must assist him at that daye, and are of different religions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And more I am of opinion (sayd he) that albeit in other changes heertofore in Ingland, as in the entrance of king Edward and Queene <note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of religion in this actions.</note> Mary, and of this Queenes Maiestie that now is, diuers men of different religions, did for other respects, concur and ioyne together for these Princes aduancements, (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that afterwards many of them repented the same) which is to be seene, in that for king Edward al the realme without exception did concurr, and for Queene Mary, it is knowne, that diuers protestants did by name, &amp; among other points it is also knowne that Sir Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Throgmorton a feruent protestant in those dayes, being of king Edwards priuy chamber, dyd not only, aduise her of the sycknes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of king Edward from day to day, but also was the first that sent an expresse messenger to aduise her of her brothers death, and vvhat the two dukes of Northumberland and Suffolke, did contriue against her, and that with such celeritye, that king Edward dying but on thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night, the tenth of Iuli the Lady Mary was most certainly, aduised therof, by saterday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning next, and that very early, in kenninghal castle of Norfolke, 80. miles of, and diuers other protestants did assist her also, in that her entrey, as in like manner al those of the Roman

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:14519:237"/>
that day (sayd he) and especially if he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale for a tyme, the disceasse of her Maiestie, vntil he may be able to put his affaires in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but this is holden to be either impossible or very hard, for the different iudgments and affections which are not thoughte to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the court councel, and Princes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it selfe, wherof we saw the effect, (as before I tould you) at the death of king Edward, which was as much indeuoured to be kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctet, as euer any was, and as much it imported the concealers, and yet with in not many hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res after, had the Lady Mary, most certayne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice therof, by those that were opposite to her in religion, as I haue shewed before, so ardent are mens myndes in such occasions, &amp; so capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of new impressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s designeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; desires, are al kinde of subiects vppon such great changes.</p>
               <p>A chiefe member of the protestant body (as <note place="margin">The Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argie.</note> you know) for wealth and force, is the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Ingland, especially the bishops and other men in Ecclesiastical dignity, which are like to be a great backe to this partie, at that day, though some men thinke that it be not very certayne, which part of the nobilitie and councell will stick vnto them, for that many in hart are presupposed to fauour the Puritan. <note place="margin">The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14519:237"/>
gentlemen according to each mans state and calling in seueral, and for the next successor, seing none is knowne nor sworne in the life of this Prince, (nor were it her safetie that any should be) cleere it is, that after her Maiesties discease, euery man is free vntil a new be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, by the common wealth, which esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth not depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vppon the appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or wil of any few, or vppon any mans proclayming of himselfe, (for diuers are like to proclayme themselues) but vppon a general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the whole body of the realme, which how it vvill be brought to passe, God only knoweth, &amp; to him we must commende it.</p>
               <p>I do no know, quothe he, of any certaine person pretendent, to whom this protestant <note place="margin">Persons designed or fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant partie.</note> partye is particularly deuoted, at this day, more then to the rest, thoughe the house of Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was wont to be much fauoured by them, but of latter yeares little spech hath bin therof, but rather of Arbella, whom the Lord Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reris sayd especially to fauour at this present, though for himselfe it be held somvvhat doubtful whether he be more fast to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, or to the puritan, but if the protestant partye, should be deuided, then their forces wilbe the lesse. The authority of her maiestie is that which at this present ouer beareth al, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that shal fayle, no man knoweth what the euent vvilbe, for that now mens hartes are hardly descerned.</p>

               <p>The puritan is more generally fauoured <note place="margin">Of the party Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titan.</note> through-out the realme with al those vvhich are not of the Roman religion, then is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, vppon a certayne general perswasion, that his profession is the more perfect, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in great townes where preachers haue made more impression in the artificers, and burgesses, then in the country people. And among the protestants, themselues, al those that are lesse interessed in Ecclesiastical liuings or other preferments, depending of the state, are more affected commonly to the puritans, or easily are to be induced to passe that way for the same reason. The person most fauoured by the puritans hitherto in common voice and opinion of men, hath bin the earle of Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, some speech of late of some diminution
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14519:238"/>
therin, and that the Lord Beacham since his <note place="margin">Persons affected by the Puritans.</note> marriage, hath entred more in affection with them. The king of Scotts (no doubt) if he were not a strainger, and had not the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before mentioned, were for his religion also very plausible. I do not heare that the earle of Darby or his mother, is much forward with these or with the protestant, though of the later sort, some are snpposed to vvish them vvell.</p>
               <p>The frendes &amp; allies of the puritan abroade, are the same, that are of the Protestant, to <note place="margin">External frends.</note> wit, those of Holland and Zealand, and such townes of France as follow the new king, and ioyntly haue chainged their religion, which are not many, for that his greatest forces are yet those of the Roman Religion, but yet if the sayd king preuaile and perseuer in his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which of late as I haue sayde is called in doubt by his often protestations to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and open going to masse) then wil he be able to giue good assistance, thoughe both these countryes (I meane both Holland and France) are liker in some mens opinions, to assist the puritan then the protestant, if the matter come in difference betweene them, for that in truth they are more conforme to the puritan reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And as for the German citties, that kepe yet and follow the particuler forme of Luther <note place="margin">

               <p>The Puritan parte at home in Ingland, is <note place="margin">The Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</note> thought to be most vigorouse of any other, that is to say, most ardent, quick, bold resolute, and to haue a great part of the best Captaines and souldiers on their side, which is a pointe of no smal moment. Greatly wil import among other poyntes which waye inclineth the cittye of London, with the tower, wherof the puritan (as is sayde) wanteth not his probability, as neither doth he of some good part (if not more) of the nauy, to be at his deuotion, which point perhapps at that day, vvilbe of as greate conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as any thing els, &amp; so much of him.</p>

throughout the realme, and this partly for the reason I mentioned before, in that the most part of the country people, that liue out of cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and great townes (in which the greatest part of Inglish forces are wont to consist) are much affected ordinarily to their religion, by reason that preachers of the contrarie religion are not so frequent with them, as in townes, <note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye great &amp; vvhy.</note> and partly also for that with these kinde of men, as with them that are most afflicted and held downe, at this tyme, by the present state, many other do ioyne (as the manner is) <hi>&amp; omnes qui amaro animo sunt, cum illis se coniungunt,</hi> as the <note place="margin">1.

and the earle of Darby haue the difference <note place="margin">The Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham &amp; the earle of Darby.</note> of titles that before hath bin seene, and each one his particuler reasons why he ought to be preferred before the other, and for their other abilities and possibilities, they are also different, but yet in one thing both Lords seeme to be like, that being both of the blood royal, they are thought to haue abased themselues much by their marriages with the two knightes dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghters S. Richard Rogers, and S. Iohin Spenfer, though otherwise both of them very vvorship ful, but not their matches in respect of their kinred with the crowne, yet doth the alliance of S. Iohn Spenser seeme to bringe many more frends with it, then that of S. Richard Rogers, by reason of the other daughters of S. Iohn, vvel married also, to persons of importance, as namely the one to S. Georg Catey gouernour of the he of Wight, vvho bringeth in also the Lord Hunsdon his father Captaine of Barwick, tvvo of the most important peeces that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath.</p>
               <p>And for that the said Lord Hunsdon, and <note place="margin">Alliance of the earle of Darby.</note> the Lady knowles disceased, were brother and sister, and both of them children to the Lady Mary Bullen, elder sister to Queene Anne, here of it cometh, that this alliance with S.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:14519:241"/>
ahd erents and followers, which are nether, few nor feeble, al which wanteth in the marriage of the Lord Beacham.</p>
               <p>An other difference also in the ability of <note place="margin">Alliance of the Seymers.</note> these two Lords is, that the house of Seymers in state and title of nobility, is much yonger then the house of Stanleys, for that Edward Seymer late earle of Hartford, and after duke of Somerset, was the first beginner therof, who being cut of together with his brother the Admiral, so soone as they were, could not so setle the saide house, especially in the alliance with the residue of the nobilitie, as otherwise they would and might haue done. But now as it remayneth, I do not remember any allyance of that house, of any great moment, except it be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry Seimer of Hamshire, and of S. Edward Seymer of Bery Pomery in Deuonshite, if he haue any, and of S. Iohn Smith of Essex, whose mother vvas sister to the late duke of Somerset, or finally the alliance that the late marriage of the earle of Hartford, with the Lady Francis Haward, may bring with it, which cannot be much, for so great a purpose as we talke of.</p>
               <p>But the earle of Darby on the other side, is very stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly &amp; honorably allied, both by father <note place="margin">Alliance of the Stanleys</note> and mother, for by his father not to speake of the Stanleys, (which are many and of good power, and one of them matched in the house of Northumberland) his said father the old
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14519:242"/>
earle had three sisters, al wel married, and al haue left children, and heyres of the houses wherin they were married, for the elder vvas married first to the Lord Sturton, and after to S. Iohn Arundel, and of both houses hath left heyres male. The seconde sister vvas married to the Lord Morley, by whom she hath left the Lord that now is, vvho in lyke manner hath mached vvith the heyre of the Lord Montegle vvho is likevvise a Stanley. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the third sister vvas married to S. Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Poynes of Glocestershire, and by him had a sonne and heyre that yet liueth. And this by his fathers side, but no lesse alliance hath this earle also by the side of his mother, vvho being <note place="margin">Allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the old countesse of Darby.</note> daughter of George Cliford earle of Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by Lady Eleanor neece of king Henry the seuenth, the said Lord George, had afterward by a second wife, that was daughter of the Lord Dacres of the North, both the earle of Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland that now is, and the Lady wharton, who hereby are brother and sister of the halfe blood, to the said Countesse of Darby, and the Dacres are their Vncles.</p>
               <p>Besides al this, the states and posfessions of the two forsaide Lordes, are far different, for <note place="margin">The sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Lord Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham and the earle of Darby.</note> the purposse pretended, for that the state of the earle of Hartford is far inferior, both for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, situation, wealth multitude of subiects, &amp; the like: for of that of the Stanleys, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the most part of the shires of Lancaster
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14519:242"/>
and Chester, and a good parte of the North of Wales, (at least wise by way of obseruance and affection) as also the Ile of man, is their owne, and Ireland and Scotland is not far of, vvhere frendship perhapps in such a case might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, and finally in this poynte of abillity great oddes is their seene betweene these Lordes.</p>
               <p>As for their religion, I cannot determyne <note place="margin">Religion of these Lords.</note> what difference their is, or may be betweene them. The Lord Beacham by education is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be a protestant, albeit some hold that his father, and father in law be more inclined towards the Puritans. The earle of Darbyes religion, is held to be more doubtful, so as some do thinke him to be of al three religions, and others of none, and these agayne are deuided in iudgments, about the euent heerof, for that some do imagin that this opinion of him, may do him goode, for that al sides heerby may (perhapps) conceaue hope of him, but others do persuade themselues that it vvil do him hurt, for that no side in deede will esteeme or trust him, so as al these matters with their euents, and consequences do remayne vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>But now will I passe to speake of the house <note place="margin">The earle of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington.</note> of Clarence, the cheefe persons, wherof, and most emynent at this day, are the earle of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington, and his bretheren the Hastings, for that the Pooles and Barringtons are of far meaner condition and authoritie, albeit the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14519:243"/>
other also, I meane the house of Hastings, doth not seme to be of any great allyance, for that albeit the old earle of Huntington, this earles father, had two brethren, the one S. Thomas Hastings, that married one of the Lord Henry Pooles daughters named Lord montague, that was put to death, which daughter was sister to this earles mother, and the other named S. Edward Hastings vvas made Lord of Lowgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borow, by Queene Mary, to whom he was first master of the horse, and afterward Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, neither of them hauing left issue: and this is al I remember by his fathers side, except it be his owne brethren as hath bin said of which S. George Hastings is the cheefest.</p>
               <p>By his mothers side, he hath only the Poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, whose power as it is not great, so what it <note place="margin">Allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the earle of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington.</note> is, is rather lyke to be agaynst him then with him, partly for their difference from him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and partly for preferment of their owne title, vppon the reasons before alleaged.</p>
               <p>By his owne marriage with the daughter of the late duke of Northumberland, and sister to the late earles of Lecester and Warwicke, he was lyke to haue drawne a very great &amp; strong alliance if the said two earles had liued, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, S.

cheefe secretary of the state, by al which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and by al the affection and power of the party puritan, and much of the protestant, this earle was thought to be in very great forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But now these great pillers being fayled, and no issue yet remayning by the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse, his wife, no man can assure himselfe what the successe wil be, especially seing that of the three bodyes of different religions, before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, it is thought that this earle hath incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deeply the hatred of the one, and perhapps some ielousy and suspition of the other, but yet others do say (and no doubt but that it is a matter of singular importance if it be so) that <note place="margin">The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver of London.</note> he is lyke to haue the whole power of London for him, which citty did preuaile so much in aduancing the title of Yorke, in king Edward the fourth his tyme, as it made him king twise, to wit once at the beginning, when he first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and put downe king Henry the sixt, and the second tyme, vvhen he being driuen out of the kingdome by his brother the <note place="margin">Polydor. 24.

               <p>The lady Infanta of Spayne pretendent of <note place="margin">Infanta of Spayne</note> the house of Britanie, is eldest daughter of king Phillip as al the world knoweth, and dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of him, and that worthely as al men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that come from thence, for that she is a princesse of rare partes both for bewty, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and pietie. The two yong Princes of <note place="margin">Duke of Parma.</note> Parma I meane both the duke and his brother the Cardinal, are ympes in like manner of great expectation, and diuers wayes neere of kynn to the said king, for that by their fathers side they are his nephewes that is the childeren of his sister, and by their mothers side almoost as neere, for that they are the nephewes of his vncle Prince Edward Infant of Portugal.</p>

               <p>What the powers and possibilities of al these <note place="margin">Povver of forrayne prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders.</note> Princes of the house of Portugal be, or may be heerafter for pursuyng their right, shal not neede to be declared in this place, for that al the world doth know and see the same, yet al seemeth to depend of the heade &amp; roote which is the king of Spayne himselfe, and the yonge Prince his sonne, whose states and forces how and where they lye, what allyance, frendes, subiects or followers they haue or may haue, it is easy to consider, but what part or affection of men they haue or may haue heerafter in Ingland it selfe, when tyme shal come, for the determyning of this matter, no man can tell at this present, and what plotts agreements, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partitions, or other conclusions may be made at that day, tyme only must teach vs, so as now I know not well what to say further in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, but only commend it to Gods highe prouidence, and therefore I pray you (quoth the Lawyer) let me ende with this only that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy I haue saide, and pardon me of my former promisse to put my opinion or ghesse, about future matters, and what may be the successe of these affaires, for besides that I am, no prophet

               <p>Thus he said, and fayne would haue left of heere, but that the whole company opposed themselues with great vehemencie, against it, and sayde, that he must needes performe his promisse, made at the beginning of this speech, to giue his censure &amp; verdite in the end, what he thought would be the successe of al these matters, wherunto he answered, that seing no nay would serue, he would breifly quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by these few woordes following.</p>
               <p>First of al (said he) my opinion is, that <note place="margin">The 1.

                  <note place="margin">3.</note>This determination thoughe it should be made now by parlament, or authority of the present Prince, would not ende or take away the roote of the controuersie, for aloeit some that should be passed ouer or put backe in their pretences, would hold their peace per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs for the tyme present, yet afterward would they bothe speake and spurne when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offred.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Agayne the multitude of pretenders being such as it is, &amp; their pretentions so ambiguous,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14519:246"/>
as hath bin declared, it is to be presupposed, that none or few of them vvil presently at the beginning cast away their hope &amp; forgoe their tittles, but wil prooue at least wise what frends will stand vnto them, and how matters are like to go fot or agaynst them, especially seing they may do it without danger, no law being against them, and their rightes and pretenses so manifest, that no man can say they do it of ambition only, or malice, treason, or conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against others, and for this assaye or first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, armes are necessary.</p>
               <p>More-ouer if any man in processe of tyme, would forgoe or giue ouer his title (as it is to <note place="margin">6. A consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to be marked.</note> be imagined that diuers wil at length, and many must, for that one only can speed) yet to the ende he be not suddenly oppressed, or laid handes on at the beginning by his aduersary parte, or made away as in such cases is wont to succeede, it is very likely that each pretender for his owne safety and defence, wil arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his frendes at the beginning, for that better conditions wilbe made with armor in handes, then when a man is naked or in the power of his aduersary, and no doubt, but the more pretenders shal stand together armed, at the beginning the easyer and the surer peace wilbe made with him that shall preuaile, for that they being many with whom he hath to compounde, he will respect them the more, &amp; yeald to more reasonable and honorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14519:246"/>
then if their were but one, &amp; he weake that should resist, for that a fault or displeasure is more easily pardoned to a multitude, &amp; to a potent aduersary, then to one or two alone that are of lesse accompt. And on the other side, the perill of these other pretenders, that should not preuaile, being common to them al, would knyt them better together for their owne defence, in liuing vnder the person that should preuaile and reigne, and he would beare more regard vnto them as hath bin said: and this both for that they should be stronger by this vnion to defend themselues, and he that reigneth should haue lesse cause to suspect &amp; feare them, to worke treason agaynst him, for that they are many, and consequently not so easy to agree betwcene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, who should be preferred, if the other were pulled downe, which to the person regnant, would be also a ground of much securitye.</p>
               <p>These are my reasons and coniectures why it is like that armes wilbe taken at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Ingland, before this controuersie can be decided.</p>
               <p>My second proposition and coniecture is, <note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture no mayn battayle probable.</note> that this matter is not like to come easely to any great or mayne battel, but rather to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at length, by some composition, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agreement, &amp; my reasons for this be these.</p>
               <p>First, for that the pretenders be many, and their powers and frends lying in diuers and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14519:247"/>
different partes of the realme, and if their were but two, then were it more probable, that they would soone come to a battel, but being many each one vvil feare the other, and seke to sortifie himselfe where his owne strength lyeth and especially towardes the portes and sea side, for receauing of succours, as easely may be done, by reason of the multitude of competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors as hath bin said, which vvil cause that at home the one will not much vrge or presse the other, at the beginning, but euery part attend rather to strenghthen it selfe for the tyme.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>A second reason of this is, for that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne Princes and states rounde about vs, are like to be much deuided in this matter, some as pretendents for themselues or their kynred &amp; frends, and others as fauourers of this or that party, for religion, so as their will not vvant presently offers of helpes and succours from abroade, which succours albeit they should be but meane or smalle at the beginning, yet vvill they be of much importance, vvhen the forces at home be deuided, and vvhen their shalbe different portes harbors, and holdes, ready within the lande, to receaue and harbour them, so as I take it to be most likely, that this affuyre vvil grow somevvhat longe and so be ended at lenght by some composition only, and that either by parlament and general consent of al partes pretendentes, and of al three bodyes of religion meeting together by their deputes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14519:247"/>
and treat and conclude some forme of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as vve see it practised now in France, or els by some other meanes of commissaries, commissioners, legates, deputies, or the like, to to make the conclusion vvith euery partye a sunder.</p>
               <p>My third &amp; last coniecture is (&amp; for a meere <note place="margin">The third coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vvho is lykest to preuaile.</note> coniecture only, I vvould haue you to hold it) that seeing there be two sortes of pretenders, which stande for this preferment, the one stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the other Inglish, my opinion is, that of any one forrayne Prince that pretendeth, the Infanta of Spayne is likest to beare it away, or some other by her title, layed vppon hym by her father the kinges good will, and on the other side, of any domestical competitors, the second sonne of the earle of Hartford, or of the issue of the countesse of Darby, carrieth much shew to be preferred.</p>
               <p>My reasons for the former part, about the <note place="margin">For the Infanta of Spayne</note> Lady Infanta, are, that she is a woman, and may easely ioyne (if her father vvill) the titles of Britany and Portugal together, she is also vnmarried, and by her marriage may make some other composition, either at home or abroade, that may facillitate the matter, she is a great Princesse and fit for some great state, and other Princes perhapps of Christendome vvould more vvillingly yeald and concurr to such a composition, of matters by this Lady, and by casting all forraine titles of Britanie and Portugal vppon her, then that the king of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14519:248"/>

               <p>In Ingland also it selfe if any partye or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be affected that way, he vvould thinke heerby to haue the more reason, and if any be against straingers, some such moderation as this would take away much of this auersion, as also of arguments agaynst it: for that heerby it semeth that no subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could be feared to any forrayne realme, but rather diuers vtilities to the realme of Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, as these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de by the reasons before alleaged in the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t chapter.</p>
               <p>I said also, that this Lady Infanta, or some other by her title and her fathers good vvil, was likest of all straingers to beare it away, for that if she should either dye or be married in any other countrye, or otherwise to be disposed of, as her prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Ingland should be disinabled before this affayre came to be tried, then may her said father and she if they list, cast their fore saide interests and titles (as diuers men thinke they would) vppon some other Prince of their owne house and blood, as for example, either vppon some of the families of Parma or Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansa before mentioned, or of the house of Austria, seing theit wanteth not many able &amp; vvorthy Princes of that house, for whom there vvould be the same reasons and considerations, to persuade their admission by the Inglish, that haue bin alleaged before for the Infanta, &amp; the

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>And secondly for that this yonger sonne is vnmarried, for any thing that I do know to the contrary, which may be a pointe of no smalle moment in such an occasion, as hath bin noted diuers tymes before, for ioyning or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefying of tittles by marriage, and for making of compositions of peace and vnion with the opposite parties. <note place="margin">3.</note>And finally for that this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sonne, being yonge, his religion is not yet much talked of, and consequently euery partie may haue hope to draw him to their side, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially he being also free as I haue said to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low what he shal thinke best, or most expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for his owne aduancement, without knott or

               <p>I do name also in this second pointe, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">For the children of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tesse of Darbie 1.</note> of the countesse of Darby first, for that in truth the probabilities of this house be very great, both in respect of their discent, which in effect is holden as it were cleeare from bastardy as before hath bin shewed, and then againe for their neernes in degree, which by the countesse yer liuing is neerer to king Henry the seuenth by one degree, then any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petitor what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
