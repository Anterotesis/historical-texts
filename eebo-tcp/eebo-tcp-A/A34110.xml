            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>Acobus Acontius,</hi> a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man, offended at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill disposition of our scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling age wished that it might be provided, <hi>that none should write and publish any thing, unless it were some new thing; which should both be of his own observation, and might make for the glory of God, and the aedification of the Church, and from whence so much fruit might be hoped, that what time is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the reading of it, the readers could not bestow it better elswhere: that so nothing might be done which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, but what was yet to be done. For few Writers (says hee) bring any 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:3"/> 
thing of their own: but onely steal, things and words, of which they make Books, &amp;c.</hi> Which they know to be most tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoken, who are to peruse that <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago</hi> of Books, wherewith we are year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little less then overwhelmed. For if you look on the titles, you shall have them always new and very specious: if on the thing, it is always the same boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over and over above a thousand times, and Coleworts crammed in, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to nauseating. And though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of new observation be offered, yet to what purpose is it, that whole Books should therefore be written, and those new things found out so buried in things ordinary, that either a man hath no mind to enquire, what of new observation is in them, or cannot do it without tediousness of spirit and loss of time. But it is not my business to inveigh against this disorder in many words. I come now to declare why I my self come out in publick. And I wil 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:3"/> lay it open in a word <hi>I bring something new, and different from the common way of Philosophie: And I bring it so, as that I hope, it will be without any ones hinderance or molestation, as conteining in a very few leaves, matters of very great moment. And I bring it to satisfie the desires of others this way.</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I had the year last past, given a proof of my Philologicall endeavours, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua Linguarum reserata,</hi> (or a seminary of Arts and Languages) which was courteously received, and that with applause, and approved almost by all mens verdict, (as severall letters, dated either to my self or my friends, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matter do testifie,) some (of the number of those, who at this time bend their desires, thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours, to rectifie the method of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) began to solicit mee, to put out my philosophicall Works, or at least to desire a communication of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, especially in Physicks. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:4"/> no other minde therefore, but to bring something for mine owne part that may be profitable, if it may be: or else that others may have occasion by me, to bring better matters; I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with my self to expose to the light, this same <hi>Synopsis of Physicks,</hi> lately dictated in this Schoole, that publick censure might be made of this also, as well as of my former Work. Which that it might be, it seemed meet to give some further intimation of the occasion and scope of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, to those that wil offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be our censors.</p>
            <p>After that the calamitous lot of exile had thrust mee, who was by calling a Divine, back to the services of the School, wherein I was desirous to beare my self, not slightly, but so as that I might discharg the trust committed to me; it chanced that I hapned, among other things, upon <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> his Books, <hi>detradendis disciplinis.</hi> In 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:4"/> these when I had found most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some counsels, for the repairing of Philosophie, and the whole course of studies, I began extreamly to grieve, that a man of so piercing a wit, after he noted so many most evident errours, had not put to his hand to make those rough things smooth, but the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one touching this excellent Writer, <hi>that Vives saw better what was not then what was,</hi> made mee to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it is usuall with the wisdome of God to communicate things by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Yet I thought with my self that others should take this as an occasion to labour to designe one certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible way among so many deviations discovered unto them: which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that men were so backward to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say for full a hundred years. (For I knew not whether any one had gone about it.) But it hapned, that a certain learned man, to whom I communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these complaints of mine in a more 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:5"/> familiar manner, shew'd mee a Book call'd, <hi>Prodromus philosophiae instau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randae</hi> by <hi>Thomas Campanella</hi> an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> which I read over with incredible joy, and being inflamed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great hope of new Light, I greedily turn'd through his <hi>Realis phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophia epilogistica</hi> (for so hee calls it) set forth in foure Books, as also the Books <hi>de rerum sensu,</hi> where ever I could get them. Whereby I found my desires in some sort satisfied, but not throughout. For his very foundation, that all things were made up of two contrary principles onely, offended me (For I was already most fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the number of three principles out of the divine Book of <hi>Genesis:</hi> and and I remember out of <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> disputing against the <hi>Manichees, That of two things fighting one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, destruction might follow, but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate construction could never follow.</hi>) And besides I observed that <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:51776:5"/> himself was not very certaine of his own hypotheses: as one that began to waver in his assertions towards the positions of <hi>Galilaeus</hi> touching the earths mobility, and yet to call them in doubt himself: as it is evident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his Apologie for <hi>Galilaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when I chanced afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a piece of Sir <hi>Francis Bacon Baron of Verulam, Chancellour of England,</hi> entituled <hi>inst aur atio magna</hi> (an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable work, and which I look upon no otherwise, then as a most bright beam of a new age of Philosophers now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising) I understood that in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars also of <hi>Campanella,</hi> such solid Demonstrations, as the truth of things requires, were wanting. Yet it grieved me again, that I saw most noble <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> present us indeed with a true key of Nature, but not open the secrets of Nature, onely shewing us by a few examples, how they were to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and leave the rest to depend on 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:6"/> observations and inductions continued for severall ages. Yet I saw neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that my hopes were not quite left in suspense: in as much as I perceived my minde so enlightned by the light which it received from those severall sparks, now grown welnigh to a torch, that some great secrets of Nature, and very obscure places of Scripture, (the reason of which I knew not before) were now plain, as it were of their own accord, to the exceeding great content of my mind. For now with those, that have lighted upon a more sound way of Philosophie in this age, I saw and rested in it;</p>
            <p>I <hi>That the onely true, genuine and plain way of Philosophie is to fetch all things from sense, reason and Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II <hi>That the Peripatetick philosophie is not onely defective in many parts, and many ways intricate, full of turnings and windings, and partly also erroneous, so that it is not onely unprofitable for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:6"/> but also (without correction and perfection hurtfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III <hi>That philosophie may be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and perfected, by an harmonicall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of all things that are and are made, to sense reason and Scripture, with so much evidence and certainty (in all such things as are of most concernment, and have any necessity) that any mortall man seeing may see, and feeling may feel, the truth scattered every where.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all and every of which observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, least we should seem to have dreamed somewhat, there will be some thing to be said more at large.</p>
            <p>And for the first we make three principles of Philosophy, with <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella,</hi> and his happy Interpreter <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie Adams, Sense, Reason and Scripture:</hi> But so joyntly, that whosoever would not be left in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or doubt, should rest on no one of these without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, otherwise it wil be a most ready precipice into errors. For <hi>Sense,</hi> though 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:7"/> it make an immediate impression upon us of the truth imprinted upon things: yet because it is very often confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either by reason of the multitude of things in a manner infinite, and the strange complications of formes: or else wearied and tired, sometimes with the distance of the objects, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently dazeled and deceived. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> must of necessity be imployed, which may conclude alike of like things, and contrarily of contrary things, by observing their proportion, and so supply the defect of sense, and correct its errours.</p>
            <p>But then because many things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote both from sense and reason (which we cannot in any sort attein unto by sense, nor yet by reason firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough) we are indepted to the grace of God, that he hath <hi>by his Word</hi> revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto us even some secrets which concern us to know. Therefore if any one desire the true knowledg of things, 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:7"/> these three <hi>principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of knowing</hi> must of force be conjoyned. Otherwise, he that will follow the guidance of sense onely, will never be wiser then the common sort; nor be able to imagine the Moon lesse then a starre; the Sun greater then the earth; and that again sphaericall, and every way habitable. On the contrary if a man contemplate on abstract things and consult onely with reason without the testimony of sense, he will be rapt away with meer phantasines, and create himself a new world: like the Platonicall and Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telicall, &amp;c. Lastly, they that heed the Scripture onely, and hearken nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to sense nor reason are either car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away beyond the world (by the sublimity of their conceptions;) or else involve things they understand not with the Colliers faith; or following the letter, propound unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves things, though never so absurd and superstitious, to be believed; as 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:8"/> Papists do in that most absurd tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantion of theirs, &amp;c. So then <hi>the principles of knowing,</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, that divine <hi>Revelation</hi> may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us belief; <hi>Reason,</hi> Understanding, <hi>Sense,</hi> Certainty. And they must be used in this order (in naturall things I say) as that we begin with sense, and end in revelation (as it were the setting to the seal of God:) for by this order every subsequent degree will receive receive from the antecedent, both <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> and also <hi>Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> For as there is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the sense: so there is nothing in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which not first in the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For he that believes, must know what is fit to be believed. Hence the Scripture frequently invites us to hear, see, tast, consider; And affirmes that faith too comes by hearing. I said <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> too. For by how much the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Reason is to sense (that is by how 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:8"/> many the more experiments of the senses it may be demonstrated) it is so much the more reall: and on the contrary again, the further it recedes from sense, by so much the more vain speculation and naked imagination it hath. But by how much the neerer divine Revelation may be reduced to understanding, and the testimonies of experience, so much the more strength it findes.</p>
            <p>I said further, that the precedent degrees were corrected by the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: and so it is. For where sense fails or mistakes, it is supplied and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by reason: And Reason by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. For example, when the sense judgeth the Moon to be bigger then <hi>Saturn,</hi> or an Oare to be broken under the water, &amp;c. Reason rectifies it by certain documents of experience. So when Reason hath gathered any thing falsely of things invisible, it is amended by divine Revelation. Yet that emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:9"/> is not violent, and with the destruction of the precedent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but gentle, so that that very thing which is corrected, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and admits it of its own accord, and with joy, and soon brings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its own, whereby the same cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected truth may become more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. For example, Reason brings nothing to correct sense, whereof it is not soon ascertained by sundry experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and affirmes it self, that so it is, (as that an Oare is not broken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, the Touch teacheth: as also the sight it self, looking on it after it is drawn out.) Faith holds out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which is contrary and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reason, (though it bring that which is beyond and above Reason:) But all things such as Reason not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yields being overcome by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but also finds of a truth to be in things, and so seeks and finds out some thing of its own, which may serve to 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:9"/> confirme and illustrate the same truth. <hi>Therefore let it be taken for true, That Sense is not onely the fountain of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but also of certainty, in naturall things: But that the understanding is the Organ not onely of knowledge, but also of certainty in revealed things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us come then to the purpose. <hi>Some deny, that holy Scripture is to be drawn to Philosophie, because it teacheth not the speculation of outward things, but the way of eternall life, I confess, that the Scripture was given by inspiration of God, to teach, reprove, correct, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I say, that this is the ultimate end of the Scripture. Yet who knows not, that there are for the most part more ends of one thing? even in humane things, much more in divine, where the wisdom of our adored God hath whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound up it self, with an artifice 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:10"/> scarce to be found out of us. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if wee finde that artifice all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nature, (and so it is) that every creature, and part of a creature, and part of a part, serves for severall uses: I see no reason why we should deprive the Book of God of this character of the highest Wisdome. But I see reason why we ought to determine, that most sufficient complements of all things, whereunto Sense and Reason were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient (and yet wee were concerned to know them) are extant in that most holy Book. For did not God bring man into the School of the World, to contemplate his manifold Wisdome? Did not hee command him to behold his invisible things by these things that are seen? (<hi>Rom. 1. v.</hi> 20.) Surely this must be acknowledged to be the end both of making the World and place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man therein. Now it is cleere through all Nature, that, to whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end God hath ordained any thing, 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:10"/> he hath conferred means upon it to be tein it. Hee hath therefore conferred means upon man to contemplate his wondrous things: Which as wee must acknowledge that they are sense and reason, so we must needs acknowledge that they are not every where suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. For our senses leave us in the knowledge of eternall things, and those things which are placed quite out of sight, and done when we are not present. But where Sense fails, Reason fails also: Being that this is nothing but an universall knowledge of things, gathered from particulars acts of sense; that this or that is, or is done, either so or so. When as therefore both Sense and Reason doe very ordinarily fail us, shall we believe, that the most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father of Lights, would not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this defect some other way? His most liberall and in every respect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved bounty towards us, will not permit us to suspect that. But if God 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:11"/> have some way or other provided for us, let it be shewen what it is, or where it is to be sought for, if not in that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred volume of Oracles? And I pray, was it in vain, or onely in respect of our eternall salvation, that God said of his Law. <hi>This is your wisdome and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the sight of the Nations, which shall heare all these statutes and say. Surely this is a wise and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people. (Deut. 4. 6.) Or did David boast in vain? I have more under standing then all my teachers; because thy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are my meditations (Psal. 119. 99.)</hi> Or the sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> say in vain: <hi>The Word of God most High is the fountain of wisdom? (Eccles.</hi> 1. 5. Or was it in vain that <hi>Salomon</hi> call'd God, <hi>the guide unto wisdome, and the corrector of the wise? Wisd.</hi> 7. 15.) see here a correctour! But how doth he correct, but by dashing over our vain cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his word? And to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I pray is all that is frequently me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:11"/> concerning the beginning of the World and the order of the Creation, and properties of the creatures, If the parent of nature, who is also the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatour of the Scriptures, meant to teach us nothing of nature? <hi>They say it is to this end, that we may learn to know and admire, love and fear the Maker of all things.</hi> Right: But how the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker without his work? Does not any one so much the more admire and praise the ingenuity of the Painter, if he be excellent, by how much the better he understands the art of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Surely yes. A superficiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will never raise either love or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. And then I demand, those things, which wee meet with in the Scriptures concerning the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (by similitudes also drawn thence) are they true or false? If true (for who can determine otherwise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blasphemie) why may we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them with those things that are 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:12"/> manifest by sense &amp; reason? that so we may finde out that harmony of truth, which is in things, and in the mouth of the Author of things? <hi>Truly, if the words of the wise are as goades and nails fastened:</hi> (as <hi>Salomon</hi> testifies, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 11.) What shall we think of the words of the all-wise God? But this, that though they raise us up with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and by the by, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein nothing but most solid truth and all manner of-wisedome. In vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may some one say: <hi>I finde no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Scriptures, much less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Grammar, Logicke, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Physicks,</hi> &amp;c. For there is as much distance betwixt divine writings and humane, as betwixt God himself and man. Man that is limited with time, place and objects, at one time and in one place can do but one thing: but God that is aeternall, omnipresent, and omniscient, at once sees, rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things, always and every 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:12"/> where. And the same Character do their writings retein on either part. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane writings do some one thing with expresse endeavour, handling one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in one place, and that in such a way as is most pleasing to mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: but divine writings like an universal treasury of wisdome stay not upon one particular matter, (unlesse it be in things pertaining to Theologie) but contein variety of matter under severall sayings. Whence a Divine, a Moralist, a Politician, a Houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a Philosopher, a Philologer, &amp;c. may take out every of them, what each hath use of. And this breadth &amp; depth of the Scripture is its prerogative before humane writings, that so it may be in truth an inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fountain of all wisdome. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever matter is to be handled, the Scripture affords always, either a rule, or some sayings or examples: as <hi>John Henrie Alsted</hi> (sometimes my honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:13"/> Master) shews in his <hi>Triumphus Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus,</hi> and much more might be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by a very accurate diligence: which that so it is, for a good part of it, shall appear also in these our Physicall meditations. Rightly therefore said <hi>Cassiodorus: the Scripture is an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly school, wherein we learn whatsoever we are either to learn or to be ignorant of.</hi> And piously <hi>T. Lydiat: It is most absurd, that heathen Philosophers should seek for the principles of all arts in one</hi> Homers <hi>posie, and that we Christians should not do the same in the Oracles of God, which are a most plentifull and most clear foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of wisdome.</hi> (About the end of his Physiological disquisition.) Those most Christian Philosophers are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deservedly to be praised, who have endeavoured to render unto God the Parent of things that praise that is due unto him, <hi>Franc. Valesius, Lambert Danaeus, Levinus Lemnius, Thomas Lydiat, Conradus As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:51776:13"/> who have not doubted to asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that the seeds of true Philosophy are conteined in the holy Book of the Bible, and to derive their maximes of Philosophy from thence (though with different successe.)</p>
            <p>Let it stand therefore, that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy is lame without divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whence wee have this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>that Aristotle is not to be tolerated in Christian schools, as the onely Master of Philosophie: But that we should be free Philosophers, to follow that which our senses, Reason, and Scripture dictate.</hi> For what? Are not we placed as wel as they in Natures garden? Why then do we not cast about our eyes, nosthrils and ears as well as they? Why should we learn the works of nature of any other Master, rather then of these? Why do we not, I say, turn over the living book of the world instead of dead pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers? wherein we may contemplate more things, and with greater delight 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:14"/> and profit then any one can tell us. If we have any where need of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretour the maker of nature, as we have said, is the best Interpretour of himself. If a Monitour or Suggestour, we have more and better then <hi>Aristotle,</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (of the various and occult Maean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of nature) being multiplyed in the processe of so many ages. For as all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things get up to perfection from rude beginnings, so Philosophy hath had its grouths too. In <hi>Aristotles</hi> age it was scarce out of its infancy: In the ages that followed after, (especially in ours) it was so increased stil with new observations, that the Aristotelick tenets savour of obscurity &amp; uncertainty in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of these, nay, they hold out open falsities. <hi>Be it then</hi> (writes <hi>Rod. Goclenius</hi> to <hi>Nic. Taurellus) that nature hath shewed all the acutenesse of humane ingenuity in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle; <hi>let</hi> Aristotle <hi>be a man that hath deserved well of all humane wisdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and above all other mortall men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:14"/> let him be the Father and Captain of our wisdome; let him be the supream Dictatour of wisdome, the Generalissimo of Philosophers, the eagle of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall Kingdome, wisdome and praise of literature; let him be the Hercules, the Prince, the Tribunall of truth; let him be the deity of Philosophers; let him be lastly a man greater then all praise, and above all calumny;</hi> which titles <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> sets him out with: <hi>yet this miracle of Nature is not the RULE OF TRUTH, seeing that hee hath not every where traced Truths footsteps.</hi> Thus <hi>Goclenius.</hi> Now hee that will may see <hi>Campanella</hi> and <hi>Verulamius,</hi> (for it may suffice, to have shewed these Hercules, who have happily put to their hands to the subduing of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and cleansing <hi>Augias</hi> stables; and to have opposed them to those, whom the authority of <hi>Aristotles</hi> vainly swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Philosophy holds bewitched:) and feel how farre <hi>Aristotles</hi> assertions are 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:15"/> often from the truth, and this is the cause why it seems convenient, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> with all his heathenish train should be excluded from the sacred Philosophy of Christians; least they should any more entangle the truth in errours, and involve and obscure those things with intricate disputations, which are of themselves plain by the lamp of the Word of God, and of sound reason. For is it not very absurd, that Christians, who are trained up in the true knowledge of the true God, and taught by his holy voice, concerning the originall causes, end, and manne of subsistence of all things visible and invisible; to whom also the very my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of aeternity are revealed; whom the anointing of God teacheth al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:51776:15"/> and have no other helps, but those of reason, and of the senses, which are common to us with them? Is it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that there is not a God in <hi>Israel,</hi> that we go to enquire of the gods of <hi>Ekron?</hi> Is the light of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> so put out, that we must needs borrow lamps at <hi>Athens?</hi> It is well known that <hi>Origen</hi> was the man that first of all joyned heathen Philosophy with Christian Religion: with no ill intent perhaps, but sure it is with very bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. The good mans purpose without doubt was to put some externall splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour upon Christian Religion, as then contemned by reason of its simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that so Christians might be well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to buckle with the Gentile Philosophers at their own weapons. <hi>But whither or no came this perswasion from him, that hath called us out of darknesse into his marvellous light, and commanded us to beware of vain Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy after the tradition of men, after the 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:16"/> rudiments of the World, and not after Christ. (Gal. 5. 8. 1 Pet, 2. 9. Colos. 2. 8.)</hi> And indeed the most sad estate of the Church a little after shews what fruit we had in coupling <hi>Aristotle</hi> what Christ; when all was ful of the noise of disputations, (for slippery quaestions, and an itching desire of controversie is the very soul of Peripateticisme) and haeresie sprung out of haeresie, till at length the fumes of humane opinions had so quite darkned the brightnesse of the divine wisdom, that all things dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into Antichristianisme. Where in forging articles of faith, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rules of life, <hi>Aristotle</hi> had an ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall share with Christ, that I may not say he had the sole dictatourship: of which thing our School divinity will give us a very cleer sight. If <hi>Origen</hi> then a man of so sublime a wit, in vain attempted to piece out Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with that same heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:16"/> and <hi>Thomas Scotus</hi> nor no man else had any better successe, why then do we tolerate it? Why do we not slip our wits out of those snares? why do we not throw away those spectacles which present us with fancies instead of things?</p>
            <p>Some are afraid, least, if they should let go Peripatetick Philosophy, they should have none at all. As if when <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> were cast out, there would have been none to bless <hi>Abraham</hi> with issue! Or that the <hi>Israelites</hi> would have been sterved with hunger, when they. had left the Aegyptian flesh pots; or that <hi>Moses</hi> must needs have grown block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, when he was out of the company of the wise men of <hi>Memphis!</hi> Nay rather, that promised Grace will come at length, at length that heavenly <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> will rain down, at length we shall be truly <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> taught of God, when turning away our ears from humane O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, we shall hearken to God alone 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:17"/> speaking by Nature, and by his Word. And then how solid, easie, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full will all things be! when as the whole course of Philosophy will not consist in opinions but in truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But greater care was to be had of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod:</hi> that all things should be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the learners in such a way, that they may finde knowledge to flow into them, not to be stuft in; always begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with those things that are best known, and ending in things no lesse known then they. For why should we think that impossible in Physicks, which is so excellently atchieved in <hi>Mathematicks?</hi> whereall Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>(N. W.)</hi> are brought to the very sight: and all is so contrived together of things that go before and are better known (always beginning with such common things that it is taedious to the unskilfull to heare them) in such an order, as that which is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest is never skipt over, nor place, given to that which is more unknown, 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:17"/> whence it comes to passe, that you must of necessity assent as well to that which is last, as to that which is first. And truly there is reason to wonder why the like hath not been yet assayed in Metaphysicks, Physicks, and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, (for Ethicks and Politicks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern more contingent things.) I am not ignorant that there is more evidence in Numbers, Measures and Weights, then in Qualities, by which Nature puts forth its strength after a hidden manner: yet I will not say that there is greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in them, seeing that all things are done alike not without highest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in a continued order, and as it were by an aeternall law. And yet in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks all things are not alike plain, yet they are assayed sundry wayes till they can be reduced to <gap reason="foreign">

For in a free Common-wealth there ought to be no <hi>Kings,</hi> but <hi>Dukes or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls;</hi> no <hi>Dictators,</hi> but <hi>Consuls.</hi> And those that profess the art of instructing men, are the Fathers of men, not the carvers of Statues. O when shall we see that day! that all things which ought to be known shall offer themselves so to 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:18"/> a mans understanding, that there wil be nothing but what may be understood for the very cleerness of it, nothing call'd in doubt for certainty: the truth of things making such an impression upon the senses with its light. For hee doth not see truly, who must yet be perswaded by arguments to make him believe that hee sees: as wee have been hither to dealt with for the best part.</p>
            <p>I could not choose, because I seemed to see light in the light of God, but assay calling God to my aid, to reduce these new hypotheses of naturall things into a new method, and dictate them to the schollers of this school. And thence sprang this, which I now offer, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting a draught of the lineaments of some new, (and as I hope truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) Philosophie. Not that I would crosse the design of great <hi>Verulam</hi> (who thought it the best way to abstein from Axiomes and method, till full inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could be made, of all and every 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:19"/> thing throughout all nature:) but to make an experiment in the mean time, whether more light might be let into our minds by this means to observe the secrets of nature the more easily, that so <hi>praise might be perfected to God out of the very mouth of infants, and confusion prepared for the gain saying enemie;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> having comprised the summe of Physicks in a short hymne for the use of the unlearned) speaks. <hi>(Psal. 8.)</hi> I have entituled it a <hi>Synopsis of Physicks reformed by divine light:</hi> because Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy is here guided by the lamp of divine Scripture, and all our assertions are brought to the attestation of the senses and reason, with as much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as could be possible. Now both those come under the name of divine light. For as <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>THY WORD is ALANTHORNE unto my feet:</hi> so said <hi>Salomon THE SPIRIT or mind OF A MAN is THE CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DLE of the Lord searching all things.

               <hi>If any one object:</hi> That these things here delivered, are not yet of that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or evidence, as to be preferred before <hi>Aristotles</hi> so long received do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; <hi>I will answer,</hi> that is not my drift at present: but onely I propound this as an example, that a truer way of Philosophie may be set out, <hi>by the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of God, the Light of Reason, and the Testimonie of Sense,</hi> if Philosophers would labour more after God and the Truth, then after <hi>Aristotle</hi> and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>I confesse my self, that something more were to be desired here yet, to that rule of certainty and evidence which I spake of before: yet because I trust that these things may be brought to a fuller <gap reason="foreign">

Every of which in particular though I dare not defend tooth and nail, for some things perhaps are still the reliques of common tradition: and others it may be, not yet sufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished upon the foundations w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have laid down) yet I am perswaded that they are the groundworks of unmoved truth, and avail much to the more exact observation of particular things. And that I may speak in a word, I hope there 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:21"/> is so much light in this method of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks here delivered, that very little place is left to doubts and disputations: so that it makes something towards the taking away the controversies of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, the opinions of all (whatsoever of truth either <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath; or <hi>Galen,</hi> the <hi>Chymicks, Campanella</hi> and <hi>Verula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> do reasonably alledge against him) being reduced to an harmony; which may be made plain by the example of the principles of which they make bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to consist, (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have to be <hi>the four Elements;</hi> the <hi>Syagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks Salt, Sulfur and</hi> ☿. Nay more, that by this means a gate is opened in a new kinde of way, not onely to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Arts and humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but also to multiply them: which could never be, unless the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of truth were found. Perhaps I speak more, then the Reader will think he finds in my Writings. But if he saw but the streams (the delineation of 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:21"/> that <hi>Pansophia Christiana,</hi> which wee have in hand) that are derived, from this fountain, as also from that of our Didacticks and Metaphysicks, hee would not hold it vainly spoken. But because those are not yet brought to light, I set down this as a law for these that are: <hi>If any thing be not sufficiently deduced from Sense, Reason, and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; If any thing cohere not harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously enough with the rest; If any thing be not evident enough with its own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, let it be taken as not said at all.</hi> Which law standing in force it may be lawful for my self &amp; all others, both to doubt always, and every where whether every thing be so as it is delivered to be: and also to enquire why it is, as it is found to be; by which two courses, that the lowest foundations of truth, will in time be discovered no body needs to doubt.</p>
            <p>Therefore let none of vs seeke after any thing else, but how the truth 
<pb facs="tcp:51776:22"/> may best be maintained on all hands which if it happen not to be on our side, and that we are deceived with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of truth, (as it is very usuall in humane affaires,) I beseech all those that are more sharp-sighted, for the love of truth courteously to shew us our way, which we have lost, and where our demonstrations come not together. But if these savour of truth something neer, that then they would not disdain to joyn their endevours with ours for the illustration thereof: that all of us being the children of truth may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and sing Hymnes of prayse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God the Father of Truth. Thou therefore</p>
            <l>O Christ the Fathers glory bright,</l>
            <l>Of this great World the onely light;</l>
            <l>On us some beams of light bestow,</l>

            <head type="sub">Touching the nature, foundation and use of Physick.</head>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I Physick is the Scientiall Knowledge of naturall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II That thing is naturall, which is by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not by Art</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or whatsoever this visible World hath, comes all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Nature or from Art those things are from Nature which God brought forth in the beginning, or w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are to this very time begotten: by a virtue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in things, as, the Heavens, the Earth, the Sea, Rivers, Mountains, Stones, Metals, Hearbs, living Creatures, &amp;c. those things are from art which men have shaped, by putting a new form upon natural things; as, Cities, Houses, Ponds, Channels, Statues, Coines, Garments, Books, &amp;c. that is by the work of mans ingenuity and hands. Physicks have nothing to do with these things; these are put over to the arts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51776:25"/> Now seeing that nature is before art: ye that art imitates nothing but nature, for as much as it doth nothing but by the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: it necessarily follows, that nature is to be laid for a foundation to arts, and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must first be knowne by those that are studious of arts, what things, and by what vertue it operates every where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when this is known, the secrets of all arts open of their own accord, without this in arts and prudentials all wil be blinde, dumbe, and maimed: therefore Physick is so necessary to be premised before the Mathematical, and Logical, and also the prudentiall Arts, that they who do otherwise, may be thought to build castles in the air.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III The nature of things is, the law of being born and of dying, of operating and of ceasing, which God the Workmaster hath laid upon all things that are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all things are born and die: all things operate somewhat, and all things cease a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: in an order and manner proper to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which order and manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is with most excellent reason, could not be disposed, but by the supream wisdome, inasmuch as it is found constantly to be imposed by way of a law upon things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51776:25"/> now it took the name of nature from the first degree of mutation of every thing, which is, to be borne.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV The knowledge of nature is to be obtein'd by searching into Nature it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By searching</hi> I say. For no one should spend his time in Physicks, to that end, that he might have his mind taken up with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conceits; but that he may put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward himself to the through and intimate knowledg of things, otherwise the intellect will not be illustrated with the nature of things, but obumbrated with the speculation of phantasms in naturall things, therefore we are to seek for guides who may make us scholers, not of themselves, but of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and exhibite unto us not their own fond reasons, but nature.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V To search Nature, is to contemplate, how, and wherefore, every thing in nature is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To contemplate I say. For as we do not see the Sun, but by looking on the Sun: so we do not learn nature, but by looking into nature; which is that the Scripture counsels us. <hi>Ask the beasts, and they shall teach thee, and the fouls of the aire, and they shall tell thee, or talk with the earth, and it shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51776:26"/> 
thee, and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. (Job</hi> 12. 7.) therefore the learners of naturall Philosophy, cannot be more happily and easily instructed, then if they be taught by ocular demonstration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is to be had: <hi>I say to contemplate every thing,</hi> that so we may sift out the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and causes of all things every where. For it is certain that nature doth nothing in vain, even in things of least moment, yea sometimes in the very least things much wisdome lies stored up. And which is more, we cannot attain to the knowledg of great things, but by the knowledg of lesser things, which the following Aphorisme will teach us.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI Nature unfolds her self in the least things, and wraps up her self in the greatest things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, in the more excellent creatures many things are wound up and woven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with such an occult artifice, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beginning nor the endings of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and accidents can easily be discerned, but in all courser creatures, all things are clearly manifest, which is the cause why the nature of compounds cannot be knowne, unlesse the nature of simples 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51776:26"/> be first known: so consequently we are to begin with these speculations, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by degrees from simpler things to the more compound: which very order we shall see that the Creator himself observed, in producing and twisting together the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>VII Wee are to studie naturall Phylosophie by the guide of sense, and light of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For sense is the beginning not onely of knowledge, but of certainty and wisdome; for as there is nothing in the intellect which was not first in the sense, so if there be any thing obscurely or doubtfully in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, we are to have recourse to the sense for evidence and certainty. but wheresoever sense or reason faileth, (as in things remote either in place or time) we are indebted to the grace of God, that he hath deigned to reveale many things unto us exceeding sense and reason. For example, the first produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the world, and the constitution of things invisible.</p>
            <p>He that neglecteth either of these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is easily intangled in errours: for by how much the more of imagination any thing hath, by so much the more vanitie it 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51776:27"/>
hath, and is the more remote from the truth: again, by how much the lesse any thing participates of revealed wisdome, by so much the lesse it partakes of the truth. and such for the most part is the Philosophy of the Gentiles, and therefore vain and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, we will follow the guidance of <hi>Moses,</hi> (who described the generation of the world by the command of God:) yet always heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observing the attestation of the senses, and of reason. For wisely doth <hi>Lud. Vives</hi> (as we have set down under the title of this book) recall Christians from the lamp of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which yeilds an obscure and maligne light, to that torch of the Sun, which Christ the light of the World brought into the world, attributing much wit indeed, but little profit to the inventions of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> nay further <hi>Campanella</hi> and <hi>Verulamius</hi> most Christian Philosophers (that are acquainted with that way of Philosophy from sense and Scripture) have demonstrated, that all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi> doctrines are nothing but a nurserie of disputations, (that is, of obscurities, haesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies, contradictions, strifes, and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) and fighting hood-winckt, and that they hinder rather then advance our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of things, and withall have afforded 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51776:27"/> us a light, whereat we may kindle more clear torches of inquiring out the truth. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvhose footsteps (yet laying strong foundations from the Scripture) vve vvill dresse out a little Theatre of nature, not for disputation, but for speculation; and vve vvill go through nature silently, yet not vvithout our eyes, and that again according to the counsel of great <hi>Vives: Here is no need of disputations,</hi> (saith he) <hi>but of a silent contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of nature: the Scholars shal enquire and ask rather then contend: If any be more slow they wil need more ful commonstration not disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and a little after, <hi>again I say, here is no need of wrangling but of looking on, so this study wil be the delight of the rich, and a refreshing of the mind to those that deal either in publike or in private affairs: for when shal we easily find any other delight of the senses, to be compared with this, either in the greatness or in the variety, or in the continuance of it; for when we bestow our labour upon this contemplation, wee need not seek for any other recreation, nor desire sawce for this meat, the walk it self, and the quiet contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is both a School and a Master, as that which always affords something, which thou mayest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, wherein thou mayest delight, which may increase thy knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51776:28"/> Therefore let us resolve upon this, vve that vievv naturall things, to rest upon no other authority besides that of the Work-master of nature, and of nature her self (as she holds forth her self to be touched and felt) the Scriptures, sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shal be our Guides, Wìtnesses and Dictators, to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of vvhich he that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents not, shevvs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very foolish and vain.</p>

               <p>THE eternall Deitie, our God that is to be adored, after the infinite glories which hee enjoyes in his immense eternity, was of his exceeding <hi>goodnesse</hi> propense to communicate himselfe out of himself; and by his exceeding <hi>Wisdome</hi> saw that his invisible things might be expressed by certain visible images; and to execute that, had his <hi>Omnipotencie</hi> at hand, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed not to envie entitie to those things, wherein he might be expressed, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his <hi>Power, Wisdome and Goodness</hi> might be revealed: therefore he produced intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creatures, by whom he might be known &amp; praised <hi>Angels and men:</hi> both after his own image: but the first pure minds, the other clothed with bodies for whom he built a dwelling place, and as it were a school of wisdome, this universall World with other creatures of inferiour degree almost infinite: all and every of which, cry out after their manner, <hi>hee made us, and not wee our selves.</hi> Now then we go about to unfold in what 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51776:29"/> order so great a work proceeded, and with what art all things were contrived, and with what strength they are held together, yet by his guiding who alone is able to testifie of himself and of his works; for thus, says he, by his Secretary <hi>Moses. Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>In the beginning God created the heaven, (v.</hi> 1.) That is, the heaven of heavens with the Angels: whom as morning stars first produced, he made spectatours of the rest of his works. (<hi>Joh. 38. v.</hi> 7.)</p>

               <p n="6">VI <hi>And God saw the light that it was good, ver.</hi> 4) that is, he saw that all things would now proceed in order. for that light being produced in a great masse, began presently to display its threefold virtue (of illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, moving it selfe, and heating,) and by turning about the World, to heat and rarifie the matter, and so to divide it. for hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed first of all from the brightnesse of that light the difference of nights and days.</p>
               <p n="7">VII <hi>He divided the light from darkness, and 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51776:30"/> 
called the light day, and the darknesse he called night, and the evening and morning were the first day, ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second effect of light was from heat, namely, that which way soever it pass'd, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and purified the matter, but it conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it on both sides, upward and downward. whence came the division of the Elements, this <hi>Moses</hi> expresses in these words.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII <hi>And God said, let there be a Firmament, that it may divide betwixt the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God said, that is, he ordained how it should be. let there be a Firmament, that is, let that light stretch forth the matter, and let the thicker part of the matter melting and flying from the light thereof, make waters on this side and on that. above, as they are the term of the visible World; but below, as they are a matter apt to produce other creatures, under which the earth as thick dregs came together. that was done the second day.</p>
               <p n="11">XI <hi>Therefore God said, let the waters be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together under heaven into one place, and let the dry land appear. and it was so; and God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the dry land, earth, and the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51776:31"/>
called stars) he placed here and there in the Firmament higher and lower, with an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall motion, to distinguish the times, and this <hi>Moses</hi> describes <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, &amp;c. thus.</p>

Lastly, that all things are from God, and for God, flow out from him, and reflow to him. But that all these things might continue in their essence, as they were disposed by the wisdome of God, he put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every thing a virtue, which they call <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to conserve themselves, in their effence, yea, &amp; to multiply, whence the continuation of the creatures unto this very day, and this <hi>Moses</hi> intimated, adding touching ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>

               <p>Therefore the veins of the strength, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and order of this nature must be more throughly searched; that those things which we have here in few words hinted out of <hi>Moses,</hi> may be more illustrated by the constant test<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An Appendix to the first Chapter.</p>
               <p>We have said that it may be gathered out 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51776:33"/> 
of those words of <hi>Moses. In the beginning God created the heaven:</hi> that <hi>the invisible World</hi> was the beginning of the works of God, that is the heaven of heavens with the Angels. Now that by this heaven is to be understood the heaven of heavens, and the Invisible, or Angelicall World appeares plain.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Out of Scripture,</hi> which 1 mentions the heaven of heavens every where; but their production no where, unlesse it be here. 2 <hi>Moses</hi> testifies that the invisible heavens were stretched out the second day, and the fourth day adorned with starres, therefore another heaven must necessarily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in this place; namely a heaven that was finished in the same moment, for that the particle <hi>autem</hi> inferres, hee created the heavens and the earth; <hi>terra autem,</hi> but the earth was without form, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">III This <hi>reason evinces the same,</hi> those things which are made by God are made in order, now an orderly processe in operation, is this, that a progresse be made from more simple things, to compound things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the most compound creature man was last produced; so the most simple and immateriall creatures, <hi>(Heaven and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels)</hi> first of all.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51776:33"/> III <hi>And what would we have more?</hi> God himself testifies expresly; that when he made the earth, the Angels stood by him as spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, for so saith he to <hi>Job; Where wast thou when I founded the earth, when the morning starres sang together, and all the sonnes of God shouted.</hi> (<hi>Job.</hi> 38. 4, 7.) calling the Angels morning starres, because they were a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall beam, and that newly risen: sonnes of God, because they were made after the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God. therefore when we hear, that the earth was founded the first day, it must needs be that the Angels were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the earth: And if the Angels, then certainly the dwellings of the Angels, the heaven of heavens; and that in full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, with all their hosts, as it were in one moment, aud this is the cause why <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> speaks no more of that heaven, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to the forming of the earth, that is the visible World: (how the Creator took unto himself six dayes to digest it) as we will also now descend.</p>

               <head>Of the visible Principles of the World, matter, spirit and light.</head>
               <p>WE have seene, God shewing us, how the World arose out of the Abysse of nihilitie; let us now see how it standeth, that so by seeing we may learn to see, and by feeling to feel, the very truth of things.</p>
               <p>And here are three principles of visible things held out unto us, matter, spirit, and light, that they were produced the first day, as three great but rude Masses, and out of those variously wrought, came forth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds of creatures, <hi>therefore we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further, whether these three principles of all bodies, have a true being, and be yet existent.</hi> least any errour be perhaps committed at the very entrance, by any negligence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, but now seeing that no more doubts of <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> this onely comes to <hi>be prooved, that by that spirit which hovered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the waters, a certain universall spirit of the world, is to be understood,</hi> which puts life and vigour into all things created, 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51776:34"/> 
for the newnesse of this opinion in physicks, and the interpretation of that place by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines with one consent of <hi>the person of the holy spirit,</hi> give occasion of doubting. But <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ostome,</hi> (as <hi>Aslacus</hi> cites him) and <hi>Danaeus</hi> acknowledgeth, that in this place a created spirit, which is as it were the soul of the world, is more rightly to be understood; and it is proved strongly.</p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>By Scripture,</hi> which testifieth that a certain vertue was infused by God through the whole world, susteining and quickening all things, and operating all things in all things; which he calleth both a <hi>spirit</hi> and a <hi>soul,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>spirit of God,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>spirit of the creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For example (<hi>Psal. 104. v.</hi> 29. 30.) <hi>David</hi> saith thus; <hi>when thou receivest their spirit,</hi> (that is the spirit of living creatures, and of plants) <hi>they die, and return to their dust: but when thou sendest forth thy spirit</hi> (that is the Spirit of God,) <hi>again, they are recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the face of the earth is renewed,</hi> but <hi>Job</hi> (27. 3.) says thus; <hi>as long as my soul shall be in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils;</hi> see the soul of man, and the spirit of God are put for the same! which place compared with the saying of <hi>Elihu, the spirit of God hath 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51776:35"/> 
made me, and the breath of the Omnipotent hath put life into me. (c. 33. v.</hi> 4.) opens the true meaning of <hi>Moses;</hi> namely that the <hi>spirit</hi> of God stirring upon the waters, produced the <hi>spirit</hi> or <hi>soul of the world,</hi> which puts life into all living things. Now that this is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through all things, appears out of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel:</hi> where God promising the spirit of life unto the dry bones, (<hi>Ezech. 17. v.</hi> 5, 14.) which he cals <hi>his</hi> Spirit, bids it to come from the four Winds (<hi>v.</hi> 9) therefore <hi>Augustine, (lib. imperf. sup. Gen. ad lit.)</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> (in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xamero</hi>) call this spirit, <hi>the soule of the world.</hi> And <hi>Aristotle</hi> (as <hi>Sennertus</hi> testifies) says that the spirit of life is a <hi>living and genitall essence diffused through all things</hi> but the testimony of <hi>Elihu,</hi> is most observable, who speaks thus. <hi>Who hath placed the whole World? If he</hi> (namely God) <hi>should set his heart upon it, and should gather unto himself the spirit thereof, and the breath thereof</hi> (or: his spirit and his breath: For the Hebrew affix is rendred both ways) <hi>all flesh would die together, and man would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto dust. Job 34. v.</hi> 13, 14. So, if God should take his spirit out of the World, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry living thing would die.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>By reason and sense,</hi> it is certainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that herbs and animals spring out of a humide matter, even without seed. But 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51776:35"/> 
whence had these life, I pray you, but from that diffused soul of the World? wee finde by experience, that bread, wine and water, yea aire, are vitall to those that feed upon them, but whence have they that vital force, I pray you, if not from this diffused soule? but now if a certaine spirit be diffused in that manner through all things, it follows necessarily, that it was created in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its whole masse, even as the matter &amp; the light were first produced, in that its great and undigested masse: so that there was no need that any thing should be created after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but be compounded of those three, and distinguished with forms. which God intimated, in <hi>Esay 42. v.</hi> 5. where declaring himself the Creator of all things, he divides them into three parts, namely, <hi>into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> (that is light <hi>the earth,</hi> (that is matter) <hi>and a quickning spirit,</hi> and just so in <hi>Zachary</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 1. let us therefore hereafter beware so great an absurdity, (that I may not say blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy) as to put the person of the Holy Ghost amongst the creatures.</p>
               <p>Now there may three reasons of this thing be given, why <hi>Moses</hi> called that quickning spirit, produced in the beginning, the Spirit of God. Namely, that it is taken in that sense, wherein els-where it is spoken of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51776:36"/> 
                  <hi>mountains of God, (Psal. 36. v. 7.) and trees of God (Psal. 104. v. 16.)</hi> and <hi>Ninive</hi> was called <hi>a citie of God:</hi> that is, by reason of their greatness and dignity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because it was produced immediatly by God; not as now it is, when that spirit passeth from one subject to another.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Because it was a peculiar act of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Analogie of our Faith teacheth us to believe, that the production of the matter out of nothing, is a work of Gods Omnipotencie, and is attributed to the Father; that the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of light</hi> (by which the World received splendour and order) <hi>is a work of wisdome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Son, (John 1. v. 3, 4.) and lastly, that the virtue infused into the creatures is a work of his goodnesse, which is attributed to the Holy Ghost. (Psal. 143. v</hi> 10.) and so must that place (<hi>Psal. 33. v. 9 &amp;</hi> 6.) be altogether understood, (for it will not bear any other sense) <hi>he spake and they were made; he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they came forth: the heavens were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the Word of God, and all the virtue of them by the spirit of his mouth</hi> Also wee must note, (<hi>Gen. 1. v.</hi> 1, 2, 3.) that three words are added to the three principles, <hi>he created, he said, and he moved himself;</hi> that they may be 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51776:36"/> 
signs of his absolute <hi>Power, of his Word, and of his spirit.</hi> Also we must note this, that in both those places the Holy Ghost with his work is placed in the midst; (as also in <hi>Esay</hi> 40. <hi>v.</hi> 13.) because he is the spirit, the love, and the mutuall bond of both, but this we speak after the manner of men</p>
               <p>Let it stand therefore for certain, that all the principles were created the first day, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in its masse; and that all things were afterwards composed out of them, which may be declared to children (for their more full understanding) by a similitude thus: an Apothecary or Confectioner being to make odoriferous Balls, takes Sugar in stead of matter; Rose-water, or Syrrup, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sweet liquour for tincture or conditure; last of all taking some of this lumpe thus made, hee imprints certain shapes upon his work. So also God first prepared his <hi>matter:</hi> then tempered it with <hi>a living spirit;</hi> then <hi>brought light into it,</hi> which by its heat and motion might mix and temper both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and bring it to certain forms. also even as a Mechanick must have matter, and two hands to work withall; the one hand, to hold; and the other to work with: so in the framing of the world, there was need, 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51776:37"/> 
first of matter, then of a spirit to frame the matter, and lastly of light, or heat to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actuate the matter under the hand of the spirit. and what need many words? we see in every stone, hearb, and living creature: first a certain quantity of matter; secondly, a certain inward virtue, whereby it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, it groweth, it spreads abroad its sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and its odour and its healing virtue; thirdly, a form or a certain disposition of parts with divers changes, which come from the heat working within.

               </p>
               <p>For what means that description of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> else? when he calls it <hi>earth, waters, the deep, darkness, a thing void, and without form?</hi> and it appears also by reason. for seeing that the lesser bodies of the World, Clouds, Water, Stones, Metals, and all things growing on the earth are made of vapours coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated (as shall appeare most evidently hereafter:) why not the whole World also? certainly the matter of the whole can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that which is found to be the matter of the parts.</p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>The first matter of the World, was a Chaos of dispersed Atomes, cohering in no part thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is proved 1 <hi>by reason,</hi> for if they had cohered in any sort, they had had form: but they had not; for it was <hi>Tohu vabohu,</hi> a thing without form and void. 2 <hi>by sense,</hi> which satisfies, that the Elements are turned unto 
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51776:38"/> 
Atomes. for what is dust, but earth reduced into Atomes? what is vapour, but water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into more subtile parts? the air it self, what is it but a most small comminution of drops of water, and unperceiveable by sense? yea, all bodies are found to consist of most extream small parts, as trees, barke, flesh, skins, and membranes, of most slender strings or threds; but bones, stones, metals, of smal dust made up together, into which they may be resolved again. And this shews also, that those threds or haires, are of Atomes, as it were glued together, that when they are dried they may be pouldred. wherefore the whole World is nothing but dust, coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with various glutinous matters into such or such a form. 3 <hi>by Scripture</hi> for the ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Wisdom it self testifies, that <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World was dust. (Prov. 8. v. 26.)</hi> out of which foundation many places of Scripture wil be better understood: (as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 14.) <hi>dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</hi> For, behold, man was made of the mud of the earth! yet God being angry for sin, threatens something more, then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dust, namely utmost resolution, into the very utmost dust, of which the mud of the earth it self was made: and wee see it to 
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51776:39"/> 
be truly so, that a man is dissolved not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into earth, but into all the elements, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those that perish by fire) and is at last scattered into very Atomes. Read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, what is said <hi>(Job 4. v. 19.) Item 19. v. 9. Esay 26. v. 19. Psal. 104. v. 29.)</hi> therefore, <hi>Democritus</hi> erred not altogether, in making Atomes the matter of the World: but hee erred in that hee believed, 1 that they were aeternall, 2 that they went together into forms by adventure, 3 that they cohere of themselves: by reason that he was ignorant of that which the Wisdom of God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us, that the Atomes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinated into a mass, by the infusion of the Spirit of life, and began to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed into forms, by the comming in of the light.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>God produced so great a mass of this matter, as might sussice to fill the created A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bysse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For with the beginning of the heaven and the earth, that vast space was presently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, wherein the heaven and the earth were to be placed, which place <hi>Moses</hi> cals the <hi>Abysse,</hi> which no creature can passe through by reason of its depth and vastness. Now the Aphorism tels us, that all this was 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51776:39"/> 
filled up with that confused fume, lest wee should imagine any <hi>vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV <hi>The matter is of it self invisible, and therefore dark,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For darkness is seen after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner when the eyes are shut, as when they are open; that is, they are not seen at all. and this is it, which <hi>Moses</hi> says: <hi>and darkness was upon the face of the Abysse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V <hi>The matter is of it self without form yet it is apt to be extended, contracted, divided, united, and to receive every form and figure, as wax is to receive every seal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For we have shewed that all the bodies of the World are made of these Atomes, and are resolved into them, therefore they are nothing else but the matter clothed with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall forms. which the Chymicks demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to the eye, reducing some dust one while into liquour, another while into a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, another while into a stone, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">VI <hi>The matter is aeternall in its duration through all forms, so that nothing of it can pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in very deed, from the making of the World untill now, not so much as one crum of matter hath perished, nor one increased. for in that bodies are generated, and do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51776:40"/> 
that is nothing else, but a transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forms in the same matter, as when va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour is made of water, of that vapour a cloud, of the cloud rain, and of the rain drunk in by the roots of plants an hearb, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">VII <hi>The principall virtue of the matter of the world is, are indissoluble cohaerence every where, so that it can endure to be discontinued in no part, and a vacant space to be left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding perhaps this virtue is not from the matter, but from the spirit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused: of which in the Chapter following.</p>
               <p n="7">VII <hi>From this matter, the whole World is materiall and corporeall, and is so called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all the bodies of the World, even the most subtle, and the most lightsome, are nothing but form, partly coagulated, partly refined. Now after what manner it is coagulated or refined, shall appear in that which follows.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For as in the beginning it moved it self upon the waters, so yet it is not extant, but in the matter; especially in a liquid and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile matter. Whence in the body of a living creature, those most subtile, sanguine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and as it were flames, which are the charriot of life, are called spirits. And Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks, extracting a spirit out of herbs, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, stones like a little water, call it the <hi>Quintessence,</hi> because it is a more subtile sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance than all the four elements. But not water it self, as it is water, but that living virtue of the creature, out of which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, inhabiting in it. which being that it cannot be altogether separated from the matter, is preserved in that subtile form of matter. For how fast the spirit inhaeres in the matter, shall be taught about the end. <hi>(hap. 9.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>To move or agitate it self through the whole matter to preserve it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, 1 that no <hi>vacuum</hi> can be in the world. For all bodies, even the most subtile, (as water, air, the skie) being indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this spirit, delight in contiguity and continuity. For as a living creature will not be cut, so also water, air, yea the world it

self; by reason of that universall spirit, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things in it, which also when a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is made (as in the wounds of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, in the cutting of the water, in the parting of the air may be seen) makes the matter close again. 2. that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture putrifies, when that spirit is taken away, (as if you extract the spirit of wine out of wine, or suffer the spirit to evaporate out of an hearb, &amp;c.) but is preserved, yea made better, if the spirit be preserved. For example; wine kept in any solid vessel under the earth, or water, though it be an 100 years; grows still the richer: the spirit stirring and moving it self in it, and by that meanes, still moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the matter more and more, and more and more purifying it from crudities.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>To keep the particular Ideas or forms of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For one &amp; the same spirit of the universe, is afterwards diduced into many particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the comand of God; so that there is one spirit of water, another spirit of earth, another of metals, another of plants, another of living creatures, &amp;c. and then in every kind again severall species.

(namely, according as the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator mingled the spirit of living creatures, that they should have Sympathy or Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy one with another) Every ones own spirit doth form it a body fit for its end. whence from the sight of the creatures onely, the use of every one may be gathered, as the learned think; because every creature hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth its signature about it.</p>

               <head> Of the motion of things.</head>
               <p>THe principles of things being constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we are to see the common acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of things: which are <hi>Motion, Quality,</hi> and <hi>Mutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our of the congresse of the principles if the World, came first motion; out of motion, came quality: and out of quality again, came various mutations of things: which three are hitherto in all created things, as it shall appear.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Motion is an accident of a body, whereby it is transferred from place to place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrine of naturall motions, how many they are, and how they are made, is the key to the understanding of all naturall actions: and therefore most diligently to be observed.</p>
               <p>II <hi>Motion was given to things, for genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, action, and time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For generation: for nothing could be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gotten without composition: nor compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed without comming together: nor come together without motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51776:43"/> For actions: because there could be none without motion</p>
               <p>For time: that it might be the measure of the duration of things. For take the Sun and the Starres out of the World, nothing can be known, what, where, when: all things will be blind, dumb, deaf.</p>
               <p>III <hi>Motion is either simple or compound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV <hi>Simple motion is either of spirit, or of light, or of matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V <hi>The motion of the spirit is called agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the spirit agitates if self in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seeking to inform it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the living spirit would not be living, if it should cease to agitate it self, and strive to subdue the matter in any sort whatsoever. This motion is the beginning of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and corruption of things. For the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in every thing (in flesh, an apple, a grain, wood, &amp;c.) doth by agitating it self, soften the parts, that it may either receive new life, or it may fly out, and the thing purri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</p>
               <p>VI <hi>The motion of the light is called diffusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the light and the heat diffuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into all the parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For fire, were not fire, nor heat, hear, if it should cease to diffuse it self, and liquifie 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51776:44"/> the matter And <hi>from this motion of the fire, all the motion of the matter draws its originall.</hi> as the experience of the senses testifies. For grosse and cold things, as wood, a stone, ice, &amp;c. want motion of themselves, which notwithstanding when fire is put to them, they forthwith obtein, as it may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to the eye. let there be a kettle full of water, put wood underneath it; behold all is quiet! but kindle the wood, you shall presently see motion: first in the wood, flame, smoak, and starting asunder the coals: by and by in the water, first evaporating, afterwards turning it self round, at length, boyling and galloping. but remove away the fire again, all the motion will cease a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by little and little. so in a living body (an animall) take away heat, forthwith not onely motion, but also mobility will cease, the members waxing stiffe. Furthermore, although there be divers motions in things, yet the Originall is every where the same, heat or fire: which being included in the world is moved circularly: being kindled in the air, as it darts it self forth, this way or that way, as the matter is disposed, or the wind sits; included in a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the strength of the phantasie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it this way or that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:51776:44"/>VII <hi>The motion of the matter is eightfold of expansion, contraction, aggregation, sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, continuitie, impulsion, libration and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof the first two are immediately from the fire, the four following from some other bodies; the two last from it self, but by the mediation of the spirit of the universe. which if it seems harsh, will soon appear plain by examples.</p>
               <p>VIII <hi>The motion of expansion is, that whereby the matter, being rarified with heat, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late sits self of its own accord, seeking larger room.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is not possible that the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rarified, should be conteined in the same space: but one part thrusts another, that they may stretch forth themselves, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themselves into a greater sphear. you shall see an example, if you drop a few drops of water into a hogs bladder, and having tied the neck thereof, lay it over a furnace, for the bladder will be stretched out, and will swell: because the water being turned into vapour, by the heat seeks more room.</p>
               <p>IX <hi>The motion of contraction is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the matter is contracted, betaking it self into a narrower space by condensation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:51776:45"/> For example; if you lay the foresaid bladder from the furnace into a cold place; for the vapour will return to water, and the swelling of the bladder will fall. or if you put a thong into the fire, you shall see it wil be wrinkled and contracted because the softer parts being extracted by the fire; the rest must needs be contracted: from the same reason also, the chinks and gapings of timber and of the earth come.</p>
               <p>X <hi>The motion of aggregation i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, when a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is carried to its connaturals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For example, our flame goes upward, a stone goes downward: for the flame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that its connaturals (that is subtile bodies) are above; a stone that its (that is heavy things) are here below. <hi>Note well,</hi> that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly call this motion <hi>naturall,</hi> who are ignorant of the rest. But though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear most in sight, and seem to be most strong and immutable, yet indeed it is weak enough; because it gives place to all the rest that follow, and puts not forth it self, but when they cease: which will of it self appear, to one that meditates these things diligently yet I will adde this.

               <p>The qualities therefore, which we will treat of, shall be common to all these. For it may be said, both of a stone, and of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of air, and of the spirit that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in a body, that it is fat or raw, hot or cold, moist, or dry, thick or thin, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>For as in the beginning the spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the matter, produced the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the waters; so <hi>Mercury</hi> is nothing but motion, the first fluid thing, which cannot be fixed, nor conteined within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limit; and <hi>salt</hi> is dry and hot, and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, just as spirit and fire; it is preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by fire, it is dissolved with water, or <hi>Mercury,</hi> but turns neither to flame, nor smoak, though it is a most spirituall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every way incorruptible.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Sulphur,</hi> what is it but matter mixt 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51776:50"/> 
with fire? for why doth it delight in flame, but that it is of a like nature? and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound things, it is the first thing combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or apt to be inflamed.</p>

                  <hi>That Mercury giveth fluidity, and easie coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter,</hi> appears out of quicksilver, which by reason of the predominancy of <hi>Mercury,</hi> is most fluid: so that it will not endure to be stoped or fixed. It is also most crude, so that it can neither be kindled nor burned: but if you put fire to it, flees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into air.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now that the coagulation of bodies is from sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> as it were glue, appears from hence that there is more oil, in dry, solid, and close, bodies, then in moist bodies; also because ashes (after that the Sulphur is cousumed, with five (if you power water on them clear not together in a lump, but with oil or fat, they cleave together. Now Chymicks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract oil out of every stone, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ashes, no part cleaving one to another any longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:51776:51"/> 
                  <hi>And that salt gives consistency,</hi> appears by the bones of living creatures, out of which Chymicks extract meer salt, also all dense things leave behind them much ashes (that is salt.)</p>
               <p>God therefore with great counsel tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered these three qualities together in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. for if <hi>Mercury</hi> were away, the matter would not flow together to the generation of things: if <hi>salt,</hi> nothing would consist together, or be fixed; if <hi>sulphur,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency would be forced, and yet apt to be dissipated.

               <head>Of the tangible quality.</head>
               <p n="11">XI <hi>The tangible quality (or tangor) is such, or such a positure of the parts of the matter in a body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">XII <hi>The copulations thereof are twelve; for every body in respect of touch, is, 1 rare or dense, 2 moist or dry. 3 soft or hard. 4 flexible or stiffe. 5 smooth or rough. 6 light or heavy. 7 hot or cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51776:52"/> Of every of which, we are to consider accurately, what and how they are.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII <hi>Rarity, is an extension of the attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted matter through greater spaces: density on the contrary, is a straighter pressing together of the matter into one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all earth, water, air, and spirit, is sometime more rare, sometime more dense; and we must note that there is not any body so dense, but that it hath pores neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, though insensible. That appears in ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of wood and earth, which let forth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in manner of sweat; also in a bottle of lead filled with water, which if it be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed together with hammers, or with a presse, sweats forth a water like a most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate dew.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV <hi>Humidity (or humour) is the liquid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the parts of the body, and aptnesse to be penetrated by one another; siccity on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a consistency, and an impenetrability of the parts of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So a clot hardned together either with heat or cold, is dry earth, but mire is moist earth, water is a humid liquour, but ice is dry water, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="15">XV <hi>Softnesse is a constitution of the matter somewhat moist, easily yeilding to the touch: 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51776:52"/> 
hardnesse is a drynesse of the matter not yeelding to the touch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So a stone is either hard or soft, also wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, spirit, air, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI <hi>Flexibility, is a compaction of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a moist glue, so that it will suffer it self to be bent: stifnesse is a coagulation of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with dry glue, that it will not bend but break.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So iron is stiffe, steel flexible. so some wood is flexible, other stiffe, but note that the flexible is also calld tough, the stiffe brittle.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII <hi>Smooth is that which with the aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of its parts doth pleasantly affect the touch: rough is that which with the inequality of its parts doth distract and draw asunder the touch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, in liquid things, the smooth is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mild, the rough tart; so marble unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished is rough; polished it is smooth. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is rough, oile is mild; a vehement and cold wind is rough and sharp; a warm air is mild. So in our body, humours, vapours, spirits, are said to be mild or sharp.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII <hi>Lightnesse is the hasting upwards of a body by reason of its rarity and spirituosity: heavinesse is the pronenesse of a dense body down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: as that appears in flame, and every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, this in water and earth.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="2">2 The inaequality of heavinesse or pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derosity, is from the unequall condensation of the matter. For look, how much the more matter there is in a body, so much the more ponderous it is: as a stone more then wood, metals more then stones, and amongst these gold, quicksilver and lead most of al, because they are the most compacted bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Amongst all heavy things, gold is found to be of greatest weight: spirit of wine, or sublimated wine of least. and the proportion of quantity betwixt these two, is found not to exceed the proportion of 21 parts: so that one drop of gold is not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than one and twenty drops of spirit of wine.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX <hi>Heat is a motion of the most minute parts of the matter reverberated against it self, penetrating and rending the touch like a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sharp points: but cold is a motion of the parts contracting themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. W.</hi> 1 It appears that heat and cold, are motions and fixed qualities: 1 because there is no body found amongst us perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51776:53"/> hot or cold, as there is rare and dense, moist and drie, &amp;c. but as a thing heats or cools; the which is done by motion. 2 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sense it self testifies, that in scorching the skin and members are penetrated and drawn asunder, but in cold they are stopped and bound, therefore it is a motion. 3 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whatsoever is often heated, (though it be metall) is diminished both in bignesse and in weight, till it be even consumed, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is that, but that the heat casting forth a thousand atomes doth weare and consume away the matter?</p>
               <p>Now it is called a motion of parts, and that reverberated against it self: for that which is moved in whole, and directly (not reflexedly) doth not heat; as wind, a bird flying, &amp;c. but that which is moved with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation, or a quick alteration, as it is is in the repercussion of light; in the itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted collision of bodies, in rubbing together friction, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But we must distinguish betwixt <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, Calefactivum,</hi> and <hi>Calefactile, Calidum</hi> or <hi>Calefactum,</hi> is that which is actually hot, and scorcheth the touch, as flame, red hot iron, seething water, or air (which also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth amost violent heat,) &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:51776:54"/> 
                  <hi>N. W.</hi> among all things that are known to us, fire is <hi>most hot;</hi> wee have nothing that is <hi>most cold</hi> but ice; which notwithstanding is farre off from being opposed in its degree of cold to the degree of heat in fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calefactivum</hi> is that which may stirre up heat; as motion, and whatsoever may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure motion; namely fire; and pepper, and all sharp and bitter things, taken within the body: for motion is from fire, and fire from motion, and heat from them both. For as fire cannot but be moved (else it presently goes out,) so motion cannot but take fire; as it appears by striking a flint, and rubbing wood something long. Therefore both are calefactive, but fire is further said to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hot, calefactive things are commonly called <hi>hot in potentiâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calefactile</hi> is that which may easily be heated as air, and after air fat things (oile, butter,) then wood, then water. For in these because the parts are somewhat rare, they are the more easily moved to agitation. stones and metals because they have their matter compacted, do not easily admit of heat; but retain it the longer after it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, because it cannot easily exhale by reason of the straight pores. and this is the 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51776:54"/> cause, why all things consisting of small particles, as feathers, hairy skins, and all rough things, (yea, and all sorts of dust) do either alwayes retein heat, (by a certain agitation of the aire inclosed) or at least easily receive it, by some transpiration rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed only from a living body.</p>
               <p n="4">4 We must also note, that all these tactile qualities, may be said of the same body in a diverse manner; namely, in respect of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother body, as water in respect of air, is a dense and heavy body; in respect of earth, or a stone, rare and light; yea and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the touch thus and thus disposed, it seems to be on this, or that manner; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, warm water seems cold to a hot hand, hot to a cold hand.</p>

               <p>Obser. 1. That colour is nothing in it self, but light diversly reflected from things, appears; 1 because as it is not seen without light, so it is not found to be any thing by any other sense, or by reason: neither is it therefore. 2 because colours as well as light diffuse themselves through the aire, and are in the eyes of all beholders.

nothing, but light diversly tinct with the diverse superficies of things. 3 because light being reflected after severall manners in the same matter, produceth severall colours. We see that, for example sake, in a cloud, which is in it self like it self, yet it appears to us sometimes whitish, sometimes blackish, sometimes ruddy, according as it is opposed to the light. In like manner we see in the Rainbow (which is nothing else but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of a cloud into most small drops of water) yellow, green, flame and sky-colour, as it appears also in Chrystall dust turned towards the light; which shew plainly, that <hi>colour</hi> is nothing else but a different tincture of light from the different inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie thereof. But there (in the Rainbow and glasse) the colours passe through; because the matter it selfe is fluid and transparent: in fixed bodies, colours are also fixed; but after a way known to God, rather then to us.</p>

glasse, chrystall, a diamond, &amp;c.

               <p>Namely, for because the heat increased with the body, increasing, doth by little and little and little consume the thin and fat parts thereof, and dry up the solid parts, so that at last, they are not able to give assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation to the matter flowing in, and that for want of gluten, and therefore the body fadeth, and withereth and at length perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

               <head>Of the Elements; Skie, Air, Water, Earth.</head>
               <p>WE have hitherto contemplated the generall parts of the world, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>principles</hi> with the common <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> thereof: now follow the species of things, which are derived from the said principles by divers degrees. Where first elements come to be considered, as which being framed of the first congresse of the principles, are as it were the bases and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of the whole order of the world.</p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>An element is the first and greatest bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the world of a simple nature.</hi>

                  <hi>A body,</hi> or <hi>a substance,</hi> for though we called matter, spirit, and light substances also, (<hi>cap.</hi> 2.) because they are not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; yet because none of them existeth of it self, and apart, but do joyntly make up other substances, the elements and the creatures that follow may with better right be so called. Now an element is said to be of a simple nature, in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51776:63"/> following, which have compound natures, as it shall appear.</p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>The constitution of the elements is made by light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For light being sent into the world, by its motion and heat began to rouse up the Chaos of the matter of the world; and when it turned it selfe round, (as yet it turnes) it purified part of the matter, and made it more subtile, the rest of the matter of necessity setling and gathering it selfe into density elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>There are foure Elements, Skie, Air, Water, Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, there are four faces of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world reduced into formes, (for at the first it was without form) differing especially in the degree of rarity and density. Note. <hi>The Peripateticks put the sublunary fire, for skie, and call the skie a Quintessence.</hi> But that same sublunary fire is a meer figment; the heaven it selfe, furnished with fiery light, is the highest element of the world; as after the Scripture the senses themselves demonstrate. He that is not satisfied with these of ours, but seeks more subtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, let him see <hi>Campanella, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulamius,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Lydiat</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p n="4">IV <hi>The skie is the most pure part of the matter of the world, spread over the highest spaces of the world.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The nature of it is to be <hi>breathable</hi> and <hi>passable</hi> every way.</p>
               <p n="6">VI <hi>Water is a grosser part of the matter of the world reduced into fluidity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of it is to be <hi>fluid</hi> and <hi>moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51776:64"/>VII <hi>The earth is the most grosse part of the matter, as it were the dregs and setling gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together at the bottom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of it is to be <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>immoveable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII <hi>The elements therefore are all one matter of the world, distinguished by degrees of density and rarity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For where the light is wheeled about, there the matter is most rarefied and pure: below that more grosse, then grosse and fluid, at length in the bottome dregs and a thick setling. Therefore this is a meer gradation. For earth is nothing else but thickned and hardned water: water, nothing but thickned air: air, subtilized water: water, liquified earth.</p>
               <p>But from this difference of density &amp; rarity there ariseth another <hi>difference</hi> of the same elements, namely, <hi>in regard of motion and rest, heat and cold.</hi> The water is moveable. (For it flows) the air more yet (for it transfuseth it self here and there;) the skie doth nothing but whirle about most swiftly, &amp; that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. Also the heaven by reason of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall motion is hot, (yea burneth) perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; the earth by reason of its perpetual rest is cold perpetually: except where it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the fire of heaven coming upon it, or inclosed in it.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51776:65"/>IX <hi>The elements are transmutable into one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, because the heat raised in the matter may extend and condense it. In the water and air we see that come daily to passe. For who knoweth not, that water doth evaporate, and is turned into air? that water is made again of vapour, the rain teacheth us. But we may also procure the same mutation in our hand: or in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Alembicks in which waters or wines are distilled. Let theie be an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks void of all matter, filled onely with air. To the long pipe of this that hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out apply some narrow mouthed glasse, and stop the pipes mouth carefully, that no air may any way get forth: you shall see that when it cannot dilate it selse locally, it will be coagulated into water in the utmost and coldest corner of it; (that is in the glasse.) You shall see (I say) that glasse sweat and distill drops, into which the air heated and rarified in the Alembick contracted it selfe. But remove away the fire, you shall see those drops vanish by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, and return into air.</p>
               <p n="10">X <hi>Aristotle thought that the Elements were in a tenfold proportion to one another; 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51776:65"/> but later men have found them near an hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, that of one drop of earth is made by rarifaction ten drops of water; and of one of water ten of air. The truth of the latter assertion is easie to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, thus. Let one take a bladder (of an oxe or an hog) and having cleansed it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it with oile to stop the pores, that the air may not get out. To the neck of this (but having first crushed out all the air) let him tie the neck of some little glasse, with about an hundreth part of the water which the bladder might contein. Let this instrument be set in the hot sun, or in a very hot stove, where the water is by the heat turned into air, it will appear that the bladder will be full. But bring the same bladder swelled with air into the cold, you shall see it (the vapour turning again into water) fall again. <hi>Note.</hi> The same hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth proportion, or near upon, is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served among colours, for one drop of ink or red will colour an hundred drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not on the contrary; and that because blacknesse represents the earth in density; whitenesse the heaven in rarity. But this very proportion varies, because the air is in 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51776:66"/> it selfe somtimes thicker and grosser, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more rare and thin.</p>
               <p n="11">XI <hi>The matter of all the elements, as it is made up of Atomes, so it is turned again into Atomes: by so much the more subtlely as it is the more subtle in its masse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For example, the earth and every dry and hard thing, is brought into a dust almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible, which may be sifted through a sieve, but cannot penetrate. The water may both be strained and penetrate. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, through vessels of earth and wood, yea, and of lead as <hi>chap. 4. aphorisme</hi> 13. We have set down an example. Air and fire pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate also through thicker bodies: as heat through furnaces.</p>
               <p n="12">XII <hi>The elements are the four greatest bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the world, of which others are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the lesser bodies of the world, which are infinite in number, and in forms, are really compounded of the elements, resolution shewes. For when they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, they return into the elements. And sense teacheth. For all things have some grossenesse, from the earth; some liquour from the water; some spirituosity from the air: some heat from heaven; and because 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51776:66"/> all things that live, are nourished by these, they are thence called <hi>Elementa quasi Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,</hi> as if you should say nourishment, as in <hi>Bohemian</hi> ziwel or <hi>ziwent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII <hi>The Elementary matter occupies a place in the world according to its degree of density and rarity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the earth resteth at the bottome: the water swims upon that: the air fleets above the water: and lastly the skie is in the highest place: you shall see the like specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle if you pour clay, water, wine, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sublimated) and oile into a glasse: for every one of these, will occupie a place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotding to its nature.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV <hi>Therefore the Elements make the four visible regions or sphears of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the earth is a globe; which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter naturally encompasseth round; the air it: the skie the air: after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in an egge the yelk is encompassed with the white; and that with the skin and shell.</p>
               <p n="15">XV <hi>Of the Elements there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, the skie and earth; as many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>They are called extream aad mean both in regard of their sites, and of their acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51776:67"/> 
For the skie is in the highest place, most thin and hot: the earth in the lowest, most thick and cold: Skie the first movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; earth the first resting. The air and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they partake of the extreams, so of their accidents: being somtimes either lesse thick or thin, moving or still, hot or cold.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI <hi>But because the Elements were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not for an idle spectacle, but for strong operation upon one another; the Creatour did somewhat change that order, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two sorts of water to be made, and two sorts of fire.</hi>

               <p n="17">XVII <hi>For part of the water is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above the highest part of the skie: and on the contrary, part of the fire is taken from the skie, and shut up into the bowels of the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these may seem paradoxes: and therefore need demonstration. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the waters it is manifest by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Moses, That God made</hi> (the second day) <hi>the</hi> Expansum <hi>of the heaven, which might divide betwixt the waters which are under the</hi> Expansum, <hi>&amp; the waters above the</hi> Expansum, <hi>Gen. 1. 6, 7,</hi> 8. What can be more clear? now whereas some modern Divines interpret it of the waters of the clouds, that is too cold. They say that <hi>Jer. 10.</hi> 13. The rain waters 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51776:67"/> 
are signified by the name of the water in heaven; and therefore here also. But I answer. 1 That the <hi>waters in heaven</hi> are one thing, and the <hi>waters above heaven</hi> another: Rain might be called <hi>water in heaven:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the air was by the Hebrews called the first heaven: but it cannot be called the <hi>waters above heaven,</hi> as these of which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> speaks. 2 That the waters of the clouds are not waters in act, but vapours: but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> speaks of waters. For he sayes expresly, <hi>that in the first seven dayes there was no rain. (cap. 2. ver.</hi> 5.) but he sayes that those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above the <hi>Expansum</hi> were presently made the second day; therefore they are some thing else then rain water. 3 He sayes, that the waters were seperated from the waters, but the waters of the clouds are not separated from the waters of the sea, and of rivers. For they are perpetually mingled: vapours ascending, rain descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. 4 He sayes, that the <hi>Expansum</hi> was in the middest betwixt the waters and the waters: but how can that be said of the clouds, which are below the <hi>Expansum,</hi> and reach not to the thousandth part of its alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? Lastly, <hi>Psalm. 148</hi> placeth the waters above the heaven, next of all to the Heaven 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51776:68"/>

                  <hi>Reason perswades the same thing most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> For setting down the principles of the world in that order, wherein we see them set down by <hi>Moses;</hi> it was necessary, that the matter being scattered by the light rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about; should flie hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and coagulate it selfe at the terms of the world on both fides, that in the middle where the light went, (and goes yet) there should be pure skie; but that on both sides above and below, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardning it self, should grow thick. We see it done here below: why not above also? es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially God himself intimating it. Let it be so, because naturally it cannot be otherwise.</p>
               <p>But that there is fire included in the earth 1 the eructations of fire in <hi>Aetra, Vesuvius, Hecla, &amp;c.</hi> do shew. 2 the springs of hot waters every where, 3 the progeneration of metals, even in cold countreys: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which can come from nothing else but from fire, which shall be looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in that which follows. 4 lastly there is a testimony extant in the book of <hi>Job chap.

               <p>IF the Light of Heaven had wrought nothing else upon the matter, but melt it together into the formes of the Elements, as it was variously rarified or densified, the world had remained void of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living creatures. But it ceaseth not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through the Elements themselves to 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51776:73"/> scorch them, and scorching them to attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them, and attenuating them, to resolve them into <hi>vapours:</hi> of which condensed again, many severall species of things are progenerated. Now then the nature of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours shall be laid open in the following A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes.</p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>Vapour is an Element rarified, mixed with another Element.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For example; the vapour of water, what is it but water rarified and scattered in the air? smoak, what is it, but an exhalation of wood or other matter resolved?</p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>Vapour is generated of the grosser Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, earth, water, air; as of all mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of water the matter is evident. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set to the fire it evaporates visibly; set in the sun it evaporates sensibly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause even whole Pools, Rivers, Lakes are dried up by little and little, by the heat of the sun. That the earth exhales, you may know by sense, if you put a clot into a dish, (of earth or pewter) and pour in water so oft upon it, and let it evapourate with the heat, till there is nothing left, neither of the water, nor of the clay. For what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the clot? it is sure enough turned 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51776:74"/> into aire, with the parts of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The vapour of air is invisible; yet it appears, that there is some. 1 In a living body, where all acknowledge that there are evaporations through the skin and the hair. For then the vapours that go out, what are they but the vapours of the inward vapours, far more subtle then the vapours of water? 2 Fruits, herbs, spices, &amp;c. dried, yea very dry, spread from them an odour, now an odour what is it but an exhalation! But not (in this place) a watery exhalation (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is not any thing watery left in them:) therefore airy.</p>
               <p>That mixt bodies do vapour is without doubt: forasmuch as the Elements of which they do consist do vapour. Understand not only soft bodies (sulphur, salt, herbs, flesh, &amp;c.) but the very hardest. For how could a thunder-bolt be generated in the clouds, if stony vapours did not ascend into the cloud? and it is certain that stones expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the air for some ages, (as in high towers) grow porous: how, but by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration? and what is the melting of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, but a kind of vaporation? for though the metall return to its consistency, yet not 
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51776:74"/> in the same quantity, because something is evaporated by putting to the heat.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>Heat is the efficient cause of vapour; which withersoever it diffuseth it selfe, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the matter of bodies, turns it into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this is the perpetuall virtue of heat, to rarifie, attenuate, and diffuse.</p>
               <p n="4">IV <hi>All is full of vapour throughout the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For heat, the begetter of vapours, is no where wanting: so that the World is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a great Vaporarie, or Stove. For the earth doth alwayes nourish infinite store of vapours in its bowels: and the sea boiles daily vvith inward vapours, and the air is stuft full of them every vvhere. And vve shall see hereafter, that the skie is not altogether free from them. But li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bodies of Animals and Plants, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>hing but shops of vapours, and as it vvere a kind of Alembecks perpetually vaporing, as long as they have life or heat.</p>
               <p>V Vapours are generated for the progenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of other things.</p>
               <p>For all things are made of the Elements, as it is vvell known, Stones, Herbs, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, &amp;c. but because they cannot be made 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51776:75"/> unlesse the Elements themselves be first founded, they must of necessity be melted; vvhich is done vvhen they are resolved into vapours, and variously instilled into things, to put on severall formes. And hence it is that <hi>Moses</hi> testifies, that <hi>the first seven days of the world, when there was yet no rain, a vapour went up from the earth, to water the whole earth:</hi> that is all things growing out of the earth. <hi>Read with attention, Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="6">VI <hi>Vapours are the matter of all bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For vvho knoweth not, that vvaters and oiles are gathered out of the vapours of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembicks? vvho seeth not also, that smoak in a chimney turns into soot, that is black dust? yea that soot gets into the wals of chimneys, and turnes into a stony hardnesse? After the same manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that clouds, rain, hail, stones, herbs, are made of the condensed vapours of the Elements, and living creatures themselves, (and in them bloud, flesh, bones, hairs) are nothing but vapours concrete, vvill appear more clear then the light at noon day.</p>
               <p n="7">VII <hi>Vapours then are coagulated, some into liquid matter, (as water, spittle, flesh or pulp) some into consistent matter, (as stones, bones, wood, &amp;c.)</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:51776:75"/> That appears, because those liquid things may be turned into vapours, and consistent things into smoke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they could not, if they were not made of them, for every thing may be resolved into that onely, of which it is made.</p>

               <head>Of winds.</head>
               <p n="11">XI <hi>Wind is a fluxe of the air, ordained in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for most profitable ends</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For winds are 1 the besomes of the world; cleansing the elements, and keeping them from putrefying. 2 the fan of the spirit of life, causing it to vegetate in plants and all growing things. 3 the charriots of clouds rains, smels, yea, &amp; of heat &amp; cold, whether soever there is need that they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed. 4 Lastly, they bestow strong moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the uses of men (as grinding, sailing)</p>
               <p n="12">XII <hi>The ordinary cause of wind is store of exhalations one where, enforcing the air to flow elsewhere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may in our hand raise a kind of wind four manner of ways; namely by forcing or compressing, rarifying and densifying air, (which shall be shewed by examples 
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51776:76"/> by and by) and so many wayes are winds raised in the world, yet they are all referred to that first cause, vapours, as shall be seen by and by. I said that wind may be raised by us by forcing, compressing, rarifying, or densifying; that may be shewn to children by ocular experiments, for if you drive the air with a fan, doth it not give a blast? if you presse it when it is drawn into the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, doth it not breath through the pipe? if you lay an apple or an egge into the fire, doth not the rarified humour break forth with a blast? but this last will be better seen in a bowle of brasse (which hath but one hole) put to the fire: especially if you drop in some drops of water. For the air shut in with the water, when they feel the heat, will presently evaporate, and thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out with a violent blast. Which may be also seen, if you put a burning wax can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into a pot well stopped (having a small hole left at the side) &amp;c. The fourth way is by condensation of air: if for example, you lay the foresaid bowle of brasse very hot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ice, and force the thin air included to be condensed again with cold, you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to draw it again from without, to fill up the hollownesse of the bowle. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51776:77"/> so many ways winds are made under heaven; either because the air is rarified with the heat of the Sun, and spreads it self; or because it contracts it self with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, and attracts from elsewhere to fill up the spaces; or because a cloud scattered, or falling downward; or else blasts some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where breaking out of the earth compresse the air, and make it diffuse: or lastly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one part of the air being moved, drives others before it, (for here you must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what was said before. 1 that a drop of water turned into air, requires an hundred times more space. 2 that the air is a very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid and moveable element: and therefore being but lightly pushed, gives back a long way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but yet it is plain that all those moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the air take their first rise from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours. Now because the world is a great globe, it affordeth great store of blasts also, both the heat of the sun above, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the fire under ground, begetting various vapours.</p>
               <p>Hence it is understood, why after a great fire there arises a wind presently, (even in the still air?) namely, because much solid matter, (wood and stone, &amp;c.) is resolved into vapours, and the air round about is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51776:77"/> by the heat of the fire, that it must of necessity spread it self, and seek a larger room.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII <hi>Winds in some countreys are certain, comming at a certain time of the year, and from a certain coast; others are free, comming from any place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note they call these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is as much to say as annuall: which are caused either by the mountainousnesse of the tract neer adjoyning, wherein the snows are then dissolved; or to be sure some other causes, by reason of which vapours are then proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated there in great abundance. But you must note, that those etesian winds are for the most part weak and gentle, and yield to the free winds.</p>
               <p>Note 2 There is also another kind of set wind, common to the whole world; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a perpetuall fluxe of the whole air, from the east to the west. For that there is such a wind. 1 they that sail about the aequator testifie. 2 in the seas of <hi>Europe,</hi> when a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wind ceaseth; they say also that a certain gentle gale is perceived from the east 3 and therefore Marriners are constantly of opinion, that the navigation from east to west is speediliest performed. 4 lastly, with 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51776:78"/> us in a clear and still skie, the highest clouds are seene for the most part to be carried from East to West. therefore wee need not doubt of this generall wind, if so be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one will call it a wind. For it proceeds not from exhalations, but from the heaven, which by its wheeling round, carries the air perpetually about, swiftly above, here nigh the earth (where the clouds are) almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly, yet under the aequator (as being in a greater Circle) very notably. Whence this Probleme may be profitably noted, why the <hi>East wind dries, but the West moistens?</hi> namely, because that being carried along with the air attenuates it the more; but this striving against the air condenseth it.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV <hi>A gentle wind is called <hi>aura,</hi> a gale; a vehement wind overthrowing all it meets with <hi>procella,</hi> a tempest; if winded into it self <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> a whirlewind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is plain that sundry vvinds may arise in sundry places together, according as matter of exhalations is afforded here and there, and occasion to turn it self hither or thither. Therefore if they flovv both one vvay, the wind doubled is the stronger; if sideways, or obliquely, the stronger carries away the weaker with it, and there is a change of the 
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51776:78"/> wind which we see done often, yea daily, but when they come opposite to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fall one against another, they make a storme or tempest; vvhich is a fight of the vvinds till the strongest overcome, and is carried vvith a horrible violence bearing dovvn all before it. But contrary vvinds of aequall strength make a vvhirlvvind, vvhen neither vvill give sidevvay, but both vvhirl upvvards, vvith a violent gyration.</p>

               <head>Of the sea-tide.</head>
               <p n="15">XV <hi>The sea-tide is the daily fluxe of the sea to the shore, and refluxe back again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The sea hath its fluxes lesse unconstant then the air, for it flows onely to the shores, and back again the same vvay: and tvvice a a day it flowes up, and twice it ebbs again. The end thereof vvithout doubt is, to keepe the vvaters of the Sea from putrefying by that continuall motion. But the efficient cause thereof heretofore accoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted amongst the secrets of nature comes novv to be searched out of the truest grounds of naturall Philosophy, and more accurate observations.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI <hi>The cause of the sea-tide, are vapours 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51776:79"/> within, wherewith the sea swelling diffuseth it self, and falling settles down again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this tide is like to the boiling of vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, seething at the fire; vvhich is nothing but the stirring of the vapours raised in the vvaters by the force of the heat. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the vvater should not be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into vapours by the heat: impossible that the vapours should not seek a passage (upvvards) to their connaturals. yet impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they should have an easie passage out of the vvater, (being that the superficies of the vvater, yea the vvhole masse thereof, being a diffused liquor like liquid glasse, hath fewer pores than the earth or wood, or a stone:) therefore it is impossible that the water should not swel rise up, dash it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sides of the kettle, and at length break in a thousand openings, and give the heat dancing &amp; evapourating a passage out, by reason of the vapour raised &amp; multiplied vvithin, and striving upvvard: all vvhich vve see in a boiling pot. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the same manner the sea svvels, by reason of the vapour that is multiplyed in the bottome of its gulfes, and lifts up it self into a tumour, &amp; of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity spreads it self to the side, neither doth it make any thing against this, that the vvater 
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51776:79"/> of the sea boiling is not so hot as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a boiling pot. For here the vast quantity doth not admit of so great heat over such deep gulfes. For the water of a kettle heats at the bottome, bu the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies begin to swell and turn about before they heat.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII <hi>Vapours within the sea, are chiefly generated by by the fire under ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They referre it commonly to the caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall fire, the Sun, and the Moon. But that is likely to be as true, as that we see a pot of water to boile, set in the sun, though never so hot. For who ever saw that? the Sun may lick the superficies of the water, and so consume it by little and little, and turn it into vapour: but nothing can make it boil at the bottome, but fire put under it. Therefore the cause of the vapours within the sea, must of necessity be placed under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath: namely that fire under ground, which the whole nature of inferiour things, demonstrate to be shut up there.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII <hi>The vapours and tides of the sea are provoked by the heat of heaven, (the Sun.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A labouring man, or a traveller, sweats easily enough by his inward heat, (stirred 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51776:80"/> up by the motion of his body) but a great deal more easily in the heat of Summer, then in Winter; and all of us sooner in a bath then else-where: the outward heat provoking the inward. In like manner the sea vapours and boiles vvithin, but yet after the harmony of the superiour fire which is from the stars. Which harmony is seen also in yielding us vvater from the clouds and fountains. For in rainy vveather foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains flow more abundantly; in dry vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they dry something, both which God intimated, <hi>Gen. 7. v.</hi> 11. and <hi>Deut. 28. v.</hi> 23. Now the cause is, <hi>the harmony of fire to fire;</hi> of the caelestiall to the subterraneous, &amp;c. as it shall elsewhere appear.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX <hi>The Sea flowes twice a day, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Sun comes and goes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Sun ascending to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, attracts the vapours of the sea, and causes the waters to be elevated and diffused: descending to the West, it suffers them to fall again. Now that the waters swell again at the Sun setting, and fall as he hastens to the East; the cause is the same which in boyling pots: where the hot water is seen to boile, and to be eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only in that part which is toward 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51776:80"/> the fire, but also on the contrary; but to fall again on the sides both wayes. So the Sea is a caldron, which the Sun (the worlds fire) encompassing, makes to swell up on both the opposite parts, but to fall in the intermediate parts; so that this sea-tide following the Sun, goes circularly after a perpetuall law.</p>
               <p n="20">XX <hi>The fluxe and refluxe of the sea is varied according to the motion of the Sun and Moon, and the site of places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1 in Winter it is almost insensible, the Sun but weakly raising the subterrane va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours. 2 When the Moon is in conjunction or opposition to the Sun, the seas swell extraordinarily; the force of both lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being joyned together to affect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things (either joyntly or else oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely.) Also the Moon encreasing the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are something retarded, decreasing they are anticipated: which gave occasion to the ancients to think that it was caused by the Moon alone. 3 Those sea fluxes and refluxes vary also according to the divers turnings and windings of Countries and Promontories, and the shorter or longer coherence of inlets with the Ocean; which causeth them to be perceived in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51776:81"/> sooner, in others later. But enough of the sea tide, the earthquake followes.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI <hi>An earthquake is the shaking of the superficies of the earth in any countrey; arising from subterrane exhalations, gathered together in great abundance, and seeking a passage out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it ceaseth not till the said ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations are either scattered through the cavities of the earth, or else break forth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> Because the Moon was to rule the night, a weak light, and that but borrowed was given her, and because she was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to shew lesser times (Months) a motion

For vvhen she runs with the Sun in the same signe of the Zodiack, she doth not appear to us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her enlightned face is turned toward the Sun, but her obscure face to us. But when she is opposite to the Sun, we behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her on the same side which looketh toward the Sun, see all her luminous face. Lastly, in the intermediate places we see her encreasing or decreasing in light; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as she turns her enlightned face to us, or turns it from us, by reason of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of her position in respect of the Sun, and us.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears that the Sun is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured after the same manner that the Moon

For the Moon is really obscured, that is deprived of light, as being fallen into the shadow; but the Sun is not deprived of light, but is only covered from us, that it cannot as then enlighten the earth with his rayes; therefore the earth is then more truly eclipsed then the Sun.</p>
               <p>Now God ordained Eclipses 1 That we might understand, that all our light is from the Sun. 2 That the magnitude of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, and of the earth might be found out. 3 To finde the true longitude of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but that belongs to Astronomers, this last to Geographers.</p>

               <p>The beating of the water into small parts causes whitenesse in the foam; even as ice, waxe, pitch, and other things are whitish when they are beaten. The durability also of the foam is more in an oily liquour, as in beer, &amp;c.</p>

                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:51776:94"/> Saltnesse something bitter, with a kind of oleosity was given to the sea. 1 That the waters might not putrifie. 2 For the more convenient nutriment of fishes. 3 For strength to bear the burdens of ships. Now the sea is salt, not (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> thought) by reason of the sun beams, extracting the thinner parts of the waters, and scorching the rest. (For our fire would do the same, and the sun in lakes and pooles, neither of which is done: yea, by how much the more, salt water is heated with our fire, the salter it is; but fresh water is so much the fresher) but by reason of the heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the bowels of the earth, and of the deep; which when it cannot exhale, it scorcheth sharply the humour that there is, so that it turnes to urine: The very same we see done in our own body (and all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures) For urine and sweat are alike salt.</p>
               <p n="53">LIII Spring waters are made of vapours condensed in the cavernes of the earth; after the same manner, as drops are gathered together upon the covers of pots.</p>
               <p>It is certain that under the earth there lies a great deep, <hi>Gen. 7.</hi> 11. That is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty masse of waters, diffused through the

Therefore as vapours ascend out of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen sea into the air, which being resolved into drops distill rain: so the subterrane waters, being attenuated by the subterrane heat, send forth vapours, which being gathered together in the hollowes of the earth, and collected into drops, flow out which way [passage] is given them. And this is it which the Scripture saith, <hi>All ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers enter into the sea, and the sea runneth not over: unto the place from whence the rivers come they returne, that they may flow again.

               <head>Of Plants.</head>
               <p>THus much of Concretes: here follow Plants which beside their figure have life.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A plant is a vitall concrete, growing out of the earth: as a tree and an herb.</p>
               <p>Some concretes (stars, meteors, mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,) want life, and lie or tarry where they were concrete: but plants endued with an inward vigour, break out of the earth, and spread themselves <hi>in plano:</hi> whence also they were called plants.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:51776:98"/>II <hi>Plants are generated, both to be an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the earth, and to yield nourishment, medicine, and other uses to living creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what a sad face the earth would have if it were not cloathed every year with those diverse coloured tapistries of herbs, we have sufficient experience in Winter, and whence should living creatures have food, medicines, and pleasures, if we were destitute of the roots, leaves, seeds and fruits of plants? not to speak of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of shade, and of the infinite uses of wood.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>The essentiall parts of a plant are,</hi> the <hi>root,</hi> the trunk (<hi>or stalk</hi>) and the branches <hi>or</hi> leaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. W.</hi> The Elements, vapours, concrete things, consisted only of <hi>similar</hi> parts: for every part and particle of water, earth, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, a cloud, iron, &amp;c. is called, and is water, earth, vapour, a cloud, iron, &amp;c. But more perfect bodies, (of plants and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures) do consist of <hi>dissimular parts that is members</hi>) every one of which hath both its office, and its name, differing from the rest. For example. In a plant, <hi>the root</hi> is the part sticking in the ground, and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the juice of the earth: <hi>the truk,</hi> 
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:51776:99"/> (or stalks) attracting the juice, concocting it: and sending it to the upper parts: the <hi>boughes and branches,</hi> are twigs, distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the juice yet better concocted, to make seed and fruit: <hi>the leaves</hi> are the coverings of the fruits and boughes.</p>
               <p n="4">IV <hi>The Spirit of a plant is called a vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or vitall spirit; which puts forth its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue three manner of wayes; in nutrition, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For here that universall spirit, (the spirit of life,) begins more manifestly to put forth its virtue, preparing a portion of matter so softly to its turn, that it may have it tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform the offices of life: and is therefore called vitall in plants, namely, because of its more manifest tokens and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of life. They call it also the <hi>vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive soul</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V <hi>Nutrition is an inbred virtue in a plant, whereby sucking in juice fit for it, changeth it into its own substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For because the encompassing air dries up every body, and the heat included in a living body doth also feed upon the inward moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; it were impossible that a plant should not presently fade away, unlesse new matter and vigour were continually supplyed with 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51776:99"/> fresh nourishment, to make up that which is lost. and to this end every plant hath a body, either hollow, or else pithy, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that the nourishing vapour may passe through and irrigate all the parts; yea what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in a plant, even the very haire or downe, is hollow and porous. Therefore in a man, the head is eased, when the haire is cut; because the fuliginous vapours of the braine, or the superfluities under the skin, do the more easily evaporate. For the same cause every plant rests upon its root, that sucking the moisture of the earth through the strings thereof it may be nourished: therefore it perisheth when it is pluckt up. the <hi>humour</hi> then, or <hi>fat juice of the earth,</hi> is a fit nourishment for plants: not dry earth, because it cannot passe through the strings and pores of a plant; nor water alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be concrete into a solid body. Therefore the moisture of the earth which is a mixture of Mercury, sulphur and salt nourisheth plants</p>
               <p n="6">VI <hi>Augmentation is a virtue of a plant, whereby it increaseth also by nourishing it self, which we call by a common terme growing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is pleasant to contemplate what it is to grow, and how it is done Now it is easily 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51776:100"/> found out by the doctrine of motions alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy delivered. For first, when the spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the seed, begins to diffuse it self, and to swell by reason of the heat that is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the thin shell of the seed must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity break: <hi>by the motion of cession.</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every body is moved towards a greater company of its connaturals, that vapour comming forth when the seed is warmed, tends towards heaven; but because the matter of the seed is fat and glutinous, the vapour being infolded therein carries it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with it, and brings it forth out of the earth, and <hi>this is the originall of the stump and boughs</hi> now because that the outside of the plant hindereth the vapours ascending, there is a strife, and heat is raised, whereby the superficies of the small body is by little and little mollified, that it may yield and rise up. and this is done every day when the Sun is hot: but the tender parts which grow up are condensed and made solid with the cold of the night: by which successions of day and night the plants take increase, all spring and summer long. Now look how much moisture is every day elevated upward by the stump, so much again succeeds it by the <hi>motion of continuitie.</hi> least there should be a 
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51776:100"/> 
                  <hi>vacuum.</hi> but because every body loves an <hi>aquilibrium,</hi> and plants own their center in the joynt of the stump and root, it comes to passe by <hi>the motion of libration,</hi> that as much as the boughs spread themselves upwards, so much the roots spread downwards or side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</p>
               <p>Now there is a question, <hi>why when a leafe or a bough is pluckt off, yea when the stock is cut asunder, the spirit doth not exhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it self, und growes stills?</hi> Answer 1 Because the spirit hath its proper seat fixed in the root, which it doth not forsake, though a passage be open through a wound received: nay more, fearing discontinuity, it gathers and conglobates it self, when it perceives an opening and danger of dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2 Because the wound is presently overspread with the moisture of the plant, which being hardened with the outward cold, covers the wound as it were with a crust, and prohibits a total expiration.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>VII.</hi> Generation is a virtue of a plant, whereby it gathers together and conglobates its spirit into a certain place of it; and makes a seed or kernell, <hi>(from which the like plant may afterwards grow.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The spirit of the plant foreseeing as it 
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51776:101"/> were, that it shall not always have matter at command, which it may vegetate, turns but a part of it self into the nourishment of the plant, and gathers together the rest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a certain place (usually in the tops of plants) and makes <hi>a seed</hi> or <hi>kernell. Now the seed</hi> (kernell or graine) <hi>is nothing else, but the image of the whole plant, gathered together into a very small part of the matter;</hi> from whence, if need be, the same plant may be produced again: as we see done. <hi>N. W. That herbs are bread neverthelesse without seed, by virtue of the spirit infused into the elements.</hi> 1 The command of God proves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>v. 11. Let the earth bring forth, &amp;c.</hi> which is yet in force. 2 Experience. For if you uncover the earth beneath all roots and seeds, yet in the years following vvhen it hath been somewhat oft watered vvith rain vvater, you shall see it bud forth. vvhich is a notable argument of the spirits being dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused every where, but especially descending with the Sun and raine.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> The outer, and inner bark, leaves, shells, downe, flowres, prickles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are integra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting parts of plants: serving to defend them, and preserve their seeds from the injurie of heat and cold.</p>

                  <hi>IX.</hi> The kernels are for the most part en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with a pulp for their thinner nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to defend them from injury, but yet this pulp when it is come to ripenesse, serves for food to living creatures; as it is to be seen in Apples, Peares, Cherries, Plummes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>The proprieties of plants are,</hi> varietie, heat, and tenacity <hi>of their spirit.</hi>

               <p n="11">
                  <hi>XI.</hi> The variety of plants is so great, that the number can scarce be counted by any means.</p>
               <p>The natural spirit in meteors and mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals makes certain species, and those easie to be counted, (as we see;) but the vitall spirit doth so diffuse it self, that the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of no man is yet sufficient, to collect the the species of herbs, and trees.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <hi>XII.</hi> The cheif kinds of plants are herbs, trees, shrubs.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>N. W.</hi> 1. Some trees live for many ages: to wit, such as have a compacted and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51776:102"/> substance, as the oak, the pine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> vvatery and thin plants, do soon grow and soon vvither; as the sallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Some lose their leaves every year, namely, those that have a vvatery juice: others keep them as trees of a rozenous nature. 3 Trees are either fruitful or barren: the first bear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Apples</hi> or <hi>Nuts,</hi> or <hi>fruit like unto Pine Apples,</hi> or <hi>Berries.</hi> 4 Porositie and airy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is given to the vvood of trees, by reason of which they do not sinke, and that. 1 That they might take fire. 2 That they might the more easily be transported any vvhither through rivers. 3 That ships might be made of them. Also <hi>clamminesse</hi> or <hi>indissipability</hi> vvas given them, that they might serve for the building of houses: for vvhich end also their talnesse serves.</p>
               <p>Other differences of plants may be seen else vvhere.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <hi>XVI.</hi> All plants are hot by nature; but in proportion to our heat, some are called cold.</p>
               <p>For generation is not done but by heat; but that vvhich is below the degree of our heat, seemes cold to us. As for <hi>Hemlock, Opium,</hi> &amp;c. they do not kill vvith cold, but vvith the viscosity of their vapours, vvhich 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51776:102"/> fill up the cavities of the brains, stop the Nerves, and so suffocate the spirit: the same may be said of all poisonous things.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII <hi>Vitall spirit <hi>(as also naturall)</hi> holds so fast to its matter, that it scarce ever forsakes it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is demonstrated (besides that we see the spirit every year to be driven by the cold of winter out of the stocks, and to be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the root: and to put forth it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the beginning of the spring) by four examples.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That how ever the matter of fruits or herbs be vexed, yet the spirit conteins it selfe: as it is to be seen in things, smoaked, tosted, roasted, soaked, pulverized, &amp;c. which retein their virtue.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That being driven out of the better part of the matter, by the force of fire, yet it sticks in the portion that is left, and there it is congregated, and inspissated; so that it suffers it selfe to be thrust together into a drop, or a little poulder, rather then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the matter: as it appears in <hi>distilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which therefore they call <hi>spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That when its matter is somewhat oft di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled and transfused into divers formes through divers Alembicks, yet it doth uot fly 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51776:103"/> away. For example, when a goat or a cow eats a purging herb, and the nurse drinks her milk (or the whey of her milk) it comes so to pass, that the infant that sucks her will be purged.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And which is more, it doth not onely retein a virtue of operating: but also of augmenting it selfe, and forming a creature of its kind: which may be shewn by two examples. <hi>Sennertus</hi> relates, that <hi>Hieremy Cornarius</hi> caused a water to be distilled in <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1608. and that in the moneth of <hi>November</hi> a little plant of that kind was found at the bottome of the glasse, in all points perfect. But <hi>Quercetanus</hi> writes that he knew, A <hi>Polonian</hi> Physician, that knew how to pulverise plants so artificially that the poulder as oft as he listed would produce the plant. For if any one desired to have a rose or a poppy shewed him, he held the poulder of a rose or a poppy inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in a glasse over the candle that it might grow hot at the bottome; which done, the poulder by little &amp; little raised it self up into the shape of that plant, and grew, &amp; represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the shape of the plant, so that one would have thought that it had been corporeall: but when the vessell was cold sunk again into poulder. Who sees not here that the 
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51776:103"/> spirits are the formers of plants? who sees not that they inhere so fast in their matter, that they can as it were raise it again after it is dead? who sees not that the spirit of a minerall or a plant is really preserved in the forme of a little water, oile, or poulder? Thus the eternall truth of that saying is mainteined. <hi>And the Spirit of God moved it selfe upon the waters.</hi> As for the spirit of a living creature, whither it may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after that manner, and raised up to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a new body, we leave it to be thought of: purposing neverthelesse to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it towards the end of the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <p>THus much of plants; here follow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures.</p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>A living creature is a moving plant, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with sense:</hi> as a worm, a fish, a bird, a beast.</p>
               <p>For if a stone or an oak could move it self freely, or had sence, it would be a living creature also.</p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>The principall difference betwixt a living creature and a plant, is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51776:104"/> is a free moving of it selfe to and fro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better to expresse the power of the spirit of life, Gods Vicar in creatures, it was needfull that such bodies should be produced, which that spirit inhabiting, might have obedient unto all actions. Now seeing that the ground of action is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bodies were to be framed, which might performe a free motion, and these are called <hi>Animalia</hi> or <hi>Animantia,</hi> living creatures, from the soul which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully evidences life in them. 2 Therefore mobility is in all living creatures, but after divers manners. For some move only by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and shutting, not stirring out of their place; as oisters and cockles. Others creep by little and little, as snailes, earth-wormes, and other wormes: some have a long body which creeps with winding it selfe about, as snakes: some have feet given them, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, beasts, birds: but these last have wings also to flie through the air. Which fishes do imitate in the water, performing their motion by swimming.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>The moving principle in a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the <hi>vitall soul:</hi> which is nothing else but the spirit of life, thick and strong, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily filling, and powerfully governing the bodies which it inhabiteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:51776:104"/>IV <hi>Now because a voluntary and a light motion cannot be performed, but in a subtle matter, living creatures have bodies given them far more tender then plants, but far more compound. For they consist of spirit, flesh, blood, membranes, veins, nerves, gristles, and lastly bones, as it were props and pillars, lest the frame should fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Understand this in perfect living creatures. For more imperfect living creatures in which we contemplate onely the rudiments of nature, have neither bones, nor flesh, nor bloud, nor veins: but onely a white humour, covered with a skin or crust, as it were with a sheath, which the spirit inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded doth stir or move; as it appears in worms, snails, oisters, &amp;c. But to perfect living creatures. 1 That they might have a more subtle spirit, <hi>bloud and brains</hi> were given. 2 And that these might not be dissipated, they had vessels and channels given them, <hi>veines, arteries, nerves,</hi> 3 That a living creature might be erected, <hi>bones</hi> were given him. 4 And left the bones, as also the veins, arteries, nerves, should easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be hurt, all was covered either with <hi>fat</hi> or <hi>flesh.</hi> 5 And that the members might move, <hi>tendons</hi> and <hi>muscles</hi> were interwoven 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51776:105"/> throughout. 6 And least in moving the bone, the bones should wear one against another, &amp; cause pain in the living creature; a <hi>gristle</hi> which is a softer substance, being as it were halfe flesh, was put between the joints. 7 And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that the frame might hang firmly together in its composure, it was compassed with a <hi>hide,</hi> or <hi>skin,</hi> as also all the members with their membranes. Therefore a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture consists of more similar parts then a plant: but of far more dissimular parts or members: of which it followes.</p>
               <p n="5">V <hi>The bodies of living creatures were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with many members: as with diverse organs for diverse actions. The head indeed is the principall member of a living creature, wherein the whole spirit hath its residence, and shews all its force: but because a living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was intended for divers actions, it had need of besides.</hi>

               <p n="12">XII The principall transmutation of the nourishment, is by progeneration of the four vitall humours, <hi>bloud, flegme, yellow cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the nourishment received, being that it is tempered together (as all the bodies of the world are) of the four elements, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in the body of a living creature into four again; the fattest part of it is turned into <hi>bloud:</hi> a part into <hi>spittle,</hi> or <hi>flegme,</hi> a part <hi>into yellow choler,</hi> or <hi>choler;</hi> a part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>black choler,</hi> or <hi>melancholy: melancholy by its grossenesse represents the earth: flegme, water: bloud, air: choler, fire.</hi> But they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in colour and in savour; for melancholy is black and bitter; flegme, white and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taste: bloud, red and sweet: choler, yellow and bitter. Now it is to be noted, that amongst these four, bloud is most copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously generated, because it conteins the very substance of the nourishment: to which 
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51776:108"/> yellow choler addes onely a more easie pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating through all: but black choler fixeth it again, and applieth it to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Lastly, flegme tempers the acrimony of them both, lest they should corrode with penetrating and fixing, and gently agglutinates the bloud to the members: And hence it is that Physicians also with the vulgar speak oft of the blood, as if it were the only food of life.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII The progeneration of vitall humours is done by concoction.</p>
               <p>For concoction doth alter the matter by the force of heat.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV Concoction in a living creature is done after the same manner as distillation in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembicks: namely, by heating of the matter, and resolution of it into vapours, and mixing the said vapours together, and by a new coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them again.</p>
               <p>For every living body is a very alembick, full of perpetuall heat and vapours. For life is heat: and heat cannot but boile the matter that is put in, and by attenuation, turn it into vapours.</p>
               <p n="15">XV Now in every concoction, there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the profitable parts from the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: the first are digested and assimilated, 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51776:108"/> the other are voided and streined forth.</p>
               <p>So in Alembicks, the more subtle and profitable parts, (that is the more fat and spirituous) being resolved into vapour are gathered again into drops: and into a thick substance: but the more grosse and impure parts, called the dregs and excrements, sink down, and are afterwards cast out.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI Every concoction leaves behind it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable dregs; which are called excrements and drosse.</p>
               <p>Thus we see it come to passe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of metals. <hi>Now we must note that plants make little or no excrement:</hi> because they are nourished with a simple and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form juice, which goes all of it into their nature: or if any thing remain, it sweats forth in gum. <hi>But living creatures;</hi> because they consist of very dissimular parts, have need of a compound nutriment, that is solid and soft, dry and moist, hot and cold, &amp;c. that so the more solid parts may have nutriment also whence by assimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on evey part draws that which will profit its selfe, the rest must of necessity be strein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. Another reason is because plants are susteined with a little spirit, and that which doth not evaporate: but living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures 
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51776:109"/> are full of spirit, (for otherwise so grosse a frame could not be susteined and weilded) and that is continually attenuated and spent. Therefore they have need of more spirit then matter for their nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and when that is extracted out of the spirituous parts, they void forth the rest.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII The principall concoction in a living creature is threefold, Chylification, Sanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Membrification.</p>
               <p>The first is made in the stomack: the second in the liver: and the last in all the members.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII Every one of these concoctions hath three sorts of vessels. 1 of ingestion. 2 of digestion. 3 of egestion.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX The vessels of Chylification; were 1 the mouth, and the throat. 2 the stomack or ventricle. 3 the guts and the arse-hole.</p>
               <p>For the food being received at the <hi>mouth,</hi> is chewed with <hi>the teeth,</hi> or jawes, and passed through the throat. It is boiled in the <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack</hi> as it were in a close Alembick for some houres. And from thence by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it passeth into the entrals (for the mouth of the ventricle towards the throat is shut up) and becometh <hi>Chylus,</hi> that is, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ferment like pap, or white broth. 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51776:109"/> For it takes a white colour from the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack by assimilation. The more subtle parts of this <hi>Chyle</hi> are attracted to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as a matter fit for bloud: but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of this first concoction, are thick dregs, which are driven out by the guts and the back part, not by the simple mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cession,</hi> but by the motion of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy,</hi> for the naturall spirits placed in the fibres of the guts, sucking forth that which is profitable, but turning themselves away from that which is unprofitable, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them, contract the nerves of the guts, and thrust forward those burdens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the passage.</p>
               <p n="20">XX The vessels of Sanguification, are 1 the Mesenterie. 2 the Liver. 3 the Vrete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, the spleen, and the gall.</p>
               <p>For the Mesenterie encompassing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals vvith its strings (which they call the Mesaraicall veins) sucks the best part of the <hi>Chylus</hi> out of the entrals; and carries them to the liver by the <hi>Vena Porta.</hi> Now the liver concocts and separates that liquour again, for it assimilates the sweeter parts in colour to it selfe, and turns <hi>them to bloud, swelling with naturall spirit:</hi> with which neverthelesse there is flegme and yellow 
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51776:110"/> choler, and black mixt. The excrement of this second concoction is urine: namely, a wheaie and salt humour which floweth from the liver by the ureteres to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whence by the channell of the genitall member it is sent forth.</p>
               <p>But because the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. concoction ought to be far more subtile then the first, it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the bloud is purged from its serosity. But both kinds of choler and flegme must of necessity also be purged from redundancy: the spleen therefore by sympathie attracts to it selfe vvhatsoever it perceiveth, that is too grosse and earthy in the bloud, and by little veins sends it again into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, and by that means disburdens it selfe of that dreggy humour; and last of all the gall attracteth those parts of the bloud that are too sharp and fiery, (vvhose little bag hangs at the liver) and by strings sends them again mixt into the entrals; whence the bitternesse and ill sent of dung.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI The vessels of membrification, are 1 veins. 2 every particular member. 3 pores.</p>
               <p>For the veins proceeding from the liver spread themselves over all the parts of the body like boughs, and sending forth little branches, every way end in strings that 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51776:110"/> are most tenacious; from which every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber apart sucketh, and by a slow aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation assimilates it to it selfe, so that the bloud flowing into the flesh, becomes flesh, that in the bones turns into bone; in a gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to a gristle; in the brain, to brains; just after the same manner as the juice of a tree is changed into wood, bark, pith, leaves, fruits, by meer assimilation. The <hi>excrements</hi> of this third most subtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction are subtle also, namely <hi>sweat and vapour,</hi> which alwayes breaths out through the pores. If any more grosse humour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains (especially after the first and second concoction not well made) it breeds scabs; or ulcers, or the dropsie.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII For the furthering of nourishment there is a spur added, that is appetite, or hunger, and thirst: which are nothing but a vellication of the fibres of the stomack, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the sharp sucking of the Chylus.</p>
               <p>For the members being destitute of the juice, wherewith they are watered, solicite the veins of bloud: and the veins (by the motion of continuity) sollicite the liver; the liver, the Mesenterie; that the entrals; the entrals the stomack: which, if it have nothing to afford, contracts and wrinkles 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51776:111"/> it selfe: and the strings of it are sucked dry, from whence proceeds first a certain titillation, (and that we call <hi>appetite</hi> simply) and afterward pain (and this we call <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>) and if solid meat be taken, but dry, because coction, or vaporation, cannot be made by reason of drinesse, there is a desire that moisture should be poured on, and this vve call thirst. It appears then <hi>why mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provokes appetite? and why the idle have but little appetite, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">XXIII The whole body is nourished at once together, by the motion of libration.</p>
               <p>To vvit, after the same manner, as the root in a plant doth equally nourish both it selfe, and the stock, and all the boughes. Therefore no member nourisheth it selfe alone, but others vvith it selfe, and so all preserved. Otherwise, if any member rob the rest of their nourishment; or again refuseth it, there follows a distemperature of the vvhole body, and by and by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, at length death.</p>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51776:113"/> perception of those things that are done within and without the living creature,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">XXX <hi>That perception is done by virtue of a living spirit; which, being that it is most subtle in a living creature, is called <hi>the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall spirit.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="31">XXXI <hi>That perceptive virtue consists in the tendernesse of the animall spirit: for because it is presently affected, with whatsoever thing it be wherewith it is touched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all sensation is by passion; as shall appear hereafter.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII <hi>The seat and shop of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall spirits is the brain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in the brain, there is not only great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est store of that spirit residing, but also the whole animall spirit is there progenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII The animall spirits are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the brain, that is in bloud and vitall spirit. 2 purified with the fanning of respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3 communicated to the whole body by Nerves. The excrements of the brain are cast forth by the nostrils eares, and eyes (that is by flegme and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ears.)</p>
               <p>For the strings of the veins and arteries, running forth into the brains, instill bloud and vitall spirit into them. And the bloud, 
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51776:113"/> that turns into the substance of the brains by assimilation: but the vitall spirit, being condensed by the coldnesse of the brain, is turned into the Animall spirit: which the air, drawn in by inspiration, and getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brain through the hollownesse of the nostrils, and of the palate, doth so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie with fanning every moment, that though it be something cold, yet it is most moveable, and runs through the nerves with inexplicable celerity. Now the <hi>Nerves</hi> are, <hi>branches or channels, descending from the brain through the body.</hi> For the marrow of the back bone, is extended from the brain all along the back of every living creature: and from thence divers little branches run forth, conveying the animall spirit, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect of sense and motion, to all the members in the whole body.</p>
               <p n="34">XXXIV To know the nature of the senses three things are pertinent, 1 the things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site. 2 the manner. 3 the effect.</p>
               <p n="35">XXXV The things requisite are 1 an object. 2 an organ. 3 a medium to conjoyn them. <hi>Or</hi> Sensile, Sensorium, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula.</p>
               <p n="36">XXXVI Objects are sensible qualities inhering in bodies; Colour, Sound, Savour, Tangor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:51776:114"/> For nothing is seen, touched, &amp;c. of it selfe, but by accidents wherewith it is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed. And if we would be accurate Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, <hi>N. W.</hi> of the three principles of things, only light or fire is preceptible. For matter and spirit are of themselves insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>the light then tempered with darknesse, makes the matter visible. Motion,</hi> (which is from light) <hi>makes a sound; but heat</hi> (which is from motion) <hi>stirs up and temperates the rest of the qualities, odours, savours, tangors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII The organs of the senses are parts of the body in which the animall spirit receives the objects that present themselves; <hi>namely,</hi> the eye, the eare, the nostrils, the tongue, and all that is nervie.</p>
               <p>Nothing in all nature acts without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: therefore the animall spirit cannot do it neither.</p>
               <p n="38">XXXVIII <hi>The medium of conjoyning them, is that which brings the object into the organ: in sight, the light; in hearing, the air moved with breaking: in smels, the air vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: in taste, the water melting: in touch, the quality it selfe inhering in the matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">XXXIX <hi>The manner of sensation is the contact of the Organ with the object, passion, and action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:51776:114"/> There is but one sense to speak general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that's the Touch. For nothing can be perceived, but what toucheth us either at hand, or at a distance. There is no sense at all of things absent.</p>
               <p n="40">XL <hi>Therefore in every sensation the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall spirit suffers by the thing sensible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is no sensation but by passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is too evident. For we do not perceive heat or cold, unlesse we be hot or cold; nor sweet and bitter, unlesse we become sweet or bitter; nor colour, unlesse we be coloured therewith. Our spirit, I say, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the organs, is touched and affected. Therefore those things which are like us, are not perceived: as heat like our heat, doth not affect us. But we must observe that the Organs, that they may perceive any qualities of the objects, want qualities of themselves; as the apple of the eye, colour; the tongue, savour; &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="41">XLI Yet in every sensation the animall spirit doth reach upon the thing sensible: namely, in receiving, speculating, &amp; laying up its species.</p>
               <p>For the Animall spirit resident in the brain, what ever sensorie it perceives to be affected, conveys it selfe thither in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know what it is: and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51776:115"/> it, returns forth with, and carries back the image of that thing with it; to the center of its work-house, and there contemplates it, what it is, and of what sort: and afterward layes it up for future uses, hence the Ancients made three inward senses.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The common sense,</hi> or attention.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The Phantasie,</hi> or imagination.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The memory,</hi> or recordation. But these are not really distinct: but onely three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct internall operations of the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Now that those inward senses are in brutes, it appears, 1 Because if they do not give heed, many things may and do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually slip by their ears, eyes, and nostrils. 2 Because they are endued with the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of imagining or judging. For doth not a dog barking at a stranger, distinguish betwixt those whom he knowes, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? yea sometimes a dog or a horse, &amp;c. starts also out of his sleep: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but by reason of some dream. And what is a dream but an imagination? 3 Because they remember also, for a dog that hath been once beaten with a cudgell, fears the like at the sight of every staffe, or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, &amp;c. And therefore it is certain, that 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51776:115"/> every living creature, even flies and worms, do imagine. But of the inward senses, more at large, and more distinctly in the Chapter following.</p>
               <p n="42">XLII <hi>The effect of sensation is pleasure, or grief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pleasure, if the sense be affected gently and easily with a thing agreeable thereto, with titillation; griefe, if with a thing that is contrary to it, or suddenly with hurt to the Organ.</p>
               <p n="43">XLIII <hi>And that the Animall spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes occupied in the actions of sense, may som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rest, and be refresbed, sleep was given to a living creature; <hi>which is</hi> a gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the animall spirits to the center of the brain, and a stopping of the Organs in the mean time, with the vapours ascending out of the ventricle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appears. 1 <hi>Why sleep most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comes upon a man after meat?</hi> or else after wearinesse, when the members being chafed do exhale vapours? 2 <hi>Why carefull thoughts disturb sleep?</hi> that is, because that when the spirit is stirred to and fro, it cannot be gathered together, and sit still. 3 <hi>What it is to watch, and how it is done?</hi> namely, when the spirit being strengthened 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51776:116"/> in it selfe, scatters the little cloud of vapours already attenuated, and betakes it selfe to its Organs. 4 <hi>Why too much watching is hurtfull?</hi> because the sprits are too much wearied, weakened, consumed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Senses in general, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be said also of every one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XLIV The touch</hi> hath for its instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the nervous skin: as also all the nervous, and membr anaceous parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Therefore haires, nailes, bones, do not feel, &amp;c. though you cut or burn them: because they have no nerves running through them. Yet they feel in that part, where they adjoyn to the flesh, because they have a nervie substance for their gluten. Hence the pain under the nailes, and membranes of the bones, is most acute. Now being that <hi>the skin</hi> of the body is most glutinous, and altogether nervie, lest it should put the living creature to continuall pain and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by being too sensitive, it is encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with a thin skin, called in Latine, <hi>Cuticula</hi> (which we see come of somtimes in members that are scorched and bruised) and void of sense, to restraine the violence of the sense.</p>
               <p n="45">
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:51776:116"/> 
                  <hi>XLV The taste</hi> hath the tongue for its Organ, a porous member, and alwayes moist, that so dry things also that touch it, may m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lt and give forth a savour, which penetrating the tongue by the nerves placed at the roots thereof, is by and by communicated to the brain.</p>
               <p>When the tongue is dry (as in great thirst) the taste perceives nothing; and therefore God hath in his wise counsell provided, that in every perfect living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the vapours exhaling out of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, should be gathered together into spittle within the concavity of the mouth, and should water the tongue perpetually: for which purpose the porositie of the tongue serves very wel. Yet there were added over and above two little kernels, called <hi>Tonsillae,</hi> spongious too, alwayes preserving spittle for the use of the tongue.</p>
               <p n="46">XLVI <hi>The nostrils are the Organs of smelling, and that cribrous bone placed over them; by which as through a sponge, the smel comming from things may enter the brain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore when the <hi>Catarrhe</hi> flowes and fils the nostrils, smelling is hindred. This is the most open way to the brain, and therefore most powerfull to affect the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall spirit, either immediately pleasing, or 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51776:117"/> recreating or strengthning it, or molesting and suffocating it. For hence it is, that grosse, fuliginous, impure vapours kill: but sharp smells raise a man, even out of a deep swoone.</p>
               <p n="47">
                  <hi>XLVII. Hearing</hi> hath the ear for its Organ; which containes the hole to the brain, together with a gristly border winding about like the shell of a snaile, adjoyned without to receive the motion of the aire when in is stricken, and turne it inward: but within at the center of the windings is a little drum, with a little bit of flesh standing by it, like a hammer; which being beaten with the aire that enters, beats the drum also, which the spirit perceiving, judges of the greatnesse or smalnesse, nearnesse or distance of the thing beaten with the aire: and by multiplied experience, knows what it is that moves the aire, and of what sort.</p>
               <p>This wonderful Organ is easily corrupted within and without. Within, if the passages be stopped with flegme: &amp; much more if the hammer or the drum be hurt with rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But without, if the ear, (that is that gristly border) be cut off: for then the sound slips by the ear, or being received in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, makes only an inordinate noise. To help which the Creator gave living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures two ears apiece.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:51776:117"/> Now it appeares hence, 1 <hi>Why too sharpe or too dull sounds offend, the temperate please us?</hi> because they agree better with our spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Why a sound penetrates obliquely also?</hi> because the aire moved, moves that which is next it round about by the motion of diffusion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why a sound spread round about, failes by little and little?</hi> because it is just as when the water of a poole is moved with a stone fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it. Excepting that the water qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a good while in that whole circle: but the circle of the rain moved, passeth away together and at once: for the sound of a bell, doth not sticke in the aire, but is wheeled about in the sounding bell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Why when one hears all hear the same?</hi> because a sound is a real commotion of the aire, which arrives at the ears of all those that are within that circle.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>What the Echo is?</hi> namely a sound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from hollow places: after the same manner as the circulations of the water made in a vessel, after they have been at the sides, returne again toward the center.</p>
               <p n="48">
                  <hi>XLVIII.</hi> The sight hath the eye for its Organ; which is nothing else but a living 
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51776:118"/> looking glasse, receiving into it self the images of such things as present themselves, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to the brain to be judged of.</p>
               <p>The fabrick of the eyes is admirable. For beneath the fore-head of every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God hath hollowed out in the skull two windows, into which the outmost mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the brain, sends two things like bags, filled with the humorus that come from the braine. In the midst of which there is a pipe woven together of an opacous thin membrane, yet full of a most pure chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line humour: they call it the <hi>apple of the eye,</hi> in which vision is properly made, this is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with a net-work, full of a watery or glassie humour: And last of all, that membrane which the common sort call the <hi>white of the eye;</hi> but Philosophers (because it is hard and polished over like a horne) call <hi>cornea,</hi> and this is transparent over against the apple and the net-work, elsewhere it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines its whitnesse. Now under the root of the apple lies the <hi>optick nerve,</hi> by which the image of the thing perceived, passeth straight to the center of the braine,</p>
               <p n="49">
                  <hi>XLIX.</hi> No vision is without the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of light; for that reflecting from things and coloured with their aspect diffuseth it self every 
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51776:118"/> way, and wheresoever it falls upon a glasse, it impresseth the image of the said things.</p>
               <p n="1">Whence it appeares: 1. <hi>Why only things that are coloured are seen?</hi> because the light must of necessity rebound to the eye, but that which hath no colour is transparent as the aire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Why those things that are to be seen must of necessity be enlightned?</hi> because sight is the resiliencie of the light from the object to the eye.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why the eye placed in the shade or in the dark sees the stronger?</hi> because it receives the light reflected without any impediment. For if the eye it self be enlightned also the light reflected from it, meets with the other light (coming from things) and so there is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lision and a dissipation of them both.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>VVhy we see nothing, if there be any thing betwixt the eye and the object?</hi> because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the light is not made but in a right line.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>VVhy some living creatures see best in a strong light, others in an obsure light?</hi> because the lucidity of the animal spirit is diverslly proportionated. So Spiders and Flies see the smallest things, which passe our sight,; (and much more the sight of an horse or an 
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51776:119"/> elephant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) because there are more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile spirits in a more subtile body.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>VVhy whitenesse disgregates the sight, and if it be overmuch, dissipates and corrupts it?</hi> because it is the very light it self reflecting, whose nature is to penetrate, attenuate, part asunder and diffuse the object. For to that end it was sent into the world.</p>

                  <hi>Right</hi> or direct vision is that whereby the light is seen, suppose the Sun or fire: For here the light offers it self to the eye by a single line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reflected</hi> is, that whereby other things are seen in a free aire: for there the light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from things, comes to the eye by a second line (for by the first line the light falls upon the object, by the second from thence upon the eye.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Refracted</hi> is that whereby things are seen through a double medium, and so by refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted lines: as when an oare or pole seems broken in the water.

                  <hi>LVI.</hi> The said Animall spirit moves the members, but with the use of instruments; Tendons and Muscles, and the joynts of the bones.</p>
               <p>The puppets wherewith Juglers (a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant sight to children) shew playes, that 
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51776:121"/> they may turne themselves about, as though they were alive, must of necessity have: 1 <hi>Joynts</hi> of the members, that they may bow. 2 <hi>Nerves</hi> or strings with which drawne to and fro they are bowed. 3 Some living strength which may draw the nerves forward and backward; which the <hi>neuro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasta</hi> that is hid under the covering supplies. Just so to the motion of a living creature, there are requisite: 1 Joynts or knuckles of bones. For bones were given to a living creature, that he might stand upright: But that he might bend also, his bones were not given him continued, but divided with joynts of limbs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Certain ligaments fastned about the bones, wherewith attraction and relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be made; therefore certaine <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> were given them as it were cords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a nervy and half gristly substance, which growing out of the head of one bone, and running along the side of another bone, grow to the lower head thereof; and when the tendon is drawne, the following bone is drawne, so as to bend it self. Now it is to be noted, that these tendons about the joynts of the bones are bare on both sides; but about the middle of them they 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51776:121"/> are extended into a kinde of a membrance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purse stuffed up with flesh: Which flesh or fleshy purse they call a muscle, of which every member hath many: not only least that the tendons when they are drawne should depart out of their place; or the bones or tendons be hurt with oft rubbing against one another; or for the shape of a living creature only (for what a body would that be which consisted of meer bones, veins, nerves, and tendons? a <hi>Sceleton</hi>) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there can be no motion at all without muscles: as it shall forthwith appear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>neurospasta</hi> or invisible mover, is the animal sqirit; which as it can at the pleasure of the phantasie, convey it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the belly of this or that muscle, so it stretches or dilates it as it vvere a paire of bellowes, and drawes in that vvhich is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, from whence nothing can follow but the bending of that member.</p>
               <p n="1">Thence it appears: 1. <hi>That the animall spirit can move nothing without an Organ:</hi> For why doth no man bend his knees before? because there wants a knuckle above. Why doth no man move his ear? because that member wants muscles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeares also, <hi>That by how many 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51776:122"/> the more muscles are given to any member, by so much the nimbler it is unto motion: by how much the bigger, so much the stronger;</hi> For example, in the hands and feet, that they might be sufficiently able to undergo the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of labours and going. It appeares also why they that are musculy or brawnie, are strong, but those that are thin, are weak?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It appeares also that the animal spirit is most busie in motion, running to and fro at the command of the phantasie, most spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily through the nerves and arteries.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the motion of a living creature is compounded of an agitative, expansive and contractive, impulsive and continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive motion. For the animal spirit coveys it self at the pleasure of the phantasie, into this or that muscle: and the muscle giving place to the spirit flowing in, stretcheth forth it self: then when the muscle is stretched forth in breadth, the length of it must be contracted of necessity: and the tendon followes the muscle contracting it self, and drawes with it the head of the next bone by the motion of continuity; all with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable quicknesse.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It appears also that this local motion (either of the whole living creature, or of 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51776:122"/> some member) is made about something immoveable with various enforcings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And because it is with enforcing, it cannot be without wearinesse.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And because it is vvith vvearinesse, there is sometimes needs of rest; vvhich is given in three kinds. 1 <hi>Standing. 2 Sitting.</hi> 3. <hi>Lying. Standing</hi> is a resting of the feet, but with an inclination of the body to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: therefore it is done by libration. <hi>Sitting</hi> is rest in the middest of the body: whereby the other parts are the more easily preserved in <hi>Aequilibrio. Lying</hi> is a total rest. That is, a prostrating of the body all along: But as too much motion brings wearinesse, so too much rest causeth tediousnesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the spirit loves to stir it self. And the same position of the members a long while together by rest, is alike troublesome: both for that the lower members are pressed with the vveight of the upper, and also for that the spirit desires to move it self any way. Hence it is in that vve turne us oft in our sleep.</p>

               <p>Seeing that living creatures as well as plants, are mortal entities: they must of necessitie be multiplied, for the conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their species; touching which marke the Axiomes following.</p>
               <p n="61">LXI. Because that the generation of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, by reason of the multitude and tendernesse of their members, could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously be performed in the bowels of the earth: they had a different sex given them. And it was ordained that the new living creature should be formed in the very body of the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:51776:124"/> As the sun by its heat doth beget plants in the wombe of the earth, so it may also those living things, whose formation is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with in some few dayes, as wormes, mice, and diverse insects, (which is done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the seed of the same living creatures falling into an apt matter scattered, or by the spirit of the universe, falling into an apt matter. But more perfect living creatures, which consist of many and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide members, and want much time for their formation (as a man, an horse, an elephant) it cannot beget. For being that the Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stay so long in the same coast of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the young one would be spoiled before it could come to perfection. I herefore the most wise Creatour of things, appointed the place of formation to be, not in the earth, but in the living creature it self; having formed two sexes, that one might do the part of the plant bearing the seed, the other of the earth, cherishing, and as it were hatching the seed. This alone and none other is the end of different sexes in all living creatures. Wo be to the rashnesse and madness of men, which abuse them! as no beast doth. The members, whereby the sexes differ, are the same in number, site and form, and differ in nothing 
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51776:124"/> almost unless it be in regard of <hi>exterius</hi> and <hi>interius:</hi> to wit the greater force of heat in the male thrusting the genitals outward, but in the female by reason of the weaker heat the said members conteining themselves within: which Anatomists know.</p>
               <p n="62">LXII <hi>The spirit is the directour of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, like as in plants; which being heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the seed, first formes it selfe a place of abode, that is the brains and head: and thence making excursions, formes the rest of the members by little and little, and gently: and again retiring to its seat, rests and operates by turns: whence the original of waking and fleeping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the formation of a living creature doth not begin from the heart, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> thought, but from the head, for the head is as it were the whole living creature; the rest of the body is nothing but a structure of organs for divers opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And that appears plain, for some living creatures (as fishes) have no heart, but none are without a head and brains.</p>

               <p>WE shewed toward the end of the ninth Chap, how fast the <hi>naturall and vitall spirit</hi> inhereth in its matter: we are now to give notice of the like in the <hi>animall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> how firmly it also abideth in its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is the bloud, the understanding of which thing, will also adde much light to 
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51776:126"/> those places of Scripture, where it is said <hi>that the soule of every living creature is in the bloud thereof;</hi> yea, <hi>that the bloud of all flesh, is the life thereof,</hi> as <hi>Gen. 9. v. 4. Levit.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 11. and 14. <hi>Deut. 12. v.</hi> 23.) And to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain secrets of nature, which they are asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at, who are ignorant of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and reason of them.</p>
               <p n="1">I First, then it is certain that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, as well as the vitall spirit, may be bound into its seed with the cold, so as that for a time it cannot exercise its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For as grains of corn kept all winter (either in a garner, or in the earth) do bud neverthelesse: so the eggs of fishes, frogs, pismires, beetles, scattered either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth or waters, do bring forth young the year following.</p>
               <p n="2">II In bodies already formed the same spirit, compelled sometimes by some force, forsakes the members, and ceaseth from all operation: yet conglobates it selfe to the center of the body, and coucheth so close, that for many dayes, moneths, years, it lies as it were asleep, yet at length it awakens again, and diffuseth it self through the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and proceeds to execute vitall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as it did before. We find it so to 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51776:126"/> be in Flies, Spiders, Frogs, Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, &amp;c. which in winter lie as though they were dead in the chinks of wals, or chaps of the earth, or under the water, yet when the Spring comes in, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live again So flies choaked in water, come to life again in warm cinders: like as it is certain, that men strangled have been brought to life again after some hours, And besides there is an example common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known of a boy killed with cold, and found four dayes after, and raised again with foments. Trances continued for some dayes are ordinarily known hence: some ready to be buried, as though they had been dead indeed, yea, and buried too, yet have lived again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some Geographers have written, how that in the farthest parts of <hi>Moscovia,</hi> men are frozen every year with extream cold, and yet live again like swallows: which notwithstanding as a thing uncertain, we leave to its place.</p>
               <p n="3">III The third and the most strange is this, that the spirit flowes out with the bloud that is shed, and yet gives not over to maintain its consent with the spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining within the body: (whither the greater part thereof remain or only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks:) 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51776:127"/> which is most evidently gathered from divers sympathies and antipathies, I will illustrate it with five examples.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Whence is it; I pray you that an oxe quakes, and is madded, and runs away at the presence of the butcher?</hi> is it not because he smels the garments, the hand, the very breath of the butcher stained with the bloud and spirit of cattle of his own kind? which is also most clear from the irreconcilable antipathy, which is found to be betwixt dogs, and dog-killers.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Whence is it that the body of a slain man bleeds at the presence of the murderer, and that after some dayes, or months, yea, and years?</hi> (For it is manifest by a thousand trialls that it is so: and at <hi>Itzenhow</hi> in <hi>Denmark, Simeon Gulartius</hi> relates that the hand of a dead man cut off, and hung up, and dried in prison, discovered the murderer full ten years after by bleeding, as a thing confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by great witnesses, and those of the Kings Counsell) and certainly we are not to flie to miracles where nature it selfe by constant observation shewes her lawes. It is very likely that the spirit of the man ready to be slain, provoked with the injury when it is shed forth with the bloud, pouring out it 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51776:127"/> selfe as it were in revenge, leaps upon the murderer: and that after the same sort as we see a dog, a wild beast, or oxe, when he is killed, run furiously upon him that stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him. For if the spirit do so yet abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the body, why not parted from it? Therefore it is to be supposed that it leaps upon the murderer, and seises on him. Whence it comes to passe, that when he comes near the body (especially if he be commanded to touch it, or look upon it) look how much spirit is left in the body, it hasteth to meet with its spirit, with its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot the bloud, namely by sympathie. Hence that Antipathie which more subtle natures find in themselves against murderers though unknown. For they tremble at the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of murderers, and nauseat if they do but eat or drink with them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The cunning of a most excellent Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon in <hi>Italy</hi> is [well] known, who helpt one that had lost his nose, carving him another out of his arme, cut and bound to his face for the space of a moneth: and the ridiculous chance [that happened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon] a little after is also known. A certain Noble man having also had his nose cut off in a duell, desired his help; but being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51776:128"/> and not willing to have his arme cut, hired a poor countrey fellow, who suffered himselfe to be bound to him, and his arme to be made use of to repair his nose. The cure succeeded: but when as about some six years after, (or thereabouts) the country man died, the Noble mans nose rotted too, and fell off. What could be the cause of it, I pray you, but that the spirit, and that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally separated, doth maintain its spirituall unity? Therefore when the spirit went out of the countrey mans carcasse, as it rotted, part of it also went out that the Noble mans nose, and his nose (by reason of the Noble mans spirit, succeeded not [into the place of it] as being into the lump of anothers
[flesh]) rotted also, and fell off.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is accounted amongst the secrets of nature, that if friends about to part, drink part one of anothers bloud, (and so addes a part of his spirit to his own) it will come to passe, that when one is sick, or ill at ease, though very far asunder, the other also will find himselfe sad: which if it be true, (as it is most likely) the reason is easie to be known.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The Magneticall Medicine is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongst Authours: with which they 
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51776:128"/> do not cure the wound it selfe, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument wherewith he wound was given, or the garment, wood, or earth besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the bloud of the wound, is onely anointed: and the wound closes and heals kindly. Some deny that this is done natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, who do not sufficiently consider the secret strength of nature. Yet examples shew that this kind of cure, with an oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with most naturall things, (yea with nothing but the grease of the axel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, scraped off from a cart) hath certain successe, without using any superstition. Wherefore it is credible, that the spirit poured out of the body with the bloud that is shed, adheres partly in the bloud, partly to the instrument it self: (for it cannot abide without matter) &amp; being forced thence with the fat that is applied returnes to its whole, and supplies that, and hereto perhaps that observation appertains concerning the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of a snake, viper, or scorpion conveyed into a man with a bite. For if the same beast, or but the bloud or fat thereof, be forthwith applied to the wound, it sucks out the venom again, because it returns to its own connaturall. More of this kind might be observed by approved experiments.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:51776:129"/> 6 Last of all, it is not unworthy of our observation, that the animall spirit doth form living creatures of another kind, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then quite forsake the putrifying mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: namely, wormes, and such like. Now it is certain by experience, that of living creatures that are dead, and putrified those living creatures are especially bred on which they were wont to feed when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. For example, of the flesh of storks, serpents are bred, of hens spiders, of ducks frogs, &amp;c. which that it will so come to passe, if they be buried in dung, <hi>John Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> a distiller of <hi>Coburg,</hi> hath taught after others. It appears then that the animall spirit is every where, and that very diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly busied, about the animating of bodies.</p>

The first vve bear about us mortall: the second dissipable: but the last enduring ever without the body; as we are assured by faith.

               <p n="4">IV As the spirit is affected by the body; so is the minde by the spirit.</p>
               <p>For as vvhen the body is diseased, the spirit is presently sad, or hindred from its action: so vvhen the spirit is ill disposed, the minde cannot performe its functions dextrously: as vve may see in drunken, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, mad-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it is, that the gifts of the minde follow the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body; that one is more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, courteous, chast, courageous, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> then another. Hence that fight within us, which the Scripture so oft mentions, and we our selves feel. For <hi>the body and the soul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are extreams (the one earthly, the other heavenly; the one bruit, the other rational; the one mortall, the other immortall; are alway contrary to one another in their inclinations.

               <p>For <hi>the hand,</hi> the instrument of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the most painful doer of all works, vvas given to man only. He only hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined an erect stature, least he should live unmindful of his countrey, Heaven. Again, he only was made naked and unarmed; but both by the singular favours of God. For living creatures whilest they always bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them their garment, (haires, feathers, shels) and their armes (sharp prickles, horns) what do they bear about them but burdens, and hindrances of divers actions? The liberty granted to man, and industry in providing, fitting and laying up all things for his use and pleasure, is something more divine.</p>

                  <hi>VI.</hi> A more copious and pure spirit was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to man, and therefore his inward operations are more excellent, namely a quicker attention, a stronger imagination, a surer memory, more vehement affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:51776:131"/> The first appears from the braine, which is given in greater plenty to man then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny living creature, (considering the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of every ones body.) For all that round head, and of so great capacity, is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up vvith brain; to what end? but that the spirit might have a more spacious vvork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house and palace. The rest are known by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience as followeth.</p>

               <p>We said in the former Chapter, that it is commonly called <hi>the common sense.</hi> This vvas given to man so much the quicker, as it is destinated to more objects, and more distinctly to be perceived.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII <hi>Imagination, is the moving of things perceived by the sense within, and an efformation of the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the image of the thing seen, heard, or touched with attention; presently gets into the brain, which the spirit by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation judges of, what it is, and how it differs from this or that thing? therefore it may well be called (in this sense) the judgment. This imagination is stronger in a man, then in any living creature: so that 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51776:131"/> it feignes new formes of things, namely by dividing or variously compounding things conceived. And this is done with such quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that upon every occasion we imagine any thing to our selves, as vve find dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waking: and by how much the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer spirit any one hath, he is so much the more prompt to think or imagine; but dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse proceeds from a grosse spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe this also:</hi> That the animal spirit vvhen it speculates forward, and drawes new images of things from the senses, is said <hi>to learne,</hi> vvhen backward, resuming ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from the memory, it is said <hi>to remember:</hi> When it is moved too and fro vvithin it self it is said to feigne somewhat. <hi>Note also,</hi> that from the evidence of sensation growes the degree of knowledge, for if the sense per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing a farre off, or weakly and obscurely, it is <hi>a generall conception:</hi> If nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, distinctly, and perspicuously, it is <hi>a particular conception:</hi> for example, when I see something move a great vvay off, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it to be a living creature: vvhen I come near, I know it to be a man, and at length this or that man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>For vve do not remember any thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, then by a like object: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if I see a man, that resembles my father in his face, presently the memory of my father comes into my minde.

               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> Now it may be demanded: seeing that the animal spirit moveth it self so vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in the brain, yea, and other nevv spirit alwayes succeeding by nutrition; how is it that the images of things do not perish, but readily offer themselves to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? <hi>Answ:</hi> Look down from a bridge into the vvater gently gliding, you shall see your face unvaried though the vvater passe away. And vvhen you see any thing tossed vvith the vvind in a free aire, the winde doth not carry away the image of the thing from thine eye: What is the cause? But that the impression of the image is not in the 
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51776:132"/> water, nor in the aire: but in the eye, from the light reflected indeed from the water and penetrating the aire. So then in like manner, an inward impression is not really made in the brain, but by a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendency in the spirit: Which resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency may be kindled again by any like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Otherwise if images vvere really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the brain, we could not see any thing otherwise in our sleep, then it had once imprinted it self in the brain being seen. But being that they are variously changed, it appears that notions are made not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all impressions, but by the bare motion of the spirit, and the imagination of like by like.</p>

               <p n="14">XIV To reason is to enquire the reasons and causes why any thing is, or is not, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon.</p>
               <p>For the mind or reason doth from the experiments of the senses gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, first form to it selfe certain generall notions: as, when it seeth that the fire scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, it formes to it selfe this rule as it were: <hi>All fire burneth,</hi> &amp;c. Such kind of experimentall notions they call princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from which the understanding, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offered, frames discourse. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if gold melt with fire, then it is hot also, and burns when it is melted. Whence follows this conclusion: therefore if the Workman pour gold into his hand, he is burnt therewith. See here is understanding, and that of a thing never seen! to which a bruite cannot attain. For they do not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but stay simply upon experiments. As if a dog be beaten with a staffe, he runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way afterward at the sight of a staffe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his late suffering comes into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51776:135"/> but that he should reason, (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a staffe is hard; and pain was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me with a staffe: therefore every hard thing struck against the body causeth pain:) this he cannot do, therefore <hi>intelligere,</hi> to understand, is <hi>inter legere,</hi> that is, amongst many things to chuse and determine what is truly, and what is not.</p>
               <p n="15">XV When ratiocination doth cohere with it selfe every way, it begets verity: if it gape any where, errour.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For he is <hi>Ingenious,</hi> who perceives and discourseth readily: he <hi>Judicious</hi> that with a certain naturall celerity giveth heed whether the reasoning cohere sufficiently every way. He is dull that hath neither of them. The two first are from <hi>the temperature of bloud and melancholy;</hi> the last comes from abundance of flegme. For melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (understand not grosse and full of dregs, but pure) tempered with much bloud, giveth a nimble wit; but moistned with lesse, a piercing and constant judgement: which is made plaine by this similitude. A glasse receiving and rendring shapes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51776:135"/> is compounded of three exceedings: exceeding hardnesse, exceeding smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, exceeding blacknesse: for the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse receives shapes: hardnesse reteins them: the blacknesse underneath clears them. (Hence the best sort of glasses are of steel, those of silver worse, and of glasse better: by reason of their greater smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and hardnesse under which some black thing is put, or cast, that it may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here immediately: For instance, lead. If it could be iron or steel, it is certain, that the images would be the brighter for blackness.) So the animall spirits, receiving agility from pure <hi>bloud,</hi> strength and constancy from <hi>Melancholy,</hi> make men <hi>ingenious:</hi> and when the prevailing melancholy clarifies the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; <hi>Judicious,</hi> too much <hi>flegme</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing both, makes men <hi>stupid.

               <p n="17">XVII The understanding begins with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversals, but ends in singulars.</p>
               <p>We have observed the same touching the senses, upon the eighth Aphorisme. For there is a like reason for both, in as much as the intellect considering any object, first 
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51776:136"/> knows that it is something; and afterwards enquires by discoursing what it is, and how it differs from other things, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes more and more subtilely. For uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versals are confused, singulars distinct. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the understanding of God is most perfect, because he knowes all singularities, by most speciall differences: Therefore he alone truly knoweth all things. But a man by how many the more particulars he knows, and sees how they depend upon their generals, by so much the wiser he is. Therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> said not rightly, <hi>That sense is of singulars, but understanding of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">XVIII The will is a faculty of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable soul, inclining it to good fore-known, and turning it away from evill fore-seen.</p>
               <p>For the soule works, that whereunto the will enclines; and the will enclines, whither the understanding leads it. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this for its guides every where: and erres not unlesse it erre. As, when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian chuseth drunkennesse rather then so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, (though he be taught otherwise) he doth it, because the intellect deceived by the sense, judgeth it better to please the palate, then to be tormented with 
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51776:136"/> thirst, (though perverse.) Therefore we must have a speciall care, least the intellect should erre, or be carried away with the inferiour appetite. It appears also from thence, that if all men understood alike, they would also will and nill alike: but the diversity of wils, argues a diversity of understanding.</p>
               <p n="19">XIX If the will prudently follow things that are truly good, and prudently avoid things that are truly bad, it begets virtue; if it do the contrary, vice.</p>
               <p>For virtue is nothing else, but a prudent, and constant, and ardent shunning of evill, and embracing of good: vice, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is nothing but a neglecting of good, and embracing of evill.</p>
               <p n="20">XX The conscience of man, is an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall memory of those things which reason dictates either to be done, or avoided; and what the will hath done or not done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rule; and what God hath denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to those that doe them, or doe them not.</p>
               <p>Therefore the function of it in the soule is three-fold: to <hi>warn, testifie,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> of all things that are done, or to be done See by the Wisdome of God an inward.

               <head>Of Angels.</head>
               <p>WE joyn the treatise concerning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with the Physicks; because they also are a part of the created World, and in the scale of creatures next to man; by whose nature, the nature of Angels is the easier to be explained. Therefore we will conclude it in some few Aphorismes.</p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>There are Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine testimonies, and apparitions testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiè that: and also a <hi>three-fold reason.</hi> 1 Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, concretes, plants, living creatures are mixt of water and spirit. Now there is matter without spirit (the pure Element;) therefore there is spirit also without matter. 2 As the matter of the world is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four kinds, (the four Elements) so we see already the spirit of the world to be distinguished into the naturall, vitall, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and mentall spirit. Now the lowest degree is to be found alone (as in concretes.) Therefore the highest may be found alone, to wit, in the Angels. 3 Every creature is 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51776:138"/> compounded of Entitie, and Nihility. (For they were nothing before the creation: but now they are something; because the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour hath bestowed on them of his Entitie, more or lesse by degrees. By how much the more entitie any thing hath, so much the further it is from nihility: and on the contrary.) Seeing then then that there is the first degree from nihility, (that is a <hi>Chaos,</hi> the rudiment of an Entitie:) without doubt there is the last also, which comes nearest to a pure Entitie. But man is not such: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause having matter admixt, he partakes much of nihility. Therefore of necessity there is a creature, with which, materiality being taken away, all other perfections remain. And that is an Angell.</p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>An Angell is an incorporeall man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Angell may be called a man, in the same sense that man himselfe is called an animall, and an animall, a plant; and a plant, a concrete, &amp;c. (as we have set down in their definitions:) that is, by reason of the forme of the precedent included, with a new perfection only super-added. For a man is a rationall creature made after the Image of God, immortall: so is an Angel, but for more perfections sake free from a 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51776:139"/> body. <hi>Therefore an Angel is nothing but a man without a body: A man is nothing but an Angel clothed with a body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that Angels are incorporous, appears 1 Because although they be present, they are not discerned neither by the sight, or any other sense. 2 Because they assume to themselves earthly, watery, aery, fiery, or mixt bodies, as need requires; and put them off again; which they could not do, if they had bodies of their own as we have. Yet ordinarily they appear in an humane forme, by reason of the likenesse of their natures, as we have said.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>Angels were created before all visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That was shewed in the Apendix of the first Chapter: you may see it again, if need be. And <hi>Moses</hi> words are clear: <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God created the heaven and the earth: and the earth was void.</hi> See the earth was (in that first production) emptie and void! Therefore heaven was not void: then it was filled with its host, the Angels.</p>
               <p n="4">IV <hi>The Angels were created out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Moses</hi> seems to comprehend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Angels under the name of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> 
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:51776:139"/> so also the universall Spirit. For he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth not say, that this was created with the earth: but he pronounceth abruptly after the creation of the earth, <hi>that the Spirit of God moved it selfe upon the waters:</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus much that it was in being before. We conclude, therefore that the Angels were formed out of that Spirit; so that part of that spirit was left in the invisible heaven, and shaped into meer spirituall substances, [<hi>Angels;</hi>] and part sent down into the materiall world below. After the same manner, as the fire was afterward partly left in the Skie, and fashioned into shining Globes: and partly sunk into the bowels of the earth, for the working of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and other uses. That which follows makes this opinion probable, (if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable.)</p>
               <p n="1">1 Principles should not be multiplied without cause. Seeing therefore that the Scripture doth not say, that they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated out of nothing, nor yet names any other principle, why should we not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with those principles that <hi>Moses</hi> hath set down?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Angels govern the bodies which they assume, like as our spirit inhabiting the 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51776:140"/> matter doth: Therefore they are like to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 There is in Angels a sense of things, as well as in our spirits. (For they see, hear, touch, &amp;c. though they themselves be invisible, and intangible. Also they have a sense of pleasure and griefe: for as much as joyes are said to be prepared for the Angels, and fire for the divells, (into which wicked men are also to be cast.) Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore they perceive without Organs, yet we must needs hold that they are not unlike to our spirit which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth by organs.</p>
               <p n="5">V <hi>The Angels were created perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is finished in the same moment, so that nothing is added to their essence by adventitious encrease. For being that they are immateriall, they are also free from the law of materiality: that is (when a thing tends to perfection) to be condensed, fixed, to encrease, and so to be augmented, and become solid by certain accessions.</p>
               <p n="6">VI Angels are not begotten.</p>
               <p>Men, Animals and Plants, are generated, because the spirit included in the matter, diffuseth it selfe with the matter, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes to make new Entities. But an Angel 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51776:140"/> being that it is without matter, and its essence cannot be dissipated, hath not whether to transfuse it selfe. Hence Christ saith, that in Heaven we shall be as the Angels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out generation, or desire of generation, <hi>Mat. 22.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p n="7">VII <hi>Angels die not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The spirit of Animals and of Plants pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, because when the matter (that is, its chariot) is dissipated, it also is dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But an Angell having his essence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by it selfe, without matter, cannot be dissipated: and therefore endures.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII <hi>The number of Angels is in a manner infinite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See <hi>Job 25. v. 2,</hi> 3. yet <hi>Daniel</hi> names <hi>thousands of thousands, and myriads of myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads, Dan.</hi> 7. 10. as also <hi>John, Apoc.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
               <p n="9">IX <hi>The habitation of the Angels is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens, Mat. 18. v. 10. <hi>and</hi> 6. v. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore they are called the Angels of Heaven, (<hi>Gal. 1. v.</hi> 8.) and the Host of Heaven, (1 <hi>King. 22. v.</hi> 19.) for it was meet, that as the earth, sea, air, and skie, have their inhabitants, so also that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens should not be left empty. Yet they are sent forth from thence for these following Ministeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:51776:141"/>X <hi>God created the Angels, that they might be,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The delight of their Creatour.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The supream spectatours of his glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3 His assistent Ministers in governing the World.</p>
               <p>The Scripture teacheth this every where: but they also point at names given them. The first appellation of Angels is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>v. 24. Cherubim,</hi> that is, <hi>Images:</hi> wherein is intimated that they were made after the image of God, as well as men <hi>But note what it is to be made after the image of God.</hi> The essentiall image of God, or the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his substance, is the Son, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Wisdome, <hi>Heb. 1. v.</hi> 3. after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of him therefore, men and Angels are said to be created: that is, made under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing creatures: in which respect also they are called <hi>the Sons of God, Job. 1. v.</hi> 2. seeing then that an Image delights him, whose Image it is, it is intimated that God made the Angels primarily for himselfe, that he might have some, who being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants with him, might behold his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majesty face to face, and be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of eternall beatitude. Now the most common name of Angels in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51776:141"/> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, <hi>messengers;</hi> because God created these to be rulers and governours of the World. For whensoever the course of nature is to be hindered, or any thing is to be wrought beyond the ordinary order of nature, God useth their assistence. For example, When the fire was to be cooled, that it should not burn, (<hi>Dan. 3. v.</hi> 25, 28.)</p>
               <p>Or the mouthes of lions to be stopped, that they should not tear <hi>Daniel,</hi> (<hi>Dan. 6. v.</hi> 22.)</p>
               <p>Or the enterprises of the wicked to be hindered, (<hi>Numb. 22. v.</hi> 22.)</p>
               <p>Or any to be killed by a sudden death, (<hi>Exod. 12. v.</hi> 23. and 1 <hi>Chron. 22. v.</hi> 15. and 2 <hi>Chron. 32. v.</hi> 21. and <hi>Acts 12. v.</hi> 23.)</p>
               <p>Or the godly to be delivered from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (<hi>Gen. 19. v.</hi> 1.)</p>
               <p>Or travellers to be guided in their way, (<hi>Psal. 91. v.</hi> 11.)</p>
               <p>Or to be preserved in any chance, lest they should be dangerously hurt, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 12.</p>
               <p>Or to be warned any thing in a dream, or otherwise, <hi>Mat. 1. 20. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence they are thought also to be added to certain persons peculiarly, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Mat. 18. 10. Acts</hi> 12. 15.) that they may 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51776:142"/> accompany them every where, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 11.) and be witnesses of all our actions, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21.) but especially that they are sent to defend Kings and Kingdoms, (<hi>Dan. 10. 12. &amp;c.</hi>) Hence also they are called, watchers or keepers, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 10. 20.)</p>
               <p n="11">XI <hi>Angels can act upon bodies, but they cannot suffer from bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these appear by the effect. For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels bear about, move and governe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which they assume: but those that are separated, they overthrow, stay and move from place to place with externall violence, at their pleasure; yet they themselves in the mean time can be hindred or stayed by no body.</p>
               <p n="12">XII <hi>The powerr of Angels exceeds the strength of any corporall creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it operates 1 without resistance of the objects by penetrating. 2 without endeavour or enforcing, being that they are not deteined or hindred by their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as our spirit is: which being tied to the body, must of necessity draw it along with it laboriously, as the snail doth her shell. Hence the Angels are called <hi>Mighty in power,</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 20.) and <hi>Powers, Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, Dominions,</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16.)</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:51776:142"/>XIII <hi>The agility of the Angels is greater then of any corporeall substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence they are compared to Wind and to Fire, and to Lightning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 4. <hi>Ezech. 1. 13. Luke</hi> 10. 18. and they are called <hi>Seraphim,</hi> that is, <hi>flamy, Isai.</hi> 6. 2. yet it is certain that they move swifter then wind or lightning, when they passe any whither. For the wind and lightning pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the air, not without resistance, but an Angell, being a meer spirit, doth it without any resistance. It appears then, that though an Angell be not in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. 20.) yet they can in a moment passe themselves whither they will. Hence it is that one Angell was able to slay a whole army in a night; and also to smite the first born of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> throughout all the Kingdom, <hi>Isai.</hi> 37. 36. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 23. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 6.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV <hi>The knowledge of Angels is far more sublime then mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that 1 because of the clearnesse of their understanding, which nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrates. 2 by reason of their power to penetrate any whither, and see things plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3 because of their long experience for so many ages. (Whereas we are but of 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51776:143"/> yesterday, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 9.) and yet they are not omniscious. For they know not the decrees of God, before they be revealed. 2 future contingents. 3 the thoughts of mans heart. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9. 10.) that is, so long as they are concealed in the heart. For when they are discovered by gestures &amp; effects, they discern them. For if we by the effects, are not altogether ignorant of their thoughts (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11.) wherefore should not they be a thousand times more quick sighted upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. W.</hi> How that part of the Angels fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into evill, exercise perpetuall hostility with mankind: and God makes use of them to be as it were executioners to wicked men: but hereafter he will condemne them both; in like manner, as good men are to enjoy the association of good Angels: and lastly, how the frauds of those are to be avoided, but the presence of these to be procured, to teaach that belongs to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Divinity.</p>

               <p n="4">IV Solution of that which is continued, is either by a rupture, or a wound. A rupture is prevented by bewaring falls, and violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <hi>VI Crudity in the body is nutriment not sufficiently concocted: namely either Chyle, or bloud, which comes I from the quality</hi> of meat and drink; when they are taken too raw, flegmatick, unwholesome, which the concoctive faculty cannot well subdue. 2 <hi>from the quantity:</hi> when more meat and drink is put in, then it is able to alter and assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto the body. For hence undigested and not assimilated humours, burthen the body, like strangers, and not pertaining thereunto. 3 <hi>For want of exercise:</hi> when the naturall heat is not stirred up, nor strengthened to perform its office lustily in the concoction of meats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From such like crudities diverse inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences follow.</hi> For 1 if the crudity be in the stomack, it causes <hi>loathing of food:</hi> for so long as the first food is not digested, there can be no appetite to any other. Again, <hi>children have an appetite</hi> to eat earth, chalk, coales, &amp;c. according as the crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are turned into the likenesse of any matter. For like desireth like. 2 If there be a viscous crudity adhering in the ventricle or in the guts, being warmed it takes spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and is turned into <hi>wormes;</hi> which gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bowels stir up evill vapours by 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51776:147"/> their motion: whence also come <hi>phartasies,</hi> very hurtfull to the head. Lastly, ctudity under the skin, (in the bloud and flesh) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <hi>palenesse:</hi> and when it is collected and putrified; <hi>scabs, ulcers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crudity is prevented by a temperate diet.</hi> as to Food, Sleep, and daily exercises: and <hi>cured</hi> 1 by violent expurgation. 2 by strong exercises. 3 by the use of tart meats and drinks. 4 by comforting the stomack with such things, as heat, both within and without.</p>
               <p n="7">VII <hi>Inflation is much and grosse vapour, exhaling from the crudities that are gathered together, and <hi>stretching the members.</hi> And that either without pain as when it causeth <hi>yex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>belching</hi> in the ventricle; <hi>panting</hi> in the heart; <hi>giddinesse</hi> in the head (when being prohibited to go any further it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a round) <hi>lazinesse</hi> and <hi>stretching</hi> in the whole body; or else with pain, as when it causeth <hi>aches</hi> in the bowels (straightning the spirits that lie between in the Fibres) and <hi>shurp</hi> or else <hi>blunt prickings</hi> in the muscles, according as it is more grosse or subtile</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is cured</hi> 1 by strong exercise, that the vapour being attenuated, may go out at the 
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51776:147"/> pores opened. 2 by expurgation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by which they are generated.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII <hi>Distillation is the condensation of crude vapours into rheume, which is the cause of many evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For crude vapours gettting up to the head, when as by reason of the abundance and grossenesse of them, they cannot be expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the ordinary passage, they become rheume flowing severall wayes, and rausing diverse diseases. For 1 If they run abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

For when the ulcerous lungs cannot with dexterity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough perform their office of cooling the heart, the vitall spirit is generated more hot then it should be, which doth not cherish, but feed upon the flesh and bloud, and at length burns out the very workhouse it self of the bloud, which is, the liver: whence 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51776:148"/> for want of bloud, which is as it were the food, followes the consumption of the whole body. 7 If the distillation flow in abundance, and grosse down the marrow of the back, it causeth the <hi>Palsie,</hi> (by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the animall spirit, that it cannot be distributed by the nerves springing from the back bone.) 8 If it fill the nerves of the muscles only, it becomes the <hi>Spasma,</hi> or <hi>Convulsions</hi> (that is when the nerve is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, like as a chord being wet and dried again, is wont to be contracted, and become shorter.) 9 If it flow subtle, and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nerves, it is at length gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the extremities of the members, and there raises sharp pains; which in the feet are called the <hi>Gout;</hi> in the hands, <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragra,</hi> or the <hi>Hand-gout;</hi> in any of the joynts of the bones <hi>Erthritica,</hi> the running gout; in the hip, it is called <hi>Ischias,</hi> or the <hi>Hip-gout,</hi> commonly the <hi>Sciatica</hi> 10 Lastly, if those kind of runnings stay in the head, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure divers diseases: as when they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the <hi>Head-ach.</hi> 11 Too raw and flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the <hi>Lethargie.</hi> 12 Salt, and cholerick, the <hi>Phrensie.</hi> 13 Grosse and mixt with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour, the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> or Falling-sickness, (when as the spirits diffused through 
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51776:148"/> the whole body, making haste to relieve the spirits befieged in the brain, make most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement stirs, and fight, till they either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and repell the disease, or else faint and are extinguished. 14 But if the grosse phlegmatick humours have occupied all the vessels of the brain at once, it becomes the apoplexie, that is, a privation of all sense and motion: whence also the vitall fire in the heart is soon after extinguished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All these diseases are both prevented, and also</hi> (if they go not too farre) <hi>cured</hi> 1 by exercise. 2 by rectification of the brain by good smels. 3 by a thin, hot, and sulphury air. 4 by thin, light meat and drink. But the peculiar cure of every disease is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the physiciaus.</p>
               <p n="9">IX <hi>Obstruction is a stopping of the bowels by thickned flegme, whence it comes to passe that they cannot execute their office.</hi> For example, when the entrals are stopt, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not void, it is the <hi>Volvuls,</hi> or <hi>wringing of the guts:</hi> when the liver is stopt, the <hi>dropsie;</hi> (For the <hi>Chylus</hi> being not turned into bloud, flowes through the veins and members, and is not turned into members.) When the bladder of gall is stopt, <hi>the Yellow Jaundise;</hi> when the Spleen, <hi>the Black Jaundise;</hi> (For 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51776:149"/> in the first the choler, in the other the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, when it cannot be voided, diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it selfe through the bloud. But when the urine pipes, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or the bladder are stopped, that is by reason of the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which they call the <hi>Stone:</hi> which stopping the passages, by its sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse pains the <hi>Veins and Nerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cure is</hi> 1 by purgations. 2 by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines attenuating, or breaking, cutting, and driving out the grosse humours which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians know.</p>
               <p n="10">X <hi>Putrefaction is the corruption of some hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the body: namely, either of flegme, or of choler, or of melancholy; which putrifying either in or out of their vessels, produce feavers or ulcers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The cure is</hi> 1 Expurgation of the place affected. 2 A good diet. 3 Motion.</p>
               <p n="11">XI <hi>Inflamation is a burning of the vitall spirit</hi> (N. vitall) <hi>or of the bloud caused by too much motion</hi> (either of the body by weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or of the mind, by musing and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,) <hi>or else by putrefaction, or else by obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is known out of the physicks, that motion doth heat even unto firing, and that by obstruction doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51776:149"/> the heat included (even in these things that are watry and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trid) so that at length it breaks out violently, hay laid up wet, (when it cannot get transpiration) doth shew. When the bloud is kindled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it becomes a <hi>feaver:</hi> when under the skin, <hi>S. Anthonies fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The generall cure is the opening of a vein, and cooling. But of feavers (being that it is a most common disease, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds) something more is to be said.</p>
               <p n="12">XII <hi>The feaver so called, from its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency or heat, is of three kinds.</hi> 1 The Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera. 2 The Putrid. 3 The Hectick. <hi>The first burns the spirits; the second the humours; the third the solid parts.</hi> The first like a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hot wind scorching all it meets with: the second like boiling water poured into a vessell, which it heats with it selfe. The third like unto a hot vessell, heating the water poured into it with it selfe.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Hectick</hi> occupies the bones and membranes, and eats and consumes them with an unnaturall heat, by degrees almost insensibly, till at length it causeth death. It is very like the Consumption. But the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid or rotten feaver occupies the bloud and humours; by which the whole body 
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51776:150"/> grows hot. The Ephemera is a more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flame, feeding upon the spirits only: and therefore it scarce endures one or two days, til the peccant cause be consumed by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it self. Hence either health or death usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follows within two or three dayes; and therefore it is called the Ephemera or dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Feaver: also the <hi>Maligne</hi> feaver. Of which sort also is the pestilentiall infection: for it comes after the same manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Putrid feavers are most usuall,</hi> but with very much difference: for when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours putrifie within their vessels, (or workhouses) especially near the heart, (in the liver or the gall,) the spirit rises against them, and kindles them: and ceases not to assault them, till it either expell the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being turned into soot, or be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished it selfe; and therefore this feaver is often deadly, it is called the <hi>Continuall Feaver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the humours rot out of their ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, that is, in the veins or members, it is an <hi>Intermitting Feaver.</hi> For the spirit ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth up at certain times, and opposeth that rottennesse with heat: but because this battle is made further off from its Castle, the heart, when the fight is ended, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51776:150"/> home. And <hi>if the putrifying humour be flegme,</hi> it still returns to oppose it the next day: hence the Quotidian Feaver. <hi>If it be yellow, choler;</hi> then every third day. Hence the <hi>Tertian. If black choler,</hi> the fourth day. Hence the <hi>Quartan:</hi> the cause of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality, is because the flegme recollects it selfe soonest, and makes new businesse for the spirits: but is withall sooner dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Hence the Quotidian lasts not long. Melancholy being that it is a dreggy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, doth not so soon recruit it selfe: but because it is soft and viscous, it is not so easily overcome: hence the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Quartans, In the Tertian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the spirit opposeth yellow choler, which is hot of it selfe, is made the hottest fight: hence Tertians are called burning feavers. They are sometimes changed one into another, or one joyned with another, according as one while one putrified hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, another while another is to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence it appears 1 why a feaver begins with cold?</hi> because the vitall spirit being to oppose the rottennesse, gathers heat as it were its aid from every part, the outward members in the mean time being benu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:51776:151"/> and quaking with cold. (For even in too much fear, when the spirit gathers it selfe into the inward parts, there is wont to follow a chilnesse of the outward members, and a quaking with cold.) 2 <hi>Whence afterwards heat?</hi> because the spirits, after they are hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with fight and motion, return again to the members; which, being cold before, do so much the worse endure the heat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning now hotter then ordinary. 3 <hi>Why the feaver leaves faintnesse behind it?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the spirit wearied with fight, betakes it selfe to rest, leaving the members desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. 4 <hi>Why food is hurtfull at the beginning of a feaver?</hi> because when the spirit is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it selfe for the battell, it hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther businesse put upon it, (to concoct the food:) But seeing that it is not able to do both, it either assaults the disease more weakly, or else leaves the food unconcocted: or at least, if it do both, it weakens and tires out it selfe too much. 5 <hi>Why it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to expell the feaver over soon?</hi> because the feaver is of it selfe a benefit to nature, driving away the rottennesse in time, left it should at length prevaile and oppresse the heart. Therefore that is no good cure of feavers which stayes the fits, but that which 
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:51776:151"/> ripens the rottennesse for expulsion: And strengthens nature to oppose them, which I leave to Physicians.</p>
               <p>Let this be the sum of that which hath been said, Crudity <hi>is the seed of all diseases. For thence gross vapours arising, cause</hi> Inflation, <hi>the same condensed in the head, cause,</hi> Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: <hi>in the other members, Obstruction: whence flowes either</hi> Rottennesse or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Therefore let him that prevents cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, believe this; that he takes the best cours that may be for his whole body. Now the way to prevent them is a temperate diet and daily exercises. O the strange virtue of labour, whereby we get both our bread and health! which mistery if the slothfull understood, they would not waste their lives with idlenesse.</p>

               <p n="1">I The Diseases of the Soule are, Forgetfulnesse of God, Torment of Conscience, and Despair of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">
