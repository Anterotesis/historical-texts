            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe being onely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the World with the particular Conveniencies of the <hi>New Bagnio, &amp;c.</hi> We ſuppoſe it needleſs to make any Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Apologie</hi> or <hi>Introduction</hi> to uſher it in. We ſhal therefore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55446:6"/>with al poſſible Plainneſs and Brevity preſent the Reader with our Thoughts about it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his Candid Peruſal.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Bagnio</hi> is erected near the Weſt end of <hi>Long-acre,</hi> in that Spot of Ground which hath been called by the Name of <hi>Salisbury-Stables.</hi> At the Front of it, next the Street, is a large commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe, wherein dwels that Honourable Perſon Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> (of whoſe great Worth, and Services to His Majeſty at Sea, not onely the King himſelf, but almoſt the whole Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is ſufficiently ſenſible); who having obtained His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Patent for the making of al Public <hi>Bagnios</hi> and <hi>Baths,</hi> either for Sweating, Bathing, Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55446:6"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the Onely Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this New Building. In this Houſe there are ſeveral Rooms ſet apart for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of ſuch as ſhal come to the <hi>Bagnio;</hi> and to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of it, the Structure of the <hi>Bagnio</hi> is adjoyned. So that the firſt Room we enter to go into the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> is a large Hal, where the Porter ſtands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Money. Hence we paſs thorow an Entry into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Room, where hangs a Pair of Scales, to weigh ſuch as our of Curioſity would know how much they loſe in Weigh while they are in the <hi>Bagnio.</hi> Thorow this Room we paſs into a large Room, called the <hi>Dreſſing-room:</hi> This Room hath on each ſide
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55446:7"/>ſeveral private Boxes, for Perſons to undreſs and dreſs themſelves in: The middle Walk, between the Rows of Boxes, is paved with Black and White Marble. This Room is always moderately warm, to prevent taking cold when the Body is ſtript; it is 32 Foot in length, and about 30 Foot broad; 'tis flat on the top, and covered with Lead. At the farther end of this Room is an Entry, which is ſomewhat warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; in this Entry the Rubbers ſtand and wait, when they are not employ'd. On the farther ſide of this Entry is a Door or Paſſage into the <hi>Bagnio</hi> it ſelf, which is a ſtately Edifice, of an Oval Figure, in length 45 Foot, and in breadth 35. 'Tis covered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55446:7"/>at the top with a high and large <hi>Cupola,</hi> in which there are ſeveral round Glaſſes fixt, to let in Light, which are much larger, and ſo fewer in number, than thoſe at the <hi>Royal Bagnio.</hi> This <hi>Cupola</hi> is ſupported by eight Cylindrical Columns of white Stone Pillars, each of which are 20 Inches Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, and 16 Foot high. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Pillars and the Sides of the <hi>Bagnio</hi> is a ſumptuous Walk, about 7 Foot and a half broad, quite round the <hi>Bagnio;</hi> ſo that the Middle of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> within the Pillars, and juſt under the <hi>Cupola,</hi> is 36 Foot long, and 26 broad: yet the Heat within theſe Columns, and likewiſe round about them, is exactly in the ſame Degree. The mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55446:8"/>Walk in the <hi>Bagnio</hi> is Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Brick; which Arch, with the <hi>Cupola,</hi> and al the top of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> is covered with Lead. The <hi>Bagnio</hi> is paved with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in the middle of it is placed a Marble Table, which is 20 Inches high, and 6 Foot ſquare. The Sides of the <hi>Bagnio</hi> are covered with White Gally-tyles, and in the Wals are made ten convenient Seats, ſuch as are in the Baths at <hi>Bathe:</hi> there are likewiſe 14 Neeches in the Wals, in which are placed ſo many Marble Fonts or Baſons, with Cocks over them of hot and cold Water, for the convenience of Waſhing. On one ſide of the <hi>Bagnio</hi> hangs a very handſom <hi>Pendulum</hi>-Clock, which is kept
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55446:8"/>to give an exact Account how Time paſſeth away. Adjoyning to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> there are four little round Rooms, about 8 Foot over, which are made for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat, ſome being hotter, others colder, as Perſons can beſt bear, and are pleaſed to uſe. In each of theſe little Rooms is fixt a Leaden Ciſtern, about 2 Foot high, 6 Foot long, and 2 Foot and a half broad: Over every of theſe Ciſterns are placed two Cocks, the one to ſupply with hot, the other with cold Water. Theſe Rooms are likewiſe al co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <hi>Cupola's,</hi> and their Wals with Gally-tyles.</p>
            <p>The Inſide of this <hi>Bagnio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus deſcribed, it's now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite we ſay ſomething of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55446:9"/>manner of Entertainment in it, which is as follows.</p>
            <p>The Perſon that comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Benefit of this <hi>Bagnio,</hi> when he firſt enters, pays his Money to the Porter, or Perſon appointed for that purpoſe, then if he pleaſeth, he may be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scales: whence paſſing into the Dreſſing-room, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Barbers, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a Box to himſelf, his particular Barber attending him, who immediately undreſſeth him, cauſing him to ſit down on the Squab or little Couch placed in the Box. Being thus undreſt, and his Head wrapt about with a Napkin, he hath a Linen Cloth put round his Middle, which reacheth down to his Feet, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55446:9"/>another thrown about his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which hangs like a Mantle down to his Middle, he hath a pair of Slippers given him, and ſo paſſeth to the Entry of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> attended by his Barber, where he is met by a particular Rubber deſtin'd to wait on him, who bringing him a pair of Wooden Clogs, which he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth for his Slippers, introduceth him into the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and then leaves him to walk about, or ſit down on one of the Seats, or elſe lye along upon the Marble Table, which beſt pleaſeth him. Thus, obſerving the Clock, the Perſon may continue as long as he wil: If he purpoſeth to ſweat much, and deſireth a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat, he may walk into
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55446:10"/>one of the little Rooms deſigned for that purpoſe; and if he finds himſelf almoſt overcome, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint, he may paſs thence into another of theſe little Rooms on the other ſide of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> which is much cooler, and there find preſent Relief; or, if he pleaſe, he may cal for a Bottle of a <hi>Diaphoretic Liquor,</hi> which our <hi>Apothecary</hi> hath always in readineſs, which is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Cordial, and wil both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Fainting, and quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him from it if he already faint, and likewiſe much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Sweating. After he hath been in about an Hour, more or leſs, he cals for his Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who firſt cauſeth him to ſit down in a Chair, over againſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55446:10"/>one of the Stone Baſons in that <hi>Bagnio;</hi> there with his Hands he artificially rubs him over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Arms, then the Legs, afterwards the Back, and then the Breaſt and Belly: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he fetcheth off much Scurf; which before ſtopt the Pores, and ſo hindred thoſe Sluces of Perſpiration from ſending forth thoſe Heterogeneous Particles which Nature deems not fit to remain mixed with that whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Liquor the Blood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavours to throw them off that way. After this, to make the Parts more pliable, the Rubber ſtretcheth every Limb of the Body, and diſtends every Joynt in each Limb; then he throws warm Water upon him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55446:11"/>and waſheth his Body all over, and hereby renders him white and clean. Having thus done, he takes him into a little Room, which is a Degree colder; there he rubs his Body al over with a Hair-Chamlet Glove, which gently ſcratcheth the Body, and is exceeding pleaſant to the Senſe; the particular Uſe and Benefit of which, we ſhal relate in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe. After he hath continued this pleaſant ſort of Friction for ſome time, more or leſs, as the Perſon deſires it, he fetcheth a Baſon of a Perfumed Lader, with which he waſheth the Body al over; this, the Rubber tels you, he finds at his own Charge: The Body being waſhed hereby, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55446:11"/>a very grateful and pleaſing Scent. This being finiſht, he rinſeth the Body with Water, and the fils the Leaden Ciſtern, ſetting the Cocks of hot and cold Water both running, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Ciſtern is ſoon filled with Water moderately warm. The Cocks being then both ſtopt, the Perſon is deſired to lie or ſit in the Ciſtern of Water; and the Cocks being at his Hand, he ſets the cold Cock a running, which renders the Water in the Ciſtern gradually colder and colder: Thus he cools himſelf at pleaſure; and when he thinks himſelf cool enough, freſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen is brought him: He then walks to the Door of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> where his Barber meets him with

The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then repairs to the Scales, and ſees what he has loſt; and then leaving the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> he betakes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55446:12"/>himſelf to his Pleaſure or Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, finding himſelf as brisk, active, and vigorous, as if he had juſt skipt into the World, and never wearied his active Members by any Exerciſe or Occupation.</p>
            <p>The ſame Reception and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment do alſo Women find, only with this difference, <hi>viz.</hi> On Womens Days there are all imaginable Conveniences of Privacy, and not a Man to be ſeen; but all the Servants are of the Female Sex, and ſuch as are not only neat and cleanly, but likewiſe skilful and dexterous in the Buſineſs they have to do. They likewiſe uſe a Water which affects the Skin with an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Whiteneſs and Clearneſs,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55446:13"/>with which they waſh the whole Body, but eſpecially the Hands, and Face, and Neck; whereby much Luſtre and Beauty is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thoſe Parts. The Days appointed for Men are <hi>Mundays, Wedneſdays, Thurſdays;</hi> and <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days;</hi> thoſe for Women are <hi>Tueſdays</hi> and <hi>Frydays</hi> only.</p>
            <p>Having thus deſcribed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of this <hi>Bagnio,</hi> and given a conciſe <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Manners and Cuſtoms appointed for the Accommodation of ſuch as ſhall frequent it; it is altogether requiſite we ſhould give as ſhort an Account as may be of the Particulars belonging to it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Waters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we relate the ſingular Uſe and Vertues of them all; which take as follows.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55446:13"/>
            <p>On the Eaſt ſide of the <hi>Bagnio</hi> there is a <hi>Coffee-houſe</hi> fronting the Street, with this Inſcription upon the Sign, <hi>THE D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KES BAGNIO COFFEE-HO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi> Near the end of this <hi>Coffe-houſe</hi> is the great Gate, which opens into a large Court-yard, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the receiving of Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: In this Court-yard is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Front of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Inſcription upon it, in Golden Letters, upon a Carved Stone, <hi>THE D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KES BAGNIO.</hi> On the left hand of the Yard, over againſt the <hi>Coffee-houſe,</hi> is a very convenient Building, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the Accommodations belonging to the <hi>Bath;</hi> on the outſide of which is inſcribed in like manner, <hi>THE D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KES
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55446:14"/>BATH.</hi> This Building is about 42 Foot broad, 21 Foot deep, and three Story high. There are in the lower Story, of firſt Floor, ſeveral Partitions: On the Weſt ſide of it is a narrow Room for a <hi>Laboratory,</hi> in which are Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic Furnaces, Glaſſes, and other Inſtruments neceſſary for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Bath-Waters.</hi> At the Eaſt end a Door opens, thorow which Perſons that come to the <hi>Bath</hi> firſt enter into an Entry, and then turn on the Right-hand into a convenient Room ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Reception; and on the further ſide of this Room a Door opens to the <hi>Bath,</hi> round about which, within the Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a Place for the Friends or Servants attending ſuch as go
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55446:14"/>into the <hi>Bath,</hi> to ſtand, who may lean over, and ſee thoſe that wade in the Waters. At one Corner of the <hi>Bath</hi> are five or ſix Steps down into the Water. This <hi>Bath</hi> is about 10 Foot long, 7 Foot broad, and 5 Foot deep; tho it ſeldom or never is ful quite up to the top: It holds about 10 Tun of Water, according to the Rules of Gaging: On the further ſide of it are Seats in the Wall, ſuch as are in the <hi>Baths</hi> at <hi>Bathe:</hi> At one corner of it is a large Pipe, to let in Water upon occaſion; and alſo a Cock ſomewhat ſmaller, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly running to ſupply the <hi>Bath</hi> with Water. There is likewiſe another ſmal Cock, and ſeveral Veſſels adapted for our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55446:15"/>purpoſe, thro which thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Liquors paſs which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the VVater, and cauſe that Heat and Ebullition which appears immediately after their mixture with the Water. The <hi>Bath</hi> is hereby kept continually hot to an exact Degree, and is impregnated by the very ſame Mineral Principles wherewith the Natural <hi>Baths</hi> are; only in this <hi>Bath</hi> they are more pure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparate from al noxious Fumes, Arſenical Particles, and other poyſonous and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Mixtures: So that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial <hi>Bath</hi> is much ſafer and better than any Natural ones; for (not to leſſen the Eſteem of Natural <hi>Baths,</hi> they being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Bleſſings which God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55446:15"/>hat conferred upon ſome Countries) in Natural <hi>Baths</hi> there is much of Contingency and Caſualty; and 'tis almoſt as probable that the Currents of Water in the Bowels of the Earth ſhould fal upon a poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as upon a wholeſom or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Mine; and ſo may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon be impregnated with Antimonial, Arſenical, or Mercurial, as with Sulphureous, Nitrous, or Vitrioline Particles. Hence ſeveral <hi>Baths</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> do retain ſuch deadly and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Qualities, that none dare to enter them: Others, tho fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, are in ſome meaſure hurtful and deſtructive: And there is no Natural <hi>Bath</hi> in the World but hath ſome unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55446:16"/>Particles ſwimming about with the numerous Sulphureous ones.</p>
            <p>On the Right-hand coming out of this <hi>Bath</hi> is a little ſquare Room, accommodated for the wiping and wrapping ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as uſe the <hi>Bath;</hi> which Room is kept moderately warm by the Heat of the <hi>Bath.</hi> At the end of this Room there is a Door into the Entry, and at the end of the Entry a pair of Stairs up to the Chambers above, where there are Beds, Fires, and al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Neceſſaries for ſuch as bathe. There are likewiſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets for Servants Lodgings, and other Conveniencies.</p>
            <p>The Manner and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Bathing are theſe. The
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55446:16"/>Perſons deſiring to uſe the <hi>Bath,</hi> whether one, two, three, or more, firſt come directly to the <hi>Bath</hi>-houſe, thro the Court-yard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the <hi>Bagnio</hi> and <hi>Bath,</hi> and, by a Servant appointed for that Buſineſs, are conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common Room of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, who having received their Money, either taketh them into the private Room at the end of the <hi>Bath,</hi> or elſe up Stairs, if they deſire it, and there undreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them: After they are ſtript, he puts on them a Canvas Shirt or Shift, gives them a pair of Clogs, and ſo leadeth them to the <hi>Bath.</hi> If they are feeble, and unable to help themſelves, they have a Guide enters with them; otherwiſe they go in without.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55446:17"/>When they are in, they either walk about, or ſit down on one of the Seats in the <hi>Bath,</hi> which Seats are ſome higher and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſome lower and leſſer, for the Convenience of tal and ſhort, great and ſmal Bodies. They continue in the <hi>Bath</hi> as long as they pleaſe, or ſo long as their Phyſician, if they conſulted any, adviſed them. They have alſo, while they are in the <hi>Bath,</hi> offered them by the <hi>Apothecary</hi> a Bottle of the mentioned <hi>Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic Cordial Liquor.</hi> During the time they ſtay in the <hi>Bath,</hi> they either divert themſelves by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Friends or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about them, or elſe by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of the ſomewhat ſtrangeneſs of the great Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55446:17"/>and Heat which now and then by Intervals they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be cauſed by the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Mixtures: Alſo, if they pleaſe to order the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to be ſhut, and ſo the <hi>Bath</hi> darkned, the Surface of thoſe Veſſels wherein the Mixtures are made wil appear Light and Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſeveral ſhining Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors or Exhalations wil be ſeen to aſcend, in the manner of Fiery Meteors; which <hi>Phenomena</hi> are cauſed by the avolition of the Sulphureous <hi>Aporrhea</hi> or Fumes from the Mineral Principles of this <hi>Bath,</hi> and are ſomewhat pleaſant to behold: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the great Virutes and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Qualities, beſides the Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of it, is the main Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55446:18"/>to perſwade Perſons to make uſe of it; yet theſe Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities being for Diverſion-ſake worth obſerving, I thought fit to mention them in the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>Bath,</hi> intending by and by to inſiſt upon the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Vertues and Qualities of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore to return from this Digreſſion, and proceed in what is yet behind, in reference to relating the Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Bathing. The Perſons in the <hi>Bath</hi> having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there as long as is thought convenient and neceſſary for this time, they come out, being handed up by a Servant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the adjacent little Room, they are wiped dry, a Shirt or Shift and Gown is put on them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55446:18"/>and hence they are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into warm Beds prepared for them in the Chambers, or elſe they are carried in a cloſe Chair to their own Lodgings near the <hi>Bath,</hi> ſuch as they ſhal chuſe for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Women likewiſe two Days every Week are here received with al Decency and due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, by Perſons of their own Sex, ordered to attend them. There is alſo one Day appointed in every Week for a particular <hi>Bath</hi> prepared for Children in the <hi>Rickets,</hi> very effectual in that Diſtemper, as wil appear in the following Part of this Treatiſe, and likewiſe by the Experience of ſuch as wil have occaſion to ſend their Children to it.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55446:19"/>
            <p>But to avoid being prolix, I ſhal now (having given this ſummary Account of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars belonging to the <hi>Bath</hi>) in as few Words as may be, give a Deſcription of the <hi>New Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Spaw</hi> is a Well of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Waters, artificially made, by Mineral Principles, conveyed into the Earth by appropriated Veſſels, there ſpringing up in a ſufficient Quantity to ſupply al Perſons that ſhal have occaſion to drink them. Their Colour is clear and tranſparent, their Taſte ſweet, and ſomewhat ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; they turn Purple if mixed with Gals, and are reduced to Tranſparency by a few Drops of Spirit of Vitriol: Oyl of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar <hi>per Deliquium</hi> will curdle and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55446:19"/>turn them White, and Spirit of Vitriol wil reſtore them to their former pellucid Colour. The Wel is covered over with Stone, with a Figure upon it, and other Carved-work about it: It hath a ſmal Iron Door, which is kept lockt, and opened only by the Perſon that draws the Water. This Wel is made cloſe to the Wal of the <hi>Bath</hi>-houſe, in the Yard, about the middle of that Building; and 'tis encompaſſed on the Yard-ſide with tal Palliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, in which there is a Door made for the Perſon that draws the Waters to paſs to the Wel, and likewiſe a Window, out of which the Waters are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to thoſe that want them. Near to theſe Pallizadoes is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55446:20"/>Room, for Perſons to ſit in that drink the Waters. There are alſo al other convenient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations for the Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Waters, as Bottles, Cups, Glaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all I thought neceſſary to relate in reference to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> the <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>Spaw.</hi> The ſubſequent Part of this Tract is to be ſpent in mentioning the great Vertues, Effects, and Qualities of them al: And we ſhall begin with the Uſe of the <hi>Bagnio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the many excellent Helps and uſeful Inventions wherewith the Induſtry of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern <hi>Phyſicians</hi> hath ſupported the tottering Fabric of Mens Bodies, the Practice of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55446:20"/>
               <hi>Bagnios</hi> deſervedly claims an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mention, and juſtly challenges a venerable Eſteem. And indeed if we conſider how long they have been known to the World, it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (whithout a manifeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Judgment of the Learned in ſo many Ages, who having often experienced the great Advantages they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, took care to hand them down to our Times, and recommended them to the Uſe of ſucceeding Generations) that their Uſefulneſs is not found to equal the Character which they have always given them, and which we now contend for.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when we remember how nearly Art reſembles Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55446:21"/>in this ſort of Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have no reaſon to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſuch conſiderable Effects from Means ſo highly probable; for, as 'tis generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that by obſerving the ſingular Benefit ſome have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by involuntary Bleeding at Noſe, ſome at the <hi>Hemorhoids,</hi> others in other Parts, we were firſt directed to take up the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, open a Vein, and cal in the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Phlebotomy;</hi> ſo 'tis not unlikely, that the Ancients taking notice of the great Relief ſome have found after, Critical Sweats, by a free Tranſpiration of the Fuliginous Parts of the Body thorow the Pores, received the firſt hint of attempting the like Evacuations by Artificial
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55446:21"/>
               <hi>Baths</hi> or <hi>Bagnios,</hi> thereby pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully aſſiſting the weakneſs of ſluggiſh Nature, in throwing off the offending Matter. We need not look back ſo far as to the Times in which <hi>Rome,</hi> when Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris of the World, boaſted of near 200 beautiful Structures erected for this purpoſe, ſince the preſent Practice of the <hi>Turks</hi> obviouſly preſents it ſelf to our Conſideration; the Wiſdom of whoſe Governours hath thought fit to provide ſuch Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations in all the principal Places of that vaſt Empire, and endow them with large Revenues: Nor do they think their Charge and Trouble in erecting theſe <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios</hi> loſt; for they apparently find themſelves much recruited
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55446:22"/>and invigorated by the frequent uſe of them; as likewiſe ſeveral Diſtempers are hereby prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It's rare to ſee any there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted either with <hi>Gout, Dropſie,</hi> or <hi>Rheumatiſms;</hi> the Reaſon of which can be aſcribed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as this wholeſom Cuſtom of uſing <hi>Bagnios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only in <hi>Turkey,</hi> but alſo in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> the uſe of <hi>Bagnios</hi> is much eſteemed of; particularly in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Hungary, Germany, Sweedland, Denmark, &amp;c.</hi> where they are in great requeſt.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Bagnios</hi> are thus uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the frequent Sweating in them ſo beneficial; if they are ſo much in requeſt abroad, and found to be of ſuch extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55446:22"/>Advantage to Kingdoms, why ſhould we exclude them? 'Tis matter of great wonder to me, that in this pregnant Age, when almoſt every Art and Science (but more particularly the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Faculty of <hi>Phyſick</hi>) hath been more improved than in ſeveral preceding Generations, and almoſt al ingenuous uſeful Inventions, whether found out in <hi>Europe,</hi> or any other Parts of the World, have been brought into immediate Uſe and Practice, that ſo admirable and Invention, and ſo publicly known in other Parts, was not thought on in <hi>England</hi> till about four Years ago. Certain I am, that if the real Vertues and Benefit of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting <hi>Bagnios</hi> were wel
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55446:23"/>known and believed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 'tis not the <hi>Royal</hi> and the <hi>Duke's Bagnio</hi> would be able to receive the twentieth part of thoſe that would crowd in upon them. But ſuch is the remiſs, careleſs, and negligent Humour of the Inhabitants of theſe Ilands, that they think not of preventing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers til they come upon them, and then they ſmart for't. There is no Part of <hi>Phyſic</hi> ſo much rejected and forgotten, as the <hi>Prophylactic</hi> or <hi>Hygieinal,</hi> which is the Preſervative Part, tho no one Part of <hi>Medicine</hi> ought to be more reſpected. To this very end Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of our Age, hath prompted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55446:23"/>us to this Study, in his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of Natural Philoſophy, Part</hi> 2. <hi>Eſſay</hi> 4. Now that <hi>Bathing</hi> and <hi>Sweating</hi> is uſeful in the <hi>Prophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactic</hi> or Preſervative, as well as in the <hi>Therapeutic</hi> or Healing Part of <hi>Phyſic,</hi> is evidently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough demonſtrable. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tends more to the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Diſtempers, and ſo, <hi>ex conſequenti,</hi> for the preſerving of Health, than the aſſiſting of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in throwing off what is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to her, and incongruous with her Balſamic Crimſon Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and other deputrated Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Pores of the Body, which are the Out-lets of thoſe unwelcome Gueſts, are ſoon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, by the conſtant and ſucceſſive thronging forth of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55446:24"/>
               <hi>Effluviums</hi> by inſenſible Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſome of which are gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or rather crooked, and ſo hang in their very <hi>exit,</hi> by which others are afterwards ſtopt in their paſſage, and ſo in time ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pores of the Body are almoſt quite clogg'd, and Nature many times put to a force to burſt them open: In the mean time ſeveral of theſe pernicious Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, which the Blood would otherwiſe tranſmit thorow thoſe Pores, finding no paſſage into the open Air, at the yet too weak repulſe of Nature, are hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about again by Circulation, and hereby oftentimes ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motions in the Blood cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, by Natures ſtrenuous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to throw them off, by a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55446:24"/>kind of abhorring violence and impetuoſity, that the genuine Ferment, and ſlow and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Motion of the Blood, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to a rapid Motion and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ebullition, and ſo many times fatal and deſtructive Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies are created; all which, by the moderate uſe of <hi>Bagnios,</hi> might be prevented. And this is the reaſon why the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the Natives of other Countries that have the frequent uſe of <hi>Bagnios,</hi> are ſeldom ſick, and live to a prodigious Age, becauſe conſtant Perſpiration being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promoted, the very Seeds of Diſtempers are thruſt out, and the Enemies of Nature quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated; ſo that Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing heterogeneous, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55446:25"/>contrary to the Principles of Life, ſhe performs her proper Functions with the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity to a competent Old age. The Body then reſigns not by being overcome by any Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, but becauſe its Organs are quite worn out and impaired by their long Exerciſe, and ſo unfit and unable for longer Service. We may mention the Uſe of <hi>Bagnios</hi> not only in preventing Diſeaſes, as we have juſt now evinced, but alſo in curing and removing ſome particular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies and Infirmities. What can be preſcribed better for a new-taken Cold, than to ſweat moderately in a well-tempered <hi>Bagnio?</hi> For, as the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſticking Particles of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55446:25"/>Blood do ſometimes hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Paſſage from the Body, and ſo obſtruct the Pores; ſo it is alſo undeniable, that fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorific and cold Particles, which ſwarm and glide about in the fluid Air, eſpecially in Winter, darting upon the Body expoſed to the Air, do often ſtick in the Pores, and ſo hinder Perſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hereby occaſion very bad Effects, and perplexing Symptoms in the Body. Now it is not only highly probable, and eaſie to imagine, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Effect and Product of daily Experience, that theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious cold Particles are ſoon driven away and put to flight by the calorific or hot Particles, of which there are enow floating or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55446:26"/>rather jumping about in <hi>Bagnios.</hi> Cold Particles have likewiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurtful Effects upon the Body, beſides ſecluding the Pores; which is by entring the Body, and mixing themſelves with the Blood, and hereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Coughs, Catarrhs Defluxions, Hoarſneſs, Quinzies, Pleuriſies, Fevers, Rheumatiſms, Pains, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches, Toothaches, Deafneſſes, &amp;c.</hi> All which direful Maladies are prevented, if the Party ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking Cold enter a <hi>Bagnio,</hi> the Heat expelling thoſe Particles which are the Cauſes of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Evils.</p>
            <p>Another Uſe of <hi>Bagnios</hi> may be to recruit the Body after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and weariſom Journey; for if a Perſon coming off ſuch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55446:26"/>a Journey do immediately make uſe of the <hi>Bagnio,</hi> it preſently refreſheth him, prevents, Stiffneſs of the Limbs, and renders him as fit for Buſineſs the next day, as if he had never travelled.</p>
            <p>To what hath been ſaid, I may add, That Sweating is uſeful in Surfeits gotten by Fruits, Meats, Wines, and other Strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; by cauſing the Blood to throw off and ſeparate that which being mixed with it, gave it the Surfeit: For which reaſon it is very proper and benficial for ſuch as drink hard, to make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of <hi>Bagnios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bagnios</hi> are likewiſe many times helpful to ſuch as have <hi>Old Pains</hi> and <hi>Aches,</hi> and alſo newly contracted <hi>Rheumatiſms.</hi>

            <p>Farther we have to add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Benefit of <hi>Bagnios,</hi> That the Friction or Rubbing uſed in them is of extraordinary uſe to Humane Bodies, as wel as the Sweating: For hereby the Circulation of the Blood in the ſmal Capillary Veſſels is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly promoted, and the narrow Ducts and Paſſages in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and ſuperficial and cuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Parts of the Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Blood and other Liquors are often coagulated, or thoſe Veſſels ſtopp'd by other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, are hereby opened; the tender Nervous Fibres are alſo hereby rubb'd up and ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to perform their Exerciſe. So that many and conſiderable are the Advantages of ſo little
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55446:27"/>and unthought-of a thing as <hi>Friction.</hi> And this is not only my bare Opinion, but the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſeveral Learned Authors. <hi>Galen</hi> in ſeveral places of his Works highly commends <hi>Fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> particularly, in <hi>Lib. de Artic. cap.</hi> 81. he ſaith, <hi>Frictiones red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt Fibrarum ſubſtantiam plenio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Carnium vero validiorem; Frictions render the ſubſtance of the Fibres fuller, the Fleſh more firm.</hi> Alſo <hi>Lib. de Offic. cap.</hi> 25. he ſaith, <hi>Frictio moderata nutrit; Moderate Friction nouriſheth.</hi> We have not only the Authority of <hi>Galen</hi> for the abetment of our Aſſertion; but likewiſe ſeveral Modern Authors do teſtifie the ſame.</p>

            <p>You may ſee more among Dr. <hi>Beal</hi>'s Communications con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cure of Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Wens by the Touch of a Dead Man's Hand, and Fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and of ſome that would cauſe Vomiting or Purging by different Stroking, and give eaſe

            <p>'Tis likewiſe credibly report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I am apt to believe it, That Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who lived to a great Age, was a great Admirer of Frictions, and oftentimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his Man to rub him down with a courſe Cloth, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
            <p>It's alſo more than probable, That many great Cures which have been done by ſome Private Perſons, who have been Famous for Stroaking or Rubbing the Parts, and have been thought to have had an Extraordinary or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55446:29"/>Divine Gift or Happineſs, that way, have oftentimes been no other than the natural Effects and Conſequents of <hi>Friction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Famous <hi>Van Helmont</hi> tels us, That he himſelf could by the Milk of an Aſs tel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had been that day di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently Curried or no.

            <p>Thus we have endeavoured to demonſtrate the great Uſe and Benefit of <hi>Bagnios.</hi> Now that this ample and ſpacious Structure of the <hi>Duke's Bagnio</hi> doth not fal ſhort of, but rather exceed moſt of the <hi>Bagnios</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> is the Aſſertion of al Travellers that have yet ſeen it.</p>
            <p>That which next occurs to our Conſideration, is the Uſe and Benefit of <hi>Baths,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of this <hi>New Artificial Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not undeſervedly have <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Baths</hi> been applauded by the moſt Eminent and Learned <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> of many ſucceſſive Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55446:30"/>neither hath the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eſteem of the Vulgar for them, for ſo many paſt Ages, been meerly the Fruits of Fanſie, without Ground or Reaſon, ſince the multitude of Cures that have yearly been effected by the Uſe of them, hath been a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of their great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>Never was the Uſe of <hi>Baths</hi> ſo much in vogue in <hi>Europe</hi> as now. The moſt Renowned, and thoſe that indeed excel al other <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Baths</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Travels.</note> at <hi>Glaſ-Hitten,</hi> an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Mile from <hi>Schemnitz:</hi> There are five very convenient <hi>Baths,</hi> with handſom Deſcents into them, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with large high Roofs.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55446:31"/>Theſe <hi>Baths</hi> are exceedingly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Cures that are done by them. Alſo at <hi>Eiſenbach,</hi> which is four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles from <hi>Glaſ-Hitten,</hi> are two very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious <hi>Hot Baths,</hi> which are very much frequented. Not only in <hi>Hungary,</hi> but likewiſe in <hi>Germany, Natural Baths</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, and much uſed: Particularly thoſe of the famous City of <hi>Aken</hi> are much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> They were found out in the Year of our Lord 53. by one <hi>Granus,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> who adorned them after the manner of the <hi>Roman Baths,</hi> and built a Noble Habitation near them, part of which is ſtil to be ſeen,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55446:31"/>retaining the Name of <hi>Turris Grani.</hi> Hence likewiſe theſe <hi>Thermae</hi> are ſtil called <hi>Aquae Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae.</hi> Within the Wals of this City are three <hi>Baths, viz.</hi> the <hi>Emperour's Bath,</hi> the <hi>Little Bath,</hi> and the <hi>Bath</hi> of <hi>St. Quirinus.</hi> The <hi>Emperour's Bath</hi> was very large, but is now divided by Partitions into ſeveral Bathing-rooms. This is that <hi>Bath</hi> in which <hi>Charles the Great</hi> formerly took ſo much delight, that he ſpent the latter end of his Days here, and would frequently ſwim in it, and invited abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Friends to this <hi>Bath,</hi> ſo that a hundred at once did frequently enter it. There are likewiſe other <hi>Baths</hi> about this City, as the <hi>Bath</hi> of <hi>St. Cornelius,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55446:32"/>the <hi>Roſe-Bath,</hi> ſo called from Mr. <hi>Roſe,</hi> a Citizen, that built it; alſo the <hi>Compus Badt,</hi> or <hi>Poor Mans Bath.</hi> Theſe are eſteemed to be <hi>Sulphureo-Nitrous;</hi> their Smell is offenſive, and Water not tranſparent. About a Furlong from the <hi>South Bath</hi> of <hi>Aken</hi> is a Village called <hi>Borſet,</hi> where there are Twenty eight <hi>Baths,</hi> eath of them holding Fifty Tun of Water, and all of them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auſtria,</hi> at <hi>Baden,</hi> are Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen very ſumptuous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful <hi>Baths,</hi> al of them wel beautified, and much reſorted to.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> alſo make great uſe of <hi>Baths,</hi> as wel as <hi>Bagnios;</hi> and do moſt of any Nation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55446:32"/>beautifie their <hi>Baths,</hi> and always build large <hi>Cupolas</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>We may likewiſe mention the <hi>Hot Waters</hi> at <hi>Bourbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the uſe of which in Bathing, as wel as Drinking, have given ſuch ſatisfaction to the World of their ſingular and admirable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that Perſons from al Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> do throng and flock thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſake of Bathing in them. Thus we ſee how For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Parts prove exemplary to us in the frequent uſe of Bathing.</p>
            <p>'Twil not be amiſs now to mention ſomething concerning the <hi>Natural Baths</hi> in our own Native Country. Thoſe that are moſt known and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are thoſe of <hi>Bathe</hi> in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire,</hi> which were ('tis ſaid)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55446:33"/>found out by one <hi>Bladud,</hi> King of the <hi>Britans,</hi> about 900 Years before <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>Bladud</hi> was ſirnamed <hi>a Magician,</hi> and was counted by the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be a Conjurer, tho al that he did to deſerve that Character, was nothing but the Effects of his Learning and Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Guidot <hi>of</hi> Bath.</note>The <hi>Baths</hi> of <hi>Bathe</hi> are in number chiefly three; the <hi>King's,</hi> the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and the <hi>Hot Bath;</hi> the <hi>Queens</hi> being but an Appendent to the <hi>King's,</hi> as the <hi>Lepers</hi> to the <hi>Hot Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King's Bath</hi> is about 58 Foot long, and 40 Foot broad: The <hi>Queens,</hi> 25 Foot long, and 24 Foot broad: The <hi>Croſs Bath,</hi> 24 Foot long, 19 Foot over Northwards, and 12 Foot over
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55446:33"/>on the South: The <hi>Hot Bath,</hi> 30 Foot long, 13 Foot broad. If we reckon by Gage, we find that the <hi>Kings Bath</hi> contains about 314 Tun of Water; the <hi>Queens</hi> 81 Tun 3 Hogſheads, the <hi>Croſs</hi> 53 Tun, the <hi>Hot</hi> 54 Tun. Theſe <hi>Baths</hi> are much frequented in the Summer; yet not ſo much as they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, if due Obſervation was made, and notice taken of the many Cures are done by them, and the admirable Virtues of them. But for what farther might be mentioned of theſe <hi>Baths,</hi> I refer the Reader to Dr. <hi>Jorden</hi> of <hi>Natural Baths,</hi> and <hi>Guidot</hi>'s Diſcourſe of <hi>Bathe,</hi> and the <hi>Hot Waters</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Another admirable <hi>Bath</hi> in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55446:34"/>
               <hi>England</hi> is the <hi>Sulphur-Bath</hi> at <hi>Knaisbrough</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Virtues of which, as the Cauſes of its Heat, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately diſcuſſed by that Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <hi>Phyſician</hi> Dr. <hi>William Simpſon</hi> (lately deceas'd) in his Diſcourſe of this <hi>Bath,</hi> adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Zymologia Phyſica,</hi> or a <hi>Philoſophic Diſcourſe of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might now be expected we ſhould ſay ſomething of the Cauſes of Heat in the <hi>Hot Baths,</hi> and of the particular Minerals wherewith they are commonly impregnated; but the Largeneſs of that Theme will not agree with the Brevity which we have reſolved to limit our ſelves unto, and therefore I ſhall not enter upon it.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55446:34"/>
            <p>Nor ſhal we launch out to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Virtues of particular <hi>Natural Baths,</hi> but only betake our ſelves to declare the Uſe of this <hi>New Artificial Bath,</hi> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Account of the ſeveral Diſeaſes that it may ſafely and ſucceſsfully be preſcribed for.</p>
            <p>Only let us premiſe thus much, to take off whatſoever prejudice the Reader may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have entertained againſt an <hi>Artificial Bath,</hi> That there can be no Reaſon in the World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, why <hi>Baths</hi> may not by Art be prepared with the ſame <hi>Mineral Ingredients</hi> that the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ones</hi> are impregnated with, which ſhal equal, if not exceed any of them al. The Reaſon may be this, That there are no
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55446:35"/>Metals in the World but by Art may be ſo prepared, as that the prepared Particles of thoſe very Metals may be mixed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo the particular Virtues of thoſe Particles communicated to the Water. Secondly, There are no Saline, Aluminous, or Eſurine Particles in the Body of the Earth, which, impregnating Water, render it able to prey upon and diſſolve the Metals or Mineral Sulphurs there, but what may be obtained or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Art, or ſomething analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to them. Thirdly, There are no <hi>Natural Baths</hi> in the World but have ſome Arſenical, Antimonial, or elſe ſome other unwholeſom offenſive Particles, mixed with the more wholeſom
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55446:35"/>and powerful Principles of it, which render thoſe Waters leſs helpful and effectual in routing thoſe Maladies for which they are preſcribed. But this <hi>Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bath</hi> conſiſts of Principles moſt refined and depurate, and ſo conſequently moſt innocent and effectual: For whatever is poyſonous and pernicious to the Nerves, is abſtracted and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them; but whatever is purely Sulphureous, Balſamic, and agreeable to the Nerves, is added to them. Beſides, our <hi>Bath</hi> is much more convenient than the <hi>Baths</hi> at <hi>Bathe,</hi> it being within-doors, and covered, ſo that Perſons need not fear the bad Effects of being expoſed to the open Air. This likewiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55446:36"/>our <hi>Bath</hi> uſeful in Winter, as well as in Summer. Another Convenience of it is, that it is at <hi>London,</hi> whither the numerous Diſeaſed Perſons, that either have not Money, or Strength to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel down into <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> may here be accommodated with ſmal Charge or trouble, and that altogether to as much purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We ſhal now mention the <hi>particular Diſtempers</hi> in which this <hi>Bath</hi> gives immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: And that which firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, and hardly admits of any Relief from any other Means than <hi>Bathing,</hi> is the <hi>Palſie.</hi> This it doth by opening the Pores of the Body, abſolving the Nerves from their Obſtruents, dinting the Acrimony and Sharpneſs of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55446:36"/>the <hi>Serum,</hi> diſſolving coagulated Blood, and giving Current to that fluid Balſam of Life, and at length reducing the Nervous and Membranous Parts to their due Order and Tone. For the ſame Reaſon this <hi>Bath</hi> is likewiſe very effectual in <hi>Convulſions, Cramps, Epilepſies, Pains, Numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Lameneſs in the Joynts,</hi> and al other Affects of the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſum genus,</hi> which are cauſed by the various Seiſures of pungent, acid Particles upon the Nerves, hereby firſt vitiating the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Juyce, and then cauſing Contorſions in thoſe tender Veſſels, whereby their Tone is altered, contracted, or relaxed. Now as theſe Nervous Maladies are created by the prevailing of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55446:37"/>ſupervening Acids, reſulting from ſome ſpurious inordinate Fermentation upon thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Chords, and ſo cauſing <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Contractions, Relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Coagulations, &amp;c.</hi> ſo, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Cure ſuch Remedies are to be ſought after as may dint, alter, and dulcifie ſuch kind of Acid Particles, and thence may looſen the contracted, ſmooth and make even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, and ſtrengthen the relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nerves; yea, and may every way anſwer the Indications of the depraved Tones of thoſe Animal <hi>Pendulas</hi> or Vital Strings, whereby the impriſoned Spirits may again be ſet free, and al the Animal Functions be reſtored to their priſtine State. Now of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55446:37"/>this ſort is our <hi>New Artificially-prepared Bath,</hi> which by correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Acids, ſupples and ſoftens the contracted, ſtrengthens and binds up the weak, and very much repairs the depraved Tone of the <hi>Genus Nervoſum.</hi> We may alſo add under this Head, the <hi>Stiffneſs of the Limbs and Joynts, Contractions of the Tendinous and Muſculous Parts:</hi> For theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Maladies being cauſed thro ſome rejected Acids, which wanting a due Fermentative mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give them wing by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, are coagulated or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the external Parts: By this <hi>Bath</hi> the Pores being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they diſſolved and put into Motion, are either ſweetned, or carried off.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55446:38"/>
            <p>We may likewiſe here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That this <hi>Bath</hi> may be uſed in <hi>Atrophyes</hi> or <hi>Aridulas, Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of one or more Parts;</hi> for by helping a freſh Fermentation of the Blood, it may force its paſſage into the otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Parts, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come capable of diſtributing an equal Nouriſhment to every Part.</p>
            <p>The next general Diſtemper that this <hi>Bath</hi> is proper for, is the <hi>Gout.</hi> O, what direful Pains, what wracking Dolours do ſome undergo, by means of this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating Malady! How are ſome (otherwiſe ſtout and undaunted Perſons) forced to cringe, ſtoop, and cry out, when this Tyrant begins to teize them? Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55446:38"/>more ſafe and ſpeedy to give eaſe in theſe horrid Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than to enter into this <hi>New Bath:</hi> It immediately dints that Fermental <hi>Acor</hi> impreſt upon the <hi>Synovia</hi> of the Joynts, ſo eaſily communicable to the adjacent Nerves: For this Diſtemper, as wel as the forementioned Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is chiefly determined and ſpecificated by Acid Particles fixt and coagulated upon different Humours and Parts. Now it is the eſſential Efficacy of a ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Sulphur (and ſuch is the chief Principle of our <hi>Bath</hi>) to dint Acids, and to reſolve ſuch as are coagulated; ſo that by the Uſe of this <hi>Bath</hi> I doubt not but Perſons will find ſo much Alleviation of theſe previous
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55446:39"/>Symptoms, and ſuch a Mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Severity of a future Fit, as that it wil ſoon need no Pen to commend it, or Tongue to aſſert its Uſefulneſs. Under this Head may be added, <hi>Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms, Sciaticas, Old Pains</hi> and <hi>Aches, Strains,</hi> and other Griefs, here too tedious to relate; all which Affects may be removed, or at leaſt in a great meaſure leſſened, by the uſe of this <hi>Bath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next grand Malady for which the frequent uſe of <hi>Baths</hi> is proper, is a <hi>Scorbutic Laſſitude, Debility, Sloth of Limbs, Drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Obtuſeneſs of the Internal Senſes,</hi> and other liminary Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of the <hi>Scurvy.</hi> Moſt of the Affects which are the Buds of that reigning Malady the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55446:39"/>
               <hi>Scurvy,</hi> do depend on the Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the Animal Spirits, not being potent enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Offices with alacrity, to which their accuſtomed juſt Temperament is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. Now by moderate Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the Animal Spirits are quickned, the Nerves cheriſhed, and all Obſtructions and Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras to their ſpritely Motion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and ſo theſe unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com Symptoms quite removed. The Blood and Humours are likewiſe hereby purified: and ſo the <hi>Bath</hi> becomes alſo uſeful in other Symptoms of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> as <hi>Spots, Blotches, Elephantiaſis,</hi> and other Scorbutic Impurities of the Blood: For by Bathing in this <hi>Bath</hi> there are procured
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55446:40"/>moſt excellent moderate Sweats, whereby the impure Acid Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (which are precipitated or cut off from the Blood in its Circulation, and topically fixt upon this or the other external Part) are looſened, diſſolved, or mortified.</p>
            <p>The next General Uſe of this <hi>Bath</hi> which we deſign to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is for Womens Diſtempers; particularly, <hi>Barrenneſs, Proneneſs to Miſcarry and not retain; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Womb, Obſtructions of the Natural Courſes;</hi> al which Diſtempers this <hi>Bath</hi> is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for: But for Modeſty ſake, being unwilling to diſguſt the Ladies, we ſhal omit inſiſting on them; tho we reſolved to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, that they might not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55446:40"/>plead Ignorance in the great Virtue and Efficacy of our <hi>Bath</hi> in this Particular.</p>
            <p>Another admirable Effect of this <hi>Bath</hi> is to Cure the <hi>Rickets</hi> in Children; for which purpoſe we have ordered, that One whole Day every Week the <hi>Bath</hi> be wholly employ'd for Children, admitting no other Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it on thoſe Days. Beſides, on thoſe Days we appropriate our <hi>Bath</hi> for that Diſtemper, by ſomewhat altering the Mineral Principles of it from thoſe which impregnate it on other Days. Becauſe Bathing may at firſt ſeem ſomething uncouth for this Diſtemper, it being unuſual, and ſeldom preſcribed, let us a little inquire into the Nature and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55446:41"/>Cauſe of this Diſtemper, and conſider whether Bathing may not then ſeem the moſt Rational and Probable Remedy that can be preſcribed for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rickets</hi> is a Diſtemper which hath been known but a few Years in the World; and the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Gliſſon de Rachitide.</note> firſt Place that it was taken notice of was in <hi>England,</hi> about Fifty odd Years ago. It firſt appeared in <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by little and little it came to be minded at <hi>London;</hi> and ſtil in the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England</hi> it is not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and in ſome places hardly known.</p>
            <p>'Tis uncertain who was the firſt Perſon that took notice of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55446:41"/>this Malady, who gave it that Name, and for what Reaſon: The moſt probable Etymology or Derivation of the Word is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Morbus Spinae dorſi,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spine</hi> or Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone is the Part primarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in this Diſtemper. The Spinal Marrow being firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, its Tone vitiated, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity and Relaxation cauſed, the adjoyning Nerves do al by conſent likewiſe ſuffer, and alſo al the Membranous and Fibrous Parts, to which thoſe Nerves are faſtned; hence Impotence, want of Motion, Torpitude, Dulneſs, and Imbecillity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the firſt Symptoms of it, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Diſtemper to be creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55446:42"/>on, which in a little time renders the whole Habit of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy feeble, the Tone of the Parts relaxed, flaccid, ſoft, and lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous; whence ſucceeds ſuch an internal Slipperineſs in al the Parts, that they are quite deſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of their Faculty of Retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſo Aſſimulating that Nouriſhment which Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys to them: Hence an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Diſtribution and Retention of Nutriment doth proceed, whereby one Part becomes leſs, another bigger, than in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ought to be: for ſome Parts are much emaciated and extenuated, as the Legs, Thighs, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other Parts are ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as the Head and Liver. There are likewiſe in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55446:42"/>for the ſame Reaſon, ſeveral Protuberancse of the Bones, particularly at the Wriſts, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Extremities of the Ribs. There is likewiſe, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Symptom attending this Diſeaſe, a Sharpneſs and Strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the Breaſt. We may likewiſe add, that ſeveral Bones are ſometimes inflected or bent, as the Bones of the Legs and Thighs, Arms and Shoulders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which Symptoms, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others which might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if not removed by Art, do tend very much to the future Prejudice of Children. How many crooked-boned, Bandy-legg'd, Strait-breaſted, Jolt-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Wry-back'd, Weak, Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Perſons do we daily ſee? The
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55446:43"/>Original of all which Infirmities may be attributed in a great meaſure to the Relicts of the <hi>Rickets,</hi> with which they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they were young. Now of Al the Remedies that ever were yet invented for this Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there's none like that of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> Therefore to prevent the Injury that Children would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe neceſſarily receive by this Diſeaſe, we have ordered a particular appropriated <hi>Bath</hi> to be made every <hi>Saturday,</hi> for ſuch as are afflicted with it; by the uſe of which the vitiated Tone of the Parts is rectified, the Parts themſelves comforted and ſtrengthened, equal Diſtribution of Nouriſhment promoted, and the Cauſes of the former inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55446:43"/>of Nutrition and Extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on removed; and, in fine, the whole Habit of Body in thoſe tender Punies reduced to its due Eutaxy and regular Diſpoſition: So that among all the Remedies that have hitherto been in vogue for Curing the <hi>Rickets,</hi> as <hi>Scarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Ears, Iſſues, Leech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Cupping-glaſſes, Bliſters, Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Rollings, Strait Stockins, Cliſters, Purges, Vomits, Specific Powders, Syrups</hi> or <hi>Electuaries, Oyntments, &amp;c.</hi> none can be ſafer and more effectual than Bathing in this appropriated <hi>Bath;</hi> for by the uſe of it this Diſtemper is prevented where there is fear or danger of it; its Progreſs is ſtopt where it is begun, and al its Symptoms in a ſhort time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55446:44"/>where it hath arrived to an Increment and conſiderable State. The Certainty of al which, and much more than I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, wil appear to ſuch as ſhal hereafter uſe it.</p>
            <p>Another very afflicting and ſomewhat ſpreading Malady, to the Cure of which <hi>Bathing</hi> may much contribute, is the <hi>Dropſie;</hi> and that becauſe it is found by experience, that Bathing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes both Urine and Sweat: For a Man ſhal ſcarce wel get out of the <hi>Bath,</hi> but he ſhal be inclinable to make Water; and then Sweat doth in ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable meaſure ſucceed, which if promoted by ſome inward <hi>Diaphoretic,</hi> wil help notably to tranſpire the ſuperfluous <hi>Serum</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:55446:44"/>or Water in the Blood, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that ſort of <hi>Dropſie</hi> which is called <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> where the Blood is too much diluted, and the <hi>Limphaducts</hi> obſtructed in the Habit of the Body: So that two grand Symptoms or Effects of a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> and perhaps a third, are hereby removed, <hi>viz. Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or Difficulty of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Pores,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Ferments in their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Functions.</hi> For hereby the Reins, Ureters, and <hi>Sphinctor</hi> of the Bladder are reminded of their Duty, the Pores of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are opened, the inward and outward Parts rendred Perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Digeſtive Ferments fortified: So that tho the uſe of this <hi>Bath</hi> it ſelf, without concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55446:45"/>Means, is not ſufficient to Cure a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> yet if <hi>Bathing</hi> be joyned with other Remedies, it will certainly prove very uſeful and beneficial.</p>
            <p>We may here likewiſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another great Convenience of it, which is, That it is very uſeful for. Corpulent Perſons, for groſs and fat Bodies: For by opening the Pores, and exciting a new and brisk Ferment in the Blood, it aſſiſts Nature to emit the ſuperfluous Unctuous Parts of the Blood; it likewiſe waſtes and cauſeth to exhale that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hath already been ſetled into Fat: Thus Fat and Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſons may in a little time be eaſed (at leaſt in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) of that heavy Burden
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55446:45"/>which they generally complain of. Nor doth this <hi>Bath</hi> make Lean Perſons become Leaner, for the ſame Reaſon that it makes Fat Perſons Lean; becauſe in Lean Bodies there is none of that ſuperfluous and Unctuous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it meets with in groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Bodies; but in Lean Bodies it plumps and corroborates the Fibres of the Muſcles.</p>
            <p>We ſhal in the next place add, That this <hi>Bath</hi> may with very good Succeſs by uſed to give preſent Eaſe in the Fits of the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gravel;</hi> for by a kind of an <hi>Anodyne</hi> Vertue it obtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the acute Senſation of thoſe Nervous and Membranous Parts which ſuffer in this Diſtemper: It likewiſe cauſeth a propenſion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55446:46"/>to make Water, and ſo either expels the Gravel or Stone if it be ſmal, or elſe if it be too big to force its <hi>exit</hi> thro the <hi>Meatus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinarius,</hi> or Urinary Paſſage, it often cauſeth a Removal of it from the top of that Paſſage, and ſo preſent Eaſe enſues. But we ſhal not inſiſt farther on this Head, our <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> the Vertues of which we ſhal hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relate, being of exceeding Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in this wracking Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing I purpoſe to mention in Commendation of this <hi>Bath,</hi> is, That it Beautifies the Skin, tho ſome <hi>Natural Baths</hi> make it more Tawny and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom: To which end I can commend it to Ladies, to ſmooth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55446:46"/>and whiten their Skin, increaſe its Plumpneſs and Luſtre, and preſerve the Body in a good Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and Diſpoſition: It takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Wrinkles and Shrivellings in the Skin, and is very uſeful to take away Chaps in Womens Breaſts and Bellies after Lying-in: It fetcheth off Spots, and other Cutaneous Deformities: It alſo waſheth from the Body that Scurf and Dirt which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to it, ſo that the uſe of it is very neat and cleanly: It takes off that yellow and unhandſom Colour of the Skin which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the <hi>Yellow Jaundies</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Cauſe is removed.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, beſides the great Pleaſure of Bathing and Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body, are al I deſign at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55446:47"/>preſent to mention concerning the great Uſefulneſs and Vertue of this <hi>New Mineral Bath:</hi> of which much more might be ſaid, but, for brevity ſake, let what hath been here conciſely related ſuffice til a future Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and more apparent Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of its real Benefit, do preſent themſelves. We ſhal therefore now proceed to give an Account of the Nature and Virtues of the <hi>New Spaw,</hi> or <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters</hi> deſigned for Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Having made it part of my Study to dive into the Nature of <hi>Waters,</hi> I muſt declare my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be, That <hi>Mineral Waters</hi> are not only of great uſe in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,</hi> and retain in them very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55446:47"/>Vertues; but alſo, that no other ſort of <hi>Medicines,</hi> let them be made up in what Form ſoever, have that Energy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Blood to its priſtine Eucraſie, the whole Body to a ſound <hi>Diatheſis,</hi> and routing the <hi>Mineras</hi> and Seminalities of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as <hi>wholſom Medicinal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Of the Truth of which Opinion, not only I my ſelf am fully ſatisfied and perſwaded, but alſo the whole <hi>European</hi> World becomes every day more and more convinced. How many thouſand Cures have been performed in this ſmall Iland, within few Years? What flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are there every Summer to <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> where the beſt <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are? How
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55446:48"/>is <hi>Epſom, Northaw, Scarborough, Knaisborough, &amp;c.</hi> yearly frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Not only in our own Country, but in other Parts of <hi>Europe, Mineral Waters</hi> are much in vogue, eſpecially in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> How are the Wels at <hi>Burbon</hi> crowded in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> by Perſons of ſeveral Nations? And what a Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tongues is there every Summer at the <hi>Spaws</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> This being my firſt <hi>Theſis, That Medicinal Waters are of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable uſe and efficacy both in Preſerving and Reſtoring the Health of Man:</hi> My next <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, <hi>That there is no Mineral Water that is naturally made in the Bowels of the Earth, but may be likewiſe prepared exactly by a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55446:48"/>skilful Hydrotomiſt:</hi> For al ſuch Waters are made by a Mixture of ſuch Mineral Particles with their Bodies as they have waſht off from the Mines or Metals by which they paſs. Thus if a Current of pure Elementary Water fal upon an Allum-Mine, it is immediately impregnated with an Eſurine Quality; whence paſſing on, it may probably meet with an Iron Bed: here by the Eſurine Quality which it before acquired, it gnaws and erodes that Mineral, receiving ſeveral of its finer Particles into ſuch Pores or ſmal Cavities in its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as thoſe Particles are adapted for by their Figures; and thus it becomes a very wholeſom <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino-Chalybeat</hi> Water: And of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55446:49"/>this Nature are the <hi>Spaws</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> So likewiſe a Current of Water within the Caverns of the Earth gliding thorow the <hi>Marcaſites</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in ſome Countries, and the Nitrous Glebes wherewith ſome Lands are ſaturated licking up the Saline Particles of thoſe Bodies, and then meeting with a Sulphur-Bed, there is inſtantly an Efferveſcence and Ebullition cauſed by the ſtrenuous Conflict between the Acid and Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles; a notable Fervour preſently ariſes, and a Heat hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be endured by the Hand; which Waters afterwards break forth in Hot Springs: Thus the Waters of <hi>Burbon</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are made. I might inſtance in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55446:49"/>other Springs, but I aim at Brevity. Now al that is thus ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Nature, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Art, by a Perſon wel ſtudied in the Nature and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Mineral Waters; ſuch curious Preparations may by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be made, as may by their ſolution in pure Fountain-water enrich it with the excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of <hi>Natural Spaws.</hi> For my own particular, having pried and been more than ordinarily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and inquiſitive in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of <hi>Spaws</hi> and <hi>Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> I dare ſay ſo much in my own behalf, that I never went about to imitate any particular Water, but in the end I exactly effected it. Further, to pleaſure any Perſon of Quality, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55446:50"/>Friends, that are deſirous to drink the <hi>Burbon,</hi> or <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters of <hi>Germany,</hi> I do here offer to make either of them, ſo exactly, that thoſe Perſons that frequently have drunk them, or the greateſt <hi>Hydrotomiſt</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the Study of Waters, ſhal not be able to diſtinguiſh them from the Natural Waters, either by Taſte, Smel, Colour, Operation, and Virtues, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Experiments he ſhal make to try them.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: Another <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> that I would lay down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to relate the Virtues of our <hi>Spaw,</hi> is, <hi>That a Mineral Water may be prepared by Art, much purer, wholeſomer, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in anſwering the Indications
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55446:50"/>they are preſcribed for, than any Natural Waters can be.</hi> My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this Aſſertion is, That <hi>Natural Medicinal Springs</hi> being the Products of <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency</hi> (not to detract from the Providence of the Infinitely-wiſe Creator) muſt needs receive many unwholeſom male-figur'd Particles with their other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Thoſe Springs being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually made, have no intrinſic Ferments in them, that wil throw off the Arſenical Particles which they have accidentally devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to which no Poyſon can be compared for Miſchief; they have no Streiners to ſecern them from the impure Mixtures; no Preparations made by the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bics in the Earth, that wil preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55446:51"/>the Mercurial Corpuſcles; nor any Expedients to diſſipate the deadly Fumes or noxious <hi>Aporrhea</hi> they have received. I wil not maintain, That al Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Springs have in them Arſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Mercurial Particles; but this I dare be bold to affirm, That many Waters in <hi>Europe,</hi> that are frequently drank of, do retain in them ſome of either of theſe Particles, tho in a ſmal quantity; and likewiſe, That there are no Natural Waters, that are impregnated with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principles, but have likewiſe in them ſome very impure Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: But now ſuch Waters may Artificially be made, as ſhal be altogether pure, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with nothing but the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55446:51"/>moſt refined and wholeſom Particles of thoſe Minerals from which they receive their Virtues; which pure Principles and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preparation are divorced and ſeparated by Art and Labour from the groſs Recrements and impure <hi>Sordes</hi> that accompany al thoſe Metals out of which the Natural Springs extract their Medicinal Qualities. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Waters thus diligently prepared, muſt needs excel the Effects and Products of meer Chance and Caſualty, and prove more innocent, wholeſom, and effectual.</p>
            <p>Being fully convinced of the Verity of this my laſt Aſſertion, by conſidering the Reaſons I have here mentioned, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55446:52"/>to make a Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhould recede in Virtue to no other, either Natural or Artificial; and therefore I ſet about the Work with as much Care and Diligence, as Pleaſure and Curioſity; and at laſt, by diſſecting ſome of the moſt wholeſom Minerals by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Fire, have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht my expected and deſired End, and obtained ſo admirable a Water, that I really think that al the Countries in <hi>Europe</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce a Natural Water equal to it. I do not ſay but <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> by taking the ſame Pains that I have done, may in time effect the ſame; but that this Water, or any thing like it in Vertue, was ever yet made, I dare confidently deny.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55446:52"/>
            <p>Now 'tis by the Perſwaſions of two or three Perſons of great Quality, as wel as my own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and Inclination to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my Country, and add any thing to the promotion of Health, or Improvement of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,</hi> that I am induced to make public theſe Excellent Waters; not doubting but the general Benefit that wil be received by them, by al that drink them, wil Quickly give an univerſal Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Waters,</hi> with al <hi>Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> being now almoſt ready for <hi>Public Drinking,</hi> we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the Name of the <hi>New Spaw;</hi> the particular Virtues of which we ſhal juſt mention, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no other Judge of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55446:53"/>of what we have or ſhal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm concerning them, than Common Experience.</p>
            <p>The Chief Virtue of theſe Waters conſiſts in their Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Quality; for they work po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently by Urine. To ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they give a Stool or two, eſpecially if they drink them quick: They make the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments very black, and the Urine pale: They dilute the Blood, and diſſolve thoſe Salts that are fixt upon the Nerves, or other Parts, cauſing acute Pains, and other Maladies, and force them out of the Blood thorow the Reins and Bladder: So that the particular Diſtempers they are proper to be preſcribed in, are theſe.</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55446:53"/>
            <p n="1">1. They are very ſafely and ſucceſsfully drank by <hi>Scorbutic</hi> Perſons; tho indeed the Word <hi>Scurvy</hi> is grown ſo general a Term in <hi>Phyſic,</hi> that ſome Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners, whatever Symptoms their Patients labour under, when they are any way doubtful of the Diſtemper, immediately term it the <hi>Scurvy:</hi> whereupon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of late have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Opinions to be, That there is no ſuch Diſtemper in Nature as the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and that the Notion of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> is a meer Impoſition upon the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Men: Yet I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, and that for ſeveral weighty and convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there is ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper as the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> which ſome
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55446:54"/>cal the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> others the <hi>Scorby,</hi> and the <hi>Scorbute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twould not only be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to enter upon explaining the Cauſes of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> but likewiſe needleſs, it being ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately done by Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Scorbuto,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by Dr. <hi>Gideon Harvey,</hi> in his <hi>New Diſcovery of the Scurvy,</hi> to which I refer the Reader. We ſhal therefore only reckon up ſome of the chief Symptoms and Effects of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> for which theſe Waters may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully be taken. The <hi>Scurvy,</hi> for the moſt part, appears in the Gums and Teeth; the Gums are ſwelled, ſpongy, diſcoloured, and ſore; the Teeth become looſe, and in proceſs of time they do
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55446:54"/>inevitably rot and caviate; and a Stinking Breath doth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly render the Diſeaſe very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious. The Gums wil bleed at the leaſt touch, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome Scorbutic Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can hardly bite a piece of Bread, but the Remainder in their Hands wil appear Bloody. Hereupon the Gums ſometimes fiſſure or cleave, and afterwards become Ulcerous; which little Ulcers are many times ſucceeded by malignant Cancerous Ulcers, threatning Deformity to the circumjacent Parts. Another grand Symptom of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> is <hi>Weakneſs and Laſſitude in the Limbs,</hi> eſpecially about the Knees and Ancles, which is attended with Shortneſs of Breath, great
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55446:55"/>Faintneſs and Wearineſs upon the leaſt Exerciſe: Sometimes there is an univerſal Soreneſs of the Limbs, eſpecially the Arms, Shoulders, Neck-bones, and Back, and no diſpoſition to ſtir or move, but a Heavineſs and Drowſineſs poſſeſſeth the Body, eſpecially upon the leaſt alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Weather.</p>
            <p>Another Concomitant of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> is <hi>Pains in the Joynts,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Tortures in the Wriſts, Knuckles, Elbows, Shoulders, Hips, Knees, Ancles, Toes, and Fingers; and that which is worſt of al, miſerable Pains about the Neck and Back-bone, ſhooting and darting Pains in the Head.</p>

            <p>Theſe being the Chief Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of this Epidemic Diſeaſe in <hi>England,</hi> nothing can be more proper or more effectual in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them, than our <hi>New Spaw Waters:</hi> In confirmation of which, I do aſſure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that I have frequently preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed not only theſe Waters Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55446:56"/>prepared, but likewiſe the very Principles of which they are made, to ſeveral Perſons in this City, with great Succeſs, for this very Diſtemper. By theſe Waters the Scorbutic Impurity of the Blood is waſhed away, and the whole Maſs of Blood purified, the exalted ſalt, acid, and ſaponary Quality of the Blood removed, the Habit of the Body rectified, the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons altered, the vitiated Tone of the Parts reduced: ſo that by drinking of this Water every Morning, for ſome conſiderable time, al the mentioned trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Symptoms are made to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and diſappear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next Diſeaſe theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are uſeful in, is the <hi>Stone</hi> and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55446:57"/>
               <hi>Strangury.</hi> I wil not pretend that theſe Waters wil diſſolve or break the Stone in the Reins or Bladder, for no Waters in the World can effect that: But yet theſe Waters are certainly as helpful in this Diſtemper, as any Waters in <hi>Europe;</hi> for by ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gliding thorow the Reins and Bladder, the Places where Gravel and the Stone have their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, by the abſterſive quality of their eſurine Salt they hinder the Increaſe or Growth of the Stone, by carrying away the recremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Sordes</hi> that would otherwiſe adhere to the Stone, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its Bulk; and likewiſe by their weight they keep the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents open, dilate the Paſſages, and take the opportunity of ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55446:57"/>a Stone now and then, with a ſtream of water, thorow the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder.</p>
            <p>Not undeſervedly are the <hi>Spaws</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> much reſorted to upon this account, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Benefit and Relief found by ſuch as drink them. Now there is nothing in theſe Waters, that ericheth them with theſe excellent Qualities, but it likewiſe impregnates our Waters: Why therefore ſhould not our Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are more refined and exactly prepared, be endowed with as great <hi>Lithontriptic</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as the <hi>Spaw-waters</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis certain, that ſome Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-waters, by being drank, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and cauſe the Stone, as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55446:58"/>Dr. <hi>Tonſtal</hi> in his <hi>Anatomy of Scarborough-Spaw</hi> proveth, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral undeniable Arguments; and relates ſeveral Stories and Obſervations concerning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who never were troubled with this Diſtemper in their Lives, yet upon drinking thoſe Waters for other Diſtempers, have afterward been tormented with direful Pains of the Stone. And Dr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> in his <hi>Hydrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Eſſays,</hi> preſcribeth a Method to correct the Petrifying Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe Waters. And it's my Opinion, That there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few <hi>Natural Medicinal Waters,</hi> but among their Mineral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Recrements that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in them, there are ſeveral Lapidific and Petrifying Particles.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55446:58"/>But theſe Waters are free from al ſuch kind of Sabulous Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Third Malady that may be helped by theſe Waters, is the <hi>Dropſie:</hi> For by theſe Waters the main Cauſe of a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> which is an <hi>Obſtruction of the Reins,</hi> is removed: The Eſurine Salt, which is a Solvent in theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, diſſolves the coagulated Matter in the Reins, and makes free paſſage both for it ſelf, and for the <hi>exit</hi> of the reſtagnating Water which before floated in the <hi>Abdomen</hi> and Legs, and ſo cauſed that Swelling in them. In the <hi>Dropſie</hi> likewiſe there is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated Ferment in the Stomach, and an aduſt <hi>Sordes</hi> impacted in the Tunicles thereof; whence a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55446:59"/>Feveriſh and preſſing Thirſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attends Dropſical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Now this Water doth cleanſe the Stomach, it looſeneth and diſſolveth the <hi>Sordes</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and ſo carrieth it off.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contradictory and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that <hi>Dropſies</hi> are to be helped by <hi>Waters,</hi> becauſe the Blood in this Diſeaſe is too much diluted already: But if we conſider how theſe Waters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Cauſe of this Malady, the ſtrangeneſs wil be taken away. Beſides, when Dropſical Perſons deſire theſe Waters, we can, by adding to them ſome Preparations of the Mineral Principles of them, make them much ſtronger; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55446:59"/>a ſmaller quantity of them may be more potent than a much greater, and ſo this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection quite removed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Yellow Jaundice</hi> is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by theſe Waters: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Obſtructions in the Bilary Ducts are opened, the regular and genuine Motion of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler promoted, and the Blood cleanſed from that Yellow Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which before was mixed with it, and hurried about thorow the Veins and Arteries by the Circulation, whence the ultmate Fibres and cutaneous Parts are at laſt diſcoloured by it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe Waters may be drank with admirable Succeſs in <hi>Hypochondriac Melancholy,</hi> and Affects of the <hi>Spleen.</hi> The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55446:60"/>and Nature of this Diſtemper I have related in a little Tract which I publiſhed ſeveral Years ago, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>A Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic Diſcourſe concerning Man;</hi> which the Reader may peruſe at his leiſure.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In al manner of Uterine Affects or Diſeaſes of the <hi>Womb,</hi> theſe Waters may be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. I ſhal not diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hyſteric Paſſions,</hi> or <hi>Fits of the Mother,</hi> proceed from the Womb, as <hi>Sennertus, Riverius,</hi> and other famous Authors tel us; or from the Exploſion of the Animal Spirits in the Nerves, as the Renowned <hi>Willis</hi> wil have it; or elſe from the more than ordinary Efferveſcence or Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the thinner and more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55446:60"/>flatulent Blood in the Heart and Lungs, as Dr. <hi>Highmore</hi> aſſerts; whence (he ſaith) the Heart and the Pneumatic Veſſels are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and ſtraitned, difficulty of Breathing cauſed, and a kind of Riſing in the Throat. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the primary and original Cauſe of it is, we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that by theſe Waters it may be removed. They are likewiſe proper in al thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers peculiar to Women, as <hi>Obſtructions of the Courſes, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Fluxes, Whites, Suffocations of the Womb,</hi> the raging and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled <hi>Furor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lterinus, Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Womb, Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Nothing more proper and beneficial in great <hi>Surfeits,</hi> than
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55446:61"/>to dilute the Blood, and ſeparate from it thoſe impure Mixtures wherewith 'twas ſurfeited, by drinking of theſe wholeſom Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Waters.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the beginning of a <hi>Hectic,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the Cauſe of a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> in a Diſcourſe of that <hi>Diſtemper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which I lately publiſhed.</note> and a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a <hi>Conſumption,</hi> nothing can be ſafer than theſe Waters. Where a <hi>Conſumption</hi> is feared, and the Body inclinable to it, theſe Waters, if drank in a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity every day, for ſome Weeks, wil in al probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity prevent it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In a <hi>Cachexy,</hi> or il Habit of Body proceeding from undue and depraved Concoctions, theſe Waters are certainly effectual: For by being often drank, they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55446:61"/>aſſiſt Concoction, by taking away what was injurious to it; and whet the Appetite, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the vitiated Acid in the Stomach; purifie the Blood, by ſeparating from it what is hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogenious, and leaving ſome of its wholeſom Particles with it; and ſo in a ſhort time the whole Body is reduced to a regular <hi>Craſis</hi> and <hi>Eutaxy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We might here add ſeveral other Maladies for which theſe Waters are of great uſe and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; as, <hi>Preternatural Vomitings, Pains at the Stomach, Heats of the Liver and Bowels, Thirſt and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Taſtes in the Mouth, Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Meſentery and other Bowels, Sarpneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of making Water, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers of

               </note> as a very late Author writeth in praiſe of the <hi>Spaw-waters</hi> in <hi>Germany;Non arbitror omnes Medicos tam Antiquos quam Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernos ullum unquam remedium adinveniſſe adeo proficium adeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que amicum humanae naturae, quod uno eodemque tempore purgat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terget, temper at &amp; corrobor at omnia viſcera, &amp; tot tamque diverſis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis

That no Form of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines do in any reſpect equal that of <hi>Mineral Water.</hi> Much more might be ſaid in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of theſe Waters; but I have already exceeded my limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bounds.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55446:63"/>
            <p>Theſe Waters may be drank from One Quart to Two and Three in a Morning: The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that drinks them is to uſe moderate Exerciſe, as Walking, Playing at Bowls, Ninepins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after them: About two Hours after he may drink a Glaſs of Wine, which wil help their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: He muſt not eat til two or three Hours after he hath drank them, nor uſe any violent Motion. He muſt uſe a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diet during the whole time of his drinking them, not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Stomach with too much or too great Variety of Food: His conſtant Drink is to be clear, freſh, and not too ſtrong; neither new, nor too ſtale. He may now and then
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55446:63"/>reſt a day or two, and then drink again. It's convenient to purge gently, after he hath drank them a fortnight or three weeks. Such as pleaſe may have them made ſtronger, by adding ſome of the Eſſence of theſe Waters to them, and ſo may drink them in leſſer Quantities.</p>
            <p>What I have farther to add concerning theſe Waters, I ſhal reſerve til a Treatiſe of <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that may be made upon the <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Spaw,</hi> which we hope to finiſh by next Summer, ſhal be publiſhed.</p>
