         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the twelfth preſent,
which I ſent by Ship;
and fearing leaſt that
may be long before it
come to your hands, I thought fit to
write unto you now by Poſt; and it
is to adviſe you, that there come
hither frequently good and luſty
ſhips from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which are ſent
hither by the Merchants of that
Town, for the ſervice of the Queen:
And there is continuall tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of great ſtore of Men, Money, and
<pb facs="tcp:57192:3"/>
Ammunition, over in them. There
came hither about 14 daies ſince M.
<hi>Knolls,</hi> and that arch K. Capt. <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald,</hi>
who is very diligent &amp; notorious
in his ſervice, for the betraying of his
Countrey, and for that hath of late
had that honour conferred upon him
to be made a Captaine, and is about
three daies ſince gon from hence with
his ſhip laden with Men, Money, and
Ammunition for <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> I heare
that M. <hi>Knolls</hi> brought over Letters
from his Majeſty, that hath been the
occaſion of the Queens ſtay here,
which all that be well affected are
very ſorry for; who had rather ſhe
were elſewhere. Upon the receipt of
which Letters from His Majeſty, I
heare that the Queen the next day
ſent M. <hi>Jermin</hi> to the States Generall,
to acquaint them therewith, and that
<pb facs="tcp:57192:3"/>
His Majeſty adviſed the Queen to
ſtay here for ſome time longer; and
that, becauſe His Majeſty was upon
a treaty of Accommodation, and
doubted not but that in ſhort time he
ſhould make all things well; and that
therefore the Queen gave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thanks
for thoſe Ships that had a long time
waited upon her ſervice, and deſired
that they might now be diſcharged,
which was done accordingly; yet
notwithſtanding Her Majeſties A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
labour here exceedingly in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
away Men, Money, Horſe and
Ammunition unto <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> for the
advancing of Her Majeſties Army in
thoſe parts. Upon thurſday laſt I was
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and there ſaw Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Standard, which was juſt then
going away, to be ſent for <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi>
&amp; yeſterday was ſeven-night, I heard

went to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to take ſhip
there, to go for <hi>England</hi> with all ſpeed,
and it is thought for <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> and
that Col. <hi>Goring</hi> is to be Lord General
of the Kings Horſe. I heare likewiſe
that there is more going away from
thence to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> 400 Officers and
old Souldiers, and 400 Horſe, and
1000 more are to follow, which are
Her Maieſties Regiment, and ſhould
have been a Guard to Her perſon if
ſhe had gon on. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
I heare ſuffers all his Officers to goe,
that will, onely under this colour,
that as many as goe hence, ſhall be
conſtrained; although he can give
them greater honour as he pleaſeth,
and they expect, for ſo good ſervice,
<pb facs="tcp:57192:4"/>
if they do return. It is very credibly
reported here, that there is now ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
away with all ſpeed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi>
160000 pound ſterling, which
I am very credibly informed by
ſome Dutch-men, is by way of
loane raiſed by the Papiſts in theſe
parts (which are not few) for the
Queen. And that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
is engaged for the payment of it,
which are moſt horrible things.
Therefore I can do no leſſe in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
