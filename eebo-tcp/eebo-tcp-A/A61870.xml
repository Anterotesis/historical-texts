            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a right foundation,</hi> and <hi>holding either no errours,</hi> or <hi>such as do not overthrow the fundamentals</hi>; but <hi>in resorting to the same Church assemblies,</hi> and <hi>celebrating devoutly the same offices,</hi> or <hi>Prayers, Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi>: and this is to be done <hi>interchangeably,</hi> so that <hi>each</hi> (upon occasion) resort unto the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> &amp; joyn in the celebration of the same <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies</hi> or <hi>publike</hi> prayers, &amp; participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which is more <hi>particularly</hi> termed the <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this was the Doctrine of <hi>Thomas Waldensis,</hi> and some other <hi>Scholmen,</hi> &amp;c. An opinion this is which though not <hi>commonly</hi> received, yet I do not (saith <hi>S.

of a <hi>Generall Council,</hi> till the whole body of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican Clergy</hi> had by a speciall agreement consented to them, and so proposed them to the severall Churches there. And to this last opinion doth <hi>S.

—He denies that <hi>Generall Councils</hi> can make <hi>new articles of faith</hi>: they are <hi>witnesses of what hath been delivered,</hi> not <hi>Sovereigns</hi> to determine of <hi>new truths,</hi> either by way of <hi>addition to</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> or in <hi>opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi> Their <hi>Infallibility</hi> is limited to <hi>Tradition,</hi> and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally assisted in the <hi>faithfull reporting</hi> of what hath <hi>been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>: what ever <hi>reports</hi> or <hi>decrees</hi> they make of <hi>another nature,</hi> they are to be received with a <hi>different assent</hi> from what is <hi>Catholique faith.</hi>

As to the subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Infallibility</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> is to be placed; since <hi>Catholiques</hi> vary as to that point, he sayes 'tis evident <hi>thereby</hi> that they are not <hi>obliged</hi> to any one part of the Question: only they are to agree in this <hi>Tridentine</hi> decision<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The first part of the <hi>Proposition</hi> is false, and notoriously contradicts the doctrine of the <hi>Thirty-nine Articles,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For although it be granted that even <hi>those Articles,</hi> the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and our <hi>Writers</hi> (and I my self) do bestow vulgarly the appellation of a <hi>Church,</hi> yet is that an <hi>impropriety of speech,</hi> and not to be <hi>justified otherwise</hi> then by professing, that when the name of <hi>Church</hi> is attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93330:15"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the predication is equivocal; since that the definition of a <hi>true Christian Church,</hi> which makes up the <hi>Ninteenth Article,</hi> cannot be accommodated to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>: viz <hi>The visible Church of Christ is a Congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duely ministred, according to Christ</hi>'s <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.</hi> This <hi>Definition</hi> is asserted and enlarged upon in the <hi>second Homily</hi> for <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> in these words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The true Church is an universal congregation or fellowship of God's faithful and elect people, built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,<note place="margin">

Christ ordained no other Element to be used in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> but onely <hi>water,</hi> whereunto when the word is joyned, it is made (as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) a full and perfect Sacrament: They being wiser in their own conceit than Christ, think it not well, nor orderly done, unlesse they use <hi>Conjuration,</hi> unlesse they hallow the water, unlesse there be <hi>Oyl, Salt, Spittle, Tapers,</hi> and such other dumb Ceremonies, serving to no use, contrary to the plain rule of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who willeth all things to be done in the Church to <hi>Edification.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> Christ ordained the Authority of the Keyes to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate notorious Sinners, and to absolve them which are truly penitent; They abuse this power at pleasure, as well in curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Godly with Bell, Book, and Candle, as also absolving the Reprobate, which are known to be unworthy of any Christian Society: whereof they that lust to see Examples, le them search their Lifes.

            </p>
            <p>To censure this Proposition, it is necessary that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it in a twofold sense: either as it relates to that original mistake of our <hi>Historian</hi> about the <hi>Infallibility and Sovereign Dominion over our faith assumed by the Pope</hi>: or as it relates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the real condition and constitution of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church in its <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>religious Doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the first consideration ariseth this Question; <hi>Whether a Protestant of the Church of England can entertain communion with the Church of Rome,</hi> (supposing no <hi>material Errours</hi> in the worship wherein the <hi>Communion</hi> is maintained,) <hi>the Bishop thereof assuming, and the Church allowing of an infallibility in him, and a sovereign dominion over our Faith, and not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theirs; and this without danger of Superstition?</hi>

it be possible for any Protestant of the Church of England to hold Communion with the present Church of Rome, in its Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Offices and Doctrines, without danger of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Question is easily decided against our <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> from that those Churches who have held <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>Pope</hi> when those pretensions were on foot, have been involved in <hi>superstitious</hi> and <hi>idolatrous</hi> practices: which is notorious out of all <hi>Church history,</hi> and the exorbitancies of the <hi>Pope</hi> in that kind (when the <hi>Canonists</hi> and other abettours ascribed unto him a <hi>Sovereignty over the Christian faith</hi>) have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced all the <hi>Superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Gregorian Missal,</hi> and <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,</hi> and <hi>Idolatries</hi>: nor doth it appear that any thing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contributed so much to the advancement of all those <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous practices</hi> and <hi>Tenets</hi> as some <hi>unwary expressions</hi> and <hi>respects of Communion,</hi> which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the <hi>Pope</hi> by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and others of <hi>succeeding Ages</hi>: which is notorious to any man that considers the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences upon which the <hi>Dominion of the Pope,</hi> and his <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is founded, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Courtiers. For though neither did the <hi>French</hi> Church, nor other <hi>Bishops</hi> ever intend to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto several <hi>superstitious</hi> and destructive <hi>tenets</hi> that the <hi>Papacy</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> urge, yet into what dangers some are <hi>fallen</hi> and <hi>ensnared,</hi> and others are threatned to be <hi>involved,</hi> is manifest; and all this from too great tendernesse in point of <hi>Ecclesiastical Communion.</hi> It is manifest from the <hi>mutability</hi> and <hi>frailty</hi> of humane nature, and the usual effect thereof upon <hi>temptations,</hi> that where such a <hi>power</hi> or <hi>Sovereignty</hi> is <hi>lodged,</hi> it may be applied to the introducing of <hi>Superstitious</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous</hi> practices. Thus <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the son of <hi>Nebat</hi> made <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to sin: they perhaps <hi>innocently</hi> complied with that <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,</hi> when <hi>Orthodox</hi>; and he misimploying it, diverted

If there were no other argument for the continuance and advancing of the study of <hi>Philology,</hi> and all <hi>ancient Learning</hi> and <hi>Church History,</hi> the <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of this Assertion</hi> of our <hi>Virtuoso</hi> is such, that no <hi>Protestant</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can otherwise but assent thereunto

            </p>
            <p>The second Question, <hi>Whether it be possible for any Protestant of the Church of England to communitate with the present Church of Rome in her tenets and Ecclesiastical offices, without danger of Superstition?</hi> is easily determin'd, by considering the nature of <hi>Ecclesiastical communion,</hi> which I explained in the beginning, and the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>grounds</hi> of our <hi>separation</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Reforming</hi> our selves. No man can hold such an <hi>assertion,</hi> but he must desert the <hi>Thirty nine Articles,</hi> wherein the <hi>invocation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Image worship, prayers in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue,</hi> the <hi>five</hi> additional <hi>Sacraments, Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one k<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But so much hath been said by me in the foregoing passages, in vindication of our <hi>Church</hi> for departing from the <hi>Romish Communion</hi>; and our <hi>Laws,</hi> together with other <hi>Ecclesiastical constitutions</hi> are so <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> against <hi>all such Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> that I need not insist hereon further: but leave it to the

               <p>The <hi>Wit</hi> that may be borrowed from the <hi>Bible</hi> is magnificent, and as all other Treasures of <hi>Knowledge</hi> it contains, <hi>inexhaustible.</hi> This may be used and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>without any danger of Profaneness.</hi> The ancient <hi>Heathens</hi> did the same; They made their <hi>Divine Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> the chief subject of their <hi>phansies</hi>: By that means their <hi>Religions</hi> had a more <hi>awfull</hi> impression, became more popular, and lasted <hi>longer</hi> in force than
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93330:31"/>
else they would have done. And why may not <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> admit the <hi>same thing,</hi> if it be practised with <hi>sobriety</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi>? What <hi>irreligion</hi> can there be in applying some <hi>Scripture-expressions</hi> to <hi>Naturall things?</hi> Why are not the <hi>one</hi> rather <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> then the other defiled by such applications? The very <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> themselves, who are wont to start at such wit as <hi>Atheistical,</hi> are more guilty of its <hi>excesses</hi> then any other sort of Men: for whatever <hi>they</hi> alledge out of the <hi>Historical, Prophetical,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and apply it to <hi>themselves,</hi> their <hi>Enemies,</hi> or their <hi>Country,</hi> though they call it the <hi>mind of God,</hi> yet it is nothing else but <hi>Scripture-comparison</hi> and <hi>similitude.</hi>
