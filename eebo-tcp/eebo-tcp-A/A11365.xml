         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was borne at <hi>Amiternum,</hi>
in the <hi>Sabine</hi> territorie, the
ſame yeere that <hi>Atheis</hi>
was taken and ſpoiled
by <hi>Syllaes</hi> Souldiers. He
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16916:9"/>
was deſcended of the noble
Saluſtian Family, which for
a long continuance of time
retained the ſplendour of
her ancient dignitie. It is
held for certaine; that hee
had his firſt education in
the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that
from his tender yeeres, the
bent of his endeauours was
wholy ſixt vpon the ſtudies
of ingenious Arts. But hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
to liue in thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
times, wherein
the corrupted manners of
the State bended towards
faction and popular ſiding,
and both vertue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wanting their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
his diſpoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
depraued in a Citty ſo
much vnciuilized (as <hi>Saluſt</hi>
himſelfe confeſſeth) was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16916:9"/>
eaſily vanquiſhed by volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
allurements. So that
being called to the affaires
of the State, as ſoone as his
age was capable of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ſuffred many ſad
misfortunes, through the
iniquitie of the times and
factious people: for as then
the Common-wealth was
much turmoiled, being
ouerſet with <hi>Syllaes</hi> party.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt that <hi>Saluſt</hi>
had a ready wit, and that
he was well verſt in all kind
of litterature, but his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
way was in writing of
Hiſtory. He had for his Tu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour,
amongſt others fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for learning, one <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teius
Praetextalus,</hi> ſurnamed
<hi>Philologus,</hi> by whom hee
was inſtructed (as <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16916:10"/>
Tranquillus</hi> reports) in
the rules of writing well
and methodically. He was
much taken with <hi>M. Catoes</hi>
ſtile, out of whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
he culled forth
many ſelected Sentences,
which he kept as a Breuiate
for his proper vſe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his workes, <hi>Catilines</hi>
conſpiracie, and his Iugur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine
warre, are the two
maſter-peeces of thoſe that
are exſtant. Beſides theſe,
he wrote the Hiſtory of
<hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> vnto
which he annexed the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuements
of <hi>Pompeie</hi> in
the Mithridaticke warre;
this work he finiſhed &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into ſundry Tomes,
the reliques whereof as yet
remaine to poſterity, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16916:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like the parcels of a broken
picture, expreſſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
grauitie and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
He applyed himſelfe
ſo ſtudiouſly vnto the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Punicke Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that for that purpoſe
alone, he trauailed into the
<hi>African</hi> Regions, to finde
out the truth with more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance;
which induſtrious
diligence of his is much
commended by <hi>Autenus
Rufus. Gellius</hi> a Roman
borne (who for his Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme
was held the <hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
of ancient learning) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers
thus much of <hi>Saluſts</hi>
ſtite. His elegancie, (ſaith
he) eloquence of ſpeech,
and affectation of noueltie
were accompanied with
much enuy. In ſo much that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16916:11"/>
diuers able wits, who were
his Contemporaries, did
reprehend and detract his
writings. But this aſperſion
proceeded either from
ignorance or a preiudicate
malice, <hi>Gellius</hi> iudgement
being cleere in this point,
that he was a ſtrict obſeruer
of the proprietie of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Language.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> was ſo vniuſt
to <hi>Saluſt,</hi> by the teſtimony
of <hi>Annaeus Seneca,</hi> that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
him for intrenching
vpon <hi>Theucidides,</hi> and for
vſurping many parcels of
his Hiſtory, which he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
out of the Greeke,
and applyed for himſelfe,
with a borrowed elegancy.
Neither doth <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi>

with too forced an affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he traced the ſteps of the

affirmes, that in the

Readers, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be added to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſts</hi>
ſpeech and briefe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.
Neither was he ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
to parallell <hi>Saluſt</hi>
with <hi>Thucidides,</hi> the Father
and Prince of the Grecian
Hiſtoriographers, as he did
<hi>Titus Liuius</hi> with <hi>Herodotus.</hi>

Hee honoured <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi>

Hee had often

                  <p>He was a great Fauorite

him that is leaſt good, to
him who excels in goodnes.
<hi>Whether men plant, ſaile, or
build, all ſucceſſe depends vpon
vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet many mortals giuen
ouer to ſloth and gluttony,
being vnlearned and vncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued,
haue paſſed ouer this
life like Pilgrims, to whom,
euen againſt nature, the
ſoule was a burden. Their
life &amp; death I eſteeme alike,
becauſe both of them are
ſilenced.</p>
                     <p>But truely, he at length
to me ſeemes to liue, and
to enioy his ſoule, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bent vpon ſome imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſeekes the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any greate exploit,
or ingenuous ſcience. But
in the great variety of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16916:17"/>
things, nature to diuers
ſhewes different wayes. It
is glorious to doe well for
the Republicke, neither is
it improper to ſpeake well
for it; you may be renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
either by peace or war;
and of thoſe who haue
done, and of thoſe who
haue wrote other mens
doings many are praiſed.
And in my iudgement, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a proportionable
glory doth not attend the
doer and writer of things;
yet it is very difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
actions forepaſt: firſt,
becauſe the deedes ought
to carry proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the
words: Secondly, becauſe
moſt men, what faults, you
reprehend, thinke you
ſpeake out of maleuolence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16916:17"/>
and enuy. When you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the large vertue
and glory of good men,
what any man thinkes eaſie
to be atchieued by himſelfe,
he receiues with good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:
if it bee aboue
that, he eſteemes their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
fained for counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feites.</p>
                     <p>But I being a young man
at firſt, was (as many men
are) thruſt from my ſtudy
into publicke affaires, and
there I ſuffered many cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
for in ſteed of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,
abſtinence, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
boldneſſe, bribery,
and auarice flouriſhed,
which vices, although my
ſoule deteſted, being a
ſtranger to euill courſes,
yet amongſt ſuch a conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16916:18"/>
of them, my tender
age being corrupted, was
inthralled by ambition:
and me, although I kept
diſtance from other crimes,
the ſame deſire of glory,
like others troubled, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with infamy and enuy.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon, as ſoone as
my minde, after many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and dangers, tooke
ſome repoſe, and that
I had reſolued to ſpend the
remainder of my time farre
from the Commonwealth:
it was not my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to waſte this commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
vacancy in ſloth and
idleneſſe, neither to weare
out my yeeres, being bent
vpon tillage, hunting, and
ſeruile imployments: but
from what purpoſe and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16916:18"/>
wicked ambition had
detained me, thither retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
I decreed to write
the exploits of the Romane
people, ſuccinctly, and as
they ſeemed worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:
the ſooner, for
that my mind was free from
hope, feare, and State-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>Therefore of <hi>Catilines</hi>
conſpiracie, as truely as I
can, in few words, I meane
to treate; for that action I
eſteeme moſt memorable,
for the noueltie of the crime
and danger. Of which mans
conditions, ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are firſt to be vnfolded,
before I begin the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

were his pleaſures, &amp;

pline was ſtrictly obſerued,
both in the Citty and
Campe. There was an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
concord without the
leaſt blemiſh of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
equity and goodneſſe
were maintained amongſt
them, more by the inſtinct
of nature, then by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Tables.</p>
                     <p>Their ſtrifes, diſcordes,
angers, and enmities, they
wraked vpon their enemies:
Citizens contended with
Citizens in the emulation
of vertue: they were magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
in diuine ceremonies,
frugall in domeſticke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
faithfull to their
friends. By theſe two cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of courage in warfare,
and equity after peace, was
concluded, they prouided
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16916:20"/>
for their owne and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke
ſafety. Of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I haue this eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
proofe; becauſe in the
time of warre, more ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was for the moſt part
exerciſed againſt thoſe,
who ingaged ſight without
command, or retired too
ſlowly, the retreate being
ſounded, then vpon ſuch
as forſooke their Enſignes,
or fled, being beaten from
their appointed ſtations.
But in the time of peace,
they ſwayed the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more by bounty then
terrour, being willing to
forgiue, rather then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
iniuries. Thus as
ſoone as induſtrie, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
had inlarged the State,
mighty Kings were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16916:20"/>
by their Armes
fierce Nations, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
by their Forces; yea,
<hi>Carthage,</hi> emulous of the
Roman Empire, was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery;
all Seas and Lands
gaue way to their Armies.</p>
                     <p>Then fortune began to
frowne, and to blend all
things with confuſion.
Thoſe men who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
without diſturbance la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
dangers, hard and
harſh fortunes, to them
eaſe and wealth, things to
be wiſhed for of others,
became a burden and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.
Then firſt the deſire
of money, and after that, of
Soueraignety began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe:
theſe proued the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16916:21"/>
materials of all miſchiefes:
for auarice ſubuerted
faith, honeſty, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good practiſes: in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteed
of them it taught
pride, cruelty, irreligion,
and bribery, with all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made many men hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-hearted,
they reſerued
one thing in their breaſts,
expreſſed another with
promptneſſe of language.
They valued amity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
not by deſert, but by
profit, and more affected a
good ſhew then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauce.
Theſe abuſes at firſt,
crept foreward by degrees,
being ſometimes ſubiect to
puniſhment: after, when
the contagion ſpred it ſelfe
like a peſtilence, the face of
the Citty was changed, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16916:21"/>
the forme of Gouernment
which was moſt iuſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
grew to be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and vnſufferable.</p>
                     <p>But firſt of all, ambition
(which vice is vertues next
counterfeit) exerciſed mens
affections, more then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe,
for glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and dominion, are
deſired indifferently by the
good and euill: but the firſt
of theſe takes the direct
way, the other, becauſe
he wants fit meanes, purſues
their inqueſt with deceit
and falſe-hood.</p>
                     <p>Couetouſneſſe hath with
it an immoderate deſire
of riches, which neuer
any wiſe man did affect:
ſhe as if infected with viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
humours, effeminates
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16916:22"/>
both mens bodies and
minds, ſhe is alwayes vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and vnſatiable, not
leſſened with plenty, nor
penury.</p>
                     <p>Now, after that <hi>Locius
Sylla</hi> had recouered by
Armes, the ſway of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicke,
from good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
ill euents atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, for all men gaue
themſelues to rapine and
pillage: this man longed
for a houſe, that other for
a field: the victours knew
neither meane nor mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie:
barbarous and bloody
executions were inflicted
vpon their fellow Citizens.
This miſchiefe was furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by another, becauſe
that <hi>Sylla,</hi> to the intent hee
might oblige the Army to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16916:22"/>
his ſeruice, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in <hi>Aſia,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the diſcipline of his
Anceſtours, entertained
them with too much luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and freedome. Places of
pleaſure, and voluptuous
allurements, had eaſily
mollified in this time of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,
the fierce courage
of his Souldiers. There
firſt the Romane Armie
learned to whore, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowſe,
and to fancy ſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons,
pictures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
vtenſils: theſe they
purloyned priuatly and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly;
withall they pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Temples, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
all diuine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
ordinances: ſo that
theſe were the Souldiers,
who after they had gotten
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16916:23"/>
the victory, left nothing to
bee poſſeſſed by the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.
<hi>Proſperitie for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
cloyes the mindes of wiſe
men, much leſſe could thoſe
men, whoſe conditions were
diſſolute, moderate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
after the victorie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From thence foreward
riches were accounted
honourable, and theſe were
courted by Domination,
glory and and power. Then
the edge of vertue was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
pouerty was thought
a diſgrace, and innocency
was eſteemed a ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the cauſall meanes
of riches, ryot, auarice,
and pride, corrupted the
youth, who made large
ſpoiles and expences, being
careleſſe of their owne
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16916:23"/>
eſtates, yet couetous after
other mens. They confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
promiſcuouſly, ſhame
and modeſty together, with
the Lawes of God &amp; man:
they were neither mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
nor prouident in their
actions.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſubiect worth the
obſeruation, when you
ſhall behold houſes and
priuate dwellings, inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with buildings in the
manner of Citties, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay
therewithall the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the Gods, which our
moſt religious Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
erected. But theſe
they beautified with piety,
as they did their owne
houſes with glory. Neither
did they take any thing
from the conquered, but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16916:24"/>
the liberty of doing wrong.
But theſe debaucht perſons
tooke moſt iniuriouſly
from their aſſociates, theſe
proprieties, which thoſe
valiant Conquerours ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to their enemies; as
though the doing of iniury
were a true argument of
command. But why ſhould
I recount thoſe abuſes,
which are not credible to
any that haue not ſeene
them, as the leuelling of
mountaines, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vp of ſeas at priuate
mens charges; who made
wealth the ſcorne of their
folly, becauſe they were
lewd, and lauiſh of that,
the honeſt fruition whereof
had beene lawfull?</p>
                     <p>Beſides, their luſts, ryots,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16916:24"/>
and other lewde practices,
were not inferiour to their
former crimes: men inured
themſelues to feminine ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferances,
and women pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikly
proſtituted their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
To pleaſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
both lands and ſeas
were ſearcht from farre:
they went to ſleepe before
naturall deſire vrged it.
They could not brooke
hunger, thirſt, cold, nor
wearineſſe, but did antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
all of them with luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Theſe motiues incited
the youth to dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
as ſoone as their
properſtore was exhauſted.
<hi>A mind infected with this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of vices, could hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
the inuaſion of luſts.</hi> By
meanes whereof the wayes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16916:25"/>

neere acquaintance, by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vſe and allurements, hee
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16916:26"/>

was confirmed rather
by the circumſtance of

                     <p>At length being taken

(a woman in whom

wicked nuptials, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
(as it ſeemes to me)
was the chiefeſt cauſe that
forwarded the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
For his polluted mind
being hatefull to God and
man, could take no reſt ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
nor waking, but was
alwayes perplexed with a

that ſhall attend our liues,
except we our ſelues vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate

ſithence the Common-wealth
is fallen into the
power and preeminence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16916:34"/>
of ſome few great men;
Kings and Tetrachs haue
beene their tributaries,
Peoples &amp; Nations haue
payd them penſions; but
as for the reſt of vs, how
valiant or good, how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or ignoble, wee haue
beene ranked amongſt the
vulgar, liuing without
reſpect, without authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
obnoxious vnto thoſe,
to whom, if the Weale
publicke tooke place, we
ſhould be the ſubiects of

all fauour, power, honour
and riches, are become
theirs, or at leaſt theirs,
on whom they pleaſe to
conferre them. But to vs,
they haue left repulſes,
dangers, iudgements; and

pouerty: which grieuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
how long will ye ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,

                     <p>But aſſuredly, by that

ſeated in our hands: wee
haue youth for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
and hearts full
of courage; contrariwiſe
through age and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

are decayed in them.
It remaines onely for vs
to begin; as for the reſt,
time will accompliſh.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16916:35"/>
Can any man liuing,
whoſe diſpoſition is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
indure to ſee theſe men
abounde with riches,
which they lauiſh out in
damming vp the ſeas, and
leuelling of mountaines,
and that we ſhould want
meanes for our preſent
neceſſities? That they
ſhould poſſeſſe two or
three houſes, and that we
ſhould want a roofe for
our heads, ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they buy pictures,
skutcheous and imboſſed
furniture; whereas they
neglect the old, demoliſh
the new, raiſe vp other
edifices in their places,
and laſt of all, by all
meanes get and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
money; yet cannot
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16916:36"/>
they by their lauiſhneſſe
bring their fortunes to an
ebbe. But we haue pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at home, debts abroad,
our eſtates are lowe, our
hopes are more deſperate.
Finally, what haue wee
left, but the miſeries of a
perplexed mind? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rowze vp your ſelues,
behold that, that liberty
(I ſay) which you haue

The ſubiect, time,

debauched with all kind

whom the Cenſours, in

Neither was he

But <hi>Fuluia</hi> hauing drawne

                     <p>In this intercourſe of

Beſides theſe, he drew to

to whom luſt and

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16916:45"/>
of the danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that neither by his

neither could hee
be ſufficiently informed,
of what numbers <hi>Manlius</hi>
Army conſiſted, nor
what was the ſcope of his

the matter to the

euery where by

                     <p>They againe, (as it is

decree, that the Consuls
ſhould endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

is granted by the Senate,

vnto the chiefeſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
after the Romane
cuſtome: by which he is
inabled to wage warre,

none of theſe priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

Senatour, recited certaine
letters, which he ſaid,
were brought vnto him
from <hi>Feſulae,</hi> by <hi>Quin. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius.</hi>
In theſe thus it was
written: <hi>That</hi> C. Manlius
<hi>had taken Armes with great

                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:16916:46"/>
Vpon this (as it is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon by the
Decree of the Senate,
<hi>Quin. Martius Rex,</hi> was
ſent into <hi>Feſulae,</hi> and <hi>Quin.
Metellus Creticus</hi> into <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>
and the neighbouring
Regions. Both theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene Generals of

from triumphing, by the
calumniation of ſome
few, vnto whom all ſuites,
whether good or bad,
were wont to be venall.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16916:47"/>
But as for the Praetours,
<hi>Qu. Pompeius Rufus</hi> was
commiſſioned to goe to

Celer,</hi> for the Picenian

power by permiſſion to
raiſe an Armie, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

Moreouer, if any man
could reueale any thing
concerning this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
(intended againſt
the ſafety of the State) it
was decreed he ſhould
haue a large reward; a

a hundred Seſterties: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

free-man impunity of the
fact, and two hundred

beſides, that the families

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16916:47"/>
ſhould be billetted in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua,</hi>

that watch and

<hi>Rome,</hi> and that the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Magiſtrates ſhould
haue the command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
With theſe nouelties
the Citty was amazed,
and the face of it was
changed; in ſtead of
mirth and frollickneſſe,
which diuturnall eaſe had
produced, forthwith
there followed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

Beſides this, the
weaker ſexe, to whom (in
regard of the maieſtie of
the State) the terrour of
warre was vnuſuall, did
bewaile their hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
they lifted vp their

commiſerated their

himſelfe, as though

he makes his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

whether fearing his

for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,

countenance, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
voyce, that they
would not without iuſt
cauſe, giue credit to any
thing that might be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
againſt him. That
he being extracted from
ſuch noble a family, had ſo
demeaned his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that onely, that
which was good, had been
harboured in his hopes:
neither ſhould they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

being a Patrician borne,
(who together with his
Anceſtours, had merited
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16916:49"/>
well of the Roman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
could not ſubſiſt
without the ruine of the
Common-wealth: when
as, forſooth, <hi>M. Tullius</hi>

of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt bee
thought to preſerue the
ſame.</p>
                     <p>When he ſuperadded
other ſcandals to theſe,
all the houſe huſht at his

Then all inraged hee

which might be vſefull for

there was not

ſo farre moued
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16916:57"/>

was the violence of this
malady, which like a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent
contagion had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt
it ſelfe almoſt
through the generality.
Neither were their minds
alienated alone, who were
knowing of this complot,
but euen the whole body
of the Commonalty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous of innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did approue <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi>

ſeemes to be done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

in a Common-wealth,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16916:57"/>
thoſe men whoſe

becauſe their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty

                     <p>But as for the Plebeians
of the City, they precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
themſelues into this
action through ſundry
motiues. Firſt of all, thoſe
who moſt exceeded in

then, thoſe who had

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16916:58"/>
all ſnch, whom ſome

had expelled from

beene a ſinke of receite.
Beſides, many others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mindefull of <hi>Syllaes</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie,
becauſe they had
ſeene ſome common
Souldiers made Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,

that in dyet and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
they liued after a
Royall manner, hoped to
reape ſuch fruites by the
victory, if that were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by their Armes.
Moreouer, the Peazant
youth, who by the hire of
their hands had got their
liuings in the fields; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16916:58"/>
allured with the hope
of priuate and publicke

the Citties eaſe, before
the thriftleſſe Country la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Theſe and all
others of this kind; did
feed on the publike cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
It being a matter
not much to be wondred
at, that penurious perſons,
of euill conditions, and
aſpiring mindes, ſhould
equally neglect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and the Common-wealth.
Moreouer, ſuch as
had their parents proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
their goods confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the priuiledge of
their liberties intrenched
vpon by the rigour of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes</hi>
victory, did attend
the euent of this warre,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16916:59"/>
with a reſolution anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the former. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
whoſoeuer were of
any faction, except of the
Senatorian, did rather
deſire the trouble then the
tranquillity of the State.
This miſchiefe, after many
forepaſſed yeeres, made
his reuerſe againe into the
Citty.</p>
                     <p>For after the Tribuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

gotten the ſoueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(whoſe yeeres and

they began by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

themſelues, with

inflamed their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages:

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16916:62"/>
with all ſorts of men that
were ſeruiceable for the

giues inſtructions to <hi>P.

found the Ambaſſadours
of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> and
draw them, if he could,
into the ſociety of this
action: thinking that they
would eaſily be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

much indebted: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the nation of the

                        <hi>Vmbrenus,</hi> by reaſon he
had negotiated in <hi>Gaule,</hi>
did know, and was
knowne vnto moſt of
their principall Citizens.
Therefore as ſoone as he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16916:62"/>
ſaw the Ambaſſadours in
the Common-hall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made ſome few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
concerning the
State of their Citty, and
ſeeming to deplore her
wrerched caſe, he began
to inquire, what end they
did expect of theſe their
great greeuances. When
he perceiued, that they
complayned by way of
reply, of the couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Magiſtrates,
and blamed the Senate,
becauſe they could haue
no redreſſe from them,
and that they expected no

but by death onely. Why
then (ſaith he) if you will
ſhew your ſelues men, I
will put you into a courſe,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16916:63"/>
by which you may ſhunne

As ſoone as he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered

with great hopes, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<hi>Vmbrenus</hi> to take
compaſſion on them: for
there was nothing ſo
dreadfull nor difficult, but
they would vndertake to
doe it willingly, ſo that
the performance of it
would free their Citty
from her debts. Thence
he brings them into the

Hee being preſent,
<hi>Vmbrenus</hi> diſcloſeth the
conſpiracy at large. Hee
names the confederates,
and with them many men
of ſundry degrees, being
altogether innocent; and
this he did, to giue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incouragement to
the Ambaſſadours. Then
he diſmiſſeth them home,
after they had promiſed
their beſt aſſiſtance. But as
for the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> they
ſtucke long vpon doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

mad men, ſhuffled all their

their night counſels,
with their carriage of

hainous a crime could
not moue: The ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is vntrue: for no
mortall man leſſens the
eſtimation of his owne
wrongs, yea many men
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16916:79"/>
interpret it too rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>But in diuers men the
licence of this is different
(ye conſcript Fathers)
for thoſe who liue lowe
in an obſcure calling, if
through anger they haue
committed any errour,
few men take notice of it,
their fame and fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both alike. As for
thoſe, who being inueſted
with great commands,
ſpend their time in high
imployments, their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are manifeſted to
all mens knowledge. So
that in the greateſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
the priuiledge of
offending is leaſt: neither
doth it beſeeme thoſe
who haue it, to be partiall
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16916:79"/>
in fauour or hatred, much
leſſe to be angry: for that
which is termed anger in
others, in men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is called pride, and
cruelty.</p>
                     <p>I thinke verily (ye C.
F.) that their offence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all puniſhment: but
moſt men remember the
next occurrences, ſo that
in wicked mens cenſures
forgetting the crime, they
diſpute of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if that ſeeme neuer
ſo little too rigorous. I
know for certaine, that
whatſoeuer <hi>D. Sillanus</hi> a
valiant and reſolute man
hath ſaid, that it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from his zeale to the
Common-wealth: nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
hath he in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16916:80"/>
a matter exerciſed his
priuate amity or hatred:
I haue knowne the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and modeſty of the
man to be ſuch: as for his
Sentence it ſeemes nor
cruell) to mee (for what
cruelty can be inflicted
vpon ſuch male factours?)
but vnuſuall it is in our
forme of gouernment:
for queſtionleſſe, feare or
wrong haue inforced
thee (<hi>O Sillanus</hi>) being
Conſull Elect, to decree
this new kind of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It were ſuperfluous
to diſcourſe of feare, ſince
by the preſent diligence
of our moſt worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull
ſo many ſtrong Aydes
are now in Armes. Of the
puniſhment I can truely
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16916:80"/>
ſay that, which the caſe
requireth. That death to
men in anguiſh and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is no torment, but the
period of calamities: It
diſſolues all the terrours
of mortality, beyond that,
there is no place for griefe
or gladneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But by the immortall
gods, why did you not
adde to the Sentence,
that firſt of all they ſhould
be ſcourged with roddes?
was it becauſe the <hi>Portia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
Law forbids it? but other
Lawes alſo impoſe exile,
not death vpon condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Cittizens: or was it
becauſe ſcourging is
more grieuous then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading?
If it be ſo, what
cenſure can be too bitter,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16916:81"/>
and cruell, againſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
conuicted of ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
a fact? But if becauſe
the puniſhment is gentler
then that, how then
ſhould it be conuenient
to obſerue the Law in
ſmall matters, when you
neglect it in the greater?
But ſhould any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that, which is
decreed againſt Traitours
to the Common-wealth?
Time, occaſion, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
will determine,
whoſe ſwaye moderates
all Nations, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
may befall them,
ſhall befall deſeruedly.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, I would haue
you to conſider (ye Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
Fathers) what you
may decree againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16916:81"/>
All euill examples
proceeded from good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings:
but when the
Gouernment is diuolued
to men not knowing, or
not good enough, this
new example is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from worthy and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
perſons, to thoſe
that are vnworthy and
vncapable. The Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,
the Athenians
being vanquiſhed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thirty men to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
that State. Theſe at
firſt began to put to
death euery man that was
moſt wicked and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hated, although hee
were vncondemned. The
people applauded this
courſe, and ſaid it was vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from their deſerts.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16916:82"/>
after, when this liberty by
degrees increaſed, they
murthered at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
both the good and
bad, and terrified the
reſt with feare. Thus the
Citty being oppreſſed
with ſeruitude, ſuffred
grieuouſly for her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
ioy.</p>
                     <p>When as in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<hi>Sylla</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
commanded <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi>
and others of the
like condition to be ſlain,
that were growne great
by the publicke calamity,
who did not commend
this act of his? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that theſe wicked
and factious men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, who
had troubled the State
with their ſeditions, where
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16916:82"/>
iuſtly put to death. But
this was the beginning of
a great maſſacre: for
when any man affected
the houſe, farme, vtenſill,
or apparell of another, he
indeuoured to liſt him in
the number of the proſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
So that thoſe, who
formerly reioyced at <hi>Da
maſippus</hi> death, were drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not long after to the
ſame blocke: neither was
there firſt an end of
ſlaughtering, before that
<hi>Sylla</hi> had inriched all his
partakers. I feare not this
in <hi>M. Tullius,</hi> nor in theſe
times: yet in this great
Citty, there are many and
various humours. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, another man
being Conſull, who hath
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16916:83"/>
alſo an Army to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
a falſhood may be
miſinterpreted for a truth.
When from this prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
by the Decree of
the Senate, the Conſull
ſhall vnſheath his ſword,
who ſhall then preſcribe
an end, or moderate the
execution of it?</p>
                     <p>Our Predeceſſours (ye
Conſcript Fathers) neuer
wanted counſell, nor cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
neither did pride
hinder them from imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forreine inſtitutions,
if they were honeſt. They
borrowed their Armes
and military weapons
from the <hi>Samnites,</hi> their
Enſignes of Magiſtracy
from the Tuſcans. Laſtly,
whatſoeuer ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16916:83"/>
were it in vſe
with their Allies or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
they practiſed it at
home with exceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.
They were more
willing to imitate then
enuy the good. But in
that time, following the
cuſtome of <hi>Greece,</hi> they
puniſhed Cittizens with
ſtripes, vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
they executed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall
puniſhment. After
this, when the Common-wealth
grew ſtrong, and
factions were of force
through the multitude of
Citizens, the innocent
were circumuented, and
other like abuſes began to
be committed. Then the
Portian Law, and other
Lawes were enacted, by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16916:84"/>
the benefit whereof, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
was permitted
to the condemned. I
thinke this to be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cauſe (ye Conſcript
Fathers) for which wee
ſhould not imbrace any
new reſolution: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
there was more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and wiſdome in them,
who from ſuch meane
foundations haue eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
ſo glorious an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
then in vs, who doe
hardly retaine their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
acquiſitions.</p>
                     <p>Is it therefore my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to haue them diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and <hi>Catilines</hi> Army
to be thus reinforced? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe: but this is my
cenſure: That their goods
ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fiſcated, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:16916:84"/>
be kept in bonds in
the infranchiſed (Townes
of beſt ability, and that
no man ſhall make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
for them to the
Senate, nor mediate with
the people: he that ſhall
doe otherwiſe, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſhould adiudge him
to vndertake againſt the
Common-wealth, and
the publicke ſafety.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Caeſar</hi> had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his ſpeech, ſome aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

otherwiſe amongſt
themſelues. <hi>M. Portius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
being required to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his mind, he vttered
this or the like Oration:</p>
                     <p>My mind farre differs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:16916:85"/>
in it ſelfe (ye Conſcript
Fathers) when I conſider
our occaſions and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and when I ballance
with my ſelfe ſome mens
opinions: they to me
ſeeme to haue argued
about their puniſhment,
who haue ſought to bring
warre vpon their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntry,
Parents, Temples, and
Families. But the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth admoniſh vs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee cautelous of
them, then to conſult,
what is to bee decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. For other
crimes you may then pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
except you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
that this doth not
happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being hap'ned you
implore Iuſtice in vaine.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:16916:85"/>
The Citty being taken, no
power remaines to the
conquered.</p>
                     <p>But by the immortall
gods I appeale to you,
who haue alwayes eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Houſes, Farmes,
Skutcheons, and Pictures,
more then the Common-wealth,
if you will retaine
thoſe things, which you ſo
much imbrace, of what
condition ſo euer they be;
if you will giue full ſcope
to your pleaſures; rouze
vp your ſelues at length,
and vndertake for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicke.
Our tributes
are not queſtioned, nor
the wrongs of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
our liberties
and liues are become
doubtfull. Often haue I
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:16916:86"/>
ſpoken at large (ye Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
Fathers) in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
and haue fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
complained of
the luxury and auarice of
our Cittizens; for which
cauſe I haue many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
I that could neuer
fauour any offence in my
ſelfe, or my owne ſoule,
did hardly remit faults
to the luſt of others. But
although you meanely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
my words, yet
the State ſtood firme;
proſperity bore out our
negligence. But now it is
not queſtioned, whether
we liue in a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or bad; neither how
great and glorious is the
Empire of the Romane
people; but whether theſe,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:16916:86"/>
whatſoeuer they be, ſhall
be intirely ours, or ours
together with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Here will any man
name to me lenity and
mercy? we haue for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
loſt already the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
appellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of things:
for the donation of other
mens goods is termed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality:
a miſchieuous
daring fortitude. To
ſuch extremities is the
State now reduced. Well,
let them be (ſince ſuch
are the cuſtomes) liberall
out of their friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
let them be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Robbers of the

not them lauiſhly giue
our blood; and whilſt
they ſpare ſome few wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16916:87"/>
ſeeke to ruine all

                     <p>Well, and learnedly
hath <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> diſcourſed
not long ſince in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
concerning life,
and death; as I conceiue,
thinking thoſe things to
be falſe, which are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the infernall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that the euill in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
remote from the
good, haue loathſome,
rude, filthy, and fearefull
habitations. Therefore
hath he cenſured, that
their goods ſhould be
confiſcated, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſhould be kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
in the infranchiſed
Townes: forſooth, leſt
being at <hi>Rome</hi> they might
be forcibly freed, either
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:16916:87"/>
by their fellow Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
or by the ſuborned
multitude: as though
wicked &amp; lewd men were
onely in the Citty, and
not throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi>
or that boldneſſe could
not there doe moſt,
where the meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
are weakeſt. Vaine
therefore is this counſell,
if he doubt any danger
from them: but if hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
feares, not in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
feare, by ſo much
the more it conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nes me
to be fearefull both for

that you haue decreed
of all the Conſpiratours.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16916:88"/>
By how much the more
you ſhall be carefull in
this, by ſo much their
ſpirits will be the more
deiected: but if they ſhall
ſee you to faint neuer ſo
little, all of them will
forthwith inſult with
more fierceneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Doe not thinke that
our Anceſtours, made
from a ſmall one this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicke
great by Armes:
if it were ſo, we ſhould
inioy it more flouriſhing
by farre; in that wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
more then they in
Allies, Cittizens, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

there were other aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which made them
great, and are wanting
to vs: induſtry at home,

Iuſtice abroad, a Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
free in Counſell;
neither obnoxious to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or paſſion. In lieu of
theſe we haue entertained
luxury and auarice, with
ſordidneſſe in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke,
and aboundance
in our priuate expences.
We commend Riches,
follow ſloth: there is no
diſtinction made between
good and euill men: am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
vſurpeth all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of vertue. Neither
is it ſtrange, ſince all of
you for your ſelues, hold
your Counſels a part,
ſince at home you are
ſlaues to your pleaſures,
here to money or fauour;
ſo that wrong is inforced
vpon the neglected Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16916:89"/>
But theſe
things I omit.</p>
                     <p>Cittizens moſt nobly
deſcended, haue conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ruine their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

of the Rebels with
his Army houers ouer
your heads: you protract
time, and euen now you
doubt what to doe with
theſe Traitours, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
within the
walls. I thinke you pitty
them: being young men,
forſooth, they haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
through ambition,
and therefore you may
diſmiſſe them armed. But
aſſuredly this meekeneſſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16916:89"/>
and mercy, if they ſhall

turne to your calamity.</p>
                     <p>For certaine the caſe is

through vigilancy, action,

ſucceed well. Whereas you
abandon your ſelues to ſloth

the gods in vaine: they by this

had ſupported ſuch great
enterpriſes. I knew that
with ſmall Forces, they
haue oftentimes incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
great Armies of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:16916:92"/>
their enemies: I knew
that with contemptible
numbers, they haue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
againſt mighty Kings,
beſides they haue fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſuffred the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of fortune. The
Greekes in eloquence,
the Gaules in military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
excelled the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.
Yet vnto me pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
many things it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
plainely, that
the remarkable vertue of
a fewe Cittizens brought
all theſe things to paſſe;
and ſo it befell, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
ouercame riches,
the few the multitude.</p>
                     <p>But after, when the
Citty was corrupted with
Riot and ſloth, the
Common-wealth againe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16916:93"/>
through her proper great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſuſtained the vices
of her Generals and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates;
&amp; as though ſhe
had lately brought forth
all her Patriots, there was
not any man found at
<hi>Rome</hi> for a long ſeaſon of
eminent vertue.</p>
                     <p>But in my memory,
there liued two men of
much vertue, yet of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
conditions, <hi>M.
Cato,</hi> and <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> whom,
becauſe the occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it ſelfe, I doe not
reſolue to paſſe ouer in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
but will deliuer
their liues and manners,
as farre as my wit will ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
yeeres and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:16916:93"/>
of theſe men were
almoſt equall, their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of mind and glory
were alike, but other
things they purſued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe:
<hi>Caeſar</hi> for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
and munificence,
was reputed great, <hi>Cato</hi>
for the integrity of his
life: the one was renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for his meekeneſſe
and mercy; to this man,
ſeuerity added dignity.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> by giuing, relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and pardoning, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
by parſimony got re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne.
The one of them
was a Sanctuary to the
oppreſſed, the other, the
ruine of malefactours.
This mans facility, that
mans conſtancy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
Laſt of all, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:16916:94"/>
was reſolued in mind
to labour, watch, to be
intentiue on his friends
affaires, with neglect of
his owne: to deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was worth the
giuing; he deſired exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely
a great command,
Army, and new warres,
where his vertue might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it ſelfe. But <hi>Catoes</hi>
ſtudy was modeſty ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
and aboue all, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity.
He did not ſtriue
with the rich man in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
nor with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
man in faction,
but with the valiant in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
with the modeſt in
modeſty, and with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in abſtinence. He
had rather be, then ſeeme
good: ſo that, by how
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:16916:94"/>
much the leſſe he purſued
glory, by ſo much the
more he purchaſed it.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16916:98"/>
that words infuſe
not valour into men, nor
that an Army becomes
ſtrenuous from daſtardly,
nor valiant from fearefull,
by the Oration of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
How much courage
is ſeated in each mans
ſoule, either by nature or
cuſtome, ſo much mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts
it ſelfe in war. whom
neither glory nor danger
excite, him you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
in vaine: the feare
of the mind hinders at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
But I haue called
you together, with intent,
to admoniſh ſome few
things, and withall that I
might vnfold the reaſons
of my counſell. You
know full well (my Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers)
what miſchiefe the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16916:99"/>
ſolution and cowardice of
<hi>Lentulus</hi> brought to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and vs, and by what
meanes, (whilſt I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Aydes from the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,)
I was hindred from
going into Gaule. But
now you perceiue all, as
well as my ſelfe, in what
extremity our affaires are:
two Armies of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
debarre vs; one from
the Citty, the other from
Gaule: to ſtay longer
here, if our reſolution
could beare it, the want
of corne and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
prohibites; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
we meane to goe,
the way muſt be opened
by the ſword.</p>
                     <p>Therefore be of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
and prepared mind,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16916:99"/>
and when you ſhall begin
the battel, remember that
you carry in your right
hands riches, renowne,
and glory, with your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
If we ouercome, all
things will be ſecured to
vs; aboundant prouiſions,
the priuiledged Townes
and Colonies will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
but if we ſhrinke for
feare, theſe will all proue
our enemies. Neither will
any place or friend ſhelter
him, whom his armes
ſhall not protect. Beſides,
(my Souldiers) the ſame
neceſſity is not impendent
ouer vs and them: wee
contend for Country, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and life: they are
at leiſure to fight for ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16916:100"/>
of ſome few. For
which cauſe fall on more
couragiouſly, being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of your ancient ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>It had beene lawfull for
vs, to haue protracted
our liues in exile with the
moſt diſgrace that could
be: ſome of you at Rome,
hauing loſt your owne,
might haue expected o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens riches. Becauſe
theſe courſes ſeemed baſe
and vnſufferable for men,
you reſolued to purſue
theſe other. If you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
theſe, there is
need of courage. No man,
except the Conquerour,
hath changed warre for
peace. For to ſeeke ſafety
by flight, when you ſhall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16916:100"/>
diuert your armes from
your enemies, by which
the body is defended, that
is madneſſe indeed. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in a battle, their
danger is greateſt, who
feare moſt: courage is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for a wall.</p>
                     <p>When I conſider you
(my Souldiers) and when
I eſteeme your braue
actes, a great hope of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
doth poſſeſſe me:
your reſolution, age, and
vertue, perſwade me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the neceſſity, which
alſo makes the cowards
valiant. For that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of our enemies
may not incloſe vs, the
faſtneſſe of the place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids:
but if fortune ſhall
enuy your valour, beware
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16916:101"/>
that you loſe not your
liues vnreuenged, nor
that being taken, you be
ſlaine like beaſts, rather
then fighting like men, to
leaue a bloody &amp; mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
victory vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>As ſoone as he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thus, pauſing a little, he
commaunds the warlike
inſtruments to ſound, and
drawes out his Troupes
in order vnto a conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place: then all the
horſes being remoued, to
the intent, that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
being made equall,
courage might be ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his Souldiers, hee
himſelfe on foot arangeth
his Army, as the place,
and his numbers requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16916:101"/>
For whereas the
plaine was ſeated between
mountaines on the left
hand, and on the right
hand it was rough with
rockes: he placeth eight
Cohorts in front; his other
Troups he imbattailes for
ſuccour in a more cloſe
order. Out of theſe hee
drawes all the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the ſelected men
that had ſerued out their
yeeres, beſides euery one
of the common Souldiers,
that was beſt armed, into
the Van of the Vanguard.
Hee commands <hi>C. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
to take charge in
the right wing, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Feſilan</hi> in the left; he
himſelfe with the freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and thoſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:16916:102"/>
tooke vp his ſtation
before the Standard of
the Eagle, which <hi>Marius</hi>
was ſaid to haue in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the Cimbrian war.</p>
                     <p>But on the other ſide,
<hi>C. Antonius,</hi> becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lame of his feet, he
could not be preſent at
the battle, commits the
whole charge of his Army
to <hi>M. Petreius</hi> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Hee imbatailes the
old Cohortes which were
inrolled becauſe of this
tumult, in the Frount,
after them he diſpoſeth
the reſt of his Forces for
aydes of reſerue. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
riding round about
on horſe-backe, naming
euery Commander ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
coniures, perſwades,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16916:102"/>
and intreates, that they
would remember, how
that they were to fight
againſt vnarmed Theeues,
for their Country, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Temples, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.
This Martiall man,
becauſe for more then
thirty yeeres, he had been
with great glory, either
Tribune, Prouoſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,
Lieutenant, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in the Army, knew
moſt of the Souldiers,
and their valiant exploits:
by rehearſing theſe, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
their courages.</p>
                     <p>But as ſoone as <hi>Petreius,</hi>
all things being thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
had giuen the
ſignall by ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
he commands the
Cohorts to aduance a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16916:103"/>
the enemies. Army
doth the like. After they
came to that diſtance, from
whence the light armed
skirmiſhers might begin
the battle, they incounter
one another with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
noyſe, and hatefull
ſignes: they leaue their
Piles, and try the matter at
ſwords point. The Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes
mindefull of their
ancient vertue, preſſe
them hardly at hand fight,
the others reſiſt without
feare, on both ſides they
fought with much fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi>
with the readieſt
Souldiers is ingag'd in the
point of the Van-garde:
he ſuccours the diſtreſſed,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16916:103"/>
ſends in freſh ſupplies for
the wounded, prouides
for all euents: he himſelfe
fights brauely, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the enemy often: he
performes together all the
Offices of a valiant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and worthy Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Petreius,</hi> as ſoone as hee
ſaw <hi>Catiline,</hi> contrary to
his expectation, to make
a forcible impreſſion, he
brings on the Praetorian
Cohort vpon the middeſt
of his enemies, and kills
them being diſordered,
reſiſting here and there:
then he aſſailes the reſt on
both ſides, in flancke,
<hi>Manlius</hi> &amp; the <hi>Feſulan</hi> fall
with the firſt.</p>
                     <p>After that <hi>Catiline</hi> ſaw
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:16916:104"/>
his Troupes broken, and
himſelfe with ſome few
remaining; being minde.
full of his parentage and
former dignity, he runnes
amongſt the thickeſt of
his enemies, and fighting
there is ſlaine. But the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
being ended, then
might you diſcerne, how
much courage; &amp; ſtrength
of ſpirit had bin in <hi>Catilines</hi>
Army. For almoſt the ſame
place, which each man
maintained fighting, the
ſame his ſoule being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
he couered with
his body. But ſome few,
through the middeſt of
whom the Proetorian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
broke, made a ſtand
differently in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
yet all of them fell by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:16916:104"/>
faire wounds. As for <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
he was found amongſt
the carkeiſes of his foes,
far from his owne men,
breathing as yet his laſt;
and that fierceneſſe of
mind, which he poſſeſſed
liuing, he retained then
in his countenance.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly of all that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
neither in the fight
nor flight was any
free Cittizen taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Thus all of them alike
ſpared their owne, and
their enemies liues. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet did the Army of
the Roman people obtaine
a ioyfull and vnbloody vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
For euery man that
was moſt valiant, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſlaine, or went from
the field grieuouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16916:105"/>
But many who iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the Campe
for view or pillage, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vp the enemies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keiſes,
found ſome a
friend, others a gueſt or
a neere kinſman, yea there
were thoſe who knew their
very foes. Thus variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gladneſſe and griefe,
mirth &amp; mourning, were
moued throughout all
the Army.</p>

of his
nature, that
being feeble,
and of ſhort continuance,
it is ruled more by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
then vertue. For by a
contrary eſtimation, you
can find nothing more
great nor excellent; and
rather to nature, humane
induſtry is wanting, then
time or abilitie. But
the guide and ruler of
mans life is the minde:
which when it purſues
glory by the way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
it becommes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
able, powerfull
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16916:108"/>
and illuſtrious. Neither
ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds it in need of fortune:
for becauſe honeſty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
and other good
Arts, ſhe can neither giue
nor take from any man.
But if ſeduced with euill
deſires, it inclines lewdly
to ſlouth, and bodily
pleaſures, vſing perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
luſt for a ſeaſon;
when through idleneſſe,
ſtrong the time and wit are
decayed, in vaine is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
infirmity accuſed.
<hi>All Authours impute their
faults to the occaſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if men had as much
regard of goodneſſe, as
with earneſtneſſe they
purſue things impertinent,
profitleſſe, yea exceeding
dangerous, neither ſhould
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16916:108"/>
they be more gouerned,
then gouerne chaunces:
and ſhould proceed to
that pitch of greatneſſe,
whereas for mortals they
ſhould be eternized with
glory.</p>
                     <p>For as mankind is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of body and ſoule,
ſo all our actions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours
follow ſome the
diſpoſition of the body,
ſome of the ſoule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a faire face, great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
corporall ſtrength,
and all other things of this
kind, fade away in a ſhort
time, but the glorious
monuments of wit, like as
the ſoule, are immortall:
Finally, for the indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the body, and
fortune, as there is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16916:109"/>
ſo there is an
end: and all of them being
borne, dye, and increaſed,
waxe old. The mind is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted,

                     <p>By how much the more
their wickedneſſe is to be
wondred at, who being
addicted to carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
waſte their time in
ſlouth and riot; but the
wit, then which there is
nothing better, nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in humane nature, they
ſuffer to ruſt, through
idleneſſe and want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring;
when eſpecially
there are ſo many and ſo
different Arts of the

                     <p>But amongſt theſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracies,
commands, and
all care of publicke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
ſeeme not fit
to be deſired of me at this
preſent: for that neither
honour is giuen to vertue,
nor they, who by falſhood
haue got any power, were
thereby the more ſecured
or honeſted: <hi>For by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

nothing elſe but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16916:110"/>
for our paines, is a

vnleſſe perchance in ſuch
a man, whom a diſhoneſt

inforce to proſtitute his

                     <p>Now, amongſt other
imployments exerciſed by
the wit, the memory of
things done, ſerues for
moſt ſpeciall vſe; of whoſe
worth, becauſe many men
haue treated, I reſolue to
paſſe it ouer; withall, leſt
any man might thinke me
to commend my owne
ſtudy. And I doe beleeue
there will be ſome, who,
for that I haue decreed, to
ſpend my remaining
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16916:110"/>
yeeres far from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
will impoſe
the name of idleneſſe on
this my ſo great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
worke: ſuch verily,
to whom it ſeemes a
chiefe point of induſtry to
ſalute the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and by feaſting to
procure fauour: who if
they did but throughly
conſider, in what times I
obtained the Magiſtracy,
and what men could not
attaine it then: and after,
what perſons came to be
Senators; truely they
would coniecture, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſeruedly then out
of ſlouth, I had altred my
determination: and that
more profit would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to the Common-wealth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16916:111"/>
wealth out of my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then other mens
imployments.</p>
                     <p>For I haue often heard
<hi>Qu. Maximus, P. Scipio,</hi>
with many other famous
men of this Citty, vſually
ſay, when they beheld the
ſtatues of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
that their minds
were moſt vehemently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
to vertue. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not that waxe nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
had ſuch efficacy in
it: but through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of things former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, this flame was
kindled in theſe braue
mens breſts, neither
could it be firſt allayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their owne worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
had equallized the
others renowne &amp; glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:16916:111"/>
But contrariwiſe who
amongſt you all is of this
condition, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contend with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours
in wealth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
then in goodneſſe,
or induſtry? yea, vpſtarts,
who by vertue were wont
to vſher home nobility,
by ſtealth, nay, plaine rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
rather, aduance
themſelues to commands
and honours: as though,
the Praetourſhip, Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and other like dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
worthy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent;
and were not
eſteemed according to
their vertue which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them. But I haue
ranged too freely and
too farre, whilſt the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16916:112"/>
manners of the Citty
greeue and irke me.
Now I returne to

                     <p>In the ſecond Punicke

of the Romane name,
much waſted the wealth

atchieued many glorious

                     <p>After him his ſon <hi>Mici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſa</hi>

alone, <hi>Maſtanabal,</hi>
and <hi>Guluſſa</hi> his brethren
being dead of ſickeneſſe.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16916:114"/>
He begot <hi>Adherbal</hi> and
<hi>Hiempſal,</hi> and brought vp
<hi>Iugurth</hi> the ſonne of his
brother <hi>Maſtanabal,</hi> (whom
becauſe borne of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
<hi>Maſsiniſſa</hi> had left
priuate) with the ſame
education that he did his
owne children. who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone
as hee came to ripe
yeeres, excelling with
ſtrength, and comelineſſe
of countenance, but moſt
of all with an able wit, he
gaue not himſelfe ouer to
the corruptions of luxurie
and ſlouth; but (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of that Nation is)
to riding, darting, and
in race matches to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with his equals; and
though hee out-went all
men in glory, yet was hee
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:16916:114"/>
deare to them all: Beſides
he ſpent moſt of his time
in hunting: he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
the Lion, and other
wild beaſts, firſt, or with
the firſt: he did the moſt,
and ſpake leaſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>For which cauſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Micipſa</hi> reioyced
at the beginning, as dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that <hi>Iugurths</hi> vertue
would be an honour to
his Kingdome: yet when
he conſidered, that this
young man, (he himſelfe
being old, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
little,) improued
himſelfe more and more;
being much moued with
the occaſion, hee pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
many things in his
mind. The nature of men
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16916:115"/>
being couetous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and prone to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
their owne deſires; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the opportunity of
his owne and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
age, (which alſo for
hope of gaine, alters the
courſe of temperate men)
afforded him matter of
terrour; as likewiſe did
the Numidians affections
wholy bent vpon <hi>Iugurth;</hi>
from whom he was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that ſome ſedition or
warre would proceed, if
he ſhould treacherously
kill ſo worthy a perſon.</p>
                     <p>Being inuironed with
theſe difficulties, when he
ſaw that neither by force
nor fraude, he could op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
a man ſo popularly
beloued, he reſolues, for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16916:115"/>
that <hi>Iugurth</hi> was valiant of
hand, and deſirous of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
glory, to expoſe
him to dangers, and that
way to try his fortunes.
Thereupon in the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine
warre, when as
<hi>Micipſa</hi> was to ſend Aydes
of Horſe and Foote vnto
the people of Rome: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that either by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation
of his valour,
or the enemies furie he
would be ſoone ſlaine, he
giues him the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ouer thoſe Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
which he ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Spaine. But the euent
of this was farre otherwiſe
then he expected: For <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi>
as he was of an actiue
and ſharpe conceite, when
he found out the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16916:116"/>
of <hi>Pu. Scipio,</hi> Generall
as then for the Romanes,
and withall, the enemies
behauiour: by much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and much care, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
by obeying mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly,
and incountring
dangers willlingly, hee
came to that renoune in a
ſhort time, that to our
men he was very deare, to
the Numantines very
dreadfull: and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
(which is a thing
moſt difficult) he was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
in battle, and wiſe
in counſell; one of which
commonly out of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
begets feare, the
other out of boldneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
temerity.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Generall
performed for the moſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16916:116"/>
part all difficult affaires
by <hi>Iugurth,</hi> he rankt him
amongſt his friends, and
honoured him euery day
more then other; as one
whoſe counſell and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
neuer failed. To
theſe were adioined mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of mind, and
dexterity of wit, by which
qualities he aduantaged
himſelfe with the familiar
friendſhip of many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</p>
                     <p>At that time ſundry vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts,
and Noblemen
ſerued in our Armie,
who preferred riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which was good
and decent: being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
and powerfull at
home, more popular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
their companions,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16916:117"/>
then honeſt in themſelues:
who by promiſes had kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
great hopes in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi>
that when King <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipſa</hi>
once dyed, he alone
ſhould inioy the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Numidia: in him
there was a large portion
of vertue: at Rome all
things were to be ſold.</p>
                     <p>But after that, when
Numantia being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
<hi>P. Scipio</hi> reſolued
to diſmiſſe his Aydes,
and to returne home him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he brought <hi>Iugurth</hi>
(with intent to reward
and honour him) before
the aſſembly, into the
Praetorian Tent: And
there in ſecret gaue him
theſe admonitions: that
he ſhould rather publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16916:117"/>
then priuately obſerue
the friendſhip of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
people, that he ſhould
not accuſtome himſelfe to
particular largeſſes: thoſe
fauours would be bought
dangerouſly from ſome
few, in which many were
intereſſed: if he would be
conſtant to his owne
courſes, renowne and the
Kingdome would come
to him freely: but if hee
ſhould proceed with too
much haſte, he and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
would be ruined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>Hauing ſpoken thus, he
diſmiſſed him with letters,
which hee was to deliuer
vnto <hi>Miciſpa.</hi> The contents
of them were theſe.</p>
                     <p>The valour of thy <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:16916:118"/>
in the Numantine
warre, hath beene moſt
remarkable: which for
certaine I know reioyceth
thee: hee is for his merits
deare to vs; that hee may
be ſo to the Senate and
people of Rome, we ſhall
endeuour with all our
power: I am ſincerely
thankfull to thee for
our friendſhip. Behold,
you haue a man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of your ſelfe,
and his grandfather
<hi>Maſsiniſſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the King, as
ſoone as hee ſaw thoſe
things confirmed by the
Generals letters, which
he had formerly heard
by a common fame, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with the worth and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16916:118"/>
reſpect of the man, reſolues
to winne <hi>Iugurth</hi> with his
bounty: thereupon he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
him, &amp; by his teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ordained him coheire
with his ſonnes: But he
himſelfe after ſome few
yeeres, being ſpent with
ſickeneſſe and old age,
when he perceiued his end
of life to approach, was
ſaid to haue had theſe
words with <hi>Iugurth,</hi> his
friends, and kinſmen, and
his ſonnes being preſent.</p>
                     <p>I entertained thee into
my Kingdome (O <hi>Iugurth</hi>)
being a child left without
hope, without fortunes;
conceiuing that I ſhould
be as much indeared to
thee for my benefits, as if
I had beene thy naturall
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16916:119"/>
father: neither hath this
opinion deceiued me. For
to omitte others of thy
great and glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
returning lately
from Numantia, thou haſt
honoured both me and
my Kingdome with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;

                     <p>But oppoſitely ſome

preuailed, which before

which <hi>Micipſa</hi> held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

The chiefe of this

a man much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

would haue onely Aſia &amp;

on the Eaſt a ſpacious
breadth of declining land,
which place the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
call Carabathmon.
The ſea is rough without

of graine, fit for Cattell,

                     <p>But what people inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
Africke at firſt, and
who afterward arriued,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:16916:137"/>
and how they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled

although it differs
from the common report;
yet as it hath beene inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
vnto vs out of the

of that Country
thinke to be, I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in briefe. But the
credit of it ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the Authours.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning, the
Getulians and Libians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
Africke, a rough
and barbarous people:
whoſe food was the fleſh
of wild beaſts, and ſuch
fruites of the earth, as
Cattell eate. Theſe men
were gouerned neither
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16916:137"/>
by cuſtomes, Lawes, nor
Magiſtrates: wandring
diſperſt, they lodged
there where night infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
But after that <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
dyed in Spaine (as the
Africans doe coniecture,)
his Army being compoſed
of ſundry Nations (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
loſt their Captaine,
and many of the Leaders
affecting the chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
disbanded ſhortly
after. Of this number the
Medes, Perſains, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians
tranſported into
Affricke by ſhipping, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
vpon the Regions
confining on the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
ſea; the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
were inmoſt from
the Ocean; and they dwelt
in the Hulles of their
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16916:138"/>
ſhips turned vpſide down,
in lieu of Cottages: for
neither the ſoyle afforded
materials for building,
neither had they meanes
to buy or barter any from
the Spaniards. The great
Sea, and an vnknowne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
prohibited all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
                     <p>Theſe by degrees, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
with the Getulians,
intermingled themſelues
with them; and becauſe
trying the goodneſſe of
the paſture, they wandred
from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
Numidae. Now
euen to this day, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Peazart Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
which they terme
Mapalia, being very large,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:16916:138"/>
and couered with croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
tiles, doe reſemble
the bottomes of ſhips.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the Medes and
Armenians, the Lybians
adioyned themſelues, for
they liued next the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Sea; the Getulians
more neere the Sunne,
not farre from the skort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
heat, and theſe ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
inhabited Townes:
For being diuided from
Spaine by a narrow ſea,
they reſolued to trafficke
one with another. The
Lybians not long after
corrupted their names,
calling them in their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
language, Mauri,
for Medi.</p>
                     <p>But the eſtate of the
Perſians ſoone flouriſhed;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:16916:139"/>
and after that the Nomo-Numidians,
becauſe of
multitude forſaking their
parents, poſſeſſed that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory,
which lying next
to Carthage is named
Numidia. Then relying
on each others ſupport,
they inforced their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
either by Armes,
or the terrour of them,
vnto ſubiection: they got
a name and renowne:
thoſe eſpecially which
were ſeated neereſt to the
Mediterranean ſea. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lybians were
leſſe warlike then the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulians:
beſides, for that
all nether Africke is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
by the Numidians;
all the vanquiſhed were
incorporated into the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:16916:139"/>

Conquerours.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the Phaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
ſome for leſſening
the multitude at home,
ſome through the deſire
of rule hauing ſollicited
the Commons, and others
longing after nouelties,
built Hippon, Adrume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,

and theſe in ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as he had heard, from his

that all things at Rome
were venall: and withall
being inflamed with their

Theſe, becauſe the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

he endeuours to

find out ſome way of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory

falling out otherwiſe, and

what he intended, about

<hi>Scaurus,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he much
feared, with a few Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
hee comes into the

heauy comminations were
added, in caſe he ſhould
not deſiſt from the ſiege,

                     <p>After theſe things were

thereof, he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
ſomething at Rome
either by bribes or fauour:
after when he heard that
<hi>Scaurus</hi> was made a party
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:16916:155"/>
in his cauſe, he hauing
great hopes of procuring
peace, reſolued to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
with them perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
for a finall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.
But in this
meane time <hi>Sextus</hi> the
Treaſurer was ſent by the
Conſull for an hoſtage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Vacca, a towne of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurths:</hi>
the colour of this
miſſion was the receite of
corne that <hi>Calpurnius</hi> had
publikely impoſed on the
Ambaſſadours; becauſe
through the delay of their
ſurrender the truce was
prolonged.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to appointment,
comes into the Camp:
and hauing deliuered
ſome few words, the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:16916:155"/>
Counſell being preſent,
concerning the hatred of
his fact, and withall, that
he might be receiued to
mercy: the reſt he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
with <hi>Beſtia</hi> and
<hi>Scaurus</hi> in ſecret, then the
reſt of their opinions being
demanded by a promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
voting, he is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vpon termes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
But as it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
thirty Elephants,
much Cattell and Horſes,
with no ſmall ſummes of
money are deliuered to
the Treaſurer. <hi>Calpurnius</hi>
goes to Rome for the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Magiſtrates:
in Numidia, and our
Army peace was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:16916:156"/>
When ſome had diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the paſſage and the
manner of theſe African
affaires: at Rome in all
places, and all aſſemblies,
the Conſuls demeanour
was much ſpoken of: the
Commons were deepely
incenſed: the Fathers were
much troubled: whether
they ſhould approue a
crime of ſuch a high condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or nullifie the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuls
Decree. And chiefly the
power of <hi>Scaurus,</hi> becauſe
he was reported to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of this to <hi>Beſtia</hi> and
his confederate, hindred
them from courſes of
equity and conueniency.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Caius Memnius,</hi> (of
the freedome of whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and hatred of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16916:156"/>
Nobilities greatneſſe, we
haue formerly ſpoken)
betweene the doubts and
delayes of the Senate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
the people in his
Orations to reuenge: he
doth admoniſh them,
that they ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Common-wealth,
nor their owne liberty: he
repreſents many inſolent
and cruell outrages of the
Nobility: being wholly
bent to exaſperate the
mindes of the Commons.
But becauſe <hi>Memnius</hi> elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in thoſe times was
much ſpoken of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
at Rome, I
thought it expedient, to
render in writing one of
his Orations amongſt ſo
many: and eſpecially, I
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16916:157"/>
will relate that, which he
vttered in the aſſembly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p>For of faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
what hopes are

and perſwade you,
that yee doe not without

moneyes extorted from

<hi>For with impunitie to doe

                     </p>
                     <p>Neither doe I (ye Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes)

he ſubornes with a mighty

the Commons
were much offended with

ſhould be taken of

and appeaſed their

his aſſurance, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke

ſelfe remaine inuiolable.
Afterwards, when they
began to be ſilent, <hi>Iugurth</hi>
being produced, <hi>Memmius</hi>
ſpeakes. He relates his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
at Rome and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:16916:166"/>
he declares his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies

he did theſe things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Romane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
knew full well, yet
from him they would haue
them manifeſted more
plainely. If hee reuealed
the truth, great hope was
repoſed for him, in the
faith and clemencie of the
people of Rome: but if he
ſhould conceale it, hee
ſhould not for all that ſaue
his complices, but would
ruine himſelfe and his

                     <p>Vpon this, when <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>

Thus the people being

departed out of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.

There was at that time a

Therefore although in the

                     <p>By the arbitration of

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16916:181"/>
all other affaires ioyntly

abundance of victuals,
and all prouiſions beſides,
which in a doubtfull and
penurious warre are wont
to be vſefull. Finally, for
the accompliſhment of
this, the Senate with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
the Latine Nation,

of him by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Cittizens; as well for
his owne braue abilities, as
alſo for that hee carried a
minde inuincible againſt
riches: and through the
auarice of Magiſtrates, our
Forces had been formerly
defeated in Numidia, and
thoſe of the enemies had
beene augmented.</p>
                     <p>But as ſoone, as he came
into Africk, the Army was
deliuer'd ouer vnto him by

ſlothfull, vnwarlick, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient

of danger, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
more ready of

preyes from their

this new Generall, more
trouble did ariſe from
their euill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, then
ayde or comfort from
ſuch a number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
For all this <hi>Metellus</hi>
reſolued, (although the
prorogation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiall
meetings had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the Summer ſeaſon,
and that hee coniectured
the Cittizens minds to be
wholly bent vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the euent)
not firſt to make an aſſay
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:16916:182"/>
of warre, before he had

                     <p>For <hi>Albinus</hi> being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the defeat of his

after he had taken a
reſolution not to goe
forth of the Prouince; for
ſo much of the Summer,
as belonged to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he quartered his
Souldiers for the moſt
part in ſtanding Camps;
except when naſtineſſe or
want of forrage compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to change pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>But watches were not

cuſtome: euery man
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:16916:183"/>
as liſted, abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from his Colours,
the drudges of the Army
intermingled with the
Souldiers daily, &amp; nightly
made excurſions: and
wandring diſorderly, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the fields, forced the
villages, and contending
one with another, made
boote of ſlaues and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
which they bartered
with the marchants for
wine by them brought,
and other ſuch like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities:
beſides, they
ſold their ammunition
corne, and bought bread
daily: finally, whatſoeuer
blemiſhes proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſloth and luxury can be

                     <p>But in this difficulty I
find <hi>Metellus</hi> to haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelfe an able &amp; wiſe
man, no leſſe then he did in
actions of hoſtility; with
ſuch temperance he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
himſelfe betwixt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and cruelty. For
by his firſt Edict, he bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
all the helpes of
ſloth, ſo that no man
was to ſell in the Camp
bread, or any other meate
ready dreſſed: the drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were not to followe
the Army: the common
Souldier being incamped
or marching, was to haue
no ſlaue nor beaſt of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage:
to other abuſes by
Arte he preſcribed a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:16916:184"/>
Beſides, with croſſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
he remoued his Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p
euery day: no other-wiſe,
then if the enemies had
beene preſent, he fortified
it with Ditch and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier:
he diſpoſed the wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
often, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
rounded them with
the Lieutenants. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
vpon a march, hee
was ſometimes in perſon
preſent with the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,
ſometimes with
them of the Reare, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with thoſe of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ward; of purpoſe, that
no Souldier ſhould ſtirre
out of his Order: but that
they ſhould aduance in
one body together with
their enſignes, and carry
their owne victuals and
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:16916:184"/>
Armes. Thus more by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the liberty of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
then by puniſhing
offences, he in a ſhort
ſpace confirmed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth,</hi>
as ſoone as he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by his Intelligencers
of <hi>Metellus</hi> proceedings;
and withall being certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from Rome of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
grew diſtruſtfull
of his owne eſtate, and
then at length laboured to
make a reall ſurrender.
Thereupon he ſends Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull
by way of petition,
who ſhould requeſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life for himſelfe and
his children, all other
things they ſhould ſubmit
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:16916:185"/>
vp to the Romane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>But by former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it was well known
to <hi>Metellus,</hi> that the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian
Nation was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
inconſtant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of innouation.
Therefore he viſiteth the
Ambaſſadours ſeuerally,
one by one: and ſounding
them by degrees, after he
knew they were fit for his
turne, hee perſwadeth
them by many promiſes
to deliuer aboue all things
<hi>Iugurth</hi> aliue, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſlaine, into his hands:
but in publicke, thoſe
things which he thought
fitting hee commandeth
them to report to the
King.</p>

                     <p>There the orders being

which was neereſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

all the Horſe-men

and hauing incouraged
his Souldiers briefly for
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:16916:191"/>
the ſeaſon, hee drawes
downe his Army, as hee
had imbattailed it, into the
plaine, the frount of the

changed.</p>
                     <p>But when he perceiued
the Numidians not to ſtir,
nor to deſcend from the

the ſeaſon of the yeere, &amp;
ſcarcity of water, that his

with thirſt, hee ſent
before vnto the riuer <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi>
one of his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
with the light-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

a place for incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
thinking that the
enemies, with frequent
charging, and croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fights
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:16916:192"/>
would retard his
paſſage: and becauſe they
repoſed no truſt in their
Armes, would take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of the Souldiers
thirſt and wearineſſe.
Then he himſelfe, as the
occaſion and place requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
in that order as hee
deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

the Conſull
himſelfe was with the

wing, who vpon the

                     <p>But <hi>Iugurth,</hi> as ſoone as
he ſaw, that thoſe who

the bringers vp of <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
Reare, with a Guarde

hee poſſeſſeth the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
where <hi>Metellus</hi> made
his deſcent: leſt perchance
the enemies falling backe,
it might ſerue them for a
retreat, and after for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Then ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, vpon a

the enemies. Some of the
Numidians kill the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-moſt:
others aſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the right and left flanke:
in furious manner they
preſent themſelues, and
preſſe forward in all
places: they diſordered the
Rankes of the Romanes.
Of whom thoſe who with
moſt reſolution had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
the enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:16916:193"/>
deluded by this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
kind of fight, were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſomtimes wounded
from a far: neither had they
meanes to ſtrike againe,
nor to ioyne in hand-fight.</p>
                     <p>Before this the Horſe-men
being inſtructed by
<hi>Iugurth,</hi> whereſoeuer a
Troupe of Romanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

cloſely nor in one groſſe,
but in as much diſtance as
they could one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus being ſuperiour
in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, if they could not
deterre the enemies from
purſuing, they inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed
them, being diſperſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

detained.</p>
                     <p>But the face of all this
conflict was various, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,
foule and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
ſome being ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

there he reſiſteth and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it off: armes, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
horſes, men, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and Cittizens, were
blended together; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was done by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
nor command: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:16916:194"/>
ſwayed all. Therefore
moſt of the day was ſpent,
when then, yea euen then
the euent was doubtfull.</p>
                     <p>At length all men fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with toyle and heate,
<hi>Metellus,</hi> when he ſaw the
Numidians come on
more coldly, he rallieth by
degrees his Souldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one body: he reſtoreth
the Rankes, and oppoſeth
foure legionary Cohorts
vnto the enemies Foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
O them, a great
part being weary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
themſelues on the
higher grounds. Hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth,
and exhorteth
his Souldiers together,
that they would not faint,
nor ſuffer theſe flying ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to ouercome: that
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:16916:194"/>
they had neither Camp,
nor any fortification,
whither retiring they
might betake themſelues:
all the hopes they had lay
in their Armes.</p>
                     <p>But neither was <hi>Iugurth</hi>
in the meane time out of
action: he circu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reneweth the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and himſelfe with
ſome choſen men tryeth
all things to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt:
he ſuccoureth his
owne ſide, chargeth the
wauering enemies, by
fighting a farre off he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
their ſtay, whom
he knew to ſtand firme.
After this manner two
Generals, men moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
contended one
with another: themſelues
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:16916:195"/>
being equall, but their
helpes vnequall. For <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi>
was aduantaged by
his Souldiers valour, the
place was diſaduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous:
to <hi>Iugurth</hi> all other
things, but Souldiers, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
opportunely. Finally,
the Romanes, when they
vnderſtood, that they had
no place of refuge, and
that the enemy diſingaged
himſelfe from fight; and
that now the euening was
come, fell off, as they were
commanded, from the
oppoſite hillocke. The
place of battell being loſt,
the Numidians were row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and chaſed: ſome few
were ſlaine: the moſt part
ſwiftneſſe, and a Country
vndiſcouered of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:16916:195"/>
preſerued from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>In the intercourſe of
this, <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> (whom we
haue heretofore ſaid to
haue beene by <hi>Iugurth</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Commander ouer
the Elephants, and part
of the Foot-bands,) as
ſoone as <hi>Metellus</hi> had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-reached
him, hee
drawes out his men by
little and little into a
peece of euen ground;
and whileſt the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
haſtening, marcheth
to the riuer, whither hee
was fore-ſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tumult, as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
required, hee imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taileth
his Army: neither
is he ſlacke to diſcouer,
what the enemies ſhould
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:16916:196"/>
attempt any where.</p>
                     <p>After he was aduertiſed,
that <hi>Rutilius</hi> was ſat down,
and that now hee was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in mind; withall, that
the noiſe increaſed from
<hi>Iugurths</hi> fight; fearing leſt
the Lieutenant, the cauſe
being knowne, ſhould
aide his diſtreſſed friends,
he extendeth his Army
with a larger Frount,
which, diſtruſting the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of his Souldiers, hee
had skilfully diſpoſed, for
the impeaching of the
enemies paſſage; and in
this order hee aduanceth
towards <hi>Rutilius</hi> Camp.
The Romanes on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
obſerue a great riſing
of duſt: For the field be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſet with Coppiſes,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:16916:196"/>
did forbid all proſpect,
and at firſt they coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the ſand was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the wind: after,
when they ſaw that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
alike &amp; as the Army
moued, approached nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
the occaſion being
diſcouered, in haſte they
take Armes, and as they
were commanded, ſtand
faſt before the Campe.
Then as ſoone as they
came within conuenient
diſtance, with hideous
noiſe they incountred one
another.</p>
                     <p>The Numidians ſtayed
ſo long whilſt they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
aide from their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants:
after they ſawe
them intangled with the
boughes of the trees, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:16916:197"/>
being thus diſordered to
fetch a compaſſe about,
they betake themſelues
to flight: and caſting away
their Armes, for the moſt
part got-off in ſafety,
through the fauour of the
hillocke, and the night,
which was now at hand.
Foure Elephants were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
all the reſt, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
forty, were ſlaine.</p>
                     <p>But the Romanes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were faint
and weary, through their
iourney, the pitching of
their Tentes, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
yet for that <hi>Metellus</hi>
ſtayed longer then opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
being well ordered,
and reſolued, they march
forwards to meete him.
For the wilineſſe of the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:16916:197"/>
Numidians ſuffred no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
nor ſlackeneſſe. And
firſt the night being darke,
after they were come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
neere diſtance, with
the noiſe, as if it had been
of enemies comming on,
they raiſed both feare and
tumult amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
and through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table fact was
like to haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted,
except the Vantcurrours
ſent out from both ſides,
had diſcouered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Thereupon in ſtead of
feare, gladneſſe aroſe: the
Souldiers reioycing call
one another to witneſſe:
they relate, and heare
their exploits: euery man
extolleth his owne valiant
actes, euen to the skies.

that he was diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged
in fight by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:

Garriſons: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth

                     <p>Through the terrour

he, that was vnable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

In the meane time
much ioy was conceiued
at Rome vpon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

as for that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
himſelfe and his

that in a place of

by meere valour;
that he poſſeſſed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country: that <hi>Iugurth</hi>
bearing himſelfe proudly
vpon <hi>Aulus</hi> negligence,
he had conſtrained him
to repoſe the hope of
his ſafety in flight, or in
the deſarts. Thereupon the
Senate, for theſe things
happily done, decreed
ſupplications to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
gods. The Citty
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:16916:201"/>
trembling before, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doubtfull of the euent
of the warre, now ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her ſelfe with ioy. Of
<hi>Metellus</hi> an honorable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
was ſpred.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon by ſo much
the more eagerly he ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
for victory, making
all poſſible ſpeed in the
purſuite thereof: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cautelous from giuing
any opportunity to the
enemy; he well knew that
enuy attended on glory:
thus by how much the
more he was renowned,
by ſo much was hee the
more carefull: neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this ſtratagem of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurths,</hi>
did hee pillage any
more with his Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded.
When it was
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:16916:202"/>
needfull to prouide corne
or forrage, the Cohorts
with the Cauallery made
a ſtanding-guard. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
commanded one part
of the Army, <hi>Marius</hi> the
other. But more with fire,
then driuing of preyes
was the Country waſted.
In two ſeuerall places not

was requiſite to vſe force,
they ioyned all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
but for the further

fight: where hee heard,
that the enemy approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
hee ſpoileth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Fountaines, of
both which there was
much ſcarcity: ſometimes
he ſheweth himſelfe to

                     <p>The Romane Generall,
when he ſaw himſelfe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

to beleaguer Zama<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a great

would come to
releeue his people, being
in diſtreſſe, and ſo a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell

he being informed of this
by Fugitiues, with great
iournies ouer marcheth
<hi>Metellus,</hi> he exhorteth the
Cittizens to defend the

added for aydes; which

and the Romans being vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

without tumult

The Romanes (euery one

fight ſome with

ſtones miſſiuely caſt:
ſome giue backe, others
fall on; and now they ſap

aſſaileth with great

proſecuteth the aſſault,
heard from behind a cry,
and tumult of enemies:

Thoſe who were aranged

the reſidue quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:16916:208"/>
come to their ſuccours.
Neither could the Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
haue longer reſiſted,
but that their footmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled
with their
horſe-men had made a
great ſlaughter vpon the
firſt incounter: on whom
they relying, did not, as
it is vſuall in a battell of
horſe-men, fall on, and
then wheele about, but
they charged with
their horſes, meeting

                     <p>In the intercourſe of
this, they fought at Zama
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:16916:208"/>
with great violence;
where any Lieutenant of
a Legion, or Tribune
had charge, there they
ſtroue with moſt courage:
neither had any man more
hope in anothers helpe,
then in him ſelfe. The
like the Towneſ-men did:
they fought or were ready
for it in all places: more
eagerly they wounded
one another, then guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelues. The noiſe
was confounded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging,
gladneſſe and
groaning: beſides the
claſhing of Armes pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

the walls, when
the enemies ſlackned the

the horſe-battell. Then, as

as they could be heard, or

ſome of them admoniſh:
others incourage, or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
with their hands, or
bend with their bodies.
Hither and thither they
moue, as they were flying,
or diſcharging weapons.</p>
                     <p>Which as ſoone as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
knew (for hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in that part) hee
proceedeth more ſlacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then it was decreed;
&amp; counterfeiteth a diſtruſt
of the buſineſſe: hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth
the Numidians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:16916:209"/>
tumult to view the
Kings battell: thus they
being fixt vpon the care of
their owne ſide, on the
ſudden he aſſaulteth the
wall moſt forcibly: and
now the Souldiers quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their ſcaling ladders,
had almoſt ſurprized the
battlements, when as the
Towneſmen troope toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
they powre downe
ſtones, fire, and other
miſſiue weapons beſides.
Our men at firſt make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
after when one,
and then others of their
ladders were broken:
and thoſe who ſtood vpon
them were thrown down:
the reſt in the beſt manner
they could, fewe being
vnhurt, the greateſt part
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:16916:210"/>
wounded, make their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
At length night par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the fight on both
ſides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Metellus,</hi> when hee
ſaw that the enterpriſe

nor that <hi>Iugurth</hi> inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
fight, except it were
out of ambuſh, or places
by him choſen; and that
now the Summer was
ſpent, he departeth from
Zama, and in thoſe Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which had reuolted
from him, and were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
fortified with
walls or ſituation, hee
placeth Garriſons. The

he diſpoſeth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
next to Numidia,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:16916:210"/>
in regard of wintring
there. Neither doth hee
afford that time, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were wont, to reſt
and riot, but becauſe the
warre had but meane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
by Armes, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſnares for the King
by his friends, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to vſe their perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
for Armes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore with many
promiſes he aſſaieth <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>
who had beene at
Rome, and ſecretly baile
being giuen, had eſcaped
Iudgement for killing
<hi>Maſsiua;</hi> becauſe that hee
by meanes of his neereſt
friendſhippe had the beſt
meanes of deceiuing: and
firſt he wrought, that hee
ſhould come to him in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:16916:211"/>
vnder the colour of
conference: then by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his faith, that if hee
deliuered <hi>Iugurth</hi> aliue or
ſlaine, he ſhould be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Senate would
grant him impunity, and
whatſoeuer was his owne,
he eaſily perſwadeth the
Numidian, being as well
of a faithleſſe diſpoſition,
as alſo fearefull, that if
peace were made with
the Romanes, he vpon
the conditions ſhould be
deliuered ouer to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He, as ſoone as the

viſiteth <hi>Iugurth,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
and bewailing his

him, that at length

he would prouide for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
his children, and
the Numidian people,
which had beſt deſerued:

were taken and ſlaine,
the ſtrength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was exhauſted:
enough oftentimes had

and the Souldiers

haughtineſſe of ſpirit, a

wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred at his purpoſe,

that all things were not

his preſent eſtate ought to

through greedineſſe
and anger, two of the
worſt counſellers, neither
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:16916:216"/>
abſtained hee from any

might ſauour of ambition:
the Souldiers, whom hee
commanded in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
Garriſons, he vſed
with a more gentle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
then before hee
had done: to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
of whom there
was a great multitude at
Vtica, hee ſpoke reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and boaſtingly of
the warre: that ſhould the
moity of the Army bee
granted to him, in a few
dayes he would haue <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi>
bound in chaines:
that the Generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
of purpoſe, for
that being a vaine man,
and of a kingly pride, he
delighted too much in
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:16916:217"/>
command: all which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
ſeemed to them
the more firme, becauſe
through the continuance
of the warre they had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
their priuate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
<hi>and to a mind full of
deſire nothing proceedeth with
ſpeed enough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreouer there was in
our Army a certaine Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midian,
<hi>Gauda</hi> by name,
the ſonne of <hi>Mastanabal,</hi>
the nephew of <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi>
whom <hi>Micipſa</hi> by teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had made his ſecond
heire, a man ſpent with
diſeaſes, and by that
meanes ſomewhat crazed
in mind. To whom peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning,
that after the
manner of Kings, hee
might place his chaire
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:16916:217"/>
equally with him, and
then, that for his Guard
he might haue a Troupe
of Roman Gentlemen,
<hi>Metellus</hi> had denyed both:
the honour, becauſe it was
proper to them, whom the
people of Rome intituled
Kings: the Guarde, for
that it would bee diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to them, if Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Gentlemen ſhould be
attendants on a Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
Him being diſquieted
<hi>Marius</hi> viſiteth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth,
that hee would
ſeeke to reuenge theſe
diſgraces vpon the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
by his aſſiſtance. The
man being ſcarce ſound
in mind by reaſon of his
diſeaſes, he extolleth him
with this fauourable
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:16916:218"/>
ſpeech: that hee was a
King, a great man, that
he was to enjoy forthwith
the Kingdome of Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:
this would ſo much
the ſooner come to paſſe,
if he himſelfe might bee
ſent Conſull to this
warre.</p>
                     <p>Therefore both him,
and the Romane Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
both Souldiers and
Marchants, ſome he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
others the hope of
peace procured, that they
wrote to their friends at
Rome vnworthily of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi>
concerning the war,
that <hi>Marius</hi> they required
for Generall. Thus for
him the Conſulſhip was
ſued for by many men,
with a moſt honeſt ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:16916:218"/>
Beſides the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
at that time, the

whatſoeuer hee intended,
fell out vnluckily.</p>

ſheweth himſelfe with

as the time would giue
leaue, were ordered and
aranged by <hi>Iugurth.</hi> Then
forthwith the battell is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
In that part where
the King was preſent in

for a while: all the reſt of
his Souldiers were broken
and chaſed vpon the firſt

tooke ſome Enſignes,
Armes, &amp; priſoners. For in
all battels, for the moſt

more beholding to their

flight <hi>Iugurth</hi> now more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
diſtruſting his

he arriueth firſt in

much of their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <p>Which things when

dry and waſte yet hoping
to finiſh the warre, if hee
could gaine that Towne,
he vndertaketh to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

in ſtead whereof, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles

Againe, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth

much raine powred
downe from the sky, that
it was ouer and aboue
enough for the Army.
Beſides they had victuals
more then they expected:
for that the Numidians,
as moſt men doe vpon a
new ſurrender, ſtretched
their diligence vnto the
vtmoſt. But the Souldiers
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:16916:231"/>
out of a kind of religion
made moſt vſe of the
raine: and that added
much to their courages:
for they thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
to be the care of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
gods: the next
day following, contrary to
<hi>Iugurths</hi> opinion, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
at Thala.</p>
                     <p>The Towneſmen, who
thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fortified
with the impregnableneſſe
of the place, being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with this great and
ſtrange accident, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
prouide for the
warre: our men doe the
like. But the King now
deeming nothing to be
impoſſible vnto <hi>Metellus,</hi>
as one who had ſubdued
by his induſtry all armes,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:16916:232"/>
weapons, places, times,
nay nature it ſelfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
other things:
by night he flieth out of
the Towne with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a great part of
his treaſure: and ſtaying
not longer in any one
place then a day or
night, he gaue out colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,
that his buſineſſe
cauſed him to make this
haſt: but indeed he feared,
Treaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he thought
to ſhun by celerity: for ſuch
deſignes are fathered by
idleneſſe and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Metellus,</hi> when he
ſaw the towneſmen reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to fight, and that it
was a ſtrong Peere, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Workes,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:16916:232"/>
and ſituation, he ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the walls with a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuallation.
Then hee
commandeth them from
that place, which was
moſt fitting for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to bring their vine
Engines forwards, and
aboue them to raiſe a
Rampier; and Towres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raiſed vpon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
thus to ſecure the
worke &amp; the labourers. To
preuent this, the Towneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
vſe all poſſible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and preparations:
nothing was left vndone
by either ſide. Finally, the
Romanes tired out with
much labour &amp; fight, after
40. dayes that they came
thither, onely got the
Towne: all the prey was
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:16916:233"/>
ſpoiled by the fugitiues.
They, when they ſaw the
walls battered with the
Rammes, and their eſtate
growne deſperate, carried
the gold, ſiluer, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
into the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
there, being laden
with wine, and viands,
they burne both that, the

which they feared
from their enemies, they
willingly inflicted on
ſelues.</p>

                     <p>At what time the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians
ruled ouer moſt
of Africke, the Cyrenians
alſo were rich and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
the Frontier betwixt
them was ſandy and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme;
there was neither
mountaine, nor riuer to
diſtinguiſh their borders:
which cauſe kept them in
a great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vndiſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
warre. After their
Armies and Fleetes had
beene often beaten and
chaſed on both ſides, and
that they had much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
one anothers
ſtrength; they fearing that

a third party would in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uade

&amp; conquered; taking truce,
they make an agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that
vpon a day appointed,
their Ambaſſadors ſhould
depart from their ſeuerall
homes; at what place they
met one another, that
ſhould be the common
border of both Nations.
Vpon this, two brethren
being ſent from Carthage,
whoſe names were the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leni,</hi>
made haſt in their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
the Cyrenians went
more ſlowly. Whether this
happened by negligence
or caſualty, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                     <p>Beſides, in thoſe places
a tempeſt no otherwiſe

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:16916:236"/>
paſſage. For when as the
wind ariſing on plaine
grounds, and bare of
trees, hath raiſed vp the
ſand from the earth, that
being carried with great
violence filleth both the
mouth and eyes: thus
proſpect being hindred,
the iourney is ſtaid.</p>
                     <p>After the Cyrenians ſaw
that they were ſomewhat
the hindermoſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their neglect, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
puniſhment at home;
they taxed the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
that departing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time from their
place of habitation, they
had diſturbed the Treaty;
finally they would rather
doe any thing then depart
vanquiſhed. But when the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:16916:237"/>
Carthaginians required
any other condition, ſo it
were equall, the Grecians
put the Carthaginians to
their choice, that either
they ſhould bee buried

deſired borders for their
people, or that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vpon the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
might proceed
whither they would. The
<hi>Philenians</hi> allowing the
condition, gaue vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and their liues to
the Common-wealth thus
were they interred aliue.
In that place the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians

                     <p>Beſides, the daughter

that bond is meanely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded

more then so. Thus the
mind is diſtracted with

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:16916:239"/>
of an equall: they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
held deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon, in a place

the Army meets: then
faith being giuen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

<hi>Iugurth</hi> inflameth <hi>Bocchus</hi>
with this ſpeech: <hi>That
the Romanes were vniuſt,
of vnſatiable auarice,
the common enemies of all
mankind: that they had the
ſame cauſe of warre with</hi>
Bocchus, <hi>as with himſelfe
and all other Nations, euen
the deſire of rule; vnto whom
all Kings were oppoſites: then
he himſelfe, a little before the

enemy to the Romanes.</hi>
Theſe, and ſuch like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
paſſing, they direct
their iourney to the towne
of Cirtha: for that <hi>Q. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi>
had lodged there the
prey, priſoners, and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
Thus <hi>Iugurth</hi> thought
that either the City being
taken, it would be a worke
worth his labour: or if the
Roman Generall came to
their ſuccours, they ſhould
come to the tryall of a
maine battell: for in cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
he made haſte onely
to diſinable <hi>Iugurths</hi> peace,
leſt by exerciſing delayes,
hee ſhould deſire ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>The General, when he had
heard of the Confederacy
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:16916:240"/>
of the Kings, he doth not
raſhly, neither as he was
often accuſtomed to doe,
(<hi>Iugurth</hi> being vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed)
preſent in all places
free meanes to fight: but
not farre from Cirtha his
Camp being fortified, he
expecteth the Kings: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it beſt, after he had
made ſome triall of the
Moores, (becauſe they
came as freſh enemies,)
to fight at his beſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
In the meane time he
is certified from Rome by
letters, that the Prouince
of Numidia was giuen to
<hi>Marius:</hi> for he had heard
before, that he was made
Conſull: with which ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
being troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
al decency, he neither
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:16916:240"/>
could refraine teares, nor
moderate his tongue; the

which ſome conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bee pride in him: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
a good diſpoſition
prouoked with diſgrace:
many men thought it was,
becauſe the victory already
gotten, was wreſted out of
his hands: to vs it is well
enough knowne, that hee
was more vexed with
<hi>Marius</hi> honour, then with
his proper iniury: neither
would he haue ſuffred it
with ſo much anxiety, if
the Prouince taken away,
had beene aſſigned to any
but <hi>Marius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore being diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:16916:241"/>
with this griefe, and
becauſe it ſeemed a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
part to take care of
anothers charge with his
owne danger, hee ſends
Ambaſſadours to King
<hi>Bocchus,</hi> to require him,
that without cauſe hee
would not become an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the people of Rome:
that he had a faire oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of contracting a
League and friendſhip,
which would be better
then warre. Although he
was confident in his owne
ſtrength, yet hee ought
not to change vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for certainties: al warre
was vndertaken with eaſe,
but concluded with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
not in the ſame
mans power lay the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:16916:241"/>
&amp; ending of it: it
was lawfull for euery man,
yea for a coward to begin:
it was to be laid aſide, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Conquerours would:
therefore hee ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for himſelfe, and his
Kingdome; neither ſhould
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mixe his flouriſhing
and <hi>Iugurths</hi> deſperate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
together.</p>
                     <p>To this the King anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
calmely enough: that
himſelfe deſired peace:
but that he tooke compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Iugurths</hi> eſtate: if
the ſame liberty were
granted to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all things
would be ſoone agreed
on. Againe the Generall,
to incounter <hi>Bocchus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds,
ſendeth other
Meſſengers: he alloweth
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:16916:242"/>
his propoſitions in part,
others he reiecteth. In this
manner by ſending and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſending
Meſſengers from
both ſides, time paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and according to
<hi>Metellus</hi> will, the warre
was protracted without
action.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Marius</hi> (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaid)
being made Conſull
through the earneſtneſſe
of the Commons, after
the people had decreed
Numidia for his Prouince,
he being heretofore incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againſt the Nobility,
did as then frequently and
fiercely preſſe them: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he offended particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
ſometimes the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
he ſpake publickly,
that he got the Conſulſhip
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:16916:242"/>
as ſpoiles from them, being
vanquiſhed; with other
words beſides glorious for
himſelfe, greuous for them.
In the meane time, his firſt
care is to prouide things
vſefull for the warre: hee
requireth a ſupply for the
Legions: he ſendeth for
aydes from the Nations,
Kings, and Confederates:
moreouer, he inuiteth all
the flowre of Latium,
moſt of them knowne to
him in the warres, few by
report; and by his ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he draweth thoſe,
who had out-ſerued their
military yeeres, to goe
this iourney with him: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the Senate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it were aduerſe,
dare to deny him concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:16916:243"/>
any buſineſſe: but
euen with gladneſſe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him a ſupply, becauſe
it was thought the warre
was not pleaſing to the
Commonalty, and <hi>Marius</hi>
ſhould either loſe his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in it, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the vulgar. But that
hope proued vain: ſo much
deſire had poſſeſſed moſt
men to go with <hi>Marius.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man was perſwaded,
that he ſhould be inriched
with the prey; that hee
ſhould returne home vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
and harboured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                        </gap>h not
a little incouraged them
with his ſpeech. For after
all things being decreed,
which he required, he had
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:16916:243"/>
an intent to inroll Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
as well for exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
ſake, as alſo for
exaſperating the Nobility:
according to his cuſtome,
he ſummoneth an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the people: then
ſpake he after this manner.</p>

                     <p>Thus to this age haue I
conuerſed from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that to all labours
and dangers I haue beene
accuſtomed. What I did
freely before your benefits
beſtowed, it is not my
counſell (O ye Romanes)
to neglect, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a reward for it.</p>
                     <p>It is a hard matter for

You haue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to wage warre
with <hi>Iugurth;</hi> a thing which
the nobility hath brooked
impatiently. I beſeech
you weigh with your
ſelues, whether it might
proue better to change
this your purpoſe, if you
ſhould find out of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Nobility, ſome
man or other of ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
of many ſtatues and

and take ſome Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian

to ſeeke another Generall
for himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>But I know (O ye Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes)
thoſe, who after
they were made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,
did beginne to reade
the acts of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
&amp; the military pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Graecians;
praepoſterous men as they
are. <hi>For to gourne, then to
be made a gouernour, is a thing
later in time; firſt in nature
and vſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Compare now (O yee
Romanes) with their pride
me, that am a new man,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:16916:246"/>
what things they are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to heare; and
reade, I my ſelfe haue
partly ſeene, partly acted,
what they haue learned in
bookes, I haue in military
ſeruice. Now doe you
make a coniecture whether
deedes or words are of
moſt accompt. They deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe
my nouelty, I their
pride. Fortune to me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches
to them are obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Although I thinke
that there is one nature &amp;
common to all, but euery
man that is moſt valiant to
be moſt noble. And if now
it could be demanded of
the fathers of <hi>Albinus</hi> and
<hi>Beſtia,</hi> whether they had
rather, that I or thoſe were
begotten of them, what
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:16916:247"/>
thinke you, they would
anſwer, but that they
would deſire the beſt of
men for their children?</p>
                     <p>But if iuſtly they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe
me, let them doe the
like to their Anceſtours:
to whom, euen as to me,
from vertue Nobility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
They enuy my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
therefore let them
enuy my labour, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and dangers: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by thoſe I got that.
But theſe men corrupted
with pride, liue ſo, as if
they contemned your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:
they ſue for them
in that manner, as if they
had liued honeſtly. <hi>No tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are deceiued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
expect things moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant,
the pleaſure of ſlouth,

and the rewards of vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, when they
ſpeake amongſt you, or
in the Senate, they magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their Anceſtours in
moſt of their ſpeeches:
by relating their valiant
acts, they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the more renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
which is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
for by how much
their life is the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
by ſo much the
more is theſe mens ſlouth
the more infamous. And
truely thus ſtands the caſe:
<hi>The glory of Anceſtours is a
light to poſterity, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth
neither their good, nor
euill deedes to lye concealed.</hi>
Of this I am wanting (O
ye Romanes.) But that
which is by farre more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:16916:248"/>
I can lawfully
ſpeake of my owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</p>
                     <p>Now behold how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt
they are: what they
arrogate to themſelues
from others vertue, that
they grant not to me for
my owne: forſooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I haue not ſtatues,
and becauſe my Nobility
is new; which queſtionles
it is better to haue gotten
then to deface being once
receiued. Verily I am not
ignorant, that if they
would forthwith anſwere
me, their ſpeech would be
very eloquent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
But in this your

in all places they rent with
their calumnies, both me
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:16916:248"/>
and you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

becauſe if true, it
muſt needs ſpeake well, if

confute it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your Counſels are
accuſed, who haue impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                     <p>I cannot for procuring

                     <p>My words are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:

Neither haue I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

I had ſmall pleaſure to

learne that, becauſe it
hath nothing auailed the

purſuite of vertue: But
thoſe other things I haue
beene taught, moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
as to charge
the enemy, to ſtand vpon

alike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Winter and

I will incourage my
Souldiers: neither will I
entertaine them with Art,
my ſelfe with plenty, nor
make their labour my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
This is a profitable,
this is a ciuill way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:16916:250"/>
For when thou
thy ſelfe ſhalt liue dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

to be a Lord, not a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                     <p>By doing theſe and ſuch

On whoſe worth, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

Their Predeceſſours

                        <pb n="491" facs="tcp:16916:250"/>

becauſe I doe not
curiouſly enough ſet
forth a banket, nor haue
euer a Stage-player of my

higher prized, then my Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe.
Which is a pleaſure
for me to confeſſe (O yee
Romanes.) For I haue
learned from my father;
and other deuoute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that neatneſſe for
women, labour for men
is moſt conuenient: and
that it behoueth all good
men to poſſeſſe more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

then wealth; that armes,
not vtenſils are an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>But therefore what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
them, what they
eſteeme dearely, let them

whore, &amp; drink: wher they
haue waſted their youth,
there let them ſpend their

theſe are more delightfull
then bankets.</p>
                     <p>But the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
For where as theſe

themſelues with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
crimes, they ſeeke
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:16916:251"/>
to take by violence the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the vertuous.
Thus moſt vniuſtly riot, &amp;

                     <p>Now, becauſe I haue

ſpeake a few words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
Firſt of all (O ye

Numidia: what helpes
haue hitherto ſupported
<hi>Iugurth,</hi> you haue remoued

Neither let any

I may ſelfe in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

<hi>For no man by ſlouth was

                     <p>But the Conſull, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions

through the leuity of his

the Conſull, as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,
marcheth to the

Caſtles: ſome by force,

were meane,
thinking that <hi>Iugurth</hi> for

when he heard that he was

                     <p>There lay amongſt the
vaſt deſarts, a faire Towne
and ſtrong, (called Capſa)
whoſe founder <hi>Hercules</hi> the
Lybian was ſaid to bee.
The Citizens were priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by <hi>Iugurth,</hi> liuing
vnder a gentle command,
and for theſe reſpects,
were held moſt faithfull:
They were fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
enemies not onely
with walls, armes and
Souldiers, but that which
is much more, with the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:16916:257"/>
roughneſſe of the Region:
for beſides the places next
to the Towne, all the reſt
were waſt for want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring,
skant of water, &amp;
infeſted with Serpents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whoſe violence, as of all
other wilde beaſts, growes
more outragious, by the
ſcarcity of meate. Beſides,
the nature of Serpents
pernicious in it ſelfe, is
more inflamed with thirſt,
then any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>Of gaining this piece
an earneſt deſire poſſeſſed
<hi>Marius,</hi> as well for the vſe
of the warre, as alſo for
that it ſeemed a difficult
matter; and <hi>Metellus</hi> had
with great glory taken the
Towne of Thala, ſeated
and fortified not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:16916:257"/>
but that at Thala
there were ſome foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
not far from the
walls. The Capſians had
onely one ſpring of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that within
the Towne, as for the reſt,
they vſed raine. That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
both there,
and in all Africke, which
being far from the ſea, lay
vncultiued, is ſuffred with
leſſe greeuance, becauſe
the Numidians for the
moſt part fed on milke,
and the fleſh of wilde
beaſts, and neither ſought
for ſalt nor other prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of gluttony: food
ſerued them againſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirſt, not for luſt
nor luxury.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Conſull,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:16916:258"/>
all things being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
relying as I thinke
on the gods (for againſt
ſo great difficulties hee
could not ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
by counſell: becauſe
alſo he was aſſailed with
want of Corne: for that
the Numidians are more
addicted to grazing of
Cattell then tillage, and
whatſoeuer croppe was
growne, they had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Kings command
in places of ſtrength: but
the fields at that time were

for it was the laſt of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
doth notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he could, make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
with prouidence
enough: he giueth out all
the Cattell, which he had
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:16916:258"/>
formerly gotten by preda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be driuen by the
Auxiliary horſe-men: hee
commandeth <hi>A. Manlius</hi>

                        </gap>is,
where he had placed
the pay and victuals: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
going to take preyes,
meant to be there within
a few dayes. Thus his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
being concealed,
he marcheth to the riuer
Tana.</p>
                     <p>But as he trauailed, he
diſtributed the Cattell
daily by equall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vnto his Army,
throughout the Centuries,
and Horſe-troupes; and
tooke order that bottles
might be made of the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:16916:259"/>
hides: thus together hee
eaſed the want of Corne,
and all men being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his purpoſe, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
thoſe things, which
would be forthwith vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Finally on the ſixth
day, when they came to
the riuer, a great number
of bottles was made.</p>
                     <p>There the Campe being
pitched with a ſlight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Souldiers to eate,
and to march out with the
ſetting of the Sunne; that
all the baggage being quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they ſhould with
water onely lade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and the beaſts of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Then when the time
came, he iſſueth forth of
the Camp; and hauing tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:16916:259"/>
all the night, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth:
he doth the ſame on
the next: and the third
long before day light, he
arriueth in a place full of
little hilles, not diſtant
aboue two miles from
Capſa: and there as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly
as he could, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a ſtand with all his
Army. But as ſoone as it
was open day, and the
Numidians fearing no
hoſtility, came forth of
the Towne in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
he ſuddenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
all the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and with theſe the
nimbleſt Foot-men to
march to Capſa with full
ſpeed, and to blocke vp
the gates: thereupon hee
himſelfe being intentiue,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:16916:260"/>
followeth haſtily, neither
doth he ſuffer the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to pillage.</p>
                     <p>Which things when the
Towneſ-men knew; their
deſperate eſtate, their
mighty feare, the vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
miſchiefe, together
with a great part of their
Citizens in the hands of
enemies, inforced them
to make a ſurrender. But
the Towne was burnt, the
Numidian youth were
ſlaine, all the reſt were ſold:
the prey was deuided to
Souldiers. This outrage
contrary to the Law of
Armes, was not done
through the auarice or
miſchieuous diſpoſition
of the Conſull: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the place was for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi>
                        <pb n="511" facs="tcp:16916:260"/>

                     <p>After <hi>Marius</hi> had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

aboue meaſure: the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:16916:261"/>

there was a ſufficient
proportion of Souldiers,
Armes, and Corne, beſides
a Fountaine of water: by
meanes of the Bulwarkes,
Towres, and other workes,
it was ſcarce aſſaultable:
the way to the Caſtle was

were raiſed to no

danger: for as ſoone as
they aduanced neuer ſo

doe their dutie amongſt

                     <p>But <hi>Marius</hi> much time
and labour being ſpent,
anxiouſly pondered in his
minde, whether he ſhould
deſiſt from this enterprize,
becauſe it had ſucceeded
ill, or ſhould expect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
which he had often

this, when he had medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
doubtfully many dayes
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:16916:263"/>
and nights, by chance a
certaine Ligurian, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldier of the auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
Cohorts, going out
of the Campe to water, not
farre from the ſide of the
Caſtle, which was oppoſite

Snailes creeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

them when he had ſought
to get one or two, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
more; through
the deſire of gathering, he
aſcended by degrees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the top of the

chance a great Holme tree
grewe in that place

for that all the Numidians

                     <p>All things being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
which he thought

hee goeth backe the

                        <hi>Marius:</hi> he informeth him
what hee had done: hee
doth perſwade him, that
on that ſide, from whence
he deſcended, he would
aſſaile the Caſtle: he doth
promiſe, that he would be
chiefe in the enterprize
and danger. <hi>Marius</hi> ſent
ſome of thoſe, who were
preſent with the Ligurian,
to informe himſelfe better
of his promiſes: of whom,
as euery mans diſpoſition
ſerued, ſo they brought
backe word, that it was
facill or difficult. Yet the
Conſuls minde was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
incouraged.</p>
                     <p>Therefore out of the

and with theſe, foure

all to obey the Ligurian,
and appointeth the next
day for that ſeruice. But
as ſoone as the time came
ordained by command, all
things being prepared and

                     <p>Vpon this, the Liguri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

hee raiſed with his

Therupon they being

and amongſt the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:16916:267"/>
he had beene left at
Rome. But becauſe the
occaſion doth admoniſh
vs of ſo braue a man, it
ſeemeth expedient to
ſpeake briefely of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and manners: and <hi>L.
Siſenna,</hi> who hath proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it moſt exactly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
amongſt all thoſe
who haue treated of that
ſubiect, ſeemeth to me not
to haue ſpoken with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
enough.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Sylla</hi> was a
Nobleman of a Patrician
race, his Family being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
extinguiſh'd through
the ſlouth of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
he was learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and that moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
in the Greeke and
Latine tongue, he was of
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:16916:268"/>
a haughty mind, greedy
of pleaſures, but more
greedy of honour: in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
times hee was luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
yet pleaſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hindred him from
his buſineſſe, excepting
that concerning his wife,
which might bee more
honeſtly interpreted: he
was eloquent, crafty and
facill in friendſhip: to
ſhaddow his affaires,
the height of his wit was
incredible: hee was a
giuer of many things, but
moſt ſpecially of mony:
and to him being the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
of all men, before the
ciuill victory, Fortune was
neuer aboue his induſtry:
and many men doubted
whether he were more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:16916:268"/>
or fortunate: for
thoſe things, which hee
did afterwards, I am vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,

                     <p>Therefore <hi>Sylla,</hi> as hath

<hi>Marius</hi> Campe with the

required that of no man:
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:16916:269"/>
he rather indeuoured this,
that moſt men might be his
debtours. He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
his paſtimes, and
ſerious affaires euen with
the meaneſt: in the works,
in marching, and at the
watches, he was moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
preſent: neither in the

loſt the Towne of Capſa,
with other places of
ſtrength commodious for
himſelfe, and withall a
great maſſe of mony, he
ſendeth Meſſengers vnto
King <hi>Bocchus,</hi> that hee
ſhould come with all
ſpeed into Numidia, that
the ſeaſon ſerued to giue
battell: whom when hee
heard to make delayes,
and doubtfully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the meanes both of
warre and peace: againe,
as before, hee corrupteth
thoſe that were next vnto
him, with gifts: and hee
promiſeth vnto the Moore
himſelfe a third part of
Numidia, if either the
Romanes were driuen out
of Africke, or the war were
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:16916:270"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pounded, his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bocchus</hi> allured with
this reward, goeth ouer to
<hi>Iugurth</hi> with a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
Thus both their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being ioyned, they
ſet vpon <hi>Marius</hi> now mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
into his winter Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons,
ſcarce a tenth part
of the day being left:
thinking that the night,
which was now at hand,
would be a ſafegard to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
being va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed, &amp; if they

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore as ſoone as
the Conſull was informed
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:16916:270"/>
by many of the enemies
comming, the enemies
themſelues were alſo come:
and before the army could
be imbattayled, or the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
gathered together; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
before it could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

with ſudden feare,

to iſſue forth to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:16916:271"/>

without Enſignes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rankes, the Horſe and

ſome fell: others kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
many circumuented
thoſe from behind, who
ſought eagerly againſt
thoſe who oppoſed them
in frount: neither valour
nor Armes defended ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently;
for that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and euery where diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed

themſelues into round bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions;
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:16916:271"/>
&amp; ſo being equally
defended, and ordered on
all parts, they ſuſtained the
enemies impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Neither in this ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a buſineſſe was <hi>Marius</hi>
terrified, or deiected in
mind any more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
but with his owne
Troupe of Horſe, (which
he had raiſed rather out of
the moſt valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then out of
thoſe, which were moſt
his familiears) he courſeth
vp &amp; downe euery where:
and ſome times he ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his owne men being
diſtreſſed: ſometimes he
aſſaileth the enemies with
his owne hand, whereas
being thickeſt, they made
moſt reſiſtance. He adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his Souldiers, becauſe
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:16916:272"/>
all of them being diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
hee could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                     <p>And now the day was
ſpent, when as yet the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
grewe nothing
ſlacke: and thinking the
night to aduantage them,
as the Kings had giuen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they fell on more
fiercely. Then <hi>Marius</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
counſell from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of his affaires: and
that he might haue a place
of retreate for his owne
men, hee ſurprizeth two
hillockes being neere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
in one of which,
not large enough for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping,
there was a
goodly fountaine of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
the other was oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
for vſe, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:16916:272"/>
for the moſt part high
and ſteepe, it needed little
fortifying. Beſides, hee
commandeth <hi>Sylla</hi> to ſtay
all night at the water with
the Horſemen. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
reallieth by degrees
the disbanded Souldiers
into one Groſſe, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being no leſſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
Then he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them all with a full
march vnto the hillocke.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Kings infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with the difficulty of
the place, are deterred
from the fight. But both
hillockes being inuironed
with the multitude, and
not ſnffering their owne
men to depart further,
they quartered ſeuerally.
Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, many fires being
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:16916:273"/>
made, the Barbarians for
moſt part of the night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
boaſt, and make
great outcries according
to their cuſtome: and the
Captaines themſelſelues
were proud, becauſe they
fled not; and carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
as if they had beene
victorious.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe paſſages
were eaſily diſcerned by
the Romanes, out of the
darkeneſſe, and the higher
places; and ſerued them
for a great incouragement.
But moſt of all, <hi>Marius</hi>
being confirmed by the
vnskilfulneſſe of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
commandeth the
greateſt ſilence to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.
Not ſo much as
the warlike inſtruments
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:16916:273"/>
did ſound at the ſetting of
the watches. Then as ſoon
as the light approached,
the enemies being now
wearied, end not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
attached with ſleepe,
he commandeth the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
of the tributary
Troupes, with all thoſe of
the Cohorts, Horſe-Troupes,
and Legions, to
ſound their inſtruments
all together; the Souldiers
had orders to raiſe a great
clamour, and to ſally out
of the gates.</p>
                     <p>The Moores and Getu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
being ſuddenly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the ſtrange and
hideous noiſe, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flye, nor take armes,
nor make, nor prouide
any meanes of reſiſtance.
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:16916:274"/>
Thus all of them with the
claſhing and clamour,
(no man comming to
their ſuccours, our men
falling on with tumult,
terrour and feare) were
like mee ſuprized with an
aſtoniſhment. Finally, all
of them were rowted, and
chaſed: moſt of their
armes, and military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
were taken: and
more ſlaine in that battell,
then in all the former, for
by ſleepe and the vncouth
terrour, flight was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                     <p>Thereupon <hi>Marius,</hi> as he
began, marcheth towards
his Winter Garriſons,
which becauſe of victuals,
he reſolued to haue in the
maritime Townes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:16916:274"/>
yet was hee growne
ſlouthfull, or inſolent
with his victory, but euen
as if hee had beene in the

with his Army
marching in ſquare battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                     <p>And verily <hi>Marius</hi> in
that and other times of the

the Army more with
ſhame then puniſhment,
which many reported to
be done out of ambition;
becauſe from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
he had accounted a

other things, which other

the skoutes haſtily

the ſame; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull

his Army, the order

hee makes a ſtand in

againſt all euents.</p>
                     <p>By this meanes <hi>Iugurths</hi>
hope was fruſtrated, who

thinking that ſome

both he and others inuade

<hi>Sylla,</hi> to whoſe eloquence,

                     <p>In the meane time the

                     <p>He being of a haughty

ſtay alone with <hi>Sylla.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This counſell, as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
in ſuch an exigent,
was allowed: &amp; forthwith
diſmarching, becauſe they
came vnexpected, they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in ſafety, <hi>Iugurth</hi> being
doubtfull, &amp; ſticking vpon
delayes. Then within a few
dayes, they arriued where
they intended to goe.</p>
                     <p>There conuerſed with
<hi>Bocchus</hi> a Numidian called
<hi>Aſpar,</hi> much, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly:
he being premit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Iugurth,</hi> (after hee
heard that <hi>Sylla</hi> was ſent)
as an Agent, and a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer
in policy of <hi>Bocchus</hi>
counſels: beſides there
was <hi>Dabar,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagrada,</hi>
                        <pb n="568" facs="tcp:16916:289"/>
of the race of
<hi>Maſsiniſſa,</hi> but vnequall
by the mothers ſide, for his
father was borne of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine;
being deare and
gracious, with the Moore
for many good Arts, with
which his mind was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
whom <hi>Bocchus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
formerly tryed by
many occurrences, to be
faithfull to the Romanes,
he ſendeth him preſently
with this meſſage to <hi>Sylla,</hi>
that he was ready to doe
whatſouer the Romane
people would deſire: that
himſelfe ſhould chuſe a
day, time, and place for
imparlance: that he would
communicate all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
with him: neither
ſhould he be afraid of <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurths</hi>
                        <pb n="569" facs="tcp:16916:289"/>
Ambaſſadour; for
dealing a freely in their
common affaires: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he could not preuent
his trecheries.</p>
                     <p>But I find, that <hi>Bocchus</hi>
more out of a Punicke
faith, then for the regard
of what he ſaid, detained
with the hope of peace,
both the Romanes, and
the Numidian: and was
wont to ponder much
with himſelfe, whether he
ſhould deliuer <hi>Iugurth</hi> to
the Romanes, or <hi>Sylla</hi> to
him. Deſire againſt vs,
feare for vs did perſwade.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Sylla</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that he would ſpeake
ſome few words before
<hi>Aſpar;</hi> the reſt in ſecret,
none of a very few being
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:16916:290"/>
preſent, withall he inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
him, what anſwers
ſhould be made vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>After, when they were
met according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he ſayes that he was
ſent by the Conſull, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
whether he would
haue peace or warre.
Then the King, according
to his inſtructions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him to returne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the tenth day; and tells
him that as yet he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
on nothing, but on
that day would giue him
an anſwer. Then both of
them depart to their Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rs.
But when moſt of the
night was ſpent, <hi>Sylla</hi> is
ſecretly ſent for by <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:</hi>
onely faithfull inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:16916:290"/>
are admitted by
them. Beſides <hi>Dabar</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeſſenger,
a deuout
man, ſweares ſincerely to
them both. Then the King
thus begins:</p>
                     <p>I neuer thought, it
would come to paſſe, that
I being the greateſt King
in all this Land, and of all
that I know the moſt opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
ſhould owe a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to a priuate man. And
verily <hi>Sylla,</hi> before I knew
thee, to many men vpon
requeſt, to others freely I
haue giuen reliefe; I my
ſelfe wanted nothing: I
reioyce, that I am difina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in this, which others
are wont to greeue at. It
ſhall be precious to me,
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:16916:291"/>
that I ſometimes haue
wanted thy friendſhip,
then which I eſteeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dearer in my mind:
of this ſo farre thou maiſt
make a tryall: armes, men,
and money, finally what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
pleaſeth thee, take
and vſe: and while thou
liueſt, thou ſhalt neuer
thinke the courteſie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with me it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
intire: moreouer, if
I may know it, thou ſhalt
deſire nothing in vaine.
<hi>For as I thinke, it is leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
for a King to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by armes, then by muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But concerning your
Commonwealth, whoſe
Agent thou art hither
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:16916:291"/>
ſent, heare this in a few
words. I neuer made war
with the people of Rome,
nor euer was willing that
warre ſhould be made:
with armes againſt armed
men I defended my bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
I paſſe ouer this.
Since it is your pleaſure,
wage warre with <hi>Iugurth,</hi>
as you will: I will not goe
beyond the riuer Mulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,
which was the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
betwixt me and <hi>Micip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
neither will I ſuffer
<hi>Iugurth</hi> to attempt it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
whatſoeuer you
ſhall requeſt, that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of me and your ſelues,
you ſhall not depart with
repulſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To this</hi> Sylla <hi>replyed
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:16916:292"/>
briefly for himſelfe, for
that which concerneth
peace, and the common
affaires more at large; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
hee reuealeth this
ſecret to the King,</hi> That he
muſt aſſure him, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Rome, in regard they
had beene victorious in the
warre, would not receiue him
into fauour: hee muſt doe
ſomething, which might ſeeme
to concerne their profit, more
then his owne: hee had a
faire opportunitie of this,
as hauing <hi>Iugurth</hi> in his
power: whom if hee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Romanes, they
ſhould bee much indebted
to him: then friendſhippe,
aliance, and that part of
Numidia, which hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:16916:292"/>
would freely fall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
                     <p>The King at firſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
alledging, that kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
aliance, and a
League beſides had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
betwixt them: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
hee feared, leſt by
the breach of his faith he
ſhould alienate the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his ſubiects; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom both <hi>Iugurth</hi>
was deare, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
hatefull. At length
being often ſollicited, he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="576" facs="tcp:16916:293"/>
they framed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,

Thus the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite

                     <p>But the King on the

with other miſchiefes
which are wont to proceed from
proſperity, after the deſtruction
of Carthage, were moſt increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
For the iniuries of the
ſtronger, and for that a diſunion
of the Commonalty from the
Fathers, and other ciuill diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had beene euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
Neither longer, then
whilſt the Kings being expelled,
there was a feare of <hi>Tarquine,</hi>
and a dangerous warre ingaged
with <hi>Hetruria,</hi> were things go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
after an vpright and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
courſe.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this, the Fathers held
the Commonalty vnder a ſeruile
ſubiection: they determined of
life and limbe after a Regall
manner, they expelled men out
of their poſſeſſions, and others
being voided, they alone liued in
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:16916:299"/>
command. With which cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but moſt ſpecially with the
burthen of vſury the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
being oppreſſed, when as
in the continuall warres they
ſuffred both taxes and military
duties, taking Armes, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
the holy mountaine, and
the Auentine: and then they
procured for themſelues Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of the people and other
priuiledges. Of the diſcords and
controuerſie on both ſides, the
ſecond Punicke warre made an
end.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the Punicke feare
being remoued, they had leiſure
to exerciſe factions. From which
time the manners of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours
were precipitated, not by

courſe of a torrent: ſo much was
the youth corrupted with riot
and couetouſneſſe, that not
without cauſe it might be ſaid,
that ſuch men were borne, who

                  <p>Then many troubles, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

did ariſe: whilſt ſome few
mighty men, on whoſe fauour
many relyed, vnder the honeſt

affected a tyrannicall

he was accounted good.</p>

which you are moſt great, and

miniſter much cauſe of feare to
me, in the contemplation of <hi>L.
Syllaes</hi> tyranny, leſt that either
you be circumuented by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
being incredulous of theſe
things, which you eſteeme moſt
wicked: eſpecially when all his
hope relie on villany and perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe:
neither can he thinke
himſelfe otherwiſe ſafe, except
he growes worſe and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
from your feare, by

take away the care of your cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued

more ingaged in defending your

being men of much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,
and no leſſe honoured
for the excellent examples of
their Anceſtours (I cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
wonder at it) beſtow
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:16916:301"/>
their ſeruice for the reward of
his tyranny ouer you: and rather
deſire them both with iniury,
then to liue freely after the
vprighteſt manner: The illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
progeny of the <hi>Bruti, Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lij,</hi>
and <hi>Lutatij,</hi> borne to ruine
that, which their Anceſtors got.</p>
                     <p>For what elſe was defended
from <hi>Pyrrhus, Hannibal, Philip,</hi>
and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but liberty, and
euery mans proper habitation;
that we might be obedient to
none, but the Lawes? all which
this cruell Romulus detaines, as
ſpoiles from taken ſtrangers; not
being glutted with the ſlaughter
of ſo many Armies, nor with that
of the Conſuls, and other Princes,
whom the fortune of the warre
hath conſumed: but euen then
hee growes more mercileſſe,
when as proſperity turneth moſt
men from anger vnto compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But he alone amongſt all
after the memory of man, hath
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:16916:301"/>
ordained puniſhments for thoſe
that are to be borne; vnto whom
iniury ſhall bee aſſured before
life: and being as yet protected
by his monſtrous villany, he
doth rage in moſt wicked man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
whilſt you out of the feare
of a more grieuous feruitude, are
terrified from the recouering of
liberty.</p>
                     <p>Something is to be done, and
he reincountred (O ye Romans)
that your ſpoiles become not his
prey: delayes are not to bee
made, neither by vowes are
helps to be procured: except
perchance you hope, that out of
the tediouſneſſe and ſhame of
his tyranny, he will quit thoſe
perquiſites with more danger,
which he hath vſurped to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by villany.</p>
                     <p>But he hath proceeded ſo far,
that he eſteemeth nothing glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but what is ſafe, and all
things to be honeſt, that tend to
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:16916:302"/>
the preſeruation of his tyrannicall
gouernment. Therefore that
peace, and quietneſſe with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,

haue imbraced before laborious
honours, haue no reſpect with
him. At this time we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                     <p>For what remaines further? or
what diuine or humane rights
are left vnpolluted? the Romane
people not long ſince the rulers
of Nations, being deſpoiled of
glory, Empire, and priuiledges,
withall growne poore and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,

haue poſſeſſed the ancient

                     <p>But I am ſeditious, as <hi>Sylla</hi>
ſaith, who complaine vpon the

ſeeke after warre, becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the priuiledges of peace.
Forſooth, as though you could
not be otherwiſe ſafe, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

ſhall approue all the proſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the innocent for their

perſons; the Citty waſted with
fire and ſlaughters: the goods of
miſerable Citizens ſold, or giuen
away; as if they were Cimbrian
pillage.</p>
                     <p>But he obiecteth to me my
poſſeſſions gotten out of the
goods of the proſcribed. Which
verily is the greateſt argument
of his wickedneſſe: that neither
I, nor any man elſe ſhould be
ſufficiently ſafe, if wee ſhould
doe vprightly. And thoſe things
which then I bought out of feare;
the price being paid, I reſtore
forthwith to the rightfull ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
neither is it my counſell to
ſuffer any prey to be made of
Citizens. Thoſe calamities ſhalbe
ſufficient, which in the heate of

madneſſe we haue indured. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Amies fighting one againſt

                     <p>Of all miſchiefes and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
let there bee an end, Of
which <hi>Sylla</hi> is not ſo penitent, but
that hee glories in his wicked
deedes, and if it were lawfull,
would follow that courſe more
egerly. Neither, now doe I feare,
what you eſteeme of him, but
how much you dare to doe your
ſelues: leſt one expecting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for chiefe, you may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
not by his power, which
is weake and broken, but by
your owne cowardice, before
you could otherwiſe be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and before he durſt appeare
ſo happy.</p>
                     <p>For beſides his debaucht mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
who deſires the ſame
with him? and who would not
haue all things changed but the
victory? his Souldiers forſooth:
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:16916:304"/>
whoſe blood hath beene the price
of riches, for <hi>Tarrula,</hi> and <hi>Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
the worſt of ſlaues. Or will
thoſe, by whom <hi>Fuſidius</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
in gaining of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracies
a baſe varlet, the ſhame
of all good men?</p>
                     <p>Therefore the victorious
Army maketh me very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
by whom beſides wounds,
and labours, nothing hath beene
procured but a Tyrant. Except
perchance they went about to
ſubuert the Tribunitiall power,
founded by our Anceſtours, that
ſo they might vſurpe Lawes and

                     <p>Why therefore doth hee

nor the pretended wrongs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

vexed and tormented with the

being reſtleſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd

Now peace and concord are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed

neither deſiring diſcords, as they

                     <p>But formerly (O ye Romans)
all ye that were Citizens relyed

inough hath beene ſpoken.
Neither is the matter ſhut vp in

                     <p>But I know not, what dulneſſe
hath poſſeſſed you, in that you
are neither moued with glory, not

it liberty enough, becauſe
your backs are kept from ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,

For this hath beene the onely,

                     <p>Truely, when I was informed,

corne failed, no man all about

were in times paſt a medley of

humane, nor diuine Lawes can
reſtraine, but that they will force
and ruine their friends and Alies,
whether liuing neere or remote,
poore or powerfull; and all that

Kingdomes they eſteeme for

                     <p>But thou, who haſt Seleucia

preſent, and warre afterwards?
The Romanes are armed againſt
all men, but moſt fiercely againſt
thoſe, who being conquered, can
yeeld the greateſt ſpoiles: by da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and deceiuing, and by raiſing
warres out of warres, they are
growne mighty. By this courſe
they will ruine all, or periſh: the
laſt of which is not difficult, if
thou from Meſopotamia, we from

wanting corne, wanting aydes.
Fortune is as yet intire through

great quarrells for the

vanquiſhed together with her,

Aſia and Cilicia: full of enemies
is Macedonia: no leſſe the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

Prouinces: when in the meane
time our tributes being ſmall and
vncertainely ballanced for the

did, for the Conuoy of victuals.</p>
                     <p>If theſe things are contracted
by our negligence and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

puniſhment as you will: but if

wherefore doe you vndertake
things vnworthy of your ſelues,

And I, ouer whoſe age death is

in thee, who haſt ſo farre
outgone others, that men are firſt
wearied with praiſing thy deeds.
then thou art of doing things
praiſe-worthy.</p>
                     <p>But vertuous acquiſitions, like
edifices, ought to be preſerued with
very much induſtry; leſt they be
deformed with negligence, or ruined

willingly reſignes rule to another,
and although hee bee good, and
milde, who can doe moſt; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is lawfull for him to bee

                     <p>This happeneth, for that many

counſell peruerſly; and
thinke themſelues by ſo much

thoſe, ouer whom they command,
haue beene the more wicked. But
this ought to be indeuoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
that thou being vertuous

                     </p>
                     <p>But this is more laborious for
thee, then for all men before thee,
to ſettle an eſtate gotten by
Armes. Thou haſt managed a
warre more gentle then the peace
of others: beſides the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
are Cittizens. Amongſt theſe
difficulties thou muſt make an
euaſion, and for euer hereafter the
Commonwealth is to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
not by armes onely, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                     <p>Therefore the occaſion ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

And this ſeemes ſo to me, that in
that manner, as thou ſhalt ſettle
the victory, all things will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
But now, that thou mayeſt
diſpoſe this more readily, and
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:16916:327"/>
eaſily, receiue in few words,
what my minde tells me.</p>
                     <p>Thou haſt had a warre, O
Emperour, with a famous man,
of great wealth, greedy of rule,
of greater fortune then wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
whom ſome few haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
being made thy enemies
by their owne iniury: withall
whom affinity, or any other ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
hath incited. For neither
was any man partaker of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
nor if he could haue
ſuffred it, had the whole world
beene ſhaken with warre. The
reſt of the multitude, rather out
of the vulgar cuſtome, then
Iudgement, followed him, one
after another, as if he had beene
the prudenter perſon.</p>
                     <p>About that time ſome men
being poſſeſſed with hope, by the
ſuggeſtions of the wicked, of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping
vpon the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
made thy Campe their
place of Concourſe, hauing firſt
polluted all things with lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:16916:327"/>
and luxury; and openly
menaced vnto the peaceable,
death, rapines, and finally all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages,
which their depraued na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vrged. A great part of
whom, after they ſaw neither
debt to be remitted, nor thy ſelfe
to vſe Cittizens as thou wouldſt
enemies, ſhrunke away from
thee: a few ſtayd, who were
likely to haue more ſecurity in
the Campe, then at Rome. So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
did the Creditours purſue
them.</p>
                     <p>But for the ſame cauſes, it is
incredible to be ſpoken what
great perſons, and how many de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted
afterwards vnto <hi>Pompey,</hi>
and vſed him all the time of the
warre, as a ſacred and vnuiolated
Sanctuary.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, becauſe peace and
warre muſt be agitated by thee
the Conquerour; this, that thou
mayſt leaue it ciuilly; that, that
it may be moſt iuſt and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:
firſt of all, thinke with thy
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:16916:328"/>
ſelfe, becauſe thou art to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, what is beſt to bee
done. <hi>Verily my opinion is, that all
tyrannicall gouernments are more
grieuous then laſting; neither can
any man be feared by many, but
feare from many muſt reflect on
him: that kinde of life wageth a
continuall and doubtfull warre:</hi>
becauſe thou canſt neither be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
from before, behind, or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide: thou muſt liue alwaies
in danger and feare.</p>
                     <p>Contrariwiſe they, who with
bounty, and clemencie haue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred
command, all ioyfull and
proſperous euents haue attended
them; yea their enemies were
more iuſt, then to others their
owne Citizens.</p>
                     <p>But will ſome ſay, that I am
a corrupter of thy victory, and
too much a wel-wiſher of the
vanquiſhed? forſooth, becauſe
thoſe things, which we, and our
anceſtours haue giuen to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Nations, enemies by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:16916:328"/>
I thinke fit to be granted to
Cittizens; neither after a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
manner would haue murder
with murder, and blood expiated
with blood. What hath obliuion
defaced thoſe outrages, which
not long before this warre were
obiected againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
<hi>Syllaes</hi> victory? he ſlew <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Carbo, Brutus,</hi> with others
beſides, being not armed, neither
according to the law of Armes,
but butchered afterwards, being
ſuppliants, with the greateſt vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
that could be: the Common-people
of Rome in a publicke
Village were ſlaughtered after
the manner of Cattell.</p>
                     <p>Out alas, how clandeſtine
were Cittizens funeralls, and
how ſuddaine were their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the boſomes of parents
and children, with the flight of
women, and yonglings, and the
ſpoile of houſes? before the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
gotten by thee, all was full
of rigour and cruelty. Vnto
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:16916:329"/>
which courſes the very ſame
men perſwade thee: and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
was the end of both your
quarrels, that with mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
iniuries ſhould be done: and
that the Commonwealth was not
recouered, but taken by thee. And
for that cauſe, the ableſt and old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Souldiers of the Army being
caſhiered, contended in Armes,
ſome againſt their brethren, and
parents, others againſt their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
that from the miſeries of
others, they might, being the
wickedſt of all men, procure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
for their gluttony and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
luſt, and might be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of the victory: by
whoſe debauchments the praiſe
of good men might bee blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
                     <p>Neither yet doe I thinke, that
thou doeſt ouerpaſſe, with what
manners and modeſty each man
demeaned himſelfe, the victory
as yet being doubtfull; and how
in the adminiſtration of the war,
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:16916:329"/>
ſome of them frequented whores
and bankets, whoſe age, if it had
beene in peacefull times, could
not without obloquy, haue taſted
ſuch pleaſures. Of the warre
inough hath beene ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Of eſtabliſhing a peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
both thou, and all thine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate:
Firſt, conſider this, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee, what that is, about
which thou conſulteſt: thus good
and euill men being diſſeuered,
thou ſhalt proceed in the open
way to truth. I coniecture thus:
becauſe all things which are
borne, dye; that at what time the
fate of dectruction ſhal approach
towards the Citty of Rome; that
Citizens againſt Citizens ſhall
ioyne in battell: thus they being
wearied and bloodleſſe, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the prey of ſome King, or
Nation. Otherwiſe, not the
whole world, nor all people vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, can moue or demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
this Empire.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the benefits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:16916:330"/>
are to be confirmed, and the
miſchiefes of diſcord are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued.
This will fall out ſo, if
thou ſhalt take away the licence
of expences, and rapines, not by
recalling to the ancient ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which long ſince in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauation
of manners are made a
laughing ſtocke, but if thou ſhalt
perſcribe to euery man a limited
eſtate and meaſure of expences.
Becauſe this cuſtome is much
practized; that young men thinke
it a moſt glorious action to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
their owne, and other mens
goods, to deny nothing to their
luſt, or to others crauing. They
eſteeme this to bee vertue, and
greatneſſe of minde; ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and modeſty being reputed
cowardice.</p>
                     <p>By this meanes their proud
mindes being entred into an euill
courſe, when as wonted meanes
are wanting, are ſpleenefully car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſometimes againſt Alies, then
againſt Cittizens: they diſturbe
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:16916:330"/>
affaires that are ſettled, and ſeeke
out new faſhions for old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherefore for euer hereafter
the Vſurer is to be remoued, that
euery man may care for his own.</hi>
This is the true and plaine way, to
ſway the Magiſtracy for the profit
of the people, not of the creditour;
and to ſhew the greatneſſe of ſpirit
in adding, not in taking from the
Republicke.</p>
                     <p>And I know how difficult this
will be at firſt, eſpecially with
ſuch, who thought in the victory
to liue more licentiouſly, and
freely, not more ſtrictly. For
whoſe ſafety if thou ſhalt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
rather then for their luſt,
thou ſhalt ſettle both them, vs,
and our Alies in a firme peace.
If the youth ſhall follow the ſame
ſtudies, and Arts, certainely thy
renowned fame, together with
the Citty of Rome, will be ruined
in a ſhort time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Finally, wiſemen for the reſpect
of peace, wage warre, they ſuſtaine
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:16916:331"/>
labour for the hope of quietneſſe:</hi>
except you confirme this, what
difference is there to haue van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
or to be vanquiſhed?
wherefore coniured by the gods,
vndertake the Commonwealth,
&amp; paſſe through all difficulties, as
thou art accuſtomed. For either
thou alone canſt heale; or farther
care is to be omitted by all men.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth any man inuoke
thee to cruell puniſhments, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by which a City
waſted rather, then reformed, but
that thou wouldeſt reſtraine the
youth from euill Arts, &amp; wicked
deſires. This indeed wil be cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
to haue prouided, that Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
may not be expelled out of
their Country vndeſeruedly; to
haue retained them from folly, &amp;
deceiteful pleaſures; to haue eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
peace and concord; not, if
thou being obſequious to vices,
&amp; ſuffring offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, ſhalt giue way
to a preſent ioy, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with
a miſchiefe, which will forthwith
inſue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="653" facs="tcp:16916:331"/>
And my courage is moſt of all
erected, with that, which others
feare, the difficulty of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And for that all Lands and
Seas are at once to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by thee (becauſe ſuch a Spirit
as thine cannot touch vpon meane
things) for thy great care there
remaines a great reward.</p>
                     <p>Therefore thou muſt prouide,
that the Common people cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with Largeſſes, and corne
publickly giuen, may be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in affaires, proper for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and by which they may be
with-held from publicke miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe:
that the youth apply
themſelues to honeſty, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
not to expences, nor riches.
This will come to paſſe thus, if
thou ſhalt cut off the vſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of money, which is the
greateſt plague of all others.</p>
                     <p>For I my ſelfe, pondering often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in my minde, by what
meanes men of moſt renowne
had found out greatneſſe: what
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:16916:332"/>
things had inlarged people and
Nations by Authors of great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;
and laſt of all, for
what cauſes moſt mighty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Empires had beene
ruined: I found alwaies the ſame
things to be good and euill, and
that ail the Conquerors contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
riches, and that all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
deſired them. <hi>Nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
can any man raiſe vp himſelfe,
and being mortall attaine things
diuine, except the delights of mony
and the body being neglected, hee
be indulgent to the minde, not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
a peruerſe fauour by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
or yeelding to concupiſcence;
but exerciſing himſelfe in labour,
patience, wholeſome precepts, and
valiant exploits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For to build vp a houſe, or
village, and to adorne it with
Skutcheons, Tapiſtry, and other
workes, and to make all of them
a ſpectacle, rather then thy ſelfe,
that is not to haue riches for an
ornament, but for a mans ſelfe to
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:16916:332"/>
be a reproach to them. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
they who twice in a day are
accuſtomed to loade their bellies,
and not to ſleepe one night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a whore; when as they haue
oppreſſed the ſoule with ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which ought to command;
That being afterwards growne
dull and lame, vainely they ſeeke
to exerciſe it. For with impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
they precipitate both
themſelues, and many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
But theſe, and many other
miſchiefes will together end with
the reputation of money, if nei-Magiſtracies,
nor other things to
be coueted by the vulgar, ſhall
be ſet to ſale.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, prouiſion muſt bee
made by thee, how Italy and the
Prouinces may be better ſecured:
the meanes whereof is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoure.
For the ſame men make a
generall waſte by forſaking their
owne houſes, and by ſeizing
wrongfully on others. Withall,
that warrefare, as it hath beene
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:16916:333"/>
hitherto, be not vniuſt, nor vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall:
when ſome ſerue out thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

formerly a reward of ſlouth, it
will be conuenient to diſtribute
vnto them throughout the infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed

when as they ſhall returne home
after the expiration of their ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendary
yeeres.</p>
                     <p>What things are neceſſary for
the Commonwealth, and glorious
for thee, I haue deliuered in a
few words. It ſeemes good to
me now to ſpeake ſomething of

mee; it would haue grieued me
more to haue kept ſilence. For
whether thou ſhalt proceede in
this, or any other courſe, ſurely
I ſhall ſpeake and aſſiſt thee to

                     <head>The ſecond Oration of the, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Commonwealth, to
C. Caeſar.</head>
                     <p>I Know how difficult, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a thing it is to giue
counſell to a King or Emperour;
finally to any man, whoſe power
is ſeated on high: becauſe they
haue both abundance of counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
neither can any man be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectiue,
and prudent inough
of future euents. Beſides, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:16916:334"/>
euill counſels ſucceed more
proſperouſly then good; becauſe
fortune ſwayeth moſt things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But it was my deſire from my
firſt youth, to vndertake the
Commonwealth: and in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, I tooke much, and moſt
ſpeciall care: not to that
end alone, that I might be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a magiſtracy, which many
haue gotten by euill Arts; but
that I might take a ſuruay of the
State, both at home, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and how powerfull ſhee
might bee in Armes, men and
money.</p>
                     <p>Therefore by me, as I meditated
many things with my ſelfe, this
counſell was approued, to
eſteeme my owne reputation and
modeſty after thy dignity, and to
hazard any thing, ſo that any glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
might accrue to thee from
that. And this I haue not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
raſhly, nor becauſe of thy
fortune; but for that amongſt
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:16916:334"/>
others, I haue found in thee this
one Art, admirable aboue the
reſt; that thy minde was alwaies
greater in aduerſe, then proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
fortunes. But this amongſt
other mortals is moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that men are alſo firſt wearied
with praiſing and admiring thy
munificence, then thou art in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things meriting glory.</p>
                     <p>Verily this is my reſolution,
that nothing can be found out ſo
difficult, which thou doeſt not
readily apprehend. Neither haue
I written theſe things to thee of
the Commonwealth, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to concerne it, becauſe I
approued my owne wit and
counſell more then was fitting:
but amongſt the labours of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
amongſt battailes, victories,
and gouernment, I reſolued to
admoniſh thee of ciuill affaires.</p>
                     <p>For if this counſell be lodged
in thy breſt; that to vindicate thy
ſelfe from the violence of thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
thou wouldſt by any
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:16916:335"/>
meanes, oppoſed againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull,
retaine the fauours of the
people, thou muſt harbour
thoughts vnworthy of thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
But if that ſpirit be within
thee, which from the beginning
hath diſturbed the faction of the
Nobility, hath reſtored the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Commonalty from a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
ſeruitude vnto liberty; in
thy Praetourſhip, vnarmed hath
broke the Armes of thy enemies;
at home and abroad hath atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſo great, and ſuch glorious
exploites, that thy very aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
dare nor complaine of any
thing but thy greatneſſe: then
heare that, which I ſhall ſpeake
of the ſumme of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
which verily thou ſhalt
finde to be true, or not farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
from truth.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe <hi>

out of his corrupt diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or that he deſired nothing

thee, fell into ſuch an errour, that
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:16916:335"/>
he put weapons into his enemies
hands: by what meanes hee
troubled the Commonwealth,
by the ſame thou oughteſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
it. Firſt of all, he gaue to a
few Senatours the chiefe power
of moderating, about tributes,
expences, and iudgements; the
Romane Commonalty, whoſe
power was formerly chiefeſt, he
left together with vs vnder the
ſame conditions of ſeruitude.</p>
                     <p>Although the iudgements, as
before were reſtored to the three
orders, yet the ſelfeſame factious
men ſway, giue, and take away,
what pleaſeth them: they cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuent
the innocent: they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceir
their owne Fauourites to
honour. Not villany, not ſcandall,
or lewdneſſe doth hinder them,
from being capable of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
what is commodious, they
force, they take by violence:
finally, as in a captiued Citty,
they vſe luſt and licence for
Lawes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="662" facs="tcp:16916:336"/>
And verily I ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
grieued, if they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
a victory gotten by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
after this their ſeruile cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.
But theſe vnactiue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
all whoſe force and valour
lyes in the tongue, mannage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently
a domination thruſt into
their hands, by fortune, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
cowardice. For what other
ſedition, or ciuill diſſenſion hath
plucked vp from the roote ſo
many, and ſuch illuſtrious Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?
or in whoſe victory euer
was the minde ſo precipitated,
and immoderate? <hi>Lu. Sylla,</hi> vnto
whom all things were lawfull in
the victory by the Law of warre,
although he conceiued that the
enemies party was fortified by
<hi>Sulpitius,</hi> yet ſome few being
ſlaine, he was deſirous to retaine
the reſt with bountie, rather then
feare.</p>
                     <p>But now together with <hi>Cato,
L. Domitius,</hi> and the reſt of that
faction, forty Senators, and many
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:16916:336"/>
young men of good hope haue
beene ſlaughtered like ſacrifices:
when in the meane time this
moſt miſchieuous kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
could not be glutted with the
blood of ſo many miſerable Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens:
not Orphants, not Parents
in the cloze of their age, not the
mourning of men, the lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of women could mollifie their
barbarous mindes. But doing
and ſpeaking worſe euery day
more then other, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to remoue ſome men out of
their dignitie, others out of the
Citty.</p>
                     <p>For what ſhould I ſpeake of
thee, whoſe contumelie theſe
moſt ſlothfull men would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for their owne life? In
regard that domination is not
ſuch a pleaſure to them, (although
it happened beyond hope) as thy
dignity is a griefe: who hold it
more acceptable to hazard their
owne liberty out of thy calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then that by thee the Empire
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:16916:337"/>
of the Romane people, of great
ſhould be made greateſt.</p>
                     <p>For which cauſe thou oughteſt
to be more and more prouident,
how thou mayſt eſtabliſh, and
ſtrengthen the State. As for me,
what my minde ſuggeſteth, I
ſhall not be doubtfull to ſpeake.
In two parts I take this Citty to
be diuided, as I haue heard from
my Anceſtours; into the Fathers,
and Commonalty. In former
times the chiefeſt authority was
in the Fathers; the greateſt power
by far was in the Commonalty.
Thereupon diſunion happened
frequently in the Citty: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the Nobilities ſtrength was
leſſened, and the right of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
amplified. But by this
meanes the Commonalty liued
freely, becauſe no mans power
was aboue the Lawes: neither in
riches, nor pride, but in a good
fame, and valiant exploites, the
Noble excelled the ignoble.
Euery man of the inferiour ranke,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:16916:337"/>
in Armes, or military imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wanting no honeſt accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
was inough for himſelfe,
inough for his Country.</p>
                     <p>But when as being expelled by
degrees out of their poſſeſſions,
ſlouth and pouerty inforced them
to haue vncertaine habitations:
they began to couet other mens
wealth, and to account their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with the Republicke ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Thus the people by little,
and little, which was the Lord,
and ruler of all Nations, fell from
his firſt greatneſſe: and for a
common command, euery man
procured for himſelfe a priuate
ſeruitude.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this multitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
firſt infected with euill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
then diſperſed into ſundry
Arts, and courſes of life, no waies
agreeing amongſt themſelues,
ſeeme not fit men vnto me, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the Commonwealth.
But new Citizens being added, a
great hope doth poſſeſſe me, that
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:16916:338"/>
all of them will be rozud vp for
the cauſe of liberty: for that both
a care will grow in them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their freedome, as well as
in thoſe for quitting their ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
My cenſure is, that theſe
being commixed, the new with
the old, thou ſhouldſt place them
in the Colonies: thus both the
military eſtate will be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the Commonalty being
detained with good imployments,
will ceaſe from committing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
euill.</p>
                     <p>But I am not ignorant, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent,
when this thing ſhall be,
what inſolencie, what outrages of
the Nobilitie will follow, when as
they ſhall be incenſed, that all
things are confounded together,
that this ſeruitude is impoſed on
ancient Citizens; finally, that of
a free State, it will become a
Kingdome, when by one
mans gift, a mighty multitude ſhal
haue the freedome of the Citty.
As for my ſelfe, this verily is my
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:16916:338"/>
opinion, <hi>That hee commits an
euill offence againſt himſelfe, that
would procure fauour for himſelfe,
with the diſprofit of the Common-wealth:
whereas the publicke
good ſerues alſo for priuat vſe,
there to be doubtfull to vndertake,
I hold it a point of ſlackneſſe and
cowardice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was alwayes the counſell
of <hi>M. Liuius Druſus,</hi> in his
Tribuneſhip to ſtriue for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to the vtmoſt of his power:
neither did he intend to doe any
thing elſe from the beginning, if
ſome factious perſons had not
ſuggeſted it vnto him, vnto whom
deceit and malice were dearer
then faith. When as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that by one man, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
benefit would be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to many men: and withall
euery one of them being conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to himſelfe, that he was of an
euill and faithleſſe diſpoſition,
they conceiued of <hi>Druſus</hi> alike
as of themſelues. Therefore out
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:16916:339"/>
of a feare, leſt he through ſo great
a fauour ſhould inioy the ſole
command, contending againſt
that, they diſturbed their owne
counſels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For which cauſe (O Emperor)
friends mony, and Aydes are to
be procured by thee with greater
care and conſtancie.</hi> To ſuppreſſe
an oppoſed enemie, it is no difficulty
for a valiant man; neither to plot,
nor auoid couert dangers, is a
thing proper to good men.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when thou ſhalt
haue brought them into the City,
and that by this meanes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
ſhall be renewed in this
thou oughteſt to exerciſe thy
minde eſpecially, that good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
may be had in eſtimation,
that concord may be confirmed
betwixt the old and new Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.
But by farre ſhalt thou
procure the greateſt of all other
benefits for thy Country, Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
thy ſelfe, thy children;
laſtly, for all mankind, if thou
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:16916:339"/>
ſhalt either take away the loue of
money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or leſſen it, as farre as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
will ſerue. Otherwiſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
priuate, nor publicke eſtate,
neither at home, nor abroad, will
be well gouerned. <hi>For whereas
the deſire of money is once entred,
neither diſcipline, nor good Arts,
nor any ingenuitie is poliſhed
inough: but the minde more or
leſſe maturely, yet finally, is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Often haue I heard, what
Kings, what Citties, and Nations
haue loſt great Empires by opu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lencie,
which being poore, they
got by vertue. This is not much
to be maruelled at.</hi> For whereas
a good man ſees one that is worſe
to become more renowned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
by his riches; he ſtormes
at firſt, and agitateth many
things in his minde: but whenas
euery day more then other, glory
ouerballanceth honour, opulency
vertue; the minde from truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolts
to pleaſure. For with glory
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:16916:340"/>
induſtry is cheriſhed: when as you
ſhall take away that, vertue in it
ſelfe is rough and vnpleaſant. Laſt
of all, where riches are valued, all
good things are vilified, faith, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
ſhamefaſtneſſe, and modeſty.
For to vertue there is one, and that
a difficult way: to get money, euery
man endeuoureth, as he pleaſeth;
it is created both out of euill, and
good meanes.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe, firſt of all take
away the Authority of money:
neither in point of life nor honor,
will any man iudge more or leſſe
from a mans eſtate, if neither
Praetour nor Conſull be made
out of the regard of wealth, but
dignity. Yet in the choice of
Magiſtrates, let the peoples
iudgement bee free. <hi>To haue
Iudges allowed by ſome few, is an
argument of Royalty; to haue them
choſen for money, is diſhoneſt.</hi>
Wherefore it is my will, that all
thoſe of the firſt Claſſicall order
doe iudge, but more in number,
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:16916:340"/>
then now iudge. Neither did
the Rhodians, nor any other
Citties euer repent of their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereas promiſcuouſly
the rich, and the poore, as euery
mans turne comes, conſult alike
about the greateſt and leaſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
                     <p>But in the creation of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
that Law pleaſeth me,
and that not abſurdly, which
<hi>C. Gracchus</hi> diuulged in his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buneſhip,
that out of the fiue
Claſſicall Orders blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
at all peraduentures Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſhould be called forth. Thus
they being coequalled in dignity,
and money, one will ſtriue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
another in vertue. Neither
doe I preſcribe difficult remedies
againſt riches. For accordingly
all things are praiſed and deſired,
as the vſe of thoſe things is.
<hi>Wickedneſſe is exerciſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
when you ſhall barre that,
no man amongſt all will be wicked
for thankes onely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="672" facs="tcp:16916:341"/>
Beſides auarice is a cruell,
fieree, and vnprofitable beaſt:
where it intends, it waſteth
Townes, Fieldes, Temples, and
Houſes: it confounds diuine and
humane Lawes: neither Armes,
nor walles can hinder her from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating
with her Force: Of fame,
modeſty, children, Country, and
parents, ſhe diſpoyleth all mortals.
<hi>But if thou ſhalt take away the
reputation of money that mighty
force of auarice will eaſily be
vanquiſhed by good manners.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And although all men both
iuſt and vniuſt remember theſe
things to bee thus: yet thou
ſhalt haue no meane controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
with the faction of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
of whoſe deceite if thou
ſhalt be cautelous, all things elſe
will ſucceede with facility. For
theſe men, if they excelled with
vertue inough, would rather be
emulous, then enuious of good
men. Becauſe ſlouth, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actiueneſſe,
ſtupidity, and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:16916:341"/>
haue inuaded them; they
clamour, they detract, they
eſteeme another mans good name
to be their diſgrace.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhould I make any
farther relation, as if it were of
an vnknowne ſubiect? The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of <hi>M. Bibulus,</hi> and the
vertue of his minde hath made
the way open to a Conſulſhip:
he being a man dull of language,
rather euill, then cunning of wit.
What may this man dare, vnto
whom the Conſulſhip, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of all other commands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the greateſt diſhonour?
what is <hi>L. Domitius,</hi> a perſon of
much ability, no member of
whom is free from lewdneſſe, or
villany? his tongue is vaine, his
hands bloody, his feete fugitiue:
things moſt diſhoneſt, which
cannot be named honeſtly.</p>
                     <p>Yet I doe not contemne the
onely various, talkatiue, and
ſubtill wit of <hi>M. Cato.</hi> Theſe
are procured by the Grecian
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:16916:342"/>
diſcipline. But vertue, vigilancy,
and labour are not found amongſt
the Greekes. For ſince they
haue loſt their liberty at home
by ſlouth, thinke you that by
their precepts, command may
be gotten? The reſt of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are moſt vnactiue Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in whom, as in a ſtatue,
there is no addition of worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the name. <hi>L. Poſthumus,</hi>
and <hi>M. Fauonius</hi> reſemble in
my opinion the ſuperfluous bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt
of a Ship, when they ſeeme
to arriue ſafe at their ends: when
any aduerſe thing doth happen,
the firſt loſſe is of them, for that
they are of the loweſt eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe now, as it ſeemeth to
me, I haue ſpoken at large of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing,
and reforming the
Commonalty: I will ſpeake of
the Senate, what may ſeeme fit
to be done by thee.</p>
                     <p>After my age, and wit grew
ripe, I did not altogether exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:16916:342"/>
my body with Armes, and
Horſes, but imployed my minde
in litterature, becauſe by nature
it was firme in the ſufferance of
labours; and in that courſe of life,
I found out this by frequent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and hearing; that all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
Citties, and Nations ſo
long inioyed a proſperous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
as ſolid counſels preuailed
amongſt them: whereſoeuer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
feare, and pleaſure corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, not long after, their
power was leſſened, then, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
taken away, laſt of all, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude
was impoſed.</p>
                     <p>Verily, this is my reſolution,
that whoſoeuer hath a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and illuſtrious place in a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then others, hath an eſpeciall
care of the Commonwealth: for
to the reſt, the Citty being ſafe,
onely liberty is aſſured; thoſe
who by vertue haue gotten rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
renowne, and honour for
themſelues, as ſoone as the State
inclining a little, begins to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled,
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:16916:343"/>
their minde is variouſly
troubled with cares and toiles:
it either meditates the defence of
glory, or liberty, or of priuate
meanes: in all places it is preſent,
it haſtneth: by how much more
it flouriſhed in proſperity, by ſo
much the more in aduerſity is it
full of anxiety and griefe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the Commonalty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
the Senate, as the body doth
the ſoule, and doth execute its
counſels: it behoueth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be able in counſell. In
the people cunning is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
For this cauſe our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
when they were preſſed
with moſt dangerous warres,
horſes, men, and money being
loſt, they were neuer weary to
contend armed for the Empire
not the wants of the Treaſury
not the force of the Enemies, no
aduerſe fortune could deiect thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mighty Spirits, but that thoſe
things, which they had gotten by
vertue, they would maintaine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:16916:343"/>
with life. And this was
done more by ſound counſell,
then fortunate fights. In regard
that with them there was one
Commonwealth; for that they
prouided: ſaction was prepared
againſt forraigne Foes: euery
man exerciſed body, and ſoule,
for his country, not for his owne
greatneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But contrariwiſe, at this time
Noblemen, whoſe mindes ſlouth
and cowardice hath inuaded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant of labour, of enemies,
of warfare, inſtructed with home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
faction, rule with pride o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all Nations. By this meanes
the Fathers, by whoſe counſell
the doubtfull Commonwealth
was formerly eſtabliſhed, being
oppreſſed, rauing vp and downe,
at anothers pleaſure are agitated
hither and thither. Sometimes
they make theſe, then thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees:
as the faction and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
of them inclines, who
beare rule, ſo they eſteeme good,
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:16916:344"/>
good and publicke euill.</p>
                     <p>But if either the liberty of all
were equall, or the opinion of it
more obſcure, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
would be farre ſtronger,
and the Nobility leſſe potent.
But becauſe it is difficult to
make the reſpect of all coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall:
for that to them the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their anceſtours left an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
glory, dignity, and clien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels:
the reſt of the multitude for
the moſt part being ignorant
people, let them in their opinion
be frec from feare. Thus it being
concealed from themſelues, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
power will be dearer to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man.</p>
                     <p>Libertie is deſiderable alike of
the good, and bad, of the valiant,
and the cowardly. But moſt men
abandon that out of feare. Moſt
fooliſh mortals, that which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the conflict, how it will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
out of cowardice, like men
vanquſhed, they take vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
<hi>Therefore I thinke by
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:16916:344"/>
two meanes the Senate may be
confirmed: if augmented in
number they deliuered their
Votes in a written table. The
table will ſerue for an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to make them dare with
greater freedome: in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
there is more aſſurance, and
ampler vſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For in theſe times for the moſt
part, ſome being intagled in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Iudgements, others in their
owne, or their friends affaires,
haue not beene preſent at the
Counſels of State: neither did
imployment detaine them more,
then the proud commands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The Noblemen, with ſome
few of the Senatorian order,
whom they haue for additions of
faction, what things ſoeuer pleaſe
them, they reprehend, allow, and
decree; them they execute, as
their luſt inciteth. But as ſome
as the number of Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tours being
increaſed, the Votes ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
in a written table, they
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:16916:345"/>
will diſmiſſe their former pride,
when they muſt obey thoſe, ouer
whom before they commanded
moſt tyrannouſly.</p>
                     <p>Perchance (O Emperour)
theſe letters being read, thou wilt
decree, what number of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
it may p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eaſe thee to haue;
and after what forme they ſhall
be diſtributed into many and
ſundry Offices; and ſince it is my
opinion, that the firſt Claſſicall
order ſhould deliuer their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
what deſcription, and
what number is to be of euery
kinde: To deſcribe all things
generally, had not beene a matter
difficult in doing: but firſt it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
good to labour about the
ſumme of the Counſell, and to
proue that to be true to thee. If
thou reſolueſt to make vſe of
this way, all other things will
ſucceed promptly. I would that
this my counſell were prudent,
and of moſt ſpeciall vſe. For
whereſoeuer proſperity happeus
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:16916:345"/>
to thee, there a good fame will
betide me.</p>
                     <p>But this deſire doth exerciſe
me more, after what manner and
how ſoone the Commonwealth
may be releeued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hold liberty
worthier then glory. And I doe
requeſt and exhort thee, that thou
wouldſt not (moſt famous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour)
after the conqueſt of the
Gaules, ſuffer the higheſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
Empire of the Romane
people to be ruined with age, and
diſſolued by the greateſt diſcord.
Verily, if this ſhall happen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, nor night ſhall eaſe thy
anguiſh of minde, but being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
out of ſleepe, raging, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thou ſhalt be vexed with a
diſtracted ſpirit. <hi>For it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to me for a truth, that the life
of all mortals is viſited by a diuine
power: neither is the good, nor euill
deed of any man valued at nothing.
But with a different condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
attend the good and bad: in
the meane time perchanee they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:16916:346"/>
more ſlowly; euery mans mind
giues him hope from his conſcience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if thy Country, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
could ſpeake with thee,
ſurely they would ſay theſe
words vnto thee: O <hi>Caeſar,</hi> we
being moſt valiant men, begot
thee in a moſt goodly City, to be
an honour, and ſuccour to vs, a
terrour to our enemies. What
we had gotten with many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and dangers, we deliuered
ouer to thee, being borne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thy life, a Country
greateſt of al on the earth, a houſe
and family moſt illuſtrious in that
Country, beſides good Arts, well
gotten riches: finally, all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtations
of peace, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of warre.</p>
                     <p>For theſe moſt ample benefits,
we deſire of thee not lewdneſſe,
nor villany, but that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reſtore our ouerthrowne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
which thing being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
the fame of thy vertue
will flye throughout all Nations.
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:16916:346"/>
For at this time although thou
haſt performed glorious exploits,
both at home and abroad, yet is
thy renowne but equall with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
valiant men: but if thou ſhalt
reſtore almoſt from deſtruction
this City ampleſt in name, and
largeſt in dominion: who will
be more famous, who greater
then thee on earth? for that if by
ſickneſſe, or fate, it ſhould happen
otherwiſe then well to this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
who doubts, but that
through the whole world, vaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
warres, and ſlaughters
would ariſe?</p>
                     <p>But if thou haſt an honeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of gratifying thy Country &amp;
Parents; hereafter the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
being reſtored, thy glory
ſhall be acknowledged aboue all
mortals, &amp; the death of thee alone
ſhall be more famous then thy
life. <hi>For the liuing ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
oftentimes enuy doth moleſt:
as ſoone as the ſoule hath giuen way
to nature, vertue extolleth her ſelfe
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:16916:347"/>
more and more aboue all detraction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What ſeemed to me expedient

you (O ye Conſcript Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
whoſe authority is growne
a laughing ſtocke for all the worſt
and wickedſt of men; where <hi>M.
Tullius</hi> defends the Lawes and
iudgements of the people of
Rome, and doth ſo moderate it
this order, as if he were the onely
remainder of the family of that
moſt renowned man <hi>Scipio</hi> the

didſt thou not learne that

with the loſſe of thy modeſty?
Therefore it is not much to bee
wondred at, that thou ſelleſt that
wickedly, which thou procuredſt
moſt lewdly.</p>
                     <p>But as I thinke, domeſticke
ſplendour exalteth thy minde:
thy wife is ſacrilegious, and ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with periuries. Thy daughter
is a Concubine to her mothers
preiudice, more pleaſing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious
to thee, then is fit ſhe
ſhould be to a father. Thou haſt
gotten a houſe with violence, and
rapine, fatall for thee, and thine:
that indeed thou mightſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
vs how much the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is changed, ſince thou (O
thou moſt wicked man) dwelleſt
in that houſe, which belonged to
<hi>M. Craſſus</hi> a Conſular perſon.</p>
                     <p>And when theſe things are ſo,
<hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, he hath beene in the
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:16916:348"/>
Counſell of the immortall gods,
and was ſent from thence to this
Citty, for a protectour of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens;
without giuing him the
name of hangman, who accounts
the Republicks da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage his owne
glory: as though thy Conſulſhip
was not the cauſe of that conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
&amp; by that meanes the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was diſioynted, at what
time it had thee for a protectour.</p>
                     <p>But I coniecture, thoſe things
extoll thee more, which after thy
Conſulſhip, thou didſt aduiſe
with <hi>Terentia</hi> thy wiſe about the
Commonwealth, when at home
yee contriued the iudgements of
the Plaution Law: when thou
condemnedſt ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours
to die, others to pay
money: when this man built the
Tuſculan for thee, that other the
Pompeian village another bought
a houſe. But he that could doe
nothing, was next to calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he either came to aſſault thy
houſe, or laid in wait for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:16916:349"/>
finally, ſome thing was
found out againſt him by thee.</p>
                     <p>Which if I obiect falſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thee, giue an account, how
much Patrimony thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue?
what hath accrued to thee
from pleading? out of what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
thou didſt purchaſe thy
houſe: thou buildedſt thy Tuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan
and Pompeian, with infinite
expence. Otherwiſe, if thou art
ſilent, to whom can it be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that thou gotteſt that wealth
out of the blood, and bowels of
the Citizens?</p>
                     <p>But as I conceiue, this new
man of Arpinum, extracted from
the family of <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> imi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tates
his vertue, he continueth the
faction of the Nobility, he hath a
care of the Romaue people, he is
not moued with feare, nor fauour.
But is this an argument onely of
his amity, and mentall vertue?
Yes verily this moſt inconſtant
man is ſuppliant to his Enemies,
contumelious to his friends, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:16916:349"/>
of this, ſometimes of that
faction; he is faithfull to no man; a
moſt light Senatour, a mercinary
Patron, no part of whoſe body is
free from filthineſſe; his tongue is
vaine, his hands are rauenous, his
throate is vnſatiable, his feete
are fugitiue. And he, when as he
is ſuch a man, yet hee dares to
ſay:</p>

                     <p>Happy thee being Conſull <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero?</hi>
Yea rather vnhappy and
wretched, which ſuffredſt as then,
the moſt cruell poſcription of her
Citizens, when as thou, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
being diſturbed, didſt
inforce all good men amazed
with terrour, to obey thy Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
when all iudgements, all
Lawes were ſwayed by thy luſt:
when as the Portian Law being
remoued, &amp; liberty taken away,
thou didſt appropriate to thy

Thou ſhalt doe (I prethee <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>)

a great deſire to vſurpe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Commonwealth,
neither did he care whether
it were by right or wrong,
ſo that he might attaine the

through his priuate wants,

their vertue had giuen the
repulſe to danger they
ſent aydes to their friends
and allies, procuring new
confederacies, rather by
giuing then receiuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.
Their gouernment
was regular, and the name
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16916:361"/>
of it was termed Royall.
Certaine ſelected perſons
whoſe bodies were infee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

the Commonwealth: theſe
in regard of their yeeres, or
Office, were called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards when the
Domination Royall, which
was firſt inſtituted for the
maintenance of liberty, and
inlargement of territory,
did degenerate into pride
and abſolute ſoueraigenty,
the forme of policie being
changed, they erected an
annuall Empire vnder the
rule of two Conſuls. By
this courſe, they thought
mens minds could beſt be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16916:361"/>
ſtrained from inſolency.
But euen then more then
before, euery man began to
ouerualue himſelfe, and to
diſpoſe his endeuours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
indirect ends: <hi>as well
knowing, that Princes jealouſies
attend more vpon good men then
bad, and that the vertue of
others adminiſters to them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
an occaſion of terrour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it is a matter ſtrange
to be rehearſed, how much
the Cittie hauing regained
her liberty, inlarged her
ſelfe in a ſhort time. So
forcibly moued the deſire
of glory, for now the youth,
as ſoone as they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of warlike ſufferances,
with much exerciſe learned
their military duties, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the moſt part in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16916:362"/>
Tents, and theſe repoſed
more delight in the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of their Armes and
horſes of ſeruice, then in
bankets, and whores. Hence
was it, that to ſuch men no
labour was vncouth, no
place was too difficult for
acceſſe or aſſault, yea, the
armed enemy was not
dreadfull: their valour ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
all incountring oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,
the controuerſie of
glory remaining eſpecially
amongſt themſelues. Thus
euery man ſtroue with emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to inuade the enemy,
to ſcale the walles, and to
exploit ſuch things in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke
view. This they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
riches, Honour,
and true Nobilitie. They
were greedy of praiſe, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16916:362"/>
of their coine. They co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted
glory without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
wealth with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
                     <p>Here I could relate, in
what places the Roman
people haue defeated with
ſmall numbers, puiſſant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of their aduerſaries,
what Citties they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by ſituation impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but I feare, this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
would withdraw me
too farre: onely let me aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thus much, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
is predominant in all
euents: It is ſhe, that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and obſcures our
actions being led more by
will then reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The exploits of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
in my opinion were
ample and magnificent, yet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16916:363"/>
ſomewhat inferiour to their
report, for by reaſon of
thoſe admirable wits which
liued in that State, their
actes were celebrated tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the world, with exceſſe
of praiſe: ſo that their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was prized in as high an
eſtimate, as the ſufficiency
of wit could deliuer in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
But the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
were neceſſitated in
this, the capableſt ſpirits
being the moſt actiue
doers: no man exerciſed
his mind without reference
to the body. The beſt men
preferred doing before
ſpeaking, and deſired ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
