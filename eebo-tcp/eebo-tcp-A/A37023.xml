            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Yet 'tis my Fate, however the World goes,</l>
            <l>I'm sure I'm still a Fool in Verse and Prose:</l>
            <l>Nay, Poets now (<hi>fore George</hi>) are at that pass,</l>
            <l>They raise their Wits by making me an Ass.</l>
            <l>Our Scribler makes me act one of threescore,</l>
            <l>A dull, unnatural Fop that keeps a Whore:</l>
            <l>Poor silly Rogue—an old Man waggish, fye,</l>
            <l>'Tis fitter for an Alderman than I:</l>
            <l>However, to oblige and save the Play,</l>
            <l>I've undertook this Character to day.</l>
            <l>I cannot choose but laugh though cause there's none, <hi>ha, ha, ha.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To see the Reverend habit I've on:</l>
            <l>And faith I fancy that in being thus fine,</l>
            <l>I'm very like too sneaking Friends of mine.</l>
            <l>One, Sirs—you'd laugh if you but heard his name,</l>

I am of the same temper with other Young Gentlemen, newly come

                     <p>I confess, I am wholly ignorant of your design, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can say little to the Business: But what will my Friends think,

                     <p>But hark ye, Sir, to come nearer to the matter, are not you

                     <p>This prohibition seems to imply as much; but, if you are,
'tis no Crime as the World goes now: For, a Man of this Age can
no more forbear being jealous, (if his Wife be handsome) than
one of the last could forbear living from her, if she were old or ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—</p>

                     <speaker>Henr.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith a good observation; why, now I see thou hast lov'd
Songs and Play-Books thus long for something: But, my pretty pert
Kinswoman, give me leave to tell you, I am no such jealous Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb;
I have too good a knowledge of my person and sufficiency
to be jealous, I thank ye—</p>

                     <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                     <p>I must confess that is an excellent rule for prevention; but,
here is another weighty question to be resolv'd: for, suppose now
that she should not be so well satisfi'd in your person and sufficiency;
what then, Sir? what then?</p>

                     <speaker>Henr.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith that's enough to make a Man jealous indeed: But,

                     <p>I never doubted any thing; nor can any Disease (accident

you: Now if you love me, go into the Garden, and as if you spoke
to me, call him a hundred Whores and Jilts—for abusing so good
a Man as Mr. <hi>Oldsapp,</hi> and at last beat him soundly. This will make

my Mistress as she slept—the first thing I laid my Hand on, on
the Bolster, was this—which by the feeling and smell—I
guess to be my Grandams Implement, a Strong-Water-Bottle: And
ifaith a Man would guess by her look to Day, she had little need of
Restoratives. But here's another that's worse—for steping back—I
stumbled upon this—a Shoe I think; but if she owns it, tho'
she is an Angel by her Face—she's a Devil by her Hoof—I

hearing the whistle, making haste to get out, I stumbled head-long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
