            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This assay I present you in this my simple New years gift, being a defence of our natiue medicines, with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of those of forrain nations. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion I once disputed in open place: &amp; being required of certain to shew my mind more at large therin, I thought good to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it with moe then one or two, adding thereto my reasons to be examined by men of wisdom &amp; vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that if I erre in this point, I might haue the moe refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: if my sentence be approoued, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit therof might be reaped of many. Now, my request is vnto your L. that this my simple gift be accepted with regard of my hearty good meaning, rather then of the thing it selfe, beeing too base in respect of your Honors person &amp; desert.

of thee gentle Reader, as she deserueth, shall requite thee with no lesse pleasure and profit, then many of her elder sisters. For what can bee more pleasant vnto thee, then the inioying of medicines for cure of thine infirmities out of thy natiue soyle, and countrie, thy Field, thy Orchard, thy Garden? and what more profitable vnto thee, then thereby to avoide the infinite charges rising vpon the vse of straunge and foreigne medicines, whereby not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy substance is wasted, but thy health oft times greatly impaired? This is then that truth which I commend vnto thee. As England aboundeth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with all things necessary for thy maintenance of life, and preseruation of health; so needeth it not, partly through natures instinct, partly by the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie of men, sufficiencie of medecine to cure the sicknesses and infirmities, whereunto our nation is subiect: which my opinion and iudgement, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vse and custome hath long bene to place greatest value in strange medecines, and the practise of the most doth ratifie the same, I knowe must needs seeme strange vnto thee, but read, consider, and then iudge, and at the least let me enterchange my paines with thy attentiue waying of that which thou shalt reade, preiudice set aside: and that a way may bee made for the playner handling of this matter, I briefly define a remedie, a medicine, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease after this sort as followeth. First beginning with a remedie, which I call the work of the Physician, whereby health may be repaired. Physicke is an art which taketh charge of the health of man, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and mainteining it present by the right vse of meate, drinke, and exercise, with other such helpes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6933:8"/>
of nature: and restoring the same decayed, by diet, medicine, helpe of hand, or surgerie instrument seuerally vsed, or by ioynt force applied. Which three are Physicke instruments, whereby the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of curing is performed, which action I call a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. And the second of these instruments name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a medicine, I define an aduersarie force of some naturall thing, equally matching the proper or next cause of the disease. Of which medicines, Hearbes, Trees, Stones, Mineralls and metally, Barthes, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all Fruites, are matter onely, and not the verie medicines them selues: for as Physicke it selfe is an art, and the action artificiall, and not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so are the instruments of the same action arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, and not naturall. And as nature affourdeth not to vs of her owne worke, either garments, or houses, or any kinde of instrument, but onely the matter whereof such instruments may bee made, leauing with vs an industrie rightly to frame them, and wisedome to vse them: so, no more is <hi>Lettis, Poppie, Rhewbarb,</hi> or <hi>Scammonie</hi> a medicine, then an Oake a Table or Ship, or a quarrie of stones, an house. Moreouer, all medicines standing in a kinde of relation to the disease which by meanes of the patients age, sexe, time of the yeare, custome, and such like occasions greatly varie, no nature which alwaies keepeth constant in the own kind can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either bee a medicine, or properly beare the name thereof: which I wish to be noted, least it be thought the simples, and such other naturall things were medicines, because commonly they carry the names of them. And thus much shall bee sufficient to haue said of the nature of a medicine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:6933:9"/>Now a disease (which remaineth last to be defined) is such state of the body, as thereby it is vnabled to performe aptly the actions thereto belonging, or those actions which the soule doth accomplish, by the instrument of the bodie.</p>
                  <p>Thus much briefly concerning the explication of the tearmes wherein this trueth is propounded.</p>
                  <p>Now the reasons, whereby both I am moued to be of this iudgement, and am so hardie as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to others to be receiued, whereof the first riseth from the Christian doctrine of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which as it serueth greatly to establish the chief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> points of Philosophie, so being drawne and more particularly applyed to the maintenance of mans life, carieth with it as a sufficient prouision for maintenance and preseruation of health, a like fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and as aunswerable to the necessitie of the patient, health being decayed; I will not stand to inireate of prouidence being well knowne to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: and being a truth in Diuinitie, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, cannot be false in Philosophie. Although the best of the auncient Philosophers and Poets haue alwaies kept it as a sure ground, who as they serue little to establish vs, hauing a surer foundation, yet may they iustly condemne the Atheist of this age, who so farre hath quenched those remnants of the light of the first creation, that all things seeme to him Fortune and Chaunce.</p>
                  <p>There is no nation vnder heauen so poore and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, but it hath of the owne countrie soyle suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to content nature with, of foode and apparell, which as they be two pillars of life, so from them are taken the means of preseruation of health, which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6933:9"/>
as to beasts are applied by naturall instinct, so are they vsed of man by reason, the temperer of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and affection.</p>
                  <p>This prouision of sustenance is most agreeable with the goodnes of the Creator, who as he is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of being to the Creature, so fayleth hee not to maintaine and preserue the same Creature the whole terme of the being thereof: and because the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the Creature is perpetuall, his wisedome hath also foreseene, and prouided a perpetuall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie of such sustenance, as is fit for that nature which standeth in neede thereof: and because the neede is not once for all, but parted into times, varying, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuers disposition and nature of that for which this prouision is made, he hath also so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed his goodnes in this point, that at all times to all things, necessarie sustenance should not be to seeke; and this extended not to men onely, but euen to brute beasts, and all things which require nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The end of this prouision is the preseruation of the Creature, which Nature most carefully stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieth (if it might be perpetuall and eternall) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to bring it, the goodnesse of the Creator, will nothing wanting, his wisedome will haue it waite vpon the necessitie of the Creature: wherefore as the Earth is called the mother of all things, not because it bringeth them forth onely, but yeeldeth them perpetuall nourishment, so is the countrie of all people to them named, the parent of all parents. Then by natures lawe, all things being abundantly ministred vnto vs for the preseruation of health at home in our owne fieldes, pastures, riuers, &amp;c. how can the wisedome of God, and his goodnesse
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6933:10"/>
stand with the absence of Medicines and remedies necessarie for the recouerie of health, the neede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as vrgent of the one as of the other: and so as great an occasion of practise of the same goodnes and wisedome in the one as in the other? which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most plaine and euident, it followeth necessarily that the medicine should be as reade for the sicke, as meate and drink for the hungry and thirstie: which except it be applied by the natiue countrie, can not be else performed. It is knowne to such as haue skil in nature, what wonderfull care she hath of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of creatures, not onely giuing to euery part of them a carefull discharge of sundrie duties, as of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, retention, concoction, expulsion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, distribution, and such like, but also to the whole creature, a knowledge of medicine to helpe themselues, if haply diseases annoy them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>India,</hi> nor <hi>Arabia,</hi> but from their verie haunt: which being not denied to them, much more is graunted to vs, in so much as (the worke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being most excellent in man) she is more vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ouer mankinde then ouer other creatures, as by the shape thereof most plainely appeareth. The Swallow cureth her dimme eyes with <hi>Celendine</hi>: the Wesell knoweth well the vertue of <hi>Hearbgrace</hi>: the Doue the <hi>Veruen</hi>: the Dogge dischargeth his mawe with a kind of <hi>Grasse</hi>: the Spider is <hi>Triacle</hi> to the Munkey: the <hi>Hippopotamus</hi> dischargeth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of his bloud by opening a veine: and <hi>Ib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6933:10"/>
drugges, but familiar with them, and taken from the place of their foode: it being very probable she hath bestowed this gift euen vpon all, one hauing interest in natures care as well as another. By this then may wee gather, if nature faile not the verie beasts in this behalfe, neither sendeth them to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe a farre of, much more is that performed vnto vs the Lords of all the creatures, and for whose vse all things were created: except we be thought lesse subiect to diseases then they, wherein we be so little priuiledged, that no creature in that respect is so fraile as we, and those most subiect to infirmities which are gouerned and dieted by vs. So that wee of all creatures haue greatest neede of Natures libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hand in this behalfe. For be it for the most part, we are more healthfull then sickly, and so haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vse of the meanes of keeping health, then of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing, yet hardly can a man say which of them is more necessarie to be readie and prest at hand, the daunger of diseases being alwaies imminent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though diseases themselues be not alwaies present. Now if to any the reason seeme weake from that which should be to inferre a being thereof, we are to vnderstand in the workes of God, whatsoeuer should be, is; hee being a workman of an absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and cunning. But saith one, the East and West Indies <hi>Arabia, Barbarie,</hi> the red Sea, are the Mines, as it were, and the fountaines of medicines; and <hi>Spaine, Protugale,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> the vents of such things, and Nauigation the meanes to obtaine them.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, but those countries yeelde many straunge things, whereof wee take vse with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6933:11"/>
great delight, and Nauigation serueth greatly for communicating of commodities and enterchange of merchandise: but how farre, and of what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities? Verely of such as if our delicacie would giue vs leaue, we might well spare, being things ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of superfluous pleasure then necessarie reliefes, and seruing rather for a certaine pompe, then for maintenance of life: and which without great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the wittes, might be proued to bring more harme to our countriemen, then commoditie: both in respect of the diuersitie in complexion of our bodies from those of straunge nations to whome they properly belong, the corruption of their outlandish wares, the selling of one thing for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>er, &amp; the withholding from vs the best of choyce: but of this hereafter. Moreouer, Nauigation being of a later inuention then the necessitie of medicine, neither practised of many nations at this day, cannot supply this want, or if men beganne then first to be diseased, when they began to find waies in the Sea to those far countries, doth it not greatly detract from that prouidence wherby all things are guided, to lay the recouerie of mans health vpon the adventures of Merchants? &amp; the disease being in the one part of the World, to haue the medicine in the other, yea, as farre distant as the East is from the West, and the life and death of a man to stand vpon a halfepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie weight of <hi>Scammonie,</hi> or a dramme or twaine of <hi>Rhewbarb?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, which is yet more absurd, that the health of so many Christian nations should hang vpon the courtesie of those Heathen and barbarous nations, to whome nothing is more odious then the very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6933:11"/>
name of Christianity? And who of malice do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde from vs such medicines as they knowe most for our vse? Whereupon the Turke denieth vnto the Christians at this day the <hi>Terra Lemnia,</hi> a medicine to be preferred before the chiefe of those wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues to enioy. The corruption of their drugges, is it not so great, that in this light of all knowledge, scarce is one able to discerne the right <hi>Bolus Armena,</hi> from the Ocre of <hi>Apulia,</hi> or to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the adulterating of <hi>Ambergreece,</hi> &amp; <hi>Muske,</hi> with a number of other corruptions, which haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten strength by custome of errour? <hi>Thamarinds,</hi> are counterfeited with <hi>Prunes, Scammonie</hi> with the milk of <hi>Spurge, Manna</hi> with <hi>Suger</hi> and the leaues of <hi>Sene, Aspalathum</hi> with the inward part of the roote of an <hi>Olue</hi> tree, <hi>Frankencense</hi> with <hi>Rosin, Bdellium</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocalla</hi> with goomes: for <hi>Bolus Armena</hi> is sold a red earth out of <hi>Apulia,</hi> for <hi>Malabatheum</hi> a leafe of a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> or <hi>Orange,</hi> for <hi>Turpeth</hi> some other other roote dipped at both ends in <hi>Goom.</hi> Which bee as like in vertue to the simples whereof the bear they visard &amp; maske, as Chalke to Cheese, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe. And greatly thou art deceiued to thinke our Nauigations store vs with ancient Medicines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Physicke in olde time hath beene furnished. For at this day neither is <hi>Balme</hi> known vnto vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Xylobalsamum,</hi> nor <hi>Cardamomum,</hi> nor <hi>Amomum,</hi> neither <hi>Costus,</hi> neither <hi>Calamus odoratus, Aspalathus, Agallocum, Narcaphthum,</hi> with the most of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ancient Medicines: so that Nauigation hath not at any time supplied this want vnto vs, and how it should hereafter I knowe not, except <hi>Galen</hi> take paines againe to saile into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> into <hi>Palestine,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6933:12"/>
                     <hi>Lemnos,</hi> to gather and make choice with his owne hands. For what hope is there to be had of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision made by Merchants? who buy to sell onely, and thereof to reape gaine; and by reason they be vnlearned, if they should be faithfull, yet must they faile greatly in this poynt, and then must wee vse such medicines as wee can come by, and the patient recouer such health as he may.</p>
                  <p>For the most part these drugs come out of <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Portugale,</hi> eyther fetched of vs or brought of them, yet neither of them hath borne name of yeelde of the best simples, so that if they bee of those countries, then they are not such as they should be: If <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugale</hi> fetch them else where, then lyeth the assurance vpon their credite. Or let me know how they discerne the <hi>Coriander</hi> of <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> the blacke <hi>Helleborus</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> the <hi>Amomum</hi> of <hi>Scythia,</hi> the <hi>Myrrha Trogloditica,</hi> the <hi>Opium</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia,</hi> (which are counted the best) from the same growing in other places, which neuer carried name of commendation for such simples.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Coloquintida</hi> growing alone vpon the plant, is much suspected of good Physitians, the <hi>Squilla</hi> that hath no fellows, is thought to sauour of a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous nature, likewise the <hi>Thymelea</hi>: now, when these are gathered to the Merchants hand, who shall tell him how they grewe, or who shall inquire but the Philosopher that knoweth what may come ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to these simples, neither is the daunger lesse in the manner of laying them vp, and keeping them ouerlong: besides the iust time of gathering being either ouerpassed, or preuented, greatly diminisheth the vertues of the Medicines. As the vse of <hi>Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:6933:12"/>
is perillous before it bee a yeare olde, and after three yeeres it is nought worth, so <hi>Agaricke</hi> gathered before it be ripe, or kept past two yeeres, becommeth vnwholsome. And as the <hi>Peonie</hi> roote is to be gathered in the wane of the Moone, and the <hi>Crayfish</hi> to be taken after the rising of the Dog starre, the Sun entering into <hi>Leo,</hi> so are there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, which if they misse their due time of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, faile greatly in their vertues. To these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions moreouer may bee added the washing of the sea, the long iourneys they are brought, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it should seeme nature had denyed vnto vs the vse of them, as to whome they were not of her yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; with such difficultie, and as it were, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, they come to vs. Then if the best of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent simples be partly vnknowne and wanting, partly adulterated, partly by age and other meanes spent before they come to our vse, what shall wee say to our compounds and mixtures, which rise of these simples? Can the temper mend them? or a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> as they call them, serue the turne? No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, not our turnes, to whome the substitute Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as I may call them, were not appointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great part as hard to come by, as the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines whose substitutes they are, and as much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto vs. As for <hi>Agallocum Calamus odoratus,</hi> for <hi>Amomum Acorus,</hi> for <hi>Castorium, Bilphium,</hi> for <hi>Crocamagmo, Agallocus,</hi> with a number of the same sorte, which these fewe leaues of paper will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Neither is it to bee thought these Lieutenant Medicines serue at all turnes in the place of the right Medicines, for so should <hi>Ginger</hi> serue the turne of <hi>Folesoote</hi> to purge by vomit, which it can no more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6933:13"/>
then curds of Cowe milk can soften and supple like butter, or the dung of the stocke Doue purge like <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> or the Dock root draw flegm from the head like <hi>Pellitorie,</hi> which <hi>Galene</hi> notwithstanding maketh substitutes of these medicines which haue such operation. I conclude therefore, seeing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation can not affoord vs either the simples which wee seeme to neede, and those which it doth, both corrupt and counterfet in the greatest part, we haue neither to craue thereof in this point aide, much lesse to trust thereunto. Now the simples being (but for the most part) bastard ware, how can the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundes that amount of the same bee other then counterfet? Whereupon as <hi>Cardanus</hi> saith in his Methode of curing, the wise Magistrates of <hi>Venice</hi> haue often times forbidden the making of <hi>Triacle</hi> and <hi>Mithridatum,</hi> because the simples could not be had, whereby they should be compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: which if <hi>Venice,</hi> the greatest Mart in this part of the world of such wares can not auouch, what can we hope for from other places? that a man would maruell to see the great store of them in all shops of Apothecaries vnder the names of <hi>Triacle</hi> and <hi>Mithridatum</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus</hi>: and it being required in <hi>Triacle</hi> before it be vsed, it should haue a time, as it were, of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which of <hi>Galene</hi> in his booke of <hi>Triacle</hi> to <hi>Piso</hi> is extended to 12. yeares, and of <hi>Paulus Egine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> in his 7. booke by 7. yeares, for those that are bitten or stong of venemous beasts, or haue drunke poyson, or are infected with the pestilence, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diseases, from ten yeares till it be 20. of age; I maruell what assurance we haue of the age of this <hi>Triacle,</hi> which is ordinarie in vse; or if we haue none,

how we dare vse it at aduenture, knowing by age the vertue thereof hath no small alteration. I would these inconueniences were the smallest, which I haue but briefly, and as it were, for a taste run ouer, yet were euen they sufficient to stay our ouer hastie vse of such strange Merchandise, and to moue vs to betake vs to those wee knowe both in the blade, and in the seede, in the roote, &amp; in the fruite, &amp; know the aire, the hill, the valley, the medowe or Marish ground where they growe. But this trust vppon outlandish Medicines hath much more neerely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vs then so. If a man would say by this ouerha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie embracing whatsoeuer straunge nations doe as it were, purge ouer vnto vs, we drinke diuers times ranke poyson in steede of wholesome medicine, I trow it would iustly moue vs to bee aduised, and not to passe ouer the enquirie of a reason, why such a one should thinke so, being one whose vocation tendeth to the charge of the health of mens bodies. The right <hi>Hermodactils</hi> are commended for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent medicines against all paines in the ioynts, as the <hi>Gout,</hi> the <hi>Schiatica,</hi> and such like, from which they purge grosse flegme. <hi>Doronicum Romanum</hi> hath great commendation for comforting the heart, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling poyson, against the Cough, for auoyding of humors which ouercharge the Chest, which are great vertues doubtlesse in them both. Now if they in the shops, as they beare the name of these medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, so caried not with them in steed of these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues daungerous poyson, then should I haue lesse cause to exhort our nation to betake them to their Gardens, and Fields, and to leaue the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the Fens of <hi>India.</hi> The common <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modactils</hi>

being a kinde of poyson called <hi>Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> so named, because with such swiftnesse it char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and ouerchargeth our vitall spirits, that it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him that hath taken it in one day.

Now if by reason no such daunger hapneth to vs, by the vse of them, they seeming not so daungerous: wee are to vnderstand they bee giuen in small quantitie, and mixed with diuers remedies against poyson, the good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God prouiding so, that otherwise they should not be ministred, as in the purging electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of <hi>Diacnicu, Hermodactils</hi> are bridled with <hi>Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and the pouder of <hi>Diatragatanthum frigidum,</hi> where indeede it hath somewhat too large scope, being better tempered in <hi>Benedicta,</hi> with <hi>Cloues, Parsely</hi> seede, <hi>Galanga,</hi> and <hi>Mace,</hi> and in the pilles of <hi>Hermodactils</hi> with <hi>Aloe, Mirobalans, Bdellium,</hi> the seede of <hi>Herbgrace,</hi> which haue force against poyson, the which small quantitie of them being bridled, &amp; dulled with other medicines, especially such as resist the force of poiso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is not deadly to vs, although great hurt therof must needs ensue.

The reasons which I haue before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I leaue to the indifferent Reader to consider of: &amp; because I am so far vrged, I easily sticke not to hold, we receiue no smal hurt from all the kinds of strange medicines, whereof I yeeld these fewe reasons which followe.</p>
                  <p>Our English bodies, through the nature of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, our kind of diet &amp; nourishment, our custom of life, are greatly diuers from those straunge nations, wherby ariseth great varietie of humours, and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our bodies from theirs, and so the causes of diseases rising vpon breach of diet, the (diet being of an other sort) must needes bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Wherevpon, although their humors bee in kinde, and in a generalitie agreeable to ours, as bloud, choler, flegm, melancholie, and such like, yet rising vpon other matter then the same in vs: and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6933:15"/>
otherwise framed by a farre other state of bodie, by reason of a diuers kinde of life, the Medicines which helpe them must needs hurt vs, not finding the like causes to striue with: and this no doubt is the cause why wee are not able to beare such dose or quantitie of their Medicines as those nations are to whome they be natiue. Besides, they worke in our bodies after a farre more vnkind manner then they report them to doe in theirs: nay, they destroy vs, and helpe them, which is an argument to me, that euery Medicine hath a relation to the diseases of the inhabitant, which if it be profitable to straungers, yet doeth it by a constraint and not halfe so kindely. The <hi>Greekes,</hi> as it may appeare by <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in his fourth Book &amp; a hundreth &amp; two &amp; fiftie Chapter, entreating of <hi>Scammonie,</hi> are able to beare a greater quantitie, yea, double, then we of <hi>Scammonie,</hi> which is an ordinarie purger with vs. Who saith, thirtie graines thereof may be giuen with 20. of blacke <hi>Helleborus,</hi> and 60. of <hi>Aloe</hi> to make a iust purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; of <hi>Scammonie</hi> alone 60. graines. Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience teacheth vs the great oddes betwixt <hi>Scammonie</hi> rawe, as they call it, and the same cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, which we name <hi>Dacrydium,</hi> both in vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of purging, and tormenting the bodie: yet hardly dare we passe aboue 20. graines of the same, and this mixed with <hi>Cordialls,</hi> and stomach Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. Moreouer, their slender correcting of it, doth argue it to be farre lesse noisome to them then to vs, who correct it onely, or at the least, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the correction thereof by a little <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Pepper,</hi> or a little <hi>Ginger</hi>: who for the plenty of excellent simples, which we both want and know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6933:15"/>
not, and for their skill in the nature of those wee correct with, might as well haue qualified it as we, whoe first wash it in <hi>Rose-water,</hi> wherein <hi>Cytrea Myrobalanus, Spike,</hi> and <hi>Cinamon</hi> haue beene boiled: in which also we let it steep foure &amp; twentie houres, then drie it, then mixe it againe with oyle of sweet <hi>Almonds,</hi> and some <hi>Goom</hi> for <hi>Tragacantha,</hi> and last of all bake it in a <hi>Quince</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> couered round with paste. Who hath not horror of the torments which both the <hi>Hellebores</hi> bring to the body? yet sayth <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Egineta</hi> in his seauenth Booke, and fourth Chapter, the blacke <hi>Helleborus</hi> purgeth yellow choler from the whole bodie without paine: which cannot bee verified of our bodies, howsoeuer it be in theirs, and therefore we feare to minister the pouder thereof in any sort, but the steeping onely of the barkes of the roots, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a simple which hath not many yeeres beene in vse, brought out of <hi>India,</hi> and highly commended, called <hi>Mechoaca,</hi> it purgeth gently say they, without vexing or grieuing the bodie, without annoying the stomacke greatly, and ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

then which hitherto hath beene said, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest wee receiue great hurt by the vse of strange medicines, and not vpon reason onley, but from plaine experience, euen with hurt to our owne bodies, which as it is the greatest price of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so therefore ought wee the more to sette thereby, and more carefully to seeke to auoyde the daunger. Againe it is euident, that the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of strange simples frameth them more to our vse. Wherefore as there bee many excellent Gardens in <hi>England,</hi> especially in London repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with store of strange and outlandish simples, it were to bee wished such indeuours were of others followed, that so we might acquaint vs better with these strangers, and by <hi>vsu capio</hi> make them our owne. But what soyle will brooke all things' It is true, yet no doubt of those that it will brooke, which I dare say are foure or fiue hundreth, this fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie of nature towards vs as it is thought, might beare a greater shewe, and we more safely vse them, especially the purgers, which carie with them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test annoyance.

Wherefore the commendation of a medicine lyeth not in force, but in such force. And therefore the counsell of the best Physitians is, if the disease will beare any delay, as the most doe, rather to apply a medicine of a weaker force, then at once with a vehement one, to shake the frame of nature. And the weaker medicine being weake, either in respect of the nature of the simple, or the small quantitie, they counsell rather to vse that kinde of curing which is by the feebler medicine in kinde, then by reason of the vnder quantitie.

What hath been said of venemous beasts, may also bee shewed in the cure of strange diseases, wherein nature see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be as carefull as in the other.

This testifieth <hi>Fallopius</hi> in his Booke of the French Pockes. Yet neede not our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines craue the helpe of India for the cure thereof, no, not although it rage farre more fiercely (as it doeth) against vs then against them.

These base creatures the rather I propound, that beeing knowne, the treasures which Nature hath hid and layde vp in them, with such varietie of vertues, wee might, the better esteeming of her benefites, and the blessings of our owne countrie, both acknowledge them, accept them, and bee more thankfull vnto God for them. The which base creatures the viler they seeme to be, the more commend they the goodnesse of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who would not the abiectest thing that is, should altogether bee without wherewith to serue, and doe homage to his Lord and maister: which if these things affoord vs, what may wee iustly promise to our selues, and require of the rest more excellent creatures? Let not the reason seeme strange and weak to thee reader, who art a Christian, which is taken from the prouidence and wisedome of God, to proue the sufficiencie of his execution and performance of the same. For if <hi>Galene</hi> thought it reasonable, (as it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.) to gather the wisedome and prouidence of the Creator by his work in the Creature &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thereof, which he in the end of his bookes

And if <hi>Galene</hi> had that religion in him, beeing a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; and groping onely in the mist of naturall knowledge of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not satisfie himselfe with a Psalme or Hymne (as hee himselfe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it) of seuenteene staues, euery staffe contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a whole booke (for thus hee himselfe calleth his Bookes of the vse of parts) of the wisedome of the most wise God, esteeming that dutie more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him then sacrifices of an hundreth Oxen, or the most costly perfumes and incense; let it not bee harsh in thine eares gentle reader, to heare now and then the goodnesse of our God, his wisedome and prouidence, to bee both intreated of and aduanced of a Christian Physitian, and to Christians, to whome the sunne of righteousnesse hath shined and scatterred those mists of naturall darkenesse, and hath giuen the earnest of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. And bee assured there is no truth in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie, but may stand with, yea rather may rest, and bee vpholden of Christianitie. But let vs proceede. <hi>Iulius Bassus, Nicerates,</hi> and <hi>Petronius Niger,</hi> as saith, <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> thought their countrie medicines, and those which their natiue soyle yeelded, most worthy to bee exactly intreated of by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like either thinking them sufficient for the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or more agreeable with them. Which homely practise of the na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6933:28"/>
whereof he compounded his golden book of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which at this day remaineth a rich storehouse to all Physitians. Now then I would know why we should more bee prouided of medicine against one disease then another, of our countrie yeeld? is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such diseases which require strange medicines are more daungerous, or lesse? if more daungerous then should the remedy for them be more at hand, then for other: if lesse, why are then the strange me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines esteemed as most forcible? and if we be lesse subiect to such diseases as are cured with them, &amp; so the absence of them may seeme tolerable, why then are tertian agues chiefly cured with <hi>Thamarines</hi> and <hi>Rhewbarbe</hi>? wherof the one commeth out of India, &amp; the other for the most part out of Barbarie. What so euer nature is yeelded to any nation, it serueth either for nourishment or medicines, or being ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nourishment nor medicine, is plaine poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Now a subducction beeing made of each of these, one from the other, what part shall we thinke wil nourishments leaue to medicines? a far greater doubtless then they them selues be: &amp; as they exceed nourishments, so greatly do they &amp; beyond al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison exced the poisons. Wherefore if the most of creatures in euery nation, be a fit matter of medicine, greatly no doubt are all nations stored with them: which store declareth, that as diseases partly rise of breach of diet, &amp; partly through poisons, so Nature would furnish vs with medicines in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the causes of both: which being not sufficient, argueth that Nature misseth of her purpose, hauing sufficiently declared her endeuour: but Nature alwaies bringeth her workes to perfection, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in case of monsters, which are not ordinary.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6933:29"/>
Wherefore her will, (she being an instinct of Gods) euer going with the execution thereof, must needs performe that to vs which she pretendeth in the varietie. But that thou maist (gentle reader) haue better holde and greater assurance of the sufficiency of thy countrie medicines. I will set downe brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the variety and sorts of all diseases cured with medicine, medicines taken from our natiue soyle aunswerable vnto them, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to cure them. And because medicines haue relation to diseases, I will first touch the diseases, and thereto ioyne the medicicines. All diseases are either in the complexion, or frame of the bodie, such as are in the complexion are all cured by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; which I named in the beginning of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise one of the instruments of Physicke. Of disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the frame, these onely are cured with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; Quantitie superfluously increased, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: obstructions, ouerstraightnesse or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largnesse of passages in the bodie. These are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diseases properly to bee cured with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: other diseases which rise of these, either of their owne accord vanishing by the cure of these, or else to bee cured by surgerie, as euill figure and shape through want of proportionall quantitie, that beeing restored, the figure forthwith returneth; or if not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ather is to be cured with helpe of hand. And luxation of ioynts, and euill coupling of partes, if they rise of distemper onely, that beeing taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with medicines, returneth oftentimes with it good situation of partes. Likewise, the situation peruerted through distemper, the complexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing restored, the other consequently do followe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:6933:29"/>Now, hauing declared in generall the diseases which onely require medicine; that euerie disease may haue his proper one, I will subdiuide them more particularly, ioyning to euery disease that medicine which thereto belongeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The diseases in the complexion are either in all the parts of the temper thereof, or else in one or twaine. In the whole complexion are such as are ingendred of venemous causes: and those either ingendred in the body, or happening thereto outwradly they which are ingendered in the bodie, are Cankers, Leprosies, falling sicknesse, Suffocation of the matrix through nature corrupted, Swounings through corruption of Wormes ingendred in the body. And these bee the diseases of venemous causes bred in the bodie. Such as happen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by outward occasions, are either by poyson taken into the bodie, or by outward touching procured: taken into the bodie, as the poyson of <hi>Toades, Henbane, Nightshade, Hemlocke, Rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, Quicksiluer,</hi> and such mineralls, and last of all infected aire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> causing pestilence, and Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Such as are outwardly procured, are either without woundes or with woundes: without wounds, infection passing from one to another, as the French pockes. With wounds, venemous bitings and stingings of beasts, as of Serpents and madde Dogges. And these are all the diseases said to bee in the whole temper of the bodie, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing first shewed to be sufficiently cured by home medicines, in like man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

soyle is knowne to bestow vpon vs for cure of these diseases, which would growe to an infinite vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, I heerein referring thee to the workes of those who of purpose haue written of the nature of simples, and are authors of practise, but it shall I hope suffice for this purpose to picke out amongst a great many, those of choise for these diseases. And first to begin with Cankers, which being not exulcerated but remayning humors, are cured (if with any medicine) by the iuyce of <hi>Nightshade,</hi> all the sortes of <hi>Endiue</hi> and <hi>Succorie,</hi> with <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> with <hi>Saint Iohns wort,</hi> wilde <hi>Clarie,</hi> called <hi>Oculus Christi,</hi> the flesh of <hi>Snayles</hi> boyled, <hi>Cray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishes,</hi> greene <hi>Frogges,</hi> and to conclude, with all kinde of metalls and mineralls; and among them <hi>Leade,</hi> how so euer it be vsed, is most souereigne. If it bee exulcerated, then heerein haue the mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls and metalls the chiefe place. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Gangrene and <hi>Speacelus,</hi> are cured by the remedies of the Canker and Woolfe, the one beeing a degree of an Vlcer in which the partes begin to bee morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the other when they haue now lost life altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The leprosie is an vniuersall Canker, and for outward medicines requireth no other: among the inward, <hi>Plantine, Whay, Hedgehogs</hi> dryed and drunke, helpe greatly. And thus much for Cankers and Leprosies, which as they be disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hard to bee cured by any medicine, so receiue they as great helpe by these our home medicines, as by any of strange countries. The falling sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if it be in such as are aged, and haue beene

but vse it for an ordinary sustenance. Whereby again appeareth a great diuersitie of working of strange medicines according to the variety of countries. But what should wee say of the nature of purgers, it is doubtlesse one of the hardest points at this day in all naturall Philosophie, neither minde [at this present to deale therein: but this may I say, as by preparation, one nature may according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie thereof, receiue diuerse, yea contrary vertues; so seemeth it to me that this vertue of purging may be procured to natures of themselues destitute ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by preparation.</p>
                  <p>Diuerse and in a manner all the metalls, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, beeing burnt and washed, giue ouer their fretting nature, and quicksiluer (which of it selfe it is not sublimed, or precipitated) becommeth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement scouring medicine: so likewise Antimonie, before it be turned into glasse or oyle, is not known to purge the bodie: vvhich beeing done, is greatly commended against the Dropsie, the French pocks, melancholie, and diuerse other diseases, vvhich it cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by purging. So that it seemeth, art of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it maketh no nature (that beeing a vvorke of the vniuersall nature) so may it not onely bee a preparer, but euen a maker of medicines: vvhich medicines are not natures, euen as health, and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are not of the nature of mans body, but euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents thereto.</p>
                  <p>Which being certaine, let vs then consider what an infinite variety of medicines wold arise of things, the same being vsed not only entire, but diuersly prepar'd &amp; euen corrupted: wherin the industry of <hi>Alchmists</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:6933:35"/>
is verily greatly to bee commended, and farre more excellent then the common <hi>Pharmacopolla</hi> rather so to bee called then <hi>Pharmacopolya,</hi> by the skill whereof diuerse natures in one thing are so exactly seuered, euery one hauing a diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.

For melancholie: violets, borage, buglosse, baulme, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I wil drawe to an end: and thus much shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this present purpose to haue said of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, belonging to the cure of all diseases in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. The other kinde of diseases are in the frame of the body: and of those, if quantity bee superfluously increased, and that in the whole body, medicines which do vehemently waste, as those of the third degree hot, diminish the same. If in the part onely, medicines which we call eaters, and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6933:35"/>
dispatch the same: as coperous, the ashes of spurge, burntalum, mercurie sublimed and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, verdigrece, burnt salt, &amp;c. If measure be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, and that without losse of substance, the glewing medicines bring cure: whereof our natiue soile is so stored, that for wounds, the Surgions need neither to send into Barbarie, nor India: as Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, Hounds tonge, the flowers and leaues of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, yarrow, carduus benedictus, betony, sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, veruen, elme leaues, adders tonge, moone worte, hearbe turpence, Selfe heale, and these if the wounds bee in the fleshie partes. If it be breaking of bones, such are ioyned with fine flower, the brayne of a dogge, with woll, and the white of an egge, the holyhocke roote, the mosse of the oke, glewe, roses, worme woode, &amp;c. If there be losse of substance in the fleshie parts either by wound, or vlcer, Incarnatiues fayle vs not: as barlie meale, fenegreeke flower, fighene meale, and to bee short all such as bee of the first degree hot and drie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out egernes or felnes. Now the diseases in straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of passages or obstructions, if they arise of the humors afore said, and in those places whereto the medicine may conueniently come, then are they to be sette free by purging. If vpon other causes, or in such places wherto the force of the medicine which purgeth cannot come, or hardely entereth, or of such causes as be no humors, but through some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strange matter, or by straightnes of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells, where though the passage is, then are other remedies to be vsed whereof we haue great plentie, as softners, loosers, and such as doe enlarge tho pores of the bodie, of which sorte are such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not aboue the first degree hote: as Chamomile, Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, new butter, Swines greace, Linseed, Fenigreek, Brionie root, all marrowes: Also medicines which make the matter thin, or cut it, and diuide it into sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts, of which sort are they of the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree hot to the third degree, as Dill, Peneriall, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, Organ, Thyme, Marioran, Saint Iohns wort, Worme-wood, &amp;c. Now, if the humour prepared be to be voided by place medicine, then salt, salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lie, Ashes, Alume, and Lime, take place; and if more vehemencie bee needfull, Calamint, vvild Cresses, Triacle, mustard, Garden Cresses, Mustard seed, nettles, dragons, all the spurges are to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the best: and if these serue not, the root of Crowfoot will make the supply. If the humour cannot be voided conueniently, except it be altered into another matter, of which sort is pent bloud out of the veines, then are ripening medicines first to be applyed: as butter, wheat-flower, Sorel, Horsehoof, Lillies, Marchmallowes, Onyons rosted; which all are singular ripers. If the matter be rough &amp; clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, these scourers auoyd that inconuenience; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diue, Suchorie, Red-roses, Plantaine, Houseleeke, Agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>monie, Betony, Hony, Horchound, Worme-wood, Baulme, Pimpernell, Watergermander, &amp;c. Now, if the matter which stoppeth be the stone, as in the kidneyes, or bladder, then are these medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines most conuenient for that vse: Grummell seed, Goates bloud, the iuyce of Mugwort, Seahuluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root, the stones found in the great snayles heads, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish roots, Saxifrage, &amp;c. If any hard matter be in other parts, the softners and wasters, &amp; dissoluers are to be applyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:6933:36"/>Thus much touching the cure of obstructions and straight passages, which according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of place where they light, cause sundry diseases, or rather take to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sundry names. As in the braine, the Apoplexie; in the bladder of Gall, the yellovve Iawnes; in the Splene, the black: in the synewes of motion, the palsey or trembling; in the lungs Asthma, and so foorth.</p>
                  <p>Now, if these passages be too large, they are to be stopped and streightned with cooling and drying medicines, of which sort in a manner are all of sharp and sowre taste; as Vine-leaues, the Brier, and the Bramble, Barbaries, Medlers, and Seruices, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; such as are of themselues, or by mixture with liquor clammie, as wheat flower, beane flower, the white of an egge, plaister, washed lime, Litharge, and Ceruse.</p>
                  <p>Now moreouer, because in all good cure, not onely the cause of the diseases is to bee oppugned, but the part also to bee strengthened, which must needs (partly by the cause of the disease, and partly euen by the conflict of the same cause with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine) befeebled; that nothing be wanting vnto vs for the restoring of health, nature hath prouided e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen speciall munition for euery part of the body, that the whole furniture against all diseases might be complete.

                  <p>Thus haue I (gentle reader) briefely run ouer the diseases cured by medicine, hauing passed by those which eyther rise of these, as euill figure by immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate excesse, or defect of quantitie, vnequally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing or wanting, or number, euill situation for want of good couplance through distemper, &amp; such like, as also the compounde of those, which require (onely composition excepted) the same medicines. Whereby euidently maist thou see, the goodnes of God towards thee, in so plentifully furnishing thine owne soyle with such varietie of medicines: which if it yeeld thee such plenty in this neglect &amp; lothing of our countrie remedies, what fruite wert thou to looke for, if diligence and paines were vsed? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily right well might wee both auoyde the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers before declared, ease our selues of immoderate charge, and haue better assurance of our medicines
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6933:37"/>
then wee haue: yea verie well satisfie our dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness euen with strange simples, or finde out such as should not only in vertues match with the spices of India (which is a plaine case) as Rosemarie match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Cinamon: Basill, Cloues: Sage, the Nutmegge: Safforn Ginger: Thyme, Muske: Sauerie, the leafe called Malabathrum, but euen in pleasantnes of rast expresse the same. And as Auens doth most liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the taste of cloues vnto vs, so likelie is it if search were made, and this enterprise of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and trying our natiue simples taken in hand by men of wisedome, and vnderstanding, wee should no more be destitute of spices then <hi>India</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> although neither <hi>Indish,</hi> nor <hi>Arabicke</hi>: and as the small iagges of the rootes of Auens, faile little from cloues in taste, so might wee as likely find that which were little inferiour to Cinamon, ginger, nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megges, and mace, not onely in likenesse of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but euen in similitude of nature: but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this to that time, when either men shall bee more carefull for publike benefit then priuate gaine, or sufficient allowance bestowed on such men as shold spend their daies only in searching out the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of natures, which at this time is greatly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, euen as for all other professions of artes. Our English soyle is greatly commended, as it iustly deserueth, for temper of the aire: &amp; of such as haue experience thereof, of strangers, and great masters of simples, for varietie of excellent medicines car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth great praise, who report they finde such sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the valleys and woodes of our North parts, as they finde in the toppes of mountaines in the South countries. So that certaine gardine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

varietie of medicines euen of forraine simples to all diseases. And if the Dittany of Candie, the Cipres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, if it bee demaunded, vvhy then both the practise is, and hath been hitherto otherwise; I will onely say thus much for answere, although much more might be said: The whole art of Physick hath been taken partly from the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Arabians.</hi> And as the precepts of the Art, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the meanes and instruments wherewith for the most part the precepts of the same art are executed: which hath bred this errour in times past, now by a tradition receiued, that all dutie of the Physician touching restoring health, is to bee performed by the same remedies, not in kinde onely, but euen specially with those which the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Masters vsed, who wrote not for vs, but for their <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Arabicks,</hi> tempering their medicines to their estates, although their rules be as common as reason to all nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> saith in his first booke of preseruing health, he giueth the rules therof no more to <hi>Germans,</hi> then to Boares and Beares, but to the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6933:38"/>
declareth, they respected their owne nation both in rule and medicine; whom also the <hi>Arabians</hi> in the same poynt followed.</p>
                  <p>Now, we receiuing the same medicines with the rule, must needs fall into the absurdities afore-saide: Much like to the euill Musitian, which playeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the instrument whereon his Master taught him, which if he assay vpon another, committeth diuerse discords among other euill graces in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick. But the wise and learned Physitian, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with other arts more generall then his owne, whereto naturall philosophie most nighly approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, beeing a knowledge of all naturall things not of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or <hi>India,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> but vniuersally, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all Countries medicines for diseases, nature yeelding sufficiencie of contraries to all sorts of them, wherto the inhabitants are subiect, at the least, in all quarters, which rise not of a blinde tradition, but from a certaine knowledge of nature. This then I take to be the chiefe cause of this custome in vsing strange medicines, which ignorance of nature doth feele, &amp; nourish daily. I blame none, neither tax I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, &amp; I dare say there is not a learned Physitian in this land, who is not able to performe this poynt with English medicines, if they would take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand: whereto I rather exhort them, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them, beeing a thing sufficiently known vnto them. For it is not the Nutmegge, or the Mace that strengtheneth the braine, and cureth cold disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and moyst diseases thereof: but a drying and warming vertue, with a secret agreement which they haue with the braine to preserue the same, which being found as sufficient in Sage, in Rosemary, in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:6933:39"/>
Betony and such like, the nutmegge and the mace, with such other spice, for that turne may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. The same may bee said of all strange na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which although wee want, yet haue we such as are as sufficient to serue in st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ede: for as euerie nation hath a peculiar condition of the same disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so must the medicine also needes bee of another sort: and as the medicine varieth, so why the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same medicine should not also varie I knowe not. The medicine varieth in respect of the complexion of the patient being other in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then in an other: which medicine is as it were seated in nature, which hath many qualities besides the medicinable, which qualitie if the medicine be good, must agree with the patients complexion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not, then hurteth it greatly. If it agreeth with the complexion of a <hi>Moore,</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> or <hi>Spanyard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> then must it needes disagree with ours, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement and want if it bee patched vp vnto vs by correctours, yet declareth that patching, that the medicine is rather by force constrained, then naturally yeeldeth it selfe to the remedie, and so of it selfe vnmeet. Wherefore as well the matter ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be changed, as the medicine it selfe. And if those correctors neede also correction, what then? I will not say that all simples neede their correctors, although it be auouched of some, and such as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great authoritie for their skill in Physicke. Thus haue I (gentle reader) for thy benefite I hope, made a way to the greater vse of our home medicines, wherin if I haue said freely my mind against strange drogues, thou maist vnderstand that otherwise the way were stopped to our English medicines, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6933:39"/>
blame me not, if I say asmuch for ours, as the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers say for theirs. And if as yet by custome it seeme hard to alter the common course, let each practicer looke to that, I set no lawes to any, onely I craue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in this point, both pleasant and profitable to English men. Wherein I haue examples of excellent Philosophers &amp; learned Physitians, neither broach I any idle conceites of my owne. Of this mind is <hi>Plinius Secundus, Fuchsius, Rulandus, Symphorianus, Campegnis, Octauianus Horatianus,</hi> Physitian to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> the Emperor, that all countries haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient medicines for all diseases. I know much more might be said of this point. But this I thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the present time, breaking as it were the yse I hope to others, who hereafter shall more copiously deale in the same argument, or at the least, drawing the first lines (of a more large treatise to my selfe which as leasure, and opportunitie shall serue may hereafter be accomplished) this gentle reader I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thee to accept in such sort, as I offer it vnto thee euen with a minde to spend my daies according to my small talent, for thy benefite.

But indeede all the time of the cure, we must studie to strengthen the liuer and bowels, as much as may bee. <hi>Ioh. Wierus.</hi>
