            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So many able Men hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

that I thought it would be to no

unleſs I intended to be an Eccho,
and repeat what others have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid. I have ſpoken of Men
lately in a Book, which I called,
<hi>The Art of War;</hi> but if I miſtake
not, no Man hath hitherto treated
of <hi>Arms.</hi> And therefore that theſe
Three Parts may be compleat, I
thought fit to publiſh this little
Treatiſe, wherein I ſhall explain
as clearly, and in as few words as
poſſibly I can, the uſe of all <hi>Arms,</hi>
which are at preſent to be found

were heretofore in uſe among the

ELOGY
ON
<hi>The Profeſsion of Arms,</hi>
AND
THE ORIGINAL
OF
<hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E NOBILITY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Profeſſion of Arms hath
in all Ages been the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Glorious of all
Profeſſions; and no man in <hi>Rome</hi> could
riſe to the Civil Magiſtracy, who had
not ſerved Ten years in the Wars. By
Arms Kingdoms ſubſiſt, Juſtice flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
the Wicked are puniſhed, and
the Proud humbled to their Duty;
and from them alone True Nobility
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33517:11"/>
derives its Original. Before, all men
were born equal, and the difference
of Eſtates and Offices, made the ſole
diſtinction of Perſons.</p>
            <p>War in Ancient Times was neither
the Refuge of the Wretched, nor the
Sanctuary of the Baniſhed; and the
Romans received none but Choſen
Men into Service, who were obliged
to put themſelves in Equipage, and
for the ſpace of Twenty years ſerve
at their own Expences, either among
the Horſe or Foot; and when they
had fulfilled the term of their Service,
they received from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
Rewards ſuitable to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of their Actions, either by being
promoted to the moſt Honourable
Charges, or being endowed with
Lands and Inheritances in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Provinces, where after the
Fatigues of War they quietly enjoyed
the Sweetneſs of Peace. And that the
Natives of the Countrey might not
be baniſhed, but means of ſubſiſting
afforded them, they gave them lands
to labour, for payment of a yearly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33517:11"/>
Tribute. Hence have ſprung Tenures,
Dependancies, Quit-Rents and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which Vaſſals owe to their
Lords and Superiors.</p>
            <p>Theſe new Maſters made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at firſt conſiderable by that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs
which was ſo natural to the
Romans, by that way of Living,
which puts a Diſtinction between
thoſe that have Carried Arms and
ſuch as have not, and by the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their brave Exploits, which
they had engraven on their Shields, as
a Mark of the Nobility which they
had acquired by their Valour. And
from thence we have Scutcheons, and
the Name of Eſquire or Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>All Rewards were not of equal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and were diſtributed according
to merit, as I have already ſaid. He
who in an Aſſault firſt mounted the
Wall of a Town, was honoured with
a Mural Crown; and on him who had
reſcued a Roman Citizen, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
a Civick Crown, which was
put upon his Head by the Perſons
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33517:12"/>
own hands whom he had relieved from
danger. Thoſe whoſe Actions were
brave and more commendable, were
likewiſe more highly rewarded than
others, and had allotted them a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſhare of Lands. Such, I ſay, were
of Chiefeſt Note amongſt the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well in reſpect of their Wealth,
as in conſideration of thoſe Glorious
Crowns, which they carried on their
Scutcheons: And from them are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
the Illuſtrious Families of
great Lords, who carry Coronets o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Arms, and who in progreſs
of time have changed their Ancient
Crowns into thoſe which they bear
at preſent, according to the new Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
wherewith Sovereigns have
been pleaſed to honour them; as of
Duke, Marqueſs, Earl, Viſcount, and
Baron. And though the Quality of
Baron be wholly baniſhed from the
Court of <hi>France,</hi> yet it was the firſt,
and I may ſay, the onely Dignity that
was heretofore in <hi>France;</hi> as may be
ſeen in the Ancient Chronicles of the
Kingdom, when they ſpeak of Kings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33517:12"/>
accompanied with the Chief Barons,
who were in that time, what the
Dukes and Peers of <hi>France</hi> are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
This puts me in mind of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
in Gauliſh Verſe; which is year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſung at High Maſs in the Pariſh
Church of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Rheims,</hi> on
the Twenty ſixth of <hi>December,</hi> the
Feaſt day of that Saint; which thus
begins:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Or ecoutez la paſſion</l>
                  <l>De Saint Eſtienne le Baron, &amp;c.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now hearken to the paſſion</l>
                  <l>Of Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> the Baron.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>The good people of paſt Ages
would have thought themſelves want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Reſpect and Veneration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Saints, if they had not
qualified them with the Name of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;
which was the Nobleſt Title of
the great Lords of their Times. I
thought fit to adduce this inſtance,
to prove the Antiquity of Baronies;
but that I may return to my Subject,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33517:13"/>
I affirm that Arms have not onely
made Dukes, Marquiſſes, Earls, and
Gentlemen; but that they have alſo
raiſed to the Throne Men of a low and
deſpicable Birth.</p>
            <p>King <hi>David</hi> was a Shepherd, as
well as <hi>Saul</hi> his Predeceſſor. <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> was the Son
of a Jugler; <hi>Agathocles</hi> King of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſa,</hi>
the Son of a Potter; <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Son of a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
King <hi>Darius,</hi> the Son of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
King <hi>Sibaris</hi> had been a Servant
in an Inne; and the Ottomans, who
at this day poſſeſs the greateſt Empire
in the World, are deſcended from
Grooms, or Men that drove Camels.
Theſe Examples oblige us to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that it is by Arms alone that
Men render themſelves worthy of the
moſt Glorious Employments. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in that Profeſſion is to be learnt
that brave and gentile way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor,
which is found no where
but among the Nobility and Gentry.
There, every thing goes by Honour,
and without any hopes of Lucre and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33517:13"/>
Profit. There, Men learn to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
liberal and faithful. There is
nothing to be found in the Hiſtories
of the greateſt Captains, but Acts
of Honour and Vertue. The Valour
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Piety of <hi>Eneas,</hi>
the Prudence of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Modeſty
of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the Complaiſance of
<hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> the Juſtice of <hi>Aulus
Fulvius,</hi> the Clemency of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
the Magnificence of <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi>
the Chaſtity of <hi>Scipio Affricanus,</hi> and
the Integrity of <hi>Attilius Regulus;</hi>
are ſufficient proofs of what I have
alleadged.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I ſhall repeat what
I ſaid in the beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that the profeſſion of Arms
has been in all Ages, not onely the
moſt glorious and honourable of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions;
but likewiſe that which has
produced the greateſt men.</p>

                     <p>THe uſual Arms of Souldiers, are
not onely the Sword, Shable,
Dagger and Bayonet, but alſo the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33517:20"/>
Musket, Fire-lock, Mouſqueton, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol,
and many others: and the firſt
thing they ſhould learn, is to make
the right uſe of ſuch as their Officers
have given them.</p>
                     <p>The Musket is a Weapon for Foot,
the Barrel of which is three foot and
eight inches long, mounted on a
Stock of four foot and eight inches in
length. It was not invented till long
after the Canon.</p>
                     <p>The Bullet of Size contains in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
eight <hi>Lignes</hi> and a half (every
<hi>Ligne</hi> a third part of a Barley Corn)
and the charge of Powder ſhould
weigh half an Ounce and a Dram
of Magazin Powder.</p>
                     <p>A Musket carries commonly ſix
ſcore Fathoms, and if it be re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
a hundred and forty, or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty fathoms.</p>
                     <p>The half of this diſtance or leſs,
is ſufficient for a good Diſcharge; for
it is by chance if they hit and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
at the full diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The Priming ſhould be of a finer
Powder than the Charge, and the
Match dry and hard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33517:20"/>
For the Musket may be uſed dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-headed
Shot, which are two Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
faſtned together, by a little piece
of Iron, about half an inch long;
as may be ſeen by the Figure.</p>
                     <p>To preſent aright to fire, according
to the Rules of exerciſing of Arms;
the Butt of the Musket muſt be put
to the Breaſt, half a foot below the
Chin; the left hand under the Stock,
or upon the Scouring Stick, if it be
in its place; the right Hand-Thumb,
four or five Fingers breadth behind the
Breech, and the other Fingers of the
ſame Hand under the Tricker, to
draw and make the Cock play, when
one has a mind to Fire: The Muzzel of
the Musket muſt always be as high as
the Cheſt of the Body of the Enemy:
Skilful Souldiers never aim at the Head,
becauſe that part being too ſmall, the
leaſt motion of either of the two is
enough to make the Bullet miſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
when one Fires at the Body, whether
the motion make the Shot riſe too
high, or fall too low, or decline too
much to one ſide, the execution is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33517:21"/>
always good, and puts him who hath
received the Shot out of condition of
Fighting.</p>
                     <p>Bandeliers are a kind of Portable
Magazine, which contains all the
Ammunition neceſſary to a Soulder.</p>
                     <p>The uſual breadth of their Belt is
four inches, and the length four
foot. All Bandeliers are furniſhed with
a dozen of little Flasks, commonly
called Charges, and a little Bag or
Purſe of Sheeps Leather. The Flasks
ſerve to keep the Powder, and the
Bag or Purſe the Bullets.</p>
                     <p>The Horſe make uſe of Carabin or

carry as far as Muskets.</p>
                     <p>With a Fire-Lock one may ſhoot
juſter than what a Musket, becauſe
it is preſented in a quite different way;
that is to ſay, the end of the Butt to
the Shoulder, the ſide to the Cheek,
ſhutting the left Eye, and aiming
with the other through the Sight-hole,
which anſwers to the little Button on
the Muzzel of the Barrel.</p>

When one would ſhoot on a level,
he muſt aim ſtreight at the Mark; and
if a Man ſhoot from a low place to a
higher, he is to take his aim four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

                     <p>Fire-Locks are apter to miſ-give

                     <p>CArabins are a kind of Fire-Arms,
which take their Name from
thoſe ancient Souldiers, called Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
who commonly made uſe of
them in the Wars. They are of two
kinds, the Common, and the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.
The Common are thoſe
which were uſed by the Kings Guards
not long ago, and are uſually called
Carabins with great Locks; which
differ in nothing as to length, ſize,
and carrying, from Fuſils and Mouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetons,
but oneIy that they had
Wheel-works. The Extraordinary are
thoſe which the French call Arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33517:24"/>
Guttieres: ſuch as are thoſe
which are ſtill uſed by all the Arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers,
whoſe little wheel-work is
provided of a double ſpring for faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating
and ſpeeding the diſcharge;
and whoſe Barrel being thicker than
that of Common Carabins, can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blank about a thouſand paces,
with the ſame proportion of Powder
as is neceſſary for a Fuſil; becauſe it
is ſcrewed and rifled: that is to ſay,
wrought and crevaſſed in the inſide
from the Muzzel to the Breech, in
form of a Screw; and from thence
proceeds the juſtneſs of Arquebuſſes.</p>
                     <p>All Carabins or Arquebuſſes have
wheel-works, as well thoſe of great
as ſmall Locks, which are bent with
a Spanner proportionated to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Axel-tree of the Wheel;
upon which, when one intends to
fire, he puts down the Snaphaunce,
which in ſtead of a Flint, ought to
be provided with a true Mine-ſtone.</p>
                     <p>Heretofore were uſed Arquebuſſes,
which fired with a Match, in the ſame
manner as Muskets; but theſe Arms
are now out of uſe.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:33517:24"/>
The King commands at preſent
that in every Troop of his Guards be
carried eight rifled or ſcrewed Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
with Locks like to thoſe of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils,
Mouſquetons and Piſtols.</p>
                     <p>Heretofore Wheel-Locks, Arque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes
with Match Locks, Choques,
and Carabins, that bend with a Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
were in uſe; and ſtrangers uſe
them ſtill. It is true, they are ſurer
than others, but they are far more
cumberſome. All ſorts of Arms may
be charged, without any other way
of Meaſuring the Powder, than by the
following Rule; Put the Bullet into
the hollow of your Hand, and pour
Powder thereon, until it be covered
and appear no more. This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

                  <p>WE have had the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gun-powder from
<hi>China,</hi> by means of the
communication that a Monk named
<hi>Bertoldus,</hi> had with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> in
his Travels in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> about the
year 1380. And therefore the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſe
were never ſo much ſurprized as
when upon their accoſting theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33517:48"/>
Countreys, they ſaw a great
many Ships equipped and ranked in
Bataillia, adorned with Streamers,
Penons, and Ropes of ſeveral Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of Silk; but their ſurprize aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
when they heard the Guns
Fire: when they expected no ſuch
thing. So that it is not true that the
Monk was the firſt inventer of Gun-powder;
he was no more but the
publiſher of a Secret which he learnt
from the Tartars, and which he had
better kept to himſelf, without try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an experiment of it, that coſt
him ſo dear, and which buried him
in the Furnace which he himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived.</p>
                  <p>The Royal Prophet had reaſon to
ſay, That we fall commonly into the
ſnares which we have laid for others;
the Authors of pernicious things,
which tend onely to the deſtruction
of their fellow Creatures, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
miſerably periſhed by the very

the Inventers. We have beſides the

likewiſe of <hi>Perillus</hi> the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer

examples; but that I may return to
my Subject, there is no doubt but
that Powder hath been a diabolical
invention, the effects whereof are
no leſs dangerous than terrible, and
thunder-claps are not more to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

with the Baſtion, to which the
Miner is to be ſet at work. The firſt
thing a Miner does, is to cover the

hole, with two ſtrong Planks, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Plates of Iron to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt every thing that may be
thrown down upon him from the
Ramparts. Next he makes his lodging
upon one of the Faces of the Baſtion
towards the point, three foot high, and
about two foot broad. He digs and
chambers, untill he reach the middle
or farther into the Wall, to the end
the Mine may work the greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
he digs and chambers alſo to the
right and left in the thickneſs of the
Wall, at leaſt ſix foot on each ſide,
with the greateſt skill he can; and at
the end of each Chamber he ſhall make
a <hi>Fourneau</hi> or little Oven, according
to the knowledge he has of the
ſtrength of the Wall, in each where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he puts between two and three
hundred weight of Powder in Bags or
Barrels, laying it as dry as he can
upon Beds of Straw; afterward he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33517:51"/>
places his <hi>Sauciſſons,</hi> which are a
kind of Stockings or Caſes of Linnen
Cloath, an inch in diameter, filled
with Powder, and whereof the end
reaches to the Mouth or Entry of the
Mine, and becauſe by theſe <hi>Sauciſſons</hi>
the Fire is to be given to the Powder
of the <hi>Fourneaus,</hi> the Miner ſhould
cover them with Tiles or Planks of
Wood to ſave them from being
ſmothered: Next he is to ſhut the
hole with good pieces of Wood, well
propt and ſupported, to hinder the
flaſhing out of the Fire, he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to faſten all with a great many
Flints and hard Stones, made in form

ſtick cloſe and not eaſily give way,

if by chance he meet with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,
which are to be found in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Baſtions, he muſt chamber over
them, and leave between them and
his Mine a ſufficient thickneſs to keep
them from venting, and being made
uſeleſs by the countermines.</p>
                  <p>When a Mine is made in a place

where the earth is ſoft and yielding,
the Ground is to be ſupported by

                  <p>The Ancients made uſe of Mines or
Subterranean wayes, but their deſigne
was very different from ours; they

that the Clay of the Moulds be good,
well beaten and wrought as they
ought to be with Flocks and Hair,
that the Moulds and all that the Piece
is caſt upon, be well greaſed with
Tallow, well bound and banded with
Iron, well baked and prepared, well
placed and laid, that the Tronions be

that there be no Cracks, Flaws, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſes,

happens when the Metal is run too

were never uſed in <hi>France</hi> before
the year 1635 at the Siege of <hi>Dole.</hi>
They are made all of Iron, and are
hollow, with two handles to carry
them by; but they are not all of the
ſame ſize, nor of the ſame ſhape:
ſome are round and others long. The
firſt are called Bombes and the other
Fire-pots. They are filled with Fire-works
and Powder, and then are
ſtopped with a Bung or Stopple well
cloſed; in the middle of which is left
a hole to apply the Fuſe to.</p>
                     <p>When Bombes are to be ſhot, a
convenient ground is choſen, not too
far diſtant from the place which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be galled; and there, a
Platform is erected, which is provided
with Plancks of Timber, on which
the Mortar-pieces are planted.</p>
                     <p>Before a Bombe be put into the
Mortar-piece, there is thrown into the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33517:67"/>
bottom of it a Charge of Powder
proportioned to the weight of the
Bombe, which is laid above the Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole
aloft.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Mortar-piece is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Artiſt takes his heights and
meaſures, that the Bombe may direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall into the place that he intends;
that is to ſay, he gives leſs or more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation
to his Mortar-piece, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he is near or diſtant from the
place and ſtops it either with a Coin,
or with an Iron Pin, which he thruſts
croſs the Carriage; that being done,
he ſets fire to the Fuſe of the Bombe,
and then to the Powder of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-piece,
which forces out the Bombe
and carries it up in the Air: when it
is come to its full reach, it falls and
breaks in a thouſand pieces. The ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and pieces of it break and bruiſe
every thing they meet with, and the
Fire-works that are within it, ſet fire
in all places where it chances to fall.
Nothing gives greater terror to the
Towns-people of a Beſieged Town,
than Bombes; and the ravage that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33517:68"/>
there they do is ſo extraordinary, and
ſo gall Men, Women, and Children,
that they know not where to be in
ſafety.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen there is a deſign to petard
a Gate; the Scituation of it is
firſt to be viewed, and when a day is
pitched upon for the execution, the
Petards, Inſtruments and neceſſary U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils
are loaded on Mules; Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are made, and every one is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
what to do; all things being well
diſpoſed, they march out in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
about the evening, that by mid-night
they may arrive in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood
of the place which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be ſurprized. The Mules are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33517:74"/>
unloaded half a quarter of a league
from the Gate, and every one takes
hold of the Tools whereof they are
to make uſe. The Petardier makes
him that carries the <hi>Madrier</hi> march
firſt; afterward he calls three for the
Petard, two to carry it, and the third
to help, if need be. If the Petard be
faſtened to the <hi>Madrier,</hi> the four
eaſe one another two and two by
turns, and the two who carry not
the Petard, have each of them a Smiths
great Hammer: after them the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardier
commands two others to march,
carrying each of them a great Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et;
then another with a Goats-foot
(or Fearn) another with a dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,
another with three or four
Pieces of lighted Match; and another
with a Turrel or good Nails, and a
Club, ſo that every Petard to be rightly
ſerved, requires at leaſt ten men.</p>
                     <p>When a Petard is to be applied to
a Draw-bridge, the Petardier makes
the Flying-Bridge march firſt, or the
Arrow with ſeven or eight Men, as
well to carry as to puſh them. Next he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33517:75"/>
makes the <hi>Madrier</hi> and the <hi>Petard</hi>
advance in the ſame order as I have
ſaid before; after follow thoſe who
carry the Ladders, and the floor of
Planks, to be thrown upon the Breach
which the Petard may have made,
who are followed by thoſe who carry
the Hammers, Hatchets, Pinſers, and
other Inſtruments to pull out the
Barrs, and cut the Chains. There is
need rather of too many Inſtruments,
than that any one ſhould be wanting;
and when the Petardier asks any thing,
he that carries it ſhould be ready at
hand to give it without making the
leaſt noiſe.</p>
                     <p>All things being thus diſpoſed, the
Petardier covers himſelf with a round
Buckler, or ſome Planks made on
purpoſe to ſecure him from Musket-ſhot,
or Fire-works that may be thrown
upon him; he applies his Petard,
commands thoſe that are to fall on to
be in readineſs, ſets Fire to the Fuſe,
and with-draws whilſt the Petard is
playing; ſo ſoon as a Breach is made,
thoſe that are commanded for the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33517:75"/>
firſt bruſh, enter the place, and force
all that reſiſts them; they who are to
back them, do as much, and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively
do all who have any thing to
put in execution.</p>

the head was of a knotty Wood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Iron, and repreſented the
Head of a Ram with Horns, and
therefore the name of Battering Ram
was given to that Engine. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Ram hung betwixt great Beams
of Wood, by Maſſive Iron Chains,
and required a hundred men to ſwing
and puſh it violently againſt the Walls.

properly the Enſign General of the

the Church of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where it lay
in Cuſtody; but when the Kings

made of a Red Stuff, about two foot

                     <p>THe difference between the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and Penon was, that the
Banner was ſquare, faſtened to a Lance
like Colours and Cornets; and the
Penon had a long Tail, which might
be eaſily made a Banner, by cutting
off the Tail. From theſe Penons is
derived the name of <hi>Penonages,</hi> which
has been given to the Companies of
the Quarters of the City of <hi>Lyons,</hi>
whoſe Captains are called <hi>Captains
Penons.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> the Penon of St.
<hi>George</hi> was the chief Banner of the
Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Every Lord carried his Arms in
his Banner, or in his Penon; but
none but Lords Banerets, were
ſuffered to carry a Banner to the
Wars. When a Lord having for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

to entertain a Troop of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to accompany a Banner, he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33517:85"/>
was allowed to raiſe a Banner; for
that end he carried at the firſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
where he was, a Penon of his
Arms, and preſented himſelf before
the Conſtable, or him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Army for the Prince;
from whom he asked leave to carry
a Banner; and that being granted
him, he took the Heraulds at Arms
Witneſſes of it, who cut off the Tail
of his Penon, and made a Banner
thereof.</p>

                  <p>THE Romans had one kind of
Enſigns for foot, and another

its Enſign General, which was
the Roman Eagle, as we have a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels
Colours in every Regiment of
foot, which is always of White Taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feta;
beſides that the Manipules or
Companies had their particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
which were ſilvered Pikes, at
whoſe end was a little piece of Wood
laid a thwart, in form of a Croſs,
with little Globes faſtened down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Pikes, on which was the
Names of the Emperours, as <hi>Suetonius</hi>

                  <p>The Enſigns of the Cavalry were of
a ſhape different from thoſe of the
Infantry. The Romans named them
<hi>Vexilla,</hi> which to ſpeak properly
were little ſquare Sails, almoſt of the
bigneſs of our Standards, which were
carried hanging at a Pike, like to
the Banners of our Churches. Theſe
Sails were for moſt part of a Purple

                  <p>Kettle-Drums are two Brazen Veſſels,
round at the bottom, and covered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

to ſound by beating on it with Sticks.</p>
                  <p>Kettle-Drums were more in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Germans and Spaniards,
than among the French, who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
never carried any but when
they won them from their Enemies.
That Ancient formality is now out
of date, and the King beſtows them
on whom he thinks fit; eſpecially
on the Troops of his Houſhold.</p>
                  <p>Drums, Fifes, Bagpipes and Haut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bois,

are for Foot, Musketeers, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
Fuſiliers, and Horſe-grandai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Drums are made of a Cheſnut
Wood, hollow and covered at both
ends with Skins of Parchment, which
are braced with Cords, and with
Snares underneath. Theſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſerve to beat the Reveilly, the
General, the Call, the March, the
Charge, the Parley, the Retreat,
the Banks or Proclamations, and all
the Commands. The Invention of
them is not late; as may be ſeen in

Head-piece.</p>
                     <p>The Carabins had for Arms a Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs
voided and cut in the Right
Shoulder, that they might the better
preſent and take aim; a Gantlet
reaching the Elbow for the Bridle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
a Casket on Head: and for
Defenſive Arms, a long Sword, a long
Eſcopett or Carabin, three foot and

The Word (<hi>Carabin</hi>) comes from

Souldiers that fight, both on Foot

Name comes from the Greek Word
<hi>Dimas,</hi> that ſignifies terror and fear;
