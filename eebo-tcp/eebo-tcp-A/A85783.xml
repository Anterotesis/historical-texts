         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Olomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The deſire of a man is his kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and a poor man is better then a liar,</hi> Prov. 19.22. If you be of his minde, I dare promiſe theſe Notes, (which I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote to your ſervice) a kinde acceptance at your hands. You will finde me to be the <hi>poor man,</hi> by the mite I preſent you with; but the hearty deſire of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſſe from which it comes, will (I hope) clear me from being <hi>the liar.</hi> I never could be ſo ſerviceable to you, as many Miniſters are to their people, having been with you in much weakneſſe, and ſtill it is the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, I ſhould be ſtaked down to a ſhort tedder of ſtrength and other abilities; I have reaſon therefore, (that I may, though not recompence that want, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my deep ſenſe thereof) to croud the more love into the little I can do for you. And truly my heart is enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you, and to God for you. If any thing makes me loath to be gone into another world, (which my drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping houſe bids me above many prepare for) it is not the leaſt, to think I ſhall leave no more of you walking in the way to eternal life, and you who are on your way thither, in no cloſer Goſpel-order for your mutual help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in your journey: yea, while I am among you, little do
<pb facs="tcp:119001:4"/>
you think how much of your poor Miniſters life lies at your mercy. If I ſhould meaſure my life by the joy of it, (as indeed who doth not?) Then in ſome uprightneſſe I can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> I live as I ſee any of you ſtand faſt in the Lord, and die as I ſee others ſtand faſt in their ſins, not to be moved with all the entreaties of the Goſpel which have wooed you. And why (my dear friends) ſhould not the life of your ſoules be much more precious in your own ſight then mine? But I forbear, I would not willingly be thought, as ſome husbands are, to be kinder to you abroad before ſtrangers, then I am at home.</p>
            <p>What I preſent you with in this Treatiſe, is a diſh from your own table, and ſo (I hope) will go down the better. You cannot deſpiſe it (though the fare be mean) except you will blame your ſelves who choſe the Cook. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be earneſt with others, to beſtow ſo much time as to read over theſe plain Sermons, leſt it ſhould be to their loſſe; it were but to call them from gathering ſheaves in the more fruitful labours of others, to glean a few eares, and thoſe but thin alſo in mine; yet with you, my people, I may be a little bold. Phyſicians ſay, the mothers milk though not ſo weighty as anothers, if no noxious humour be taſted in it, becauſe natural, is more proper for the childe then a ſtrangers. And, I think, it would not be an errour, if I ſhould ſay it held in the milk which the Miniſter gives to his flock. A people conſcienciouſly lying at the breaſts of their own Miniſter, (if the milk he gives be whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome) may expect the bleſſing of God for their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it has not ſo much luſciouſneſſe to pleaſe the curious taſter as ſome others. Well, whatever theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were, ſome of thoſe few ſpirits which you found in hearing, will be miſſing in the reading of them. It is as eaſie to paint fire with the heat, as with pen and ink to
<pb facs="tcp:119001:4"/>
commit that to paper, which occurres in preaching. There is as much difference between a Sermon in the Pulpit, and printed in a book, as between milk in the warme breaſt, and in a ſucking bottle, yet what it loſeth in the lively taſte, is recompenced by the convenience of it. The book may be at hand when the Preacher cannot; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that's the chief end of printing, that as the bottle and ſpoon is uſed when the mother is ſick or out of the way; ſo the book, to quiet the Chriſtian and ſtay his ſtomack in the abſence of the Ordinance. He that readeth Sermons and good bookes at home to ſave his paines of going to hear, is a thief to his ſoul in a religious habit: he conſults for his eaſe, but not for his profit; he eats cold meat when he may have hot: He hazards the loſing the benefit of both by contemning of one. If the Spouſe could have had her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at home, ſhe needed not to have courſed the ſtreets and waited on the publick. O what need we offer ſacriledge for ſacrifice, rob God of one duty to pay him another? He hath laid our work in better order, one wheele would not interfere with another, if we did more regularly. A chief part of <hi>Davids</hi> Arithmetick of numbring our dayes, lies in that which we call diviſion, as to caſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this our ſhort life ſo, as to divide the little whole ſumme thereof into the ſeveral portions of time due for the performing of every duty in. An Inſtrument is not in tune, except it have all the ſtrings, and thoſe will not make good muſick, if the Muſician hath not wiſdome to cauſe every ſtring to ſpeak in its due time; The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is not in tune, except he takes in all the duties of his place and calling, neither will the performance of them be harmonious in Gods eare, if every one be not done in its proper ſeaſon. O my friends, labour not only to do the duty of your place, but that duty in its own place alſo.
<pb facs="tcp:119001:5"/>
Heare when you ſhould hear. Know your rime for cloſet, and time for ſhop: and when your retiring houre comes, a few minutes now and then ſpent in taking a repetition of what formerly you heard, ſhall not (I hope) another day be reckoned with your loſt time. The Subject of the Treatiſe is ſolemn, <hi>A War between the Saint and Satan,</hi> and that ſo bloody a one, that the cruelleſt which ever was fought by men, will be found but ſport and childes play to this. Alas, what is the killing of bodies to deſtroying of ſoules? 'Tis a ſad meditation indeed, to think how many thouſands have been ſent to the grave in a few late yeares among us by the ſword of man; But far more aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to conſider how many of thoſe may be ſent to hell by the ſword of Gods wrath. 'Tis a ſpiritual war you ſhall reade of, and that not a hiſtory of what was fought many ages paſt and is now over; but of what now is doing, the Tragedy is at preſent acting, and that not at the furtheſt end of the world, but what concernes thee and every one that reades it. The ſtage whereon this war is fought, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans own ſoul. Here is no Neuter in this war, the whole world is engaged in the quarrel, either for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, or for Satan againſt God. It was a great queſtion ſome yeares paſt, Who are you for? The not giving a good account to which hath coſt many a life. O my dear friends, think ſolemnly what anſwer you meane to give to God and conſcience, when they in a dying houre ſhall ask every one of you, Who art thou for? 'Tis an incomparable mercy, that you are yet where you may chooſe your ſide: It will not be ever ſo, may be not a day to an end. If once in another world, you muſt then ſtand to your colours, yet you may run from the Devils quarters, and be taken into Chriſts pay. The Drum beats in the Goſpel for Voluntiers. O, the Lord make you
<pb facs="tcp:119001:5"/>
willing in the day of his power. I know you all would be on the ſureſt ſide. O what can you be ſure of, while under the devils Enſigne, but damnation? The curſe of God cleavs to him and all that takes part with him O let not the little plunder &amp; ſpoil of ſinful pleaſures and pelf, bewitch you ſtill to follow his Camp. What is that ſouldier bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his booty he gets in a fight, who before he can get off with it, is himſelf ſlain upon the place? (ſo many have been ſerved in theſe wars, if reports be true.) 'Tis that thou muſt certainly look for. The piece is charg'd, and aime taken at thy breaſt, which will be thy eternal death if thou perſiſteſt. Gods threatenings will go off at laſt and then where art thou? where, but in hell, where thy wedge of gold and Babyloniſh garment, thy wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe will do thee little ſtead? O Neighbours, I am loath to leave you in the way where Gods bullets flie; but I muſt have a word for you, my Chriſtian friends, who have eſpouſed Chriſts quarrel, and are in the field againſt Satan. My heart is towards you, who have thus willingly offered your ſelves among the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his help againſt the mighty. He can deſtroy him without you, but he takes your love as kindly as if he could not. God hath ſent me (as <hi>Jeſſe</hi> did <hi>David</hi>) with this little preſent to you and the reſt of my Brethren that are in his Camp. May it be but to the ſtrengthening of your hearts and hands in fighting the Lords battels, and I ſhall bleſſe God that put it into my heart thus to viſit you. O hold on, dear friends, in your Chriſtian warfare, let none take the crown from you. <hi>Whet your courage at the throne of grace,</hi> from whence all your recruits of ſoule-ſtrength come. <hi>Send faith oft up the hill of the Promiſe,</hi> to ſee and bring you the certain newes of Chriſts coming to you, yea, for you, and aſſured victory with him. <hi>Reade the exploits,</hi> which Chriſts Worthies by faith have done,
<pb facs="tcp:119001:6"/>
and in their Conqueſts reade your own, for in them <hi>he ſpake with us,</hi> as the Prophet of <hi>Jacob. Be thankful</hi> for every victory you get, and let not the houling wilderneſſe, yet before you, put the ſong of your praiſes for temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons paſt out of tune, yet rejoyce with trembling, as thoſe who are ſtill in your enemies countrey, and muſt keep by the ſword what you get by the ſword: <hi>Be ſure you ſtand in cloſe order amongſt your ſelves</hi>; Theſe times give us too many ſad examples of ſuch, who firſt fell from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their Brethren, and then into the devourers hand; ſtraglers are ſoon ſnap't; you will finde you are ſafeſt in a body. <hi>Take heed of a private ſpirit</hi>; let not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your particular ſafety, but of the whole Army of Saints be in your eye and care, eſpecially that company in which you march, (Congregation I mean;) that ſouldier which can ſee an enemy in fight with his brethren, and not help them, he makes <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Watch over one another, not to play the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks on your brothers failings, and triumph when he halts, but to help him up if he falls, or if poſſible, to keep him from falling by a timely reſcue, as <hi>Abiſhai</hi> came to <hi>Davids</hi> ſuccour. <hi>Keep your rank and file.</hi> We ſee what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Satan hath got in theſe looſe times, ſince we have learnt to fight him out of order, and the private ſouldier, (Chriſtian I mean) hath taken the officers work out of his hands. <hi>Harden your ſelves againſt the ſcandals, which the cowardize and treachery of falſe brethren hath given you.</hi> He is the right ſouldier that is not diſcouraged by thoſe that run from, or that are ſlain in the battel; but ſtill preſſeth on to victory, though he goes to it over the backs of others that are killed upon the place.

Get but once your hearts mortified to the world, and care rolled upon God, for name, eſtate, and relations here, and then you are fit to march whereever Chriſt will lead you. The want of this hath made many run home to ſave their own private ſtake there, when they ſhould have been in the field for Chriſt. And now, my Chriſtian friends, march on, not in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of your Armour, but in the power of his might, who hath promiſed ſhortly to ſubdue Satan under your feet. I have done, only I muſt crave pardon of you, for rending this part of the Treatiſe from the other, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my little ſtrength or leiſure would ſuffer me to graſp at once.</p>
            <p>But this having firſt put forth its hand in preaching, can make no great breach upon that, though it get the ſtart a little in printing. Let me therefore, dear friends, (if God ſhall make this imperfect birth any way ſerviceable to your faith,) humbly deſire, that you would as continue to ſtrive at the throne of grace for a bleſſing on my poor Miniſtery among you, ſo alſo lift up a prayer, that ſtrength may be given, to bring forth what of this yet is undeliver'd. I do not ſend you thither where I intend not to meet you, but ſhall deſire grace to be found faithful in ſtriving with you, and for you, that amongſt thoſe who finde any ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from my weak labours, you to whom they are chiefly devoted may not receive the leaſt.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Aul</hi> was now in bonds, yet not ſo cloſe kept as to be denied pen and paper: God (it ſeemes) gave him ſome favour in the ſight of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Nero</hi>'s priſoner; <hi>Nero</hi> was much more Gods. And while God had work for <hi>Paul,</hi> he found him friends both in Court and priſon. Let perſecutors ſend the Saints to priſon, God can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Keeper for their turn.</p>
               <p>But how doth this great Apoſtle ſpend his time in priſon? not in publiſhing invectives againſt thoſe, (though the worſt of men) who had laid him in; a piece of zeal which the holy ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thoſe times were little acquainted with: Nor in politick counſels how he might winde himſelf out of his trouble, by ſordid flattery of, or ſinful compliance with the great ones of the times. Some would have uſed any pick-lock to have opened a paſſage
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119001:10"/>
to their liberty, and not ſcrupled, (ſo eſcape they might) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they got out at the door or window: But this holy man was not ſo fond of liberty or life, as to purchaſe them with the leaſt hazard to the Goſpel. He knew too much of another world, to bid ſo high for the enjoying of this, and therefore he is at a point what his enemies can do with him, well knowing he could go to heaven whether they would or no; No, the great care which lay upon him was for the Churches of Chriſt: as a faithful Steward he labours to ſet this Houſe of God in order before his departure. We reade of no diſpatches ſent to Court to procure his liberty, but many to the Churches to help them to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free. There is no ſuch way to be even with the devil and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for all their ſpite againſt us, as by doing what good we can, wherever we become. The devil had as good have let <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; for he no ſooner comes into priſon, but he falls a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which the gates of Satans priſon flie open, and poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners come forth. Happy for <hi>Oneſimus</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to Jaile; God had an errand for <hi>Paul</hi> to do to him and others, which the devil never dream't of. Nay, he doth not only preach in priſon, but that he may do the devil all the miſchief he can, he ſends his Epiſtles to the Churches; that taſting his Spirit in his afflictions, and reading his faith, now ready to be offered up, they might much more be confirmed, amongſt which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> was not leaſt in his thoughts, as you may perceive by his abode with them two yeares together, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.10. as alſo by his ſending for the Elders of this Church as far as <hi>Miletus,</hi> in his laſt journey to <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 20.17. to take his farewel of them, as never to ſee their face in this world more. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſad impreſſion which that heart-breaking departure left upon the ſpirits of theſe Elders, yea, the whole Church, (by them acquainted with this mournful newes,) might ſtir up <hi>Paul,</hi> now in priſon, to write unto this Church, that having ſo much of his Spirit, yea, of the Spirit of the Goſpel left in their hands to converſe with, they might more patiently take the newes of his death.</p>
               <p>In the former part of this Epiſtle, he ſoares high in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of faith. In the latter, according to his uſual method, he deſcends to Application; where we finde him contracting all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119001:10"/>
thoſe truths, as beams together in a powerful exhortation, the more to enkindle their hearts, and powerfully perſwade them to <hi>walk worthy of their vocation, chap.</hi> 4.1. which then is done, when the Chriſtians life is tranſparent, that the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhines forth in the power of holineſſe on every ſide, and from all his relations, as a candle in a Cryſtal glaſſe, not in a dark Lanthorn, lightſome one way, and dark another: and therefore he runs over the ſeveral relations of <hi>Husband, Wife, Parents, Children, Maſter</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> and preſſeth the ſame in all theſe.</p>
               <p>Now having ſet every one in his proper place, about his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duty: as a wiſe General after he hath ranged his Army, and drawn them forth into rank and file: he makes this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeech at the head of this <hi>Epheſian</hi> Camp, all in martial phraſe, as beſt ſuiting the Chriſtians calling, which is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued warfare with the world, and the Prince of the world. The ſpeech it ſelf contains two parts;</p>
               <p>Firſt, a ſhort, but ſweet and powerful encouragement, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the other part is ſpent in ſeveral directions, for their managing this war the more ſuccesfully, with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives here and there ſprinkled among them. To begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word of encouragement to battel. With this he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his ſpeech; <hi>Finally, my brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord</hi>: the beſt way indeed to prepare them for the following directions. A ſoul deeply poſſeſt with fear, and diſſpirited with ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of danger, is in no poſture for counſel. As we ſee in an Army when put to the run with ſome ſudden alarm, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of danger; 'tis hard rallying them into order while the ſcare and feare is over; therefore the Apoſtle firſt raiſeth up their ſpirits, <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord</hi>: as if he ſhould ſay, perhaps ſome drooping ſoules finde their hearts faile them, while they ſee their enemies ſo ſtrong, and they ſo weak; ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and they ſo few; ſo well appointed, and they ſo naked and unarmed; ſo skilful and expert at armes, but they green and raw ſouldiers; Let not theſe or any other thoughts diſmay you, but with undaunted courage march on, and <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord</hi>; on whoſe performance lies the ſtreſſe of the battel, and not on your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119001:11"/>
skill or ſtrength: It is not the leaſt of a Miniſters care, and skill in dividing the Word, ſo to preſſe the Chriſtians duty, as not to oppreſſe his Spirit with the weight of it, by laying it on the creatures own ſhoulders, and not on the Lords ſtrength, as here our Apoſtle teacheth us.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of Chriſtian Courage and Reſolution, wherefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and how obtained.</head>
                  <p>WE ſhall wave the Compellation, and begin with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: <hi>Be ſtrong,</hi> that is, be of good courage, ſo commonly uſed in Scripture-phraſe; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.7. <hi>Be ſtrong and couragious.</hi> So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.4. <hi>Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be ſtrong</hi>: or, unite all the powers of your ſouls, and muſter up your whole force, you will have uſe of all you can make or get. From whence the Point is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note>The Chriſtian of all men needs courage and reſolution. Indeed there is nothing he doth as a Chriſtian, or can do, but is an act of valour: A cowardly ſpirit is beneath the loweſt duty of a Chriſtian: <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Be thou strong and very couragious, that thou mayeſt</hi>: what? ſtand in battel againſt thoſe warlike Nations? No, <hi>But that thou mayest obſerve to do according to all the Law, which Moſes my ſervant commanded thee.</hi> It requires more prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe and greatneſſe of ſpirit to obey God faithfully, then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an Army of men, to be a Chriſtian then to be a Captain. What ſeems leſſe, then for a Chriſtian to pray? yet this cannot be performed aright, without a Princely Spirit; As <hi>Jacob</hi> is ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119001:11"/>
to behave himſelf like a <hi>Prince,</hi> when he did but pray: for which he came out of the field Gods Bannarite. Indeed if you call that prayer, which a carnal perſon performes, nothing more poor and daſtard-like. Such a one is as great a ſtranger to this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, as the craven ſouldier is to the exploits of a valiant Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The Chriſtian in prayer comes up cloſe to God, with an humble boldneſſe of faith, and takes hold of him, wreſtles with him, yea, will not let him go without a bleſſing, and all this in the face of his own ſins, and divine juſtice, which let flie upon him from the fiery mouth of the Law; while the others boldneſs in prayer is but the childe, either of ignorance in his minde, or hardneſſe in his heart; whereby not feeling his ſins, and not knowing his danger, he ruſhes upon duty with a blinde confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which ſoon quails, when conſcience awakes and gives him the alar<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, that his ſins are upon him, as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> on <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>; alas, then in a fright the poor-ſpirited wretch throwes down his weapon, flies the preſence of God with guilty <hi>Adam,</hi> and dares not look him on the face. Indeed there is no duty in a Chriſtians whole courſe of walking with God, or acting for God, but is lined with many difficulties, which ſhoot like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies through the hedges at the Chriſtian, whileſt he is march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward Heaven: ſo that he is put to diſpute every inch of ground as he goes. They are only a few noble-ſpirited ſoules, (who dare take Heaven by force) that are fit for this calling. For the further proof of this Point, ſee ſome few pieces of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that every Chriſtian engageth in.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Chriſtian is to proclaim and proſecute an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable war againſt his boſome-ſins; thoſe ſins which have layen neareſt his heart, muſt now be trampled under his feet: So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I have kept my ſelf from my iniquity</hi>; Now what courage and reſolution doth this require? you think <hi>Abraham</hi> was tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purpoſe, when called to take his <hi>ſon, his ſon Iſaac,</hi>

                     <hi>his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon whom he loved,</hi> and offer him up with his own hands, and no other, yet what was that to this? Soul, take thy luſt, thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſt, which is the childe of thy deareſt love, thy <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the ſin which hath cauſed moſt joy and laughter; from which thou haſt promiſed thy ſelf the greateſt return of pleaſure or profit: as ever thou lookeſt to ſee my face with comfort, lay hands on it, and offer it up: poure out the blood of it before me, run
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119001:12"/>
the ſacrificing knife of mortification into the very heart of it, and this freely, joyfully, (for it is no pleaſing ſacrifice that is offered with a countenance caſt down,) and all this now, before thou haſt one embrace more from it. Truly this is a hard chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fleſh and blood cannot bear this ſaying; our luſt will not lie ſo patiently on the Altar, as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or as a <hi>Lambe that is brought to the ſlaughter, which is dumb,</hi> but will roar and ſhreek, yea, even ſhake and rend the heart with their hideous out-cries. Who is able to expreſſe the conflicts, the wreſtlings, the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Spirit the Chriſtian feels, before he can bring his heart to this work? or who can fully ſet forth the Art, the Rhetorical inſinuations, which ſuch a luſt will plead with for its life? one while Satan will extenuate and mince the matter, It is but a little one, O ſpare it, and thy ſoule ſhall live for all that: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while he flatters the ſoul with the ſecrecy of it, Thou mayeſt keep me and thy credit alſo; I will not be ſeen abroad in thy company to ſhame thee among thy neighbours: ſhut me up in the moſt retired room thou haſt in thy heart, from the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others (if thou wilt,) only let me now and then have the wanton embraces of thy thoughts and affections in ſecret; if that cannot be granted, then Satan will ſeem only to deſire execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be ſtayed a while, as <hi>Jephtha</hi>'s daughter of her father; <hi>Let me alone a monthor two,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 17. v. 2, 37.</note> 
                     <hi>and then do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth</hi>: well knowing few ſuch reprieved luſts, but at laſt obtain their full pardon; yea, recover their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the ſoule. Now what reſolution doth it require to break through ſuch violence and importunity, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, to do preſent execution? Here the valiant Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the world, have ſhewed themſelves meer cowards, who have come out of the field with victorious banners, and then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yea, died ſlaves to a baſe luſt at home. As one could ſay of a great Romane Captain, (who as he rode in his triumphant Chariot through <hi>Rome,</hi> had his eye never off a Courtizan that walk't along the ſtreet) Behold, how this goodly Captain that conquered ſuch potent Armies, is himſelf conquered by one ſilly woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Chriſtian is to walk ſingularly, not after the worlds guiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. we are commanded not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to this world, that is, not to accommodate our ſelves to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119001:12"/>
the corrupt cuſtomes of the world. The Chriſtian muſt not be of ſuch a complying nature, to cut the coat of his Profeſſion according to the faſhion of the times, or the humour of the company he falls into, like that Courtier, who being ask't how he could keep his preferment in ſuch changing times, which one while had a Prince for Popery, another while againſt Popery? anſwered, he was <hi>Eſalice, non ex quercu ortus</hi>: he was not a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born oake, but bending oſier, that could yield to the winde: No, the Chriſtian muſt ſtand fixt to his principles, and not change his habit, but freely ſhew what Country-man he is by his holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the truth. Now, what an <hi>odium,</hi> what ſnares, what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers doth this ſingularity expoſe the Chriſtian to? Some will hoot and mock him, as one in a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion would be laugh't at in your ſtreets. Thus <hi>Michal</hi> flouted <hi>David.</hi> Indeed the world counts the Chriſtian for his ſingularity of life the only foole; which I have thought gave the firſt occaſion to that nick-name, whereby men commonly expreſſe a ſilly man or a fool: Such a one (ſay they) is a meer <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, in the worlds account a foole. But why an <hi>Abraham</hi>? becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> did that which carnal reaſon (the worlds idol) laughs at as meere folly; he left a preſent eſtate in his fathers houſe, to go he know not whither, to receive an inheritance he knew not when. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luch fooles all the Saints are branded for, by the wiſe world. <hi>You know the man and his communication,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jehu</hi> to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, asking what that mad fellow came for, who was no other then a Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.11. Now this requires courage to deſpiſe the ſhame, which the Chriſtian muſt expect to meete withal for his ſingularity. Shame is that which proud nature moſt diſdaines,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.13.</note> to avoid which many durſt not <hi>confeſſe Chriſt openly</hi>; many loſe heaven, becauſe they are aſhamed to go in a fooles coat thither. Again, as ſome will mock, ſo others will perſecute to death, meerly for this non-conformity in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians principles and practices to them. This was the trap laid for the three children; they muſt dance after <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> pipe, or burne. This was the plot laid to enſnare <hi>Daniel,</hi> who walk't ſo unblameably, that his very enemies gave him this teſtimony, that he had no fault, but his ſingularity in his Religion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.5. 'Tis a great honour to a Chriſtian, yea, to Religion it ſelfe, when all their enemies can ſay is, they are preciſe, and will not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119001:13"/>
do as we do. Now in ſuch a caſe as this, when the Chriſtian muſt turn or burne; leave praying, or become a prey to the cruel teeth of bloody men; how many politick retreats, and ſelf-preſerving diſtinctions would a cowardly unreſolved heart invent? The Chriſtian, that hath ſo great oppoſition had need be well lock't into the ſaddle of his Profeſſion, or elſe he will be ſoon diſmounted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Chriſtian muſt keep on his way to heaven in the midſt of all the ſcandals that are caſt upon the wayes of God, by the Apoſtaſie and foul falls of falſe Profeſſors. There were ever ſuch in the Church, who by their ſad miſcarriages in judgement and practice, have laid a ſtone of offence in the way of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at which weak Chriſtians are ready to make a ſtand, (as they at the bloody body of <hi>Aſahel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 2.22.</note>) not knowing whether they may venture any further in their Profeſſion. Seeing ſuch (whoſe gifts they ſo much admired) lie before them, wallowing in the blood of their ſlaine Profeſſion: of zealous Profeſſors to prove, perhaps, fiery perſecutors; of ſtrict Performers of religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, irreligious Atheiſts: no more like the men they were ſome yeares paſt, then the vale of <hi>Sodom,</hi> (now a bog and quagmire) is, to what it was, when for fruitfulneſſe compared to the garden of the Lord. We had need have a holy reſolution to bear up againſt ſuch diſcouragements, and not to faint: as <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who lived to ſee the whole Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (a very few excepted) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting, and in their hearts turning back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet with an undaunted Spirit maintained his integrity, yea, reſolved though not a man beſide would beare him company, yet he would ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Chriſtian muſt truſt in a withdrawing God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Let him that walks in darkneſſe, and ſees no light, truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> This requires a holy boldneſſe of faith indeed to venture into Gods preſence, as <hi>Eſther</hi> into <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> when no ſmile is to be ſeen on his face, no golden ſcepter of the promiſe perceived by the ſoule, as held forth to embolden it to come near, then to preſſe in with this noble reſolution; <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi> Nay more, to truſt not only in a withdrawing but a <hi>killing God</hi>;<note place="margin">Job 13.15.</note> not when his love is hid, but when his wrath breakes forth: Now for a ſoule to make its approaches to God by a recumbency of faith, while God ſeemes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119001:13"/>
to fire upon it, and ſhoot his frownes like envenomed arrowes into it. This is hard work, and will trie the Chriſtians mettal to purpoſe. Yet ſuch a maſculine ſpirit we finde in that poore woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who takes up the bullets Chriſt ſhot at her, and with an humble boldneſſe of faith ſends them back again in her prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, the believer is to perſevere in his Chriſtian courſe to the end of his life, his work and his life muſt go off the ſtage together. This addes weight to every other difficulty of the Chriſtians calling: We have known many who have gone into the field, and liked the work of a ſouldier for a battel or two, but ſoon have had enough, and come running home again, but few can bear it as a conſtant trade. Many are ſoon engaged in holy duties, eaſily perſwaded to take up a Profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as eaſily perſwaded to lay it down; like the new Moon, which ſhines a little in the firſt part of the night, but is down before half the night be gone; the lightſome Profeſſors in their youth, whoſe old age is wrapt up in thick darkneſſe of ſin and wickedneſſe; O this perſevering is a hard word! this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the croſſe daily, this praying alwayes, this watching night and day, and never laying aſide our clothes and armour, I mean indulging our ſelves to remit and unbend in our holy wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God, and walking with God; this ſends many ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful away from Chriſt, yet this is the Saints duty, to make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion his every day work, without any vacation from one end of the yeare to the other. Theſe few inſtances are enough to ſhew what need the Chriſtian hath of reſolution. The application followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> This gives us then a reaſon why there are ſo many Profeſſors, and ſo few Chriſtians indeed; ſo many that run, and ſo few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; ſo many go into the field againſt Satan, and ſo few come out Conquerours; becauſe all have a deſire to be happy, but few have courage and reſolution to grapple with the difficulties, that meet them in the way to their happineſſe. All <hi>Iſrael</hi> came joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out of <hi>Egypt</hi> under <hi>Moſes</hi> his conduct, yea, and a <hi>mixed multitude</hi> with them, but when their bellies were a little pinched with hunger, and their greedy deſires of a preſent <hi>Canaan</hi> defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea, inſtead of peace and plenty, war and penury, they (like white-liver'd ſouldiers) are ready to flie from their colours,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119001:14"/>
and make a diſhonourable retreat into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thus the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of thoſe who profeſſe the Goſpel, when they come to puſh of pike, to be tried what they will do, deny, endure for Chriſt, grow ſick of their enterpriſe: alas, their hearts fail them, they are like the waters of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; but if they muſt diſpute their paſſage with ſo many enemies, they will even content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their own Ciſtern, and leave heaven to others that will venture more for it. O how many part with Chriſt at this croſſe-way! like <hi>Orpah</hi> they go a furlong or two with Chriſt, while he goes to take them off from their worldly hopes, and bids them prepare for hardſhip, and then they fairly kiſſe and leave him, loath indeed to loſe heaven, but more loth to buy it at ſo dear a rate. Like ſome green heads, that childiſhly make choice of ſome ſweet trade (ſuch as is the Confectioners) from a liquoriſh tooth they have to the junkets it affords, but meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſoure ſauce of labour and toile that goes with them, they give in, and are weary of their ſervice; the ſweet bait of Religion hath drawn many to nibble at it, who are offended with the hard ſervice it calls to; It requires another ſpirit then the world can give or receive to follow Chriſt fully.</p>

their wings; if their feathers be clipt, their power broken, he is loſt; but in the Army of Saints, the ſtrength of every Saint, yea, of the whole hoſte of Saints lies in the Lord of hoſtes. God can overcome his enemies without their hands, but they cannot ſo much as defend themſelves without his arme. It is one of Gods names, <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.19. He was the ſtrength of <hi>Davids</hi> heart, without him this valiant Worthy (that could, when held up in his armes, defie him that defied an whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) behaves himſelf ſtrangely for feare, at a word or two that drop't from the Philiſtines mouth. He was the ſtrength of his hands, <hi>He taught his fingers to fight,</hi> and ſo he is the ſtrength of all his Saints in their war againſt ſin and Satan. Some propound a queſtion, whether there be a ſin committed in the world, in which Satan hath not a part? but if the queſtion were, whether there be any holy action performed without the ſpecial aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God concurring? that is reſolved, <hi>John.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Without me you can do nothing.</hi> Thinking ſtrength of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> We Apoſtles, we Saints that have habitual grace, yet this lies like water at the bottome of a Well, which will not aſcend with all our pumping, till God poure in his exciting grace, and then it comes. To will is more then to think, to exert our will into action, more then both; theſe are of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you to will, and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> He makes the heart new, and having made it fit for heavenly motion, ſetting every wheele (as it were) in its right place, then he windes it up by his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating grace, and ſets it on going, the thoughts to ſtir, the will to move, and make towards the holy object preſented; yet here the chariot is ſet, and cannot aſcend the hill of action, till God puts his ſhoulder to the wheele, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to performe that which is good I finde not.</hi> God is at the bottome of the ladder, and at the top alſo, the Author and Finiſher, yea, helping and lifting the ſoule at every round, in his aſcent to any holy action. Well, now the Chriſtian is ſet on work, how long will he keep cloſe to it? Alas, poor ſoul, no longer then he is held up by the ſame hand, that impowered him at firſt. He hath ſoon wrought out the ſtrength received, and therefore to maintain the tenure of a holy courſe. there muſt be

renewing ſtrength from heaven every moment, which <hi>David</hi> knew, and therefore when his heart was in as holy a frame as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he felt it, and his people by their free-will-offering declared the ſame: yet even then he prayes, that God would <hi>keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of his people, and eſtabliſh their hearts to him,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. He adored the mercy that made them willing, and then he implores his further grace to ſtrengthen them, and tie a knot, that theſe precious pearles newly ſtrung on their hearts, might not ſlip off.

Well, now he hath words put into his mouth; alas, they will freeze in his very lips, if he hath not ſome heart-heating af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to thaw the tap: and where ſhall this fire be had? not a ſpark to be found on his own hearth; except it be ſome ſtrange fire of natural deſires, which will not ſerve: whence then muſt the fire come to thaw the iceneſſe of the heart, but from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? The Spirit, he muſt ſtretch himſelf upon the ſoul, (as the Prophet on the childe) and then the ſoule will come to ſome kindly warmth, and heavenly heat in his affections; the Spirit muſt groane, and then the ſoul will groane, he helps us to theſe ſighs and groans, which turne the ſailes of prayer. He diſſolves the heart, and then it burſts out of the heart by groans, of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119001:17"/>
lips by heavenly Rhethorick, out of the eyes as from a flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate with teares: yet further now the creature is enabled to wreſtle with God in prayer; what will he get by all this? ſuppoſe he be weak in grace, is he able to pray himſelf ſtrong, or corruption weak? no, this is not to be found in prayer, as an act of the creature: this drops from heaven alſo. <hi>In the day that I cried,</hi>

                     <hi>thou anſweredſt me, and gaveſt me strength in my ſoul. David</hi> received it in duty, but had it not from his duty, but from his God. He did not pray himſelf ſtrong, but God ſtrengthened him in his prayer.

'tis as impoſſible that the creature ſhould be, or act without ſtrength from God: This, to be, act in and of himſelf, is ſo incommunicable a property of the Deity, that he cannot impart it to his creature: <hi>God is, and there is none beſides him</hi>: when God made the world, it is ſaid indeed he ended his work, that is, of Creation: he made no new <hi>ſpecies</hi> and kindes of creatures more; but to this day he hath not ended his work of Providence; <hi>Hitherto my Father worketh,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John.</hi> 5.17. that is, in preſerving and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering what he hath made with ſtrength to be and act, and therefore he is ſaid to <hi>hold our ſouls in life.</hi> Works of Art, which man makes, when finiſh't may ſtand ſome time without the Workmans help, as the houſe, when the Carpenter that made it is dead; but Gods works both of nature and grace are never off his hand, and therefore as the Father is ſaid to work hitherto for the preſervation of the works of nature, ſo the Son, to whom is committed the work of Redemption, he tells us <hi>he worketh</hi> alſo.

God brings his grace into the heart by Conqueſt: now as in a conquered City, though ſome yield and become true ſubjects to the Conquerour; yet others plot how they may ſhake off this yoke; and therefore it requires the ſame power to keep, as was to win it at firſt.

Thus God doth with his Saints, the great God comes and looks into their Cupboard, and ſees how they are laid in, and ſends in accordingly, as he findes them. <hi>Your heavenly Father knowes you have need of theſe things,</hi> and you ſhall have them. He knows you need ſtrength to pray, hear, ſuffer for him, and in <hi>ipſâ horâ dabitur.</hi>

Were the ſtock in  our own hands, we ſhould ſoon prove broken Merchants. God knows we are but leaking veſſels, when fulleſt, we could not hold it long; and therefore to make all ſure, he ſets us under the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119001:19"/>
ſtreamings forth of his ſtrength, and a leaking veſſel under a cock gets what it loſeth. Thus we have our leakage ſupplied continually. This was the proviſion God made for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in. the wilderneſſe; <hi>He clave the rock, and the rock followed them.</hi> They had not only a draught at preſent, but it ran in a ſtreame after them; ſo that you hear no more of their complaints for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>This rock was Chriſt.</hi> Every believer hath Chriſt at his back, following him with ſtrength as he goes, for every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and trial. One flower with the root is worth many in a poſie, which though ſweet yet do not grow, but wither as we wear them in our boſomes. Gods ſtrength, as the root keeps our grace lively, without which though as orient as <hi>Adams</hi> was, it would die.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond deſign God hath in his Saints happineſſe is, that he may ſo expreſſe his mercy and love to them, as may rebound back to him in the higheſt advance of his own glory therein, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 12. which is fully attained in this way of empowering Saints, by a ſtrength not of their own, but of their God his ſending, as they are put to expence. Had God given his Saints a ſtock of grace to have ſet up with, and left them to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, he had been <hi>magnified</hi> indeed, becauſe it was more then God did owe the creature, but he had not been <hi>omnified</hi> as now, when not only the Chriſtians firſt ſtrength to cloſe with Chriſt is from God, but he is beholden ſtill to God for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that ſtrength, in every action of his Chriſtian courſe. As a childe that travels in his fathers company, all is paid for, but his father carries the purſe, not himſelf: ſo the Chriſtians ſhot is diſcharged in every condition; but he cannot ſay this I did, or that I ſuffered, but God wrought all in me and for me. The very combe of pride is cut here, no room for any ſelf exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts. The Chriſtian cannot ſay, that I am a Saint is mercy, but being a Saint that my faith is ſtrong, this is the childe of my own care and watchfulneſſe. Alas, poor Chriſtian! who kept thine eye waking, and ſtirr'd up thy care? was not this the off-ſpring of God as well as thy faith at firſt? No Saint ſhall ſay of Heaven when he comes there, This is Heaven which I have built by the power of my might. No, <hi>Jeruſalem above is a City, whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> Every grace, yea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace is a ſtone in that building, the topſtone whereof is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119001:19"/>
laid in glory, where Saints ſhall more plainly ſee, how God was not only Founder to begin, but Benefactour alſo to finiſh the ſame. The glory of the work ſhall not be crumbled, and piece-meal'd out, ſome to God, and ſome to the creature, but all entirely paid in to God, and he acknowledged all in all.</p>

                  <p>THe third Branch followeth, which contains an encouraging Amplification annexed to the exhortation in theſe words; <hi>And in the Power of his might,</hi> where a twofold enquiry is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the explication of the phraſe. Firſt, what theſe words import, <hi>The Power of his might?</hi> Secondly, what it is to <hi>be ſtrong in the Power of his might</hi>?</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, the Power of his might: It is an Hebraiſm, &amp; imports nothing but his mighty Power; like that phraſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>To the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> that is, to the praiſe of his glorious grace. And his mighty Power imports no leſſe then his Almighty Power; ſometimes the Lord is ſtiled <hi>mighty and strong,</hi> as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 24.8. ſometimes <hi>moſt mighty,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Almighty,</hi> no leſſe is meant in all, then Gods infinite Almighty Power.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, to be ſtrong in the mighty Power, or Power of the Lords might, implies theſe two acts of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a ſetled firme perſwaſion, that the Lord is Almighty in  Power. <hi>Be strong in the Power of his might,</hi> that is, be ſtrongly rooted in your faith, concerning this one foundation-truth, that God is Almighty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it implies a further act of faith, not only to believe, that God is Almighty, but alſo that this Almighty Power of God is engaged for its defence: ſo as to bear up in the midſt of all trials and temptations undauntedly, leaning on the arme of God Almighty, as if it were his own ſtrength; for that is the Apoſtles drift, as to beat us off from leaning on our own ſtrength, ſo to encourage the Chriſtian to make uſe of Gods Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, as freely as if it were his own; when ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by Satan in any kinde. As a man ſet upon by a thief, ſtirs up all the force and ſtrength he hath in his whole body to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119001:21"/>
defend himſelf and offend his adverſary; ſo the Apoſtle bids the Chriſtian <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his might,</hi> that is, Soul, away to thy God, whoſe mighty Power is all intended and devoted by God himſelf for thy ſuccour and defence. Go ſtrengthen and entrench thy ſelfe in it by a ſtedfaſt faith, as that which ſhall be laid out to the utmoſt for thy good. From whence theſe two Notes, I conceive, will draw out the fatneſſe of the words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it ſhould be the Chriſtians great care and endeavour in all temptations and trials, to ſtrengthen his faith on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Chriſtians duty and care is not only to believe that God is Almighty, but ſtrongly by faith to reſt on this Almighty Power of God, as engaged for his help and ſuccour in all his trials and temptations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note>Firſt, it ſhould be the Chriſtians great care in all temptations and trials, to ſtrengthen his faith on the Almighty Power of God. When God holds forth himſelfe as an object of the ſouls truſt and confidence in any great ſtrait or undertaking; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly this attribute of his Almighty power is preſented in the promiſe, as the ſureſt hold faſt for faith to lay hold on; as a Father in rugged way, gives his childe his <hi>arme</hi> to lay hold by, ſo doth God uſually reach forth his Almighty power for his Saints, to exerciſe their faith on. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> whoſe faith God tried above moſt of his Saints before or ſince, for not one of thoſe great things which were promiſed to them, did they live to ſee performed in their dayes; and how doth God make known himſelf to them for their ſupport, but by diſplaying this Attribute? <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. <hi>I appeared unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac and Jacob by the Name of God Almighty.</hi> This was all they had to keep houſe with all their dayes: with which they lived comfortably, and died triumphantly, bequeathing the promiſe to their children, not doubting (becauſe God Almighty had promiſed) of the performance. Thus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. where great mercies are promiſed to <hi>Judah,</hi> and a Song penn'd before-hand to be ſung on that gaudie day of their ſalvation: yet becauſe there was a ſharp Winter of Captivity to come between the Promiſe, and the Spring-time of the promiſe; therefore to keep their faith alive in this ſpace, the Prophet calls them up to act

their faith on God Almighty, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi> So when his Saints are going into the furnace of perſecution, what now doth he direct their faith to carry to priſon, to ſtake with them but this Almighty power? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Let them that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, commit the keeping of their ſouls to him, as to a faithful Creatour</hi> Creatour is a name of Almighty Power, we ſhall now give ſome. Reaſons of the Point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> Firſt, becauſe it is no eaſie work to make uſe of this truth, (how plain and clear ſoever it now appears,) in great plunges of temptation, that God is Almighty; To vindicate this Name of God from thoſe evil reports, which Satan and carnal Reaſon raiſe againſt it, requires a ſtrong faith indeed. I confeſſe this principle is a piece of natural divinity; That light which finds out a Deity, will evince (if followed cloſe) this God to be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; yet in a carnal heart, it is like a ruſty ſword, hardly drawn out of the ſcabbard, and ſo of little or no uſe. Such truths are ſo impriſoned in natural conſcience, that they ſeldome get a faire hearing in the ſinners boſome, till God gives them a Goal-delivery, and brings them out of their houſe of bondage, where they are ſhut up in unrighteouſneſſe with a high hand of his convincing Spirit. Then and not till then the ſoule will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God is holy, merciful, Almighty; nay, ſome of Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, and not the meaneſt for grace amongſt them, have had their faith for a time ſet in this ſlough, much ado to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe difficulties and improbabilities, which ſenſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have objected, ſo as to relie on the Almighty Power of God, with a notwithſtanding. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, a ſtarre of the firſt magnitude for grace, yet ſee how his faith blinks and twinkles, till he wades out of the temptation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21. <hi>The people among whom I am are ſix hundred thouſand, and thou haſt ſaid, I will give them fleſh that they may eat a whole moneth, ſhall the flocks and the herds be ſlain for them to ſuffice them?</hi> This holy man had loſt the ſight for a time of the Almighty Power of God, and now he is projecting how this ſhould be done; as if he had ſaid in plain termes, How can this be accompliſhed? for ſo God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets his reaſoning, <hi>v.</hi> 23, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Is the Lords hand waxed ſhort?</hi> So <hi>Mary, John</hi> 11.32. <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</hi> And her Siſter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119001:22"/>
                     <hi>Martha,</hi> v. 39. <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh.</hi> Both gracious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet both betrayed the weakneſſe of their faith on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of Chriſt, one limiting him to place; <hi>If thou hadſt been here he had not died</hi>; as if Chriſt could not have ſaved his life abſent as well as preſent, ſent his health to him as well as brought it with him. The other to time, <hi>Now he ſtinketh.</hi> As if Chriſt had brought his Phyſick too late, and the grave would not deliver up its priſoner at Chriſts command; and haſt thou ſuch an high opinion of thy ſelf, Chriſtian, that thy faith needs not thy utmoſt care and endeavour for further eſtabliſhment on the Almighty Power of God, when thou ſeeſt ſuch as theſe daſh their foot againſt this kinde of temptation?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon may be taken from the abſolute neceſſity of this act of faith above others, to ſupport the Chriſtian in the houre of temptation. All the Chriſtians ſtrength and comfort is fetched without doors, and he hath none to ſend of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand but faith; This goes to heaven and knocks God up, as he in the parable, his neighbour at midnight for bread: Therefore when faith failes, and the ſoul hath none to go to market for ſupplies, there muſt needs be a poor houſe kept in the meane time. Now faith is never quite laid up, till the ſoul denies, or at leaſt queſtions the Power of God. Indeed, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſputes the Will of God, whiſpering within its own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, will he pardon? will he ſave? this may make faith go haltingly to the throne of grace, but not knock the ſoule off from ſeeking the face of God: even then faith on the Power of God, will bear it company thither: <hi>If thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 8.2.</note> if thou wilt, thou canſt pardon, thou canſt purge: But when the ſoul concludes he cannot pardon, cannot ſave, this ſhoots faith to the heart, ſo that the ſoule falls at the foot of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, not able more to reſiſt. Now it growes liſtleſſe to duty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether it pray or not, as one that ſees the Well dry, breaks or throwes away his Pitcher.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly, becauſe God is very tender of this flower of his Crown, this part of his Name: Indeed we cannot ſpell it right and leave out this letter; for that is Gods Name, whereby he is known from all his creatures. Now man may be called wiſe, merciful, mighty: God only all-wiſe, all-merciful, Almighty; ſo that when we leave out this ſyllable All, we nick-name God,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119001:22"/>
and call him by his creatures name, which he will not anſwer to. Now the tenderneſſe that God ſhews to this Prerogative of his, appears in three particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in the ſtrict command he layes on his people, to give  him the glory of his power, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 12, 13. <hi>Feare ye not their feare, but ſanctifie the Lord of hoſtes himſelf</hi>: that is, in this ſad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of your affaires, when your enemies aſſociate, and you ſeem a loſt people to the eye of Reaſon, not able to conteſt with ſuch united Powers, which beſet you on every ſide: Now I charge you ſanctifie me in giving me the glory of my Almighty Power; believe that your God is able of himſelf, without any other, to defend you, and deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in his ſeverity to his deareſt children, when they  ſtagger in their faith, and come not off roundly (without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and diſputing the caſe) to relie on his Almighty Power: <hi>Zacharias</hi> did but ask the Angel, <hi>How ſhall I know this, becauſe I am an old man, and my wife ſtricken in yeares</hi>; yet for bewraying therein his unbelief, had a ſigne indeed given him, but ſuch a one as did not only ſtrengthen his faith, but ſeverely puniſh his unbelief, for he was ſtruck dumb upon the place. God loves his children ſhould believe his Word, not diſpute his power; ſo true is that of <hi>Luther, Deus amat curriſtas nonquaeristas.</hi> That which gave accent to <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. was that he was <hi>fully perſwaded, that what God had promiſed, he was able to performe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in the way God takes of giving his choiceſt mercies, and greateſt ſalvations to his people, wherein he layes the ſcene of his Providence ſo, that when he hath done, it may be ſaid Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power was here. And therefore God commonly puts down thoſe means and ſecond cauſes, which if they ſtood about his work, would blinde and hinder the full proſpect thereof in effecting the ſame, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>We received the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we might not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead.</hi> Chriſt ſtayed while <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, that he might draw the eyes of their faith more ſingly to look on his power, by raiſing his dead friend, rather then curing him being ſick, which would not have carried ſo full a conviction of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe with it. Yea, he ſuffers a contrary power many times to ariſe in that very juncture of time, when he intends the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119001:23"/>
mercy to his people, that he may reare up the more magnificent pillar of remembrance to his own power, in the ruine of that which conteſts with him. Had God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> in the time of thoſe Kings which knew <hi>Joſeph,</hi> moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they might have had a friendly departure and an eaſie deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but God reſerves this for the reigne of that proud <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> who ſhall cruelly oppreſſe them, and venture his Kingdom, but he <hi>will ſatisfie his luſt upon them.</hi> And why muſt this be the time? but that God would bring them forth with a ſtretched-out arme: The magnifying of his power was Gods great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. <hi>In very deed for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, to ſhew in thee my power, and that my Name may be declared throughout the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, in the prevalency which an argument that is preſſed from his Almighty Power hath with God. It was the laſt ſtring <hi>Moſes</hi> had to his bowe, when he begg'd the life of <hi>Iſrael, Numb,</hi> 14.16. <hi>The Nations which have heard the fame of thee will ſpeak, ſaying, Becauſe the Lord was not able, &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Let the Power of my Lord be great</hi>; And with this he hath their pardon thrown him,</p>

                     <p>Firſt, I ſhall prove that the Almighty Power of God is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the Chriſtians defence, with the grounds of it. Secondly, why the Chriſtian ſhould ſtrongly act his faith on this.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Almighty Power of God is engaged for the Saints  defence; God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with an high hand, but did he ſet them down on the other ſide the Red-ſea, to finde and force their way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> by their own policie or power? When he had opened the iron gate of their houſe of bondage, and brought them into the open fields, did he vaniſh as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from <hi>Peter,</hi> when out of priſon? No, as a man carries his ſon, ſo the Lord bare them in all the way they went, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.31. This doth lively ſet forth the Saints march to heaven: God brings a ſoule out of ſpiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> by his converting grace, that is the <hi>day of his power,</hi> wherein he makes the ſoule willing to come out of Satans clutches. Now when the Saint is upon his march, all the countrey riſeth upon him. How ſhall this poore creature paſſe the pikes, and get ſafely by all his enemies bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? God himſelf infolds him in the arme of his everlaſting ſtrength. <hi>We are kept by the Power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. The Power of God is that <hi>ſhoulder,</hi> on which Chriſt carries his <hi>ſheep</hi> home, rejoycing all the way he goes, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.5. Theſe everlaſting armes of his ſtrength are thoſe <hi>Eagles wings,</hi> upon which the Saints are both tenderly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely conveyed to glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4. There is a five fold tie or engagement that lies upon Gods power, to be the Saints life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the near relation he hath to his Saints, they are his own dear children, every one takes care of his own, the ſilly Hen, how doth ſhe buſſle and beſtir her ſelf to gather her brood under her wing when the Kite appears? No care like that which Nature teacheth. How much more will God, who is the Father of ſuch diſpoſitions in his creature, ſtir up his whole ſtrength to defend his children? <hi>He ſaid, They are my people, ſo be became their Saviour,</hi> Iſa. 33.8. As if God had ſaid, Shall I ſit ſtill with my hand in my boſome, while my own people are thus miſuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119001:24"/>
my face: I cannot beare it. The Mother as ſhe ſits in her houſe heares one ſhreek, and knowes the voice, cries out, O 'tis my childe, away ſhe throws all, and runs to him. Thus God takes the alarm of his childrens cry; <hi>I heard Ephraim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Lord, his cry pierced his eare, and his eare affected his bowels, and his bowels call'd up his power to the reſcue of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the dear love he beareth to his Saints engageth his power. He that hath Gods heart, cannot want his arme. Love in the creature commands all the other affections, ſets all the powers of the whole man on work; thus in God, love ſets all his other attributes on work, when God once pitch't his thoughts of doing good to loſt man, then wiſdom fell on projecting the way, Almighty power that undertook to raiſe the fabrick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to wiſdomes modell. All are ready to effect what God ſaith he likes. Now the believing ſoule is an object of Gods choiceſt love, even the ſame, with which he loves his Son, <hi>John</hi> 17.26.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, God loves the believer as the birth of his everlaſting counſel, when a ſoul believes, then Gods eternal purpoſe and counſel concerning him, (whom he choſe in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, and with whom his thoughts went ſo long big) brings forth. And how muſt God needs love that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom he carried ſo long in the wombe of his eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? This goodly Fabrick of heaven and earth had not been built, but as a ſtage whereon he would in time act what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in heaven of old, concerning the ſaving of thee, and a few more his Elect; and therefore according to the ſame rate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, with which God pleaſed and entertained himſelf in the thoughts of this before the world was, muſt he needs rejoyce over the ſoule now believing, with love and complacency uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; and God having brought his counſel thus far towards its iſſue, ſurely will raiſe all the power he hath, rather then be diſappointed of his glory, within a few ſteps of home; I mean, his whole deſign in the believers ſalvation; The Lord who hath choſen his Saints,<note place="margin">Zech. 3.</note> (as Chriſt prayes for <hi>Joſhua</hi> their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will rebuke Satan and all their enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God loves his Saints as the purchaſe of his Sons blood; they coſt him dear, and that which is ſo hardly got, ſhall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119001:24"/>
not be eaſily loſt. He that was willing to expend his Sons blood to gain them, will not deny his power to keep them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God loves the Saints for their likeneſſe to himſelfe, ſo that if he loves himſelf, he cannot but love himſelf appearing in them; and as he loves himſelf in them, ſo he defends himſelf in defending them. What is it in a Saint that enrageth hell, but the image of God, without which the war would ſoon be at an end? It is the hatred the Panther hath to man that makes him flie at his picture; <hi>For thy ſake we are ſlain all the day long</hi>: and if the quarrel be Gods, ſurely the Saint ſhall not go forth to war at his own coſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Covenant engageth Gods Almighty power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me.</hi> There is a League offenſive and defenſive between God and his Saints, he gives it under his hand, that he will put forth the whole power of his Godhead for them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.24. <hi>The Lord of Hoſtes is the God of Iſrael, even a God to Iſrael.</hi> God doth not parcel himſelf out by retaile; but gives his Saints leave to challenge whatever a God hath as theirs, and let him whoever he is, ſit in Gods throne, and take away his crown, that can faſten any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth on the Holy One; as his Name is, ſo is his Nature, a God keeping Covenant for ever. The Promiſes ſtand as the mountains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> never to be removed; the weak as wel as the ſtrong Chriſtian is within this line of Communication. Were Saints to fight it out in open field by the ſtrength of their own grace, then the ſtrong were more likely to ſtand, and the weak to fall in battel, but both caſtled in the Covenant are alike ſafe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the Saints dependance on God, and expectation  from God in all their ſtraits, oblige his power for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; whither doth a gracious ſoule flie in any want or danger from ſin, Satan, or his inſtruments, but to his God? as naturally as the Coney to her burrough; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.3. <hi>At what time I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I will truſt in thee!</hi> He tells God he will make bold of his houſe to ſtep into, when taken in any ſtorme; and doth not queſtion his welcome. Thus when <hi>Saul</hi> hunted him, he left a city of gates and barres to truſt God in open field. Indeed all the Saints are taught the ſame leſſon, to renounce their own ſtrength, and relie on the Power of God, their own
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119001:25"/>
policie, &amp; caſt themſelves on the wiſdom of God; their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; and expect all from the pure mercy of God in Chriſt which act of faith is ſo pleaſing to God, that ſuch a ſoul ſhall never be aſhamed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.18. <hi>The expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh.</hi> A Heathen could ſay, when a bird (ſcared by a Hawke) flew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſome, I will not betray thee unto thy enemy, ſeeing thou comeſt for Sanctuary unto me. How much leſſe will God yield up a ſoule unto its enemy, when it takes Sanctuary in his Name, ſaying, Lord, I am hunted with ſuch a temptation, dogg'd with ſuch a luſt, either thou muſt pardon it, or I am damned; mortifie it, or I ſhall be a ſlave to it; take me into the boſome of thy love for Chriſts ſake; caſtle me in the armes of thy everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength; it is in thy power to ſave me from, or give me up into the hands of my enemie: I have no confidence in my ſelf or any other: Into thy hands I commit my cauſe, my life, and relie on thee; This dependance of a ſoul undoubtedly will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Almighty Power of God, for ſuch a ones defence: he hath ſworn the greateſt oath that can come out of his bleſſed lips, even by himſelf, that ſuch as thus flie <hi>for refuge</hi> to <hi>hope</hi> in him ſhall have <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6.17. This indeed may give the Saint the greater boldneſſe of faith to expect kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, when he repairs to God for refuge, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come before he is look't for, God having ſet up his Name and Promiſes as a ſtrong Tower, both calls his people into theſe Chambers, and expects they ſhould betake themſelves thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Chriſts preſence and employment in heaven layes a ſtrong engagement on God to bring his whole force and power into the field upon all occaſions for his Saints defence; one ſpecial end of his journey to heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and abode there is, that he might (as the Saints Solicitour) be ever interceding for ſuch ſupplies and ſuccours of his Father, as their exigencies call for; and the more to aſſure us of the ſame before he went, he did (as it were) tell us, what heads he meant to go upon in his interceſſion, when he ſhould come there; one of which was this, that his Father ſhould keep his children while they were to ſtay in the world, from the evil thereof, <hi>John</hi> 17.15. Neither doth Chriſt take upon him this work of his own head, but hath the ſame appointment of his Father, for what he now prayes in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119001:25"/>
heaven, as he had for what he ſuffered on earth: He that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him a Prieſt to die for ſinners, did not then ſtrip him of his Prieſtly garments (as <hi>Aaron,</hi>) but appoints him to aſcend in them to heaven, where he ſits a Prieſt for ever by Gods Oath. And this office of interceſſion, was erected purely in mercy to believers, that they might have full content given them for the performance of all that God had promiſed; ſo that Jeſus Chriſt lies Lieger at Court as our Embaſſadour, to ſee all carried fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between God and us according to agreement: And if Chriſt follows his buſineſſe cloſe, and be faithful in his place to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, all is well; and doth it not behove him to be ſo, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for ſuch dear relations? Suppoſe a Kings Son ſhould get out of a beſieged City, where he hath left his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; (whom he loves as his own ſoule,) and theſe all ready to die by ſword or famine, if ſupply come not the ſooner, could this Prince, when arrived at his fathers houſe pleaſe himſelf with the delights of the Court, and forget the diſtreſſe of his family? or rather would he not come poſt to his father, (having their cries and groans alwayes in his eares) and before he eat or drink, do his errand to his father, and entreat him if ever he lov'd him, that he would ſend all the force of his Kingdom to raiſe the ſiege, rather then any of his dear relations ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh? Surely (Sirs) though Chriſt be in the top of his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and out of the ſtorme in regard of his own perſon, yet his children left behind in the midſt of ſins, Satans, and the worlds batteries are in his heart, and ſhall not be forgotten a moment by him. The care he takes in our buſineſſe appeared in the ſpeedy diſpatch he made of his Spirit to his Apoſtles ſupply, when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, which aſſoon almoſt as he was warme in his ſeat, at his Fathers right hand, he ſent, to the incomparable comfort of his Apoſtles and us, that to this day, yea, to the end of the world do, or ſhall believe on him.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is the end as of all Promiſes to be ſecurity to our faith, ſo of thoſe in particular where his Almighty Power is expreſly engaged, that we may count this attribute our portion, and reap the comfort it yields as freely, as one may the crop of his own field: <hi>Walk before me,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, I am God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>; ſet on this as thy portion, and live upon it; The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6. teacheth us what uſe to make of promiſes, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> there is the promiſe, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which he teacheth us to draw by faith from this, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>So we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper.</hi> We, that is, every believer may boldly ſay, that is, we may conclude God will help: not ſneakingly, timorouſly, perhaps he will; but we may boldly aſſert it in the face of men and devils, becauſe he that is Almighty hath ſaid it. Now for a Chriſtian not to ſtrengthen his faith on this incomparably ſweet attribute, but to ſit down with a few weak unſetled hopes, when he may, yea, ought to be ſtrong in the faith of ſuch promiſes, what is it but to undervalue the bleſſing of ſuch promiſes? as if one ſhould promiſe another houſe and land, and bid him make them as ſure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the Law can binde, and he ſhould take no care to effect this, would it not be interpreted as a ſleighting of his friends kindneſſe? Is it a ſmall matter that God paſſeth over his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power by promiſe to us, and bids us make it as ſure to our ſelves as we can by faith, and we neglect this, leaving the Writings of the promiſes unſealed on our hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, our obedience and comfort are ſtrong or weak as our faith is on this principle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, our obedience, that being a childe of faith partakes of its Parents ſtrength or weakneſſe; <hi>Abraham</hi> being ſtrong in faith, what an heroick act of obedience did he perform in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Son? his faith being well ſet on the Power of God, he carries that without ſtaggering, which would have laid a weak faith on the ground. No act of faith more ſtrengthens
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119001:26"/>
for duty, then that which eyes Gods Almighty power enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for its aſſiſtance, <hi>Go in this thy might,</hi> ſaid God to <hi>Gideon, have not I call'd thee?</hi> as if he had ſaid, Can I not, will I not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee through thy work? Away goes <hi>Gideon</hi> in the faith of this and doth wonders. This brought the righteous man from the Eaſt to Gods foot, though he knew not whither he went, yet he knew with whom he went, God Almighty. But take a ſoul not perſwaded of this how uneven and unſtable is he in his obediential courſe? every threat. from man if mighty diſmayes him, becauſe his faith not fixt on the Almighty, and therefore ſometimes he will ſhift off a duty to comply with man, and betray his truſt into the hands of a ſorry creature, becauſe he hath fleſhly eyes to behold the power of man, but wants a ſpiritual eye to ſee God at his back, to protect him with his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power; which were his eyes open to ſee, he would not be ſo routed in his thoughts at the approach of a weak creature: <hi>Should ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> ſaid good <hi>Nehemiah, Nehem.</hi> 6.11. He was newly come from the throne of grace, where he had called in the help of the Almighty, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>O God, ſtrengthen my hands.</hi> And truly now he will rather die upon the place, then diſparage his God with a diſhonourable retreat.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Chriſtians comfort increaſeth or waines, as the  aſpect of his faith is to the power of God. Let the ſoule queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that or his intereſt in it, and his joy guſheth out, even as blood out of a broken vein: It is true, a ſoule may ſcramble to heaven with much ado, by a faith of recumbency, relying on God as able to ſave, without this perſwaſion of its intereſt in God; but ſuch a ſoule goes with a ſcant ſide-winde, or like a ſhip whoſe maſts are laid by the board, expoſed to winde and weather, if others better appointed did not tow it along with them. Many feares like waves ever and anon cover ſuch a ſoule, that it is more under water then above; whereas one that ſees it ſelfe folded in the armes of Almighty power, O how ſuch a ſoule goes mounting afore the winde, with her ſailes fill'd with joy and peace! Let affliction come, ſtormes ariſe, this bleſſed ſoule knows where it ſhall land and be welcome. The Name of God is his harbour, where he puts in as boldly, as a man ſteps into his own houſe, when taken in a ſhower. He heares God calling him into this and other his attributes, as

for another coaſt, it belongs to the Saints into whoſe boſome this truth unlades all her comfort: ſee God ſhutting the door upon you, when he ſets his children to feaſt themſelves with ſuch dainties, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.13. <hi>My ſervants ſhall eat, but ye ſhall be hungry; my ſervants ſhall drink; but ye ſhall be thirsty.</hi> God hath his ſet number, which he provides for; He knows how many he hath in his family: theſe and no more ſhall ſit down. One chief diſh at the Saints board is the Almighty power of God; This was ſet before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſtands before all his Saints, that they may eate to fulneſſe of comfort on it; <hi>But thou ſhalt be hungry</hi>; He is Almighty to pardon, but he will not uſe it for thee an impenitent ſinner; thou haſt not a friend on the bench, not an attribute in all Gods Name will ſpeak for thee: Mercy it ſelf will ſit and vote with the reſt of its fellow-attributes for thy damnation. God is able to ſave and help in a time of need, but upon what acquaintance is it that thou art ſo bold with God, as to expect his ſaving arme to be ſtretcht forth for thee? Though a man will riſe at midnight to let in a childe, that cryes and knocks at his doore, yet he will not take ſo much paines for a dog, that lies howling there. This preſents thy condition, ſinner, ſad enough, yet this is to tell thy ſtory faireſt; for that Almighty power of God which is engaged for the beleevers ſalvation, is as deeply obliged to bring thee to thy execution, and damnation. What greater tie then an oath? God himſelf is under an oath to be the deſtruction of every impenitent ſoul. That oath which God ſware in his wrath againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, concernes every unbeleever to the end of the world. In the Name of God conſider, were it but the oath of a man, or a company of men, that like thoſe in the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſhould ſweare to be the death of ſuch a one, and thou wert the man, would it not fill thee with feare and trembling night and day, and take away the quiet of thy life, till they were made friends? What then are their pillows ſtuft with, who can ſleep ſo ſoundly without any horrour or amazement, though they be told, that the Almighty God is under an oath of damning them body and ſoul, without timely repentance? O bethink your ſelves, ſinners, is it wiſdome, or valour to refuſe termes of mercy from Gods hands, whoſe Almighty power if rejected, will ſoone bring you

All theſe mighty ſinnes and devils, make not one Almighty ſinne, or an Almighty devil. Oppoſe to all the hideous charges brought againſt thee by them this onely attribute.

Something like our uſual phraſe; when a childe or a woman ſtrikes us, I am a man, and not a childe, or woman, therefore I will not ſtrike again. The very conſidering God to be God, ſuppoſeth him Almighty to pardon as well as to avenge, and this is ſome relief; But then to conſider it is Almighty power in bond and Covenant to pardon, this is more; As none can binde God but himſelf, ſo none can break the bond himſelf makes: and are they not his own words, that <hi>he will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon</hi>?

The Almighty God ſtands in ſight of thee while thou art in the valley fighting, and ſtayes but for a call from thee when diſtreſſed in battel, and then he will come to thy reſcue: <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> cried, when in the throng of his enemies, and the Lord helped him, much more mayeſt thou promiſe thy ſelf his ſuccour in thy ſoul-combates: Betake thy ſelf to the throne of grace with that promiſe; <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you</hi>: and before thou urgeſt it (the more to help thy faith,) comfort thy ſelf with this, that though this word Almighty is not expreſt, yet it is implied in this and every promiſe, and thou mayeſt without adding a title to the Word of God read it in thy ſoul; ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, ſaith the Almighty God, for this and all his attributes are the conſtant ſeale to all his promiſes. Now ſoule put the bond in ſuit, fear not the recovery, 'tis debt, and ſo due: He is able whom thou ſueſt, and ſo there is no feare of loſing the charge of the ſuit, and he that was ſo gracious to binde himſelf when he was free, will be ſo faithful (being able) to perform now he is bound: only while thou expecteſt the performance of the promiſe, and the aſſiſtance of this Almighty power againſt thy

Perhaps thou findeſt the duty of thy calling too heavy for thy weak ſhoulders, make bold by faith to lay the heavieſt end of thy burden on Gods ſhoulder, which is thine (if a believer) as ſure as God can make it by promiſe. When at any time thou art ſick of thy work, and ready to think with <hi>Jonas</hi> to run from it; encourage thy ſelfe with that of God to <hi>Gideon,</hi> whom he call'd from the flaile to threſh the mountains, <hi>Go in this thy might,</hi> hath not God call'd thee? fall to the work God ſets thee about, and thou engageſt his ſtrength for thee. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength.</hi> Run from thy work, and thou engageſt Gods ſtrength againſt thee, he'll ſend ſome ſtorme or other after thee to bring home his runaway ſervant. How oft hath the Coward been kill'd in a ditch, or under ſome hedge, when the valiant ſouldier that ſtood his ground and kept his place got off with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour? Art thou call'd to ſuffer? flinch not becauſe thou art afraid, thou ſhalt never be able to bear the croſſe; God can lay it ſo even, thou ſhalt not feel it; though thou ſhouldeſt finde no ſuccour till thou comeſt to the priſon-door, yea, till thou haſt one foot on the ladder, or thy neck on the block, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair not. <hi>In the Mount will the Lord be ſeen.</hi> And in that houre he can give thee ſuch a look of his ſweet face, as ſhall make the blood come in the gaſtly face of a cruel death, and appear lovely in thy eye for his ſake. He can give thee ſo much comfort in hand, as thou ſhalt acknowledge God is aforehand with thee, for all thy ſhame &amp; pain thou canſt endure for him; And if it ſhould not amount to this, yet ſo much as will bear all thy charges thou canſt be put to in the way, lies ready told in that promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119001:30"/>
Thou ſhalt have it at ſight, and this may ſatisfie a Chriſtian, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if he conſiders, though he doth not carry ſo much of heavens joy about him to heaven as others, yet he ſhall meet it as ſoon as he comes to his Fathers houſe, where it is <hi>reſerved for him.</hi> In a word, Chriſtian, relie upon thy God, and make thy daily applications to the throne of grace, for continual ſupplies of ſtrength: you little think how kindly he takes it, that you will make uſe of him, the oftner the better, and the more you come for, the more welcome; elſe why would Chriſt have told his diſciples, <hi>Hitherto ye have ask't nothing</hi>; but to expreſſe his large heart in giving, loath to put his hand to his purſe for a little, and therefore by a familiar kind of Rhetorick puts them to riſe higher in asking, as <hi>Naaman</hi> when <hi>Gehazi</hi> asks one talent, entreats him <hi>to take two</hi>; ſuch a bountiful heart thy God hath, while thou art asking a little peace and joy, he bids thee open thy mouth wide, and hee'l fill it, Go and ranſack thy heart, Chriſtian, from one end to the other, finde out thy wants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thy ſelfe with all thy weakneſſes, and ſet them before the Almighty, as the <hi>Widow</hi> her empty veſſels before the <hi>Prophet,</hi> hadſt thou more then thou canſt bring, thou mayeſt have them all fill'd. God hath ſtrength enough to give, but he hath no ſtrength to deny, here the Almighty himſelfe (with reverence be it ſpoken) is weak; even a childe, the weakeſt in grace of his family, that can but ſay Father, is able to overcome him; and therefore let not the weakneſſe of thy faith encourage thee. No greater motive to the bowels of mercy to ſtir up Almighty power to relieve thee, then thy weakneſſe, when pleaded in the ſenſe of it. The pale face and thin cheeks (I hope) move more with us, then the canting language of a ſtout ſturdy beggar. Thus that ſoule that comes laden in the ſenſe of his weak faith, love, patience, the very weakneſſe of them carries an argument along with them for ſuccour.</p>

Is not this thy caſe, poor ſoul? thou haſt been praying for ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a luſt, and now thou wouldeſt have God preſently put forth his power to knock it on the head, and lay it for dead, that it ſhould never ſtir more in thy boſome: is not this the doore thou haſt ſtood looking for God to come in at, and no ſight or newes of thy God his coming that way? thy corruption yet ſtirs, it may be is more troubleſom then before; now thou askeſt, where is the ſtrength promiſed to thy relief? let me intreat thee before <pb n="44" facs="tcp:119001:31"/>
thou layeſt down this ſad Concluſion againſt thy God or ſelf, ſee whether he hath not conveyed in ſome ſtrength by another door: Perhaps thou haſt not ſtrength to conquer it ſo ſoon as thou deſireſt, but hath he not given further praying ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? Thou prayedſt before, but now more earneſtly, all the powers of thy ſoul are up to plead with God; Before thou waſt more favourable and moderate in thy requeſt, now thou haſt a zeal, thou canſt take no denial, yea, welcome any thing in the room of thy corruption; Would God but take thy ſin and ſend a croſſe, thou wouldeſt bleſſe him: Now, poor ſoule, is this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no ſtrength? Had not thy God re-inforced thee, thy ſin would have weakened thy ſpirit of prayer, and not increaſed it. <hi>David</hi> began to recover himſelf, when he began to recover his Spirit of prayer.

If God hath given thee ſo much ſtrength, to wreſtle with him above and againſt denials, thou haſt prevailed with the ſtronger of the two: overcome God, and he'll overcome the other for thee. Again, perhaps thou haſt been praying for further ſtrength to be communicated to thee in duty, that thou mighteſt be more ſpiritual, vigorous, united, ſincere, and the like therein, and yet thou findeſt thy old diſtempers hanging about thee, as if thou hadſt never acquainted God with thy aile; Well, ſoule, look once again into thy boſome with an unprejudiced eye, though thou doeſt not find the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength thou prayedſt for, yet haſt thou no more ſelf-abaſing ſtrength? perhaps the annoyance thou haſt from theſe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtempers in duty, occaſion thee to have a meaner opinion of all thy duties then ever, yea, they make thee abhor thy ſelfe in the ſenſe of theſe, as if thou hadſt ſo many loathſom vermein about thee. <hi>Jobs</hi> condition on the dunghil, with all his botch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and running ſores on his body, appears deſirable to thee, in compariſon of thine, whoſe ſoul thou complaineſt is worſe then his body.

It is more becoming the dutiful diſpoſition of a childe, when he hath not preſently what he writes for to his father, to ſay, my father is wiſer then I, his wiſdom will prompt him, what and when to ſend to me, and his fatherly affections to me his childe, will neither ſuffer him to deny any thing that is good, or ſlip the time that is ſeaſonable.

As a mother doth by her childe, that is learning to go, ſhe ſets it down, and ſtands ſome diſtance from it, and bids it come to her, the childe feels its legs weak, and cries for the mothers help, but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſteps back on purpoſe, that the childe ſhould put forth all its little ſtrength in making after her: When a poor ſoul comes and prayes againſt ſuch a ſin, God ſeems to ſtep back and ſtand at a diſtance; the temptation increaſeth, and no viſible ſuccour appears, on purpoſe that the Chriſtian, though weak, ſhould exerciſe that ſtrength he hath. Indeed we ſhall finde the ſenſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119001:32"/>

As a childe that writes for money to his father, none comes preſently, this makes him husband that little he hath the better, not a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now ſhall be laid out idly; Thus when a Chriſtian hath pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſuch a ſin again and again, and yet finds himſelf weak, prone to be worſted, O how careful will this, ſhould this make ſuch a one of every company, of every occaſion? Such a one had not need give his enemie any advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God may deny the Chriſtian ſuch aſſiſting ſtrength in duty, or mortifying ſtrength of corruption as he deſires, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on a gracious deſign, that he may thereby have an advantage of expreſſing his love in ſuch a way, as ſhall moſt kindly work upon the ingenuity of the ſoule to love God again. Perhaps (Chriſtian) thou prayeſt for a mercy thou wanteſt, or for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance out of ſome great affliction, and in the duty thou findeſt not more aſſiſtance then ordinary, yea, many diſtractions of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in it, and miſ-giving thoughts with unbelieving feares after it; Well, notwithſtanding thoſe defects in thy duty, yet God heares thy prayer, and ſends in the mercy on purpoſe, that he may greaten his love in thine eye, and make it more luſcious and ſweet to thy taſte, from his accepting thy weak ſervices, and paſſing by the diſtempers of thy ſpirit. Here is leſſe ſtrength for the duty, that thou mayeſt have more love in the mercy, nothing will affect a gracious heart more then ſuch a conſideration. See it in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.11, 12. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, All men are liars. What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> As if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, notwithſtanding all the comfortable meſſages I had from God by his Prophets concerning this matter, my own prayers, and thoſe remarkable providences, which carried in them a partial anſwer to them, and performance of what was promiſed, yet I betray'd much unbelief, queſtioning the truth of the one, and the return of the other; and hath God notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all my infirmities fulfill'd my deſire, and performed his promiſe? O what ſhall I render unto the Lord? Thus <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:119001:32"/>
reades Gods mercy through the ſpectacles of his own weakneſſe and infirmity, and it appears great, whereas if a mercy ſhould come in, as an anſwer to a duty managed with ſuch ſtrength of faith, and height of other graces, as might free him and his duty from uſual infirmities, this might prove a ſnare, and occaſion ſome ſelf-applauding, rather then mercy-admiring thoughts in the creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God may communicate the leſſe of his aſſiſting  ſtrength, that he may ſhew the more of his ſupporting ſtrength, in upholding weak grace: We do not wonder to ſee a man of ſtrong conſtitution, that eats his bread heartily, and ſleeps ſoundly, live: But for a crazie body, full of ailes and infirmities, to be ſo patcht and ſhored up by the Phyſicians Art that he ſtands to old age, this begets ſome wonder in the beholders. It may be thou art a poor trembling ſoule, thy faith is weak, and thy aſſaults from Satan ſtrong, thy corruptions ſtirring and active, and thy mortifying ſtrength little, ſo that in thy opinion they rather gain ground on thy grace, then give ground to it, ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non thou art ready to think, thou ſhalt be caſt as a wrack upon the devils ſhoare: and yet to this day thy grace lives, though full of leaks; now is it not worth the ſtepping aſide to ſee this ſtrange ſight? A broken ſhip with maſts and hull rent and torne, thus towed along by Almighty power, through an angry ſea, and Armadoes of ſins and devils, ſafely into its harbour. To ſee a poore dilling or ruſh candle in the face of the boiſterous winde, and not blown out; In a word, to ſee a weak ſtripling in grace held up in Gods armes, till he beats the devil craven: This God is doing in upholding thee: thou art one of thoſe <hi>babes,</hi> out of whoſe <hi>mouth God is perfecting his praiſe,</hi> by ordaining ſuch ſtrength for thee, that thou a babe in grace, ſhalt yet foile a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in wrath and power.</p>

duty, to mortifie corruption and the like? perhaps thou wilt ſay, Yes, I have waited on thoſe Ordinances, which are the way in which he hath promiſed to give out ſtrength. But is this all? thou mayeſt come to them, and not wait on God in them. Haſt thou not carnally expected ſtrength from them, and ſo put the Ordinance, as ſhe her husband in Gods ſtead? Hath not the frame of thy ſpirit ſome affinity with theirs in <hi>James</hi> 4.13. <hi>We will go into ſuch a city, and buy, and ſell, and get gaine</hi>: Hath not thy heart ſaid, I will go and hear ſuch a man, and get comfort, get ſtrength? and doeſt thou wonder thou art weak, barren and unfruitful? Are Ordinances God, that they ſhould make you ſtrong or comfortable? Thou mayeſt heare them anſwer thee, poor ſoul, as the King to the woman in the ſiege of <hi>Samaria</hi>: Help, O prayer, ſayeſt thou, or, O Miniſter; How can they help except the Lord help: Theſe are but Chriſts ſervants: Chriſt keeps the Key of his wine-cellar, they cannot ſo much as make you drink, when you come to their Maſters houſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, poor ſoul, ſtay not ſhort of Chriſt, but preſſe through all the croud of Ordinances, and ask to ſpeak with Jeſus, to ſee Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and touch him, and vertue will come forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ask thy ſoule whether thou haſt been thankful for that little ſtrength thou haſt; though thou art not of that ſtrength in grace, to run with the foremoſt, and hold pace with the talleſt of thy brethren, yet art thou thankful that thou haſt any ſtrength at all? though it be but to cry after them, whom thou ſeeſt out-ſtrip thee in grace, this is worth thy thanks. All in <hi>Davids</hi> army attained not to be equal with his few Worthies in proweſſe and honour, and yet did not caſhiere themſelves: thou haſt reaſon to be thankful for the meaneſt place in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Saints, the leaſt communications of Goſpel mercy and grace muſt not be over-look't. Aſſoon as ever <hi>Moſes</hi> with his army was through the ſea, they ſtrike up before they ſtir from the bank-ſide, and acknowledge the wonderful appearance of Gods power and mercy for them, though this was but one ſtep in their way; a howling wilderneſſe preſented it ſelf to them, and they not able to ſubſiſt a few dayes with all their proviſion, for all their great victory, yet <hi>Moſes,</hi> he will praiſe God for this handſel of mercy. This holy man knew the only way to keep credit with God, ſo as to have more, was to keep touch, and pay
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119001:33"/>
down his praiſe for what was received. If thou wouldeſt have fuller communications of divine ſtrength, owne God in what he hath done. Art thou weak? bleſſe God thou haſt life. Doeſt thou through feebleneſſe often faile in duty, and fall into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation? Mourne in the ſenſe of theſe: yet bleſſe God, that thou doeſt not live in a total neglect of duty, out of a prophane contempt thereof, and that in ſtead of falling through weakneſs, thou doeſt not lie in the mire of ſin through the wickedneſſe of thy heart. The unthankful ſoul may thank it ſelf, it thrives not better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, art thou humble under the aſſiſtance and ſtrength  God hath given thee? pride ſtops the conduit; if the heart be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin to ſwell, it is time for God to hold his hand and turne the cock, for all that is poured on ſuch a ſoule runs over into ſelf-applauding, and ſo is as water ſpilt in regard of any good it doth the creature, or any glory it brings to God. A proud heart and a lofty mountain are never fruitful. Now beſide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wayes that pride diſcovers it ſelf, as by under-valuing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and over-valuing it ſelfe, and ſuch like, you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two other ſymptomes of it. Firſt, it appears in bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, when a perſon runs into the mouth of temptation, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf up on the confidence of his grace receiv'd. This was <hi>Peters</hi> ſin, by which he was drawn to engage further then became an humble faith, running into the devils-quarters, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his priſoner for a while. The good man, when in his right temper, had thoughts low enough of himſelf, as when he ask't his Maſter, <hi>Is it I</hi>? but he that feared at one time, leſt he might be the traitour, at another cannot think ſo ill of himſelf, as to ſuſpect he ſhould be the denyer of his Maſter. What he? No, though all the reſt ſhould forſake him, yet he would ſtand to his colours; Is this thy caſe, Chriſtian? Poſſibly God hath given thee much of his minde, thou art skilful in the Word of life, and therefore thou dareſt venture to breath in corrupt aire, as if only the weak ſpirits of leſſe knowing Chriſtians, expoſed them to be infected with the contagion of errour and hereſie; Thou haſt a large portion of grace, or at leaſt thou thinkeſt ſo, and ventureſt to go where an humble-minded Chriſtian would fear his heels ſhould ſlip under him. Truly now thou tempteſt God to ſuffer thy lock to be cut, when thou art ſo bold to lay
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119001:34"/>
thy head in the lap of a temptation. Secondly, pride appears in the neglect of thoſe means, whereby the Saints graces and comforts are to be fed when ſtrongeſt. May be, Chriſtian, when thou art under feares and doubts then God hath thy company, thou art oft with thy pitcher at his door, but when thou haſt got any meaſure of peace, there growes preſently ſome ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe between God and thee: thy pitcher walks not as it was wont to theſe Wells of ſalvation. No wonder if thou (though rich in grace and comfort) goeſt behinde-hand, ſeeing thou ſpendeſt on the old ſtock, and driveſt no trade at preſent to bring in more: Or if thou doeſt not thus neglect duty, yet may be thou doeſt not perform it with that humility, which formerly beautified the ſame: then thou prayedſt in the ſenſe of thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to get ſtrength, now thou prayeſt to ſhew thy ſtrength, that others may admire thee. And if once (like <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) we call in Spectators to ſee our treaſure, and applaud us for our gifts and comfort, then it is high time for God, if he indeed love us, to ſend ſome meſſengers to carry theſe away from us, which carry our hearts from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, if thy heart doth not ſmite thee from what hath been ſaid, but thou haſt ſincerely waited on God, and yet haſt not received the ſtrength thou deſireſt, yet let it be thy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to live and die waiting on him. God doth not tell us his time of coming, and it were boldneſſe to ſet on of our own heads. Go, ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. <hi>Stay ye in Jeruſalem, until ye be endued with Power from on High.</hi> Thus he ſaith to thee, ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wait on him in the means he hath appointed, till thou beeſt endued with further power to mortifie thy corruptions, &amp;c.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, thy thus perſevering to wait on God, will be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſtrong grace in thee: the leſſe encouragement thou haſt to duty, the more thy faith and obedience to bear thee up in duty. He that can trade when times are ſo dead, that all his ware lies upon his hand, and yet drawes not in his hand, but rather trades more and more, ſure his ſtock is great. What, no comfort in hearing, no eaſe to thy ſpirit in praying, and yet more greedy to heare, and more-frequent in prayer? O ſoul, great is thy faith and patience.</p>

When temptation is ſtrong, thy little ſtrength even ſpent, and thou ready to yield into the hands of thine enemies, then expect ſuccours from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to enable thee to hold out under the temptation: Thus to <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient,</hi> or power from heaven to raiſe the ſiege, and drive away the tempter; thus to <hi>Job,</hi> when Satan had him at an advantage, then God takes him off. Like a wiſe Moderatour, when the Reſpondent is hard put to it by a ſubtile Opponent, takes him off, when he would elſe run him down. <hi>James</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful, and of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy.</hi>

               <p>To begin with the firſt, the furniture which every one muſt get that would fight Chriſts battels. The queſtion here will be, What is this Armour?</p>
               <p>Firſt, by armour is meant Chriſt; we reade of putting on <hi>the Lord Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 13.14. where Chriſt is ſet forth under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Armour. The Apoſtle doth not exhort them for riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drunkenneſſe, to put on ſobriety and temperance; for chambering and wantonneſſe, put on chaſtity; (as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher would have done) but bids, <hi>Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; implying thus much till Chriſt be put on, the creature is unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 'Tis not a mans morality and Philoſophical vertues, that will repel a temptation, ſent with a full charge from Satans cannon, though poſſibly it may the piſtol ſhot of ſome leſſe ſolicitation; ſo that he is the man in Armour, that is in Chriſt. Again, the Graces of Chriſt theſe are Armour, as <hi>the Girdle of truth, the breast plate of righteouſneſſe,</hi> and the reſt. Hence we are bid alſo <hi>put on the new man, Eph.</hi> 4.24. which is made up of all the ſeveral graces, as its parts and members. And he is the unarm'd ſoule, that is the unregenerate ſoule. Not excluding thoſe duties and means which God hath appointed the Chriſtian to uſe for his defence,</p>
               <p>The phraſe thus opened; the Point is,</p>

Or thus, A ſoule out of Chriſt is naked and deſtitute of all armour to defend him againſt ſin and Satan. God at firſt ſent man forth in compleat armour, <hi>being created in righteouſneſſe and true holines</hi>; but by a wile the devil ſtrip't him, and therfore aſſoon as the firſt ſin was compleated, it is written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. <hi>They were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> that is, poor weak creatures, at the will of Satan a ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, diſarm'd by their proud Conquerour, and unable to make head againſt him. Indeed it coſt Satan ſome diſpute to make the firſt breach, but after that he had once the gates open'd to let him in as Conquerour into the heart of man, he playes <hi>Rex</hi>: behold, a troop of other ſins croud in after him, without any ſtroak or ſtrife, in ſtead of confeſſing their ſins, they run their head in a buſh, and by their good will would not come where God is, and when they cannot flie from him, how do they prevaricate before him? They peale one of another, ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſin rather then ſuing for mercy. So quickly were their hearts hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin. And this is the woful condition of every ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked he findes us, and ſlaves he makes us, till God by his effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al call delivers us from the power of Satan <hi>into the Kingdome of his dear Son,</hi> which will further appear, if we conſider this Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſtate in a foure-fold notion.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Firſt, it is a ſtate of alienation from God. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, &amp;c.</hi> Such a one hath no more to do with any Covenant-promiſe, then he that lives at <hi>Rome</hi> hath to do with the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> which is

the birth-right of its own Deniſons, not Strangers. He is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world, he can claim no more protection from God, then an out-law'd ſubject from his Prince; If any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief befalls him, the mends is in his own hands, whereas God hath his hedge of ſpecial providence about his Saints, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, though his ſpite be moſt at them, dares not come upon Gods ground to touch any of them, without particular leave. Now what a deplored condition is that, wherein a ſoule is left to the wide world, in the midſt of legions of luſts and devils, to be rent and torne l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Let God leave a people, though never ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, preſently they loſe their wits, cannot finde their hands; A company of children or wounded men may riſe up, and chaſe them out of their fenced Cities, becauſe God is not with them; which made <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> pacifie the mutinous Iſraelites at the tidings of giants and walled cities with this; <hi>They are bread for us, their defence is departed from them.</hi> How much more muſt that ſoule be as bread to Satan, that hath no defence from the Almighty? Take men of the greateſt parts, natural or acquired accompliſhments, who only want an union with Chriſt, and renewing grace from Chriſt: O what fooles doth the devil make of them, leading them at his pleaſure, ſome to one luſt, ſome to another; the proudeſt of them all is ſlave to one or other, though it be to the ruining of body and ſoul for ever, Where lies the myſtery, that men of ſuch parts and wiſdom, ſhould debaſe themſelves to ſuch drudgery work of hell? even here, they are in a ſtate of alienation from God, and no more able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to break the devils priſon, then a ſlave ro run from his chain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Chriſtleſſe ſtate is a ſtate of ignorance, and  ſuch muſt needs be naked and unarm'd. He that cannot ſee his enemie, how can he ward off the blow he ſends? One ſeeing Prophet leads a whole army of blinde men whither he pleaſeth. The imperfect knowledge Saints have here, is Satans advantage againſt them; he often takes them on the blinde ſide, how eaſily then may he with a parcel of good words carry the blinde ſoule out of his way, who knowes not a ſtep of the right? Now that the Chriſtleſſe ſtate is a ſtate of ignorance, See <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſſe, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> Ye
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119001:37"/>
were <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> not <hi>in the dark,</hi> ſo one that hath an eye may be. A childe of light is often in the dark, concerning ſome truth or promiſe, but then hath a ſpiritual eye, which the Chriſtleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wants, and ſo is darkneſſe. And this darkneſſe cannot be enlightened, but by its union with Chriſt, which is expreſt in the following phraſe; <hi>But now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> As the eye of the body once put out, can never be reſtored by the creatures Art, ſo neither can the ſpiritual eye, loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by the teaching of men or Angels. It is one of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which Chriſt came to cure, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. 'Tis true, there is a light of reaſon, which is imparted to every man by nature, but this light is darkneſſe, compared with the Saints. As the night is dark to the day, even when the moon is in its full glory. This night-light of Reaſon may ſave a perſon from ſome ditch or pond, great and broad ſins, but it will never help him to eſcape the more ſecret corruptions, which the Saint ſees like atomes in the beams of ſpiritual knowledge. There is ſuch curious work the creature is to do, which cannot be wrought by candle-light of natural knowledge. Nay more, where the common illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit is ſuperadded to this light of nature, yet that is darkneſſe compar'd with the ſanctifying knowledge of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſoule, which doth both diſcover ſpiritual truths, and warme the heart at the ſame time with the love of truth, having like the Sun a prolifical and quickening vertue, which the other wants; ſo that the heart lies under ſuch common illuminations cold and dead. He hath no more ſtrength to reſiſt Satan, then if he knew not the command; whereas the Chriſtians knowledge, even when taken Priſoner by a temptation, purſues and brings back the ſoul as <hi>Abraham</hi> his Nephew, out of the enemies hands; which hints the third</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Chriſtleſſe ſtate is a ſtate of impotency, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>When we were without ſtrength, Chriſt</hi> came <hi>to die for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> What can a diſarm'd people that have not ſword or gun do to ſhake off the yoke of a conquering enemie? Such a power hath Satan over the ſoule, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. he is call'd the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> that keeps the ſoule as his <hi>Palace</hi>: If he hath no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance from heaven, he need feare no mutiny within; he keeps all in peace there. What the Spirit of God doth in a Saint, that in a manner doth Satan in a ſinner. The Spirit fills
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119001:37"/>
the heart of his with love, joy, holy deſires, feares; ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan fills the ſinners heart with pride, luſt, lying: <hi>Why hath Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan filled thy heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>? And thus fill'd with Satan (as the drunkard with wine) he is not his own man, but Satans ſlave.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the ſtate of unregeneracy is a ſtate of friendſhip  with ſin and Satan. If it be enmity againſt God, (as it is) then friendſhip with Satan. Now it will be hard to make that ſoule fight in earneſt againſt his friend. Is Satan divided? will the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil within fight againſt the devil without? Satan in the heart ſhut out Satan at the door? ſometimes indeed there appears a ſcuffle between Satan and a carnal heart, but it is a meer cheat, like the fighting of two fencers on a ſtage, you would think at firſt they were in earneſt, but obſerving how wary they are, where they hit one another, you may ſoon know they do not mean to kill: and that which puts all out of doubt, when the prize is done, you ſhall ſee them making merry together, with what they have got of their Spectatours, which was all they fought for; when a carnal heart makes the greateſt buſſle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin by complaining of it, or praying againſt it, follow him but off the ſtage of duty, (where he hath gained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Saint, the prize he fights for) and you ſhall ſee them ſit as friendly together in a corner as ever.</p>

No ſuch matter: Conſider but this one thing, and you will wonder that Chriſt hath any to follow him, rather then that he hath ſo few. Satan findes the world unarm'd, when the Prince of the world comes, he findes nothing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the whole ſoule is in a diſpoſition to yield at firſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and if Conſcience, Governour for God in the creature ſtands out a while, all the other powers, as will and affections are in a diſcontent, (like mutinous ſouldiers in a garriſon) who never reſt till they have brought over conſcience to yield, or

againſt its command ſet open the City gate to the enemie, and ſo deliver traiterouſly their conſcience priſoner to their luſts: But when Chriſt comes to demand the ſoul, he meets a ſcornful anſwer: <hi>Depart from us, we deſire not the knowledge of the moſt High. We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> With one conſent they vote againſt him, and riſe up as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt <hi>Samſon</hi> whom they call'd <hi>the Deſtroyer of the countrey.

They will not deliver the Caſtle they hold for Satan, till fired over their heads. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> oppoſeth <hi>Moſes</hi> on one hand, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> cry out upon him on the other. Such meaſure hath Chriſt both at Satans hand, and the ſinners. That which leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Alexanders</hi> Conqueſts, was, he overcame a people buried in barbariſme, without armes or diſcipline of war; and that which heightened <hi>Ceſars,</hi> (though not ſo many) he overcame a people more warlike and furniſh't. Satans victories are of poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, graceleſſe ſouls, who have neither armes, nor hands, nor hearts to oppoſe; but when he aſſaults a Saint, then he ſits down before a city with gates and bars, and ever riſeth with ſhame; unable to take the weakeſt hold, to pluck the weakeſt Saint out of Chriſts hands; but Chriſt brings ſouls out of his dominion with a high hand, in ſpite of all the force and fury of hell, which like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſte purſue them.</p>

Why? becauſe this opens a magazine of armes and furniture for the ſoule; the Word is that <hi>Tower of David, Cant.</hi> 4.4. <hi>built for an Armourie, wherein there hang a thouſand bucklers; all the ſhields of mighty men.</hi> Hence the Saints have ever had their armour, and the preaching of the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks it.

tell me, I beheld Satan falllng when I ſent you: I knew the Goſpel would make work where it came; and therefore no wonder Satan labours to diſpoſſeſſe the Goſpel, which diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth him; he knows that army is near loſt, whoſe magazine is blowen up; 'Tis true indeed, under the very Goſpel the devil rageth more in ſuch ſwiniſh ſinners, as are given over of God to be poſſeſt of that fiend, for rejecting of his grace; but he is caſt out of others, who <hi>before the loving kindneſſe of God to man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi> in the Goſpel, were commanded by him, <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures</hi>; But now by the light of the Goſpel they ſee their folly, and by the grace it brings are enabled to renounce him. This, this is that which torments the foule ſpirit, to ſee himſelf forſaken of his old friends and ſervants, and this new Lord to come and take his ſubjects from him: and therefore he labours either by perſecution to drive the Goſpel away, or by policy to perſwade a people to ſend it away from their coaſts, and was he ever more likely to effect it among us? What a low eſteem hath he brought the preaching of the Goſpel unto? the price is fallen half in half to what it was ſome yeares paſt, even among thoſe that have been counted the greateſt Merchants up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints Exchange. Some, that have thought it worth croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſeas, even to the <hi>Indies</hi> (almoſt as far as others fetch their gold) to enjoy the Goſpel, are loath now to croſſe the ſtreet to hear it at ſo cheap a rate; And ſome that come, (who formerly trembled at it) make it moſt of their errand to mock at, or quarrel with it. Nay, it is come to ſuch a paſſe, that the Word is ſo heavy a charge to the ſqueamiſh ſtomacks of many Profeſſors, that it comes up again preſently, and abundance of choler with it againſt the Preacher, eſpecially if it fall foule of the ſins and errours of the times, the very naming of which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to offend, though the Nation be ſinking under their weight. What reproaches are the faithful Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel laden withal? I call heaven and earth to witneſſe, whether ever they ſuffered a hotter perſecution of the tongue, then in this apoſtatizing age. A new generation of Profeſſours are ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, that will not know them to be the Miniſters of Chriſt, though thoſe before them, (as well in grace as time, more able to derive their ſpiritual pedigree, then themſelves) have to their death owned them for their ſpiritual fathers.

                  <p>FIrſt,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> the Chriſtians Armour which he weares muſt be of divine Inſtitution and appointment. The ſouldier comes into the field with no armes, but what his General commands, 'tis not left to every ones fancie to bring what weapons he pleaſe, this will breed confuſion. The Chriſtian ſouldier is bound up to Gods order, though the army be on earth, yet the Councel of War fits in Heaven; This duty ye ſhall do, that means ye ſhall uſe; and to do more or uſe other then God commands, though with ſome ſeeming ſucceſſe againſt ſin; ſuch ſhall ſurely be call'd to account for this boldneſſe. The diſcipline of war among men is ſtrict in this caſe. Some have ſuffered death by a Councel of war, even when they have beaten the enemie, becauſe out of their place, or beſide their order. God is very preciſe in this point, he will ſay to ſuch as invent wayes to worſhip him of their own, coyne meanes to mortifie corruption, obtain comfort in their own mint; <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> this is truly to be <hi>righteous over-much,</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) when we will pretend to correct Gods Law, and adde ſupplements of our own to his rule. Who will pay that man his wages that is not ſet on work by God? God tells <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 23.32.</note> the falſe Prophets ſhall do them no good, becauſe they come not of his errand; ſo neither will thoſe wayes and meanes help, which are not of Gods appointing; Gods thoughts are not as mans, nor his wayes as ours, which he uſeth to attain his ends by. If man had been to ſet forth the Iſraelitiſh army, now to march out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; ſurely his wiſdom would have directed rather to have plundered the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their horſe and armes, (as more neceſſary for ſuch an expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)

then to borrow their jewels and eare-rings, but God will have them come out naked and on foot; and <hi>Moſes</hi> keeps cloſe to his order; yea, when any horſes were taken in battel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God commanded they ſhould be houghed, they obeyed, though to their ſeeming diſadvantage. It was Gods war they waged, and therefore but reaſonable they ſhould be under his command, they encamp't and march't by his order; as the Ark moved or reſted, they fought by his command, the number ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, the means and weapons they ſhould uſe, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by God, as in the aſſault of <hi>Jericho</hi>: and what is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of all this? (for ſurely God had an eye in that to our march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven, and our fighting with theſe curſed ſpirits and luſts that ſtand in our way) but that we ſhould fight lawfully, uſing thoſe means, which we have from his mouth in his Word?</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> This reproveth two ſorts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thoſe that fight Satan in Armour, that hath no divine Inſtitution, as</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Papiſt. Look into his armoury, and hardly a piece that will be found Armour of God. They fight in the Popes armour: his authority is the ſhop, wherein their weapons are forged; It were a kinde of pennance to your patience, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat all the ſeveral pieces of armour, with which they load ſilly ſoules, too heavy indeed for the broadeſt ſhoulders among them to bear; yea, more then the wiſer ſort of them mean to uſe, their maſſes, mattens, vigils, pilgrimages, Lent-faſts, whippings, vowes of chaſtity, poverty, with a world of ſuch traſh; where is a Word of God for theſe? who hath required theſe things at their hands? a thouſand woes will one day fall upon thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, who have ſtrip't the people of the true Armour of God, and put theſe reeds and bulruſhes in their hands. This may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us in the ſight of God and men, for our departure from them, who will force us to venture the life of our ſoules in ſuch, paper-armour, when God hath provided better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the carnal Proteſtant, who fights in fleſhly armour. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3. the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of <hi>warring after the fleſh,</hi> that is, with weapons or means, which mans carnal wiſdome prompts to, and not God commands, and ſo are weak. How few are clad with other in the day of battel; Firſt, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119001:40"/>
tempts to ſin, if he hath not preſently a peaceable entrance; yet the reſiſtance commonly made is carnal; the ſtrength car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal they reſt on, their own, not Gods; the motives carnal, as the fear of man more then of God. Where one ſaith, How ſhall I do this and ſin againſt God? many in their hearts ſay, How ſhall I do this and anger man, diſpleaſe my Maſter, provoke my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and loſe the good opinion of my Miniſter? <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>John,</hi> and did many things: had he fear'd God, he would have laboured to have done every thing. The like may be ſaid of all other motives, which have their ſpring in the creature, not in God; they are armour which will not out-ſtand ſhot. If thy ſtrength lie in a creature-lock, it may be ſoon cut off; if in God it will hold, as his command; <hi>It is written</hi>: I cannot do it, but I muſt ſet my foot on the Law of my Maker. Or the love of Chriſt; I cannot come at my luſt, but I muſt go over my bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saviour, and therefore away, foule Tempter, I hate thee and thy motion. This foundation is rock, and will ſtand; but if it be ſome carnal reſpect that balanceth thee, another more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be found of the ſame kinde, which will caſt the ſcales an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way. She that likes not the man becauſe of his dreſſe only, may ſoon be gain'd when he comes in another habit. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can change his ſuit, and then thy mouth will be ſtop't when thy carnal argument is taken off. Secondly, when the Word or Conſcience rebuke for ſin, what is the armour that men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover their guilty ſoules withal? truly no other then carnal. If they cannot evade the charge that theſe bring, then they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to mitigate it, by extenuating the fact. 'Tis true, will they ſay, I did (I confeſſe) commit ſuch a fault, but I was drawen in; <hi>The woman gave me, and I did eate,</hi> was <hi>Adams</hi> fig-leaf armour: 'tis but once or twice, and I hope that breaks no ſuch ſquares, was this ſuch a great buſineſſe? I know jolly Chriſtians will do as much as this comes to; I thank God, I cannot be charged for whore or thief: This is the armour that muſt keep off the blow. But if Conſcience will not be thus taken off, then they labour to divert their thoughts, by ſtriking up the loud muſick of carnal delights, that the noiſe of one may drown the other, or with <hi>Cain,</hi> they will go from the preſence of the Lord, and come no more at thoſe Ordinances which make their head ake, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſt of their raving conſciences. If yet the ghoſt haunts
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119001:41"/>
them, then they labour to pacifie it, with ſome good work or other, which they ſet againſt their bad; their almes and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their old age, muſt expiate the oppreſſion and violence of their former dayes: as if this little frankincenſe were enough to aire and take away the plague of Gods curſe, which is in their ill gotten goods. Thus poor creatures catch at any ſorry cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which will not ſo much as hide their ſhame, much leſſe choak the bullet of Gods wrath, when God ſhall fire upon them; this muſt he Armour of Gods appointing. <hi>Adam</hi> was naked for all his fig-leaves,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.21.</note> while God <hi>taught him to make coats of skins,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly (as ſome think) ſhadowing out <hi>Christ</hi> the true <hi>Lambe of God,</hi> whoſe righteouſneſſe alone was appointed by him to cover our ſhame, and arme our naked ſouls from the ſight and ſtroke of his juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it reproves thoſe who uſe the Armour of God, but not as God hath appointed, which appears in three ſorts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when a perſon uſeth a duty appointed by God, not as Armour of defence againſt ſin, but as a cover for ſin. Who would think him an enemie that weares Chriſts colours in his hat, and marcheth after Chriſt in the exerciſe of all the duties of his worſhip? ſuch a one may paſſe all the Courts of guard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as being bid ſtand, all take him for a friend; and yet ſome ſuch there are, who are fighting againſt Chriſt all the while. The hypocrite is the man, he learnes his poſtures, gets the Word, hath his tongue tip'c with Scripture-language, and walks in the habit of a Chriſtian, meerly on a deſign to drive his trade the more cloſely; Like ſome high-way men in our dayes, who rob in the habit of ſouldiers, that they may be the leſſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; this is deſperate wickedneſſe indeed, to take up Gods armes, and uſe them in the devils ſervice; of all ſinners ſuch ſhall finde leaſt mercy; falſe friends ſhall ſpeed worſe then open enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they uſe not the Armour of God, as God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who put a carnal confidence therein. We muſt not confide in the Armour of God, but in the God of this Armour, becauſe all <hi>our weapons are</hi> only <hi>mighty through God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. The Ark was the meanes of the Jewes ſafety, but carnally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded and gloried in, haſtened their overthrow: ſo duties and Ordinances, gifts and graces in their place, are means for the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119001:41"/>
ſouls defence; Satan trembles as much as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> at the <hi>Ark,</hi> to ſee a ſoule diligent in the uſe of duty, and exerciſe of grace; but when the creature confides in them, this is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. As ſome, when they have prayed, think they pleaſe God for all day, though they take little heed to their ſteps. Others have ſo good an opinion of their faith, ſincerity, knowledge, thut you may aſſoon make them believe they are dogs, as that they may ever be taken in ſuch an errour or ſinful practice. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when aſſiſted in duty, are prone to ſtroak their own head with a <hi>Bene feciſti Bernarde,</hi> and ſo promiſe themſelves to ſpeed, becauſe they have done their errand ſo well. What ſpeak ſuch paſſages in the hearts of men, but a carnal confidence in their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to their ruine? Many ſoules (we may ſafely ſay) do not only periſh praying, repenting and believing after a ſort, but they periſh by their praying and repenting &amp;c. while they carnally truſt in theſe. As it falls out ſometimes, that the ſouldier in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel loſeth his life by means of his own Armour, it is ſo heavy he cannot flie with it, and ſo cloſe buckled to him, that he cannot get it off, to flie for his life without it. If we be ſaved, we muſt come naked to Chriſt for all our duties, we will not flie to Chriſt while confiding in them, and ſome are ſo lock't into them, that they cannot come without them, and ſo in a day of temptation are trampled under the feet of Gods wrath, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans fury. The poor <hi>Publican</hi> throwes down his armes, (that is, all confidence in himſelf) cries for quarter at the hands of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>God be merciful unto me a ſinner,</hi> and he comes off with his life, he went away juſtified: but the Phariſee, loaden with his righteouſneſſe, and conceited of it, ſtands to it, and is loſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, they do not uſe the Armour of God as ſuch, who in  the performing of divine duties, eye not God through them, and this makes them all weak and uneffectual. Then the Word is mighty, when read as the Word of God, then the Goſpel preach't, powerful to convince the conſcience, and revive the drooping ſpirit, when heard, as the appointment of the great God, and not the exerciſe of a mean creature. Now it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in three things, whether we eye divine appointment in the meanes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when we engage in a duty, and look not up to God 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119001:42"/>
for his bleſſing. Didſt thou eye Gods appointment in the means, thou wouldeſt ſay, Soul, if there come any good of thy preſent ſervice, it muſt drop from heaven, for it is Gods appointment, not mans: And can I profit whether God will or no? or think to finde and bring away any ſoul-enriching treaſure from his Ordinance without his leave? had I not beſt look up to him, by whoſe bleſſing I live more then by my bread?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Again, Secondly, it appears we look not at Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when we have low thoughts of the means. What is <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> that I ſhould waſh in it? what is this preaching that I ſhould attend on it, where I heare nothing but I knew before? what theſe beggarly elements of water, and bread, and wine? Are not theſe the reaſonings of a ſoul that forgets who appoints theſe? Didſt thou remember who commands, thou wouldeſt not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion what the command is; what though it be clay, let Chriſt uſe it, and it ſhall open the eyes, though in it ſelf more like to put them out. Hadſt thou thy eye on God, thou wouldeſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence thy carnal reaſon with this; 'Tis God ſends me to ſuch a duty, whatſoever he ſaith unto me I will do it, though he ſhould ſend me (as Chriſt them) to draw wine out of pots fill'd with water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when a ſoule leaves off a duty, becauſe he hath not in it what he expected from it. O, ſaith the ſoul, I ſee it is in vain to follow the means as I have done; ſtill Satan foiles me, I will even give over. Doeſt thou remember, ſoule, 'tis Gods appointment? ſurely then thou wouldeſt perſevere in the midſt of diſcouragements. He that bids thee pray, bids thee pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing. He that bids thee hear, bids thee wait at the poſts of wiſdom: thou wouldeſt reaſon thus, God hath ſet me on duty, and here I'le ſtand, till God takes me off and bids me leave praying.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> SEcondly, the Chriſtians Armour muſt be Armour of God, in  regard of its make and conſtitution. My meaning is, 'tis not only God, that muſt appoint the weapons and armes the Chriſtian uſeth for his defence: but he muſt alſo be the efficient of them, he muſt work all their work in them and for them. Prayer is an appointment of God, yet this is not armour of proof, except it be a Prayer of God flowing from his Spirit.

that cry for a knife or dagger, and are pleaſ'd as well with a bone knife, and wooden dagger, as with the beſt of all? ſo they have ſome armour, it matters not what. Pray they muſt, but little care how it be performed: Beleeve in God? yes, they hope they are not infidels: but what it is, how they come by it, or whether it will hold in an evil-day, this never was put to the queſtion in their hearts. Thus thouſands periſh with a vain conceit, they are arm'd againſt Satan, death and judgment, when they are <hi>miſerable and naked,</hi> yea, worſe on it then thoſe who are more naked, (thoſe I mean) who have not a rag of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to hide their ſhame from the worlds eye; and that in a double reſpect.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is harder to work on ſuch a ſoul ſavingly, becauſe he hath a forme, though not the power, and this affords him a plea. A ſoule purely naked, nothing like the wedding garment on, he is ſpeechleſſe; the drunkard hath nothing to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when you ask him why he lives ſo ſwiniſhly; you may come up to him, and get within him, and turn the very mouth of his conſcience upon him, which will ſhoot conviction into him: But come to deal with one that prayes and heares, one that is a pretender to faith and hope in God, here is a man in gliſtering armour, he hath his weapon in his hand, with which he will keep the Preacher, and the Word he chargeth him with at armes length. Who can ſay, I am not a Saint? what duty do I neglect? here's a breaſt-work he lies under, which makes him not ſo faire a mark either to the obſervation or reproof of another, his chief defect being within, where mans eye comes not. Again, 'tis harder to work on him, becauſe he hath been tamper'd with already, and miſcarried in the eſſay. How comes ſuch a one to he acquainted with ſuch duties, to make ſuch a Profeſſion? was it ever thus? No, the Word hath been at work upon him his conſcience hath ſcared him from his trade of wickedneſſe into a forme of Profeſſion, but taking in ſhort of Chriſt, for want of a through change, it is harder to remove him then the other: he is like a lock whoſe wards have been troubled; which makes it harder to turn the Key, then if never potter'd with. 'Tis better dealing with a wilde ragged cole, never back't, then one that in breaking hath took a wrong ſtroak. A bone quite out of joynt then falſe ſet. In a word, ſuch a one hath more to deny then a

profane perſon; the one hath but his luſts, his whores, his ſwill and draffe; but the other hath his duties, his ſeeming graces. O how hard is it to perſwade ſuch a one to light, and hold Chriſts ſtirrup, while he and his duties are made Chriſts foot-ſtool.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ſuch a one is deepeſt in condemnation. None ſink  ſo far into hell as thoſe that come neareſt heaven, becauſe they fall from the greateſt height. As it aggravates the torments of damned ſouls in this reſpect above devils, they had a cord of mercy thrown out to them, which devils had not: ſo by how much God by his Spirit waits on, pleads with, and by both gains on a ſoul more then others by ſo much ſuch a one (if he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh) will finde hell the hotter: theſe adde to his ſin, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance of his ſin in hell thus accented will adde to his torment. None will have ſuch a ſad parting from Chriſt, as thoſe who went half-way with him, and then left him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (I beſeech you) look to your armour, <hi>David</hi> would not fight in armour, he had not tried though it was a Kings; perhaps ſome thought him too nice: What? is not the Kings armour good enough for <hi>David</hi>? Thus many will ſay, Art thou ſo curious and preciſe? ſuch a great man doth thus and thus, and hopes to come to heaven at laſt, and dareſt not thou venture thy ſoule in his armour? No, Chriſtian, follow not the example of the greateſt on earth; 'tis thy own ſoul thou ventureſt in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, therefore thou canſt not be too choice of thy armour. Bring thy heart to the Word, as the only touch-ſtone of thy grace and furniture; the Word (I told you) is <hi>the Tower of David,</hi> from whence thy armour muſt be fetch't, if thou canſt finde this Tower-ſtamp on it, then 'tis of God, elſe not. Try it therefore by this one Scripture-ſtamp. Thoſe weapons are mighty, which God gives his Saints to fight his battels withal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God.</hi> The ſword of the Spirit hath its point and edge, whereby it makes its way into the heart and conſcience, through the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency of the one, and ſtupidity of the other, (wherewith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as with buffe and coat of male, armes the ſinner againſt God) and there cuts and ſlaſhes, kills and mortifies luſt in its own Caſtle, where Satan thinks himſelf impregnable. The Breaſt-plate which is of God, doth not bend and break at every pat of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119001:44"/>
temptation, but is of ſuch a divine temperament, that it repels Satans motions with ſcorne on Satans teeth. Should ſuch a one as I ſin, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in another caſe? and ſuch are all the reſt. Now try whether your weapons be mighty or weak: what can you do or ſuffer more for God, then an hypocrite that is clad in fleſhly armour? I'le tell you what the world faith, and if you be Chriſtians, clear your ſelves, and wipe off that dirt which they throw upon your gliſtering armour: they ſay, Theſe Profeſſors indeed have God more in their talk then we, they are oftner in the mount of duty then we, but when they come down into their ſhops, relations and worldly employments, then the beſt of them all is but like one of us; they can throw the Tables of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments out of their hands as well as we, come from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and be as covetous and griping, as peeviſh and paſſionate as the worſt; they ſhew as little love to Chriſt as others, when it is matter of coſt, as to relieve a poor Saint, or maintain the Goſpel, you may get more from a ſtranger, an enemie, then from a profeſſing brother. O Chriſtians, either vindicate the Name of Chriſt, whoſe Enſign you ſeem to march after, or throw away your ſeeming armour, by which you have drawn the eyes of the world upon you. If you will not, Chriſt himſelf will ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiere you, and that with ſhame enough ere long. Never call that Armour of God, which defends thee not againſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan. Take therefore the ſeveral pieces of your armour, and try them, as the ſouldier before he fights, will ſet his helmet or head-piece, as a mark at which he lets flie a brace of bullets, and as he findes them ſo will weare them or leave them; but be ſure thou ſhooteſt Scripture-bullets. Thou boaſteſt of a breaſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, ask thy ſoul, Didſt thou ever in thy life perform a duty to pleaſe God, and not to accommodate thy ſelf? Thou haſt prayed often againſt thy ſin, a great noiſe of theſe pieces have been heard coming from thee by others, as if there were ſome hot fight between thee and thy corruption, but canſt thou indeed ſhew one ſin thou haſt ſlain by all thy praying? <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, though his coat was brought bloody to <hi>Jacob</hi> and ſo may thy ſin be for all thy mortified look in duty, and out cry thou makeſt againſt them. If thou wouldeſt thus try every piece, thy credulous heart would not ſo eaſily be cheated with Satans falſe ware.</p>

                     </label> I anſwer, the weakneſſe of grace is in reſpect of ſtronger grace,   but that weak grace is ſtrong and mighty in compariſon of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit grace: Now I do not bid thee try the truth of thy grace by ſuch a power as is peculiar to ſtronger grace, but by that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which will diſtinguiſh it from falſe; true grace, when weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is ſtronger then falſe when ſtrongeſt. There is a principle of divine life in it, which the other hath not; Now life, as it gives excellency (a flea or fly by reaſon of its life is more excellent then the Sun in all its glory) ſo it gives ſtrength. The ſlow motion of a living man (though ſo feeble that he cannot go a furlong in a day) yet coming from life, imports more ſtrength then is in a ſhip, which (though it ſailes ſwiftly) hath its motion from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: Thus poſſibly an hypocrite may exceed the true Chriſtian in the bulk and out-ſide of a duty, yet becauſe his ſtrength is not from life, but from ſome winde and tide abroad that carries him, and the Chriſtians is from an inward principle, therefore the Chriſtians weakneſſe is ſtronger then the hypocrite in his greateſt enlargements. I ſhall name but two acts of grace when weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, whereby the Chriſtian exceeds the hypocrite in all his beſt array. You will ſay, then grace is at a weak ſtay indeed, when the Chriſtian is perſwaded to commit a ſin, a great ſin, ſuch a one as poſſibly a carnal perſon would not have it ſaid of him for a great matter, ſo low may the tide of grace fall, yet true grace at ſuch an ebbe will appear of greater ſtrength and force then the other.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, this principle of grace will never leave till the ſoule  weeps bitterly with <hi>Peter,</hi> that it hath offended ſo good a God. Speak, O ye hypocrites, can ye ſhew one tear that ever you ſhed in earneſt for a wrong done to God? Poſſibly ye may weep to ſee the bed of ſorrow which your ſins are making for you in hell, but ye never loved God ſo well, as to mourne for the injury ye have done the Name of God.

Thus we ſee an excellency of the Saints ſorrow above the hypocrites. The Chriſtian by his ſorrow ſhews himſelf a Conquerour of that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119001:45"/>
ſin, which even now overcame him, while the hypocrite by his pride ſhews himſelf a ſlave to a worſe luſt, then that he reſiſts. While the Chriſtian commits a ſin he hates it; whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loves it while he forbears it.</p>

Thus prays the gracious ſoul, that God would but ſpare him a little, and ſtrengthen him but once before he dies, that he may be avenged on his pride, unbelief, and thoſe ſins whereby he hath moſt diſhonoured his God; but a falſe heart is ſo far from ſtudying revenge, that he rather ſwells, like the ſea, againſt the Law which banks his luſt in, and is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with God who hath made ſin ſuch a leap, that he muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his ſoule if he will have it.</p>

hang together like links in a chain, ſtones in an arch, members in the body; prick one vein, and the blood of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may run out at that ſluce; neglect one duty, and no other will do us good. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter, in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. preſſeth the Chriſtian to a joynt endeavour, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the whole body of grace; indeed, that is health when the whole body thrives. <hi>Adde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to your faith vertue</hi>; Faith is the file-leading grace. Well, haſt thou faith, adde vertue: True, faith is of a working ſtirring nature; without good works it is dead or dying. <hi>Fides pingueſcit operibus, Luther.</hi> 'Tis kept in plight and heart by a holy life, as the fleſh which plaiſters over the frame of mans body, though it receives its heat from the vitals within, yet helps to preſerve the very life of thoſe vitals; thus good works and gracious actions have their life from faith, yet are neceſſary helps to preſerve the life of faith; thus we ſee ſometimes the childe nurſing the Parent that bare it, and therein performes but his duty. Thou art fruitful in good works, yet thou art not out of the devils ſhot, except thou addeſt <hi>to thy vertue knowledge.</hi> This is the candle without which faith cannot ſee to do its work. Art thou going to give an almes? if it be not <hi>oculata charitas,</hi> if charity hath not this eye of knowledge to direct when, how, what, and to whom thou art to give, thou mayeſt at once wrong God, the perſon thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt, and thy ſelf. Art thou humbling thy ſelfe for thy ſin? for want of knowledge in the tenour of the Goſpel, Satan may play upon thy ignorance, and either perſwade thee thou art not humbled enough, when, God knowes, thou art almoſt quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with thy teares, and even carried down by the impetuous torrent of thy ſorrow into deſpair, or elſe ſhewing thee thy blubber'd face, may flatter thee into a carnal confidence of thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. Perhaps thou ſeeſt the Name of God diſhonoured in the place where thou liveſt, and thy ſpirit is ſtirred within thee, (as <hi>Pauls</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi>) now if knowledge ſits not in the ſaddle to reine and bridle in thy zeal, thou wilt be ſoon carried over hedge and ditch, till thou falleſt into ſome precipice or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thy irregular acting. Neither is knowledge enough, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou beeſt arm'd with <hi>Temperance,</hi> which here (I conceive) is that grace, whereby the Chriſtian (as Maſter of his own houſe) ſo orders his affections (like ſervants to reaſon and faith,) that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119001:46"/>
they do not irregularly move, or inordinately laſh out into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of, cares for, or joy in the creature-comforts of this life, without which Satan will be too hard for thee. The Hiſtorian tells us, that in one of the famous battels between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> that which loſt the <hi>French</hi> the day was a ſhower of <hi>Engliſh</hi> arrowes, which did ſo gall their horſe, as put the whole army into diſorder, their horſe knowing no ranks, did tread down their own men: The affections are but as the horſe to the Rider, on which knowledge ſhould be mounted, if Satans barbed arrows light on them, ſo that thy deſires of the creature prove unruly, and juſtle with thy deſires of Chriſt, thy care to keepe thy credit or eſtate, put thy care to keep a good conſcience to diſorder, and thy carnal joy in wife and childe trample down, or get before thy joy in the Lord, judge on which ſide victory is like to fal. Well, ſuppoſe thou marcheſt provided thus far in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly array towards heaven, while thou art ſwimming in proſperity; moſt thou not alſo prepare for foule way and weather, I mean, an afflicted eſtate? Satan will line the hedges with a thouſand temptations, when thou comeſt into the narrow lanes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, where thou canſt not run from this ſort of temptation, as in the Champaigne of proſperity: Poſſibly, thou that didſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the ſnare of an alluring world, mayeſt be diſmounted by the ſame when it frownes; though temperance kept thee from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunk with the ſweet wines of thoſe pleaſures, yet for want of <hi>patience</hi> thou mayeſt be drunk with the wine of aſtoniſhment, which is in afflictions hand: therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to temperance adde patience</hi>; either poſſeſſe thy ſelf in patience, or elſe ſome raving devil of diſcontent will poſſeſſe thee. An impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſoule in affliction is a bedlam in chains, yea, too like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in his chaines, that rageth againſt God, while he is fettered by him. Well, haſt thou patience? an excellent grace indeed, but not enough; thou muſt be a pious man as well as a patient. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to patience? adde godlineſſe.</hi> There is an atheiſtical ſtupid patience, and there is a godly Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: Satan numbs the conſcience of the one, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he complains not that feels not; but the Spirit of Chriſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calmes the other, not by taking away the ſenſe of paine, but by overcoming it with the ſenſe of his love. Now godlineſſe comprehends the whole worſhip of God, inward and outward.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119001:47"/>
If thou beeſt never ſo exact in thy morals, and not a worſhipper of God, then thou art an Atheiſt. If thou doeſt worſhip God, and that devoutly, but not by Scripture-rule, thou art an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If according to the rule, but not in Spirit and truth, then thou art an hypocrite, and ſo falleſt into the devils mouth. Or if thou doeſt give God one piece of his worſhip, and denyeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſtill Satan comes to his market. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9 <hi>He that turneth back his eare from hearing the Law, his prayer is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord.</hi> Yet (Chriſtian) all thy Armour is not on. Thy godlineſſe indeed would ſuffice, wert thou to live in a world by thy ſelf, or hadſt nothing to do but immediate communion with God; But (Chriſtian) thou muſt not always dwell on this mount of immediate worſhip, and when thou deſcendeſt, thou haſt many brethren and ſervants to thy Father, who live with thee in the ſame family; and thou muſt comport thy ſelf becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or elſe thy Father will be angry. Firſt, thou haſt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, heires of the ſame promiſe with thee, therefore you muſt adde to godlineſſe <hi>brotherly kindneſſe.</hi> If Satan can ſet you at odds, he gives a deep wound to your godlineſſe. You will hardly joyne hearts in a duty, that cannot joyne hands in love. Secondly, there are not only brethren, but ſervants, a multitude of profane carnal ones, who though they never had the names of ſons and daughters, yet retain to Gods family, and thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will have thee walk unblameably, yea, winningly to thoſe that are without, which that thou mayeſt do, thou muſt adde to brotherly kindneſſe <hi>charity</hi>; by which grace thou ſhalt be willing to do good to the worſt of men; when they curſe thee, thou muſt pray for them, yea, pray for no leſſe then a Chriſt, a heaven for them. <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, while they were raking in his ſide for his heart-blood. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am perſwaded the want of this laſt piece of armour, hath given Satan great advantage in theſe our times. We are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid our charity ſhould be too broad, whereas in this ſenſe, if it be not as wide as the world, it is too ſtrait for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which bids us <hi>do good to all.</hi> May not we Miniſters be charged with the want of this? when the ſtraine of our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſolely directed to the Saints; and no paines taken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing poor captived ſoules, yet uncall'd, out of the devils clutches, who may hale them to hell without any diſturbance,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119001:47"/>
while we are comforting the Saints, and preaching their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; but in the mean time let the ignorant be ignorant ſtill, and the profane profane ſtill, for want of a compaſſionate cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to their ſoules, which would excite us to the reproving and exhorting of them, that they might alſo be brought in to the way of life, as well as the Saints encouraged, who are walking therein. We are ſtewards to provide bread for the Lords houſe; the greateſt part of our hearers cannot, muſt not have the childrens bread, and ſhall we therefore give them no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all? Chriſts charity pitied the multitude, to whom in his publike preaching he made ſpecial application, as in that famous Sermon, moſt part of which is ſpent in rowſing up the ſleepy conſciences of the hypocritical Phariſees, by thoſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclaps of woes and curſes, ſo often denounced againſt them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. Again, how great advantage hath Satan from the want of this charity in our families? Is it not obſerv'd, how little care is taken by profeſſing Governours of ſuch Societies, for the inſtructing their youth? Nay, 'tis a principle which ſome have drunk in, that 'tis not their duty. O where is their charity in the mean time, when they can ſee Satan come within their own walls, and let him drive a childe, a ſervant in their ignorance and profaneneſſe to hell, and not ſo much as ſally out upon this enemy by a word of reproof or inſtruction, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue theſe ſilly ſouls out of the murtherers hand? We muſt leave them to their liberty forſooth, and that is as faire play as we can give the devil; give but corrupt nature enough of this rope, and it will ſoon ſtrangle the very principles of God and Religion in their tender yeares.</p>

As the Chriſtian is to endeavour after every grace, ſo is he to preſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the advance and increaſe of every grace, even to perfection itſelf; as he is to adde to his faith vertue, ſo he is to adde faith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119001:48"/>
to faith; he is ever to be compleating of his grace. It is that which is frequently preſt upon believers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. And purifie your ſelves, as God is pure.</hi> Where we have an exact copy ſet, not as if we could equallize that purity and perfection which is in God, but to make us ſtrive the more, when we ſhall ſee how infinitely ſhort we fall of our copy, when we write the faireſt hand. So <hi>James</hi> 1.3. <hi>Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting nothing,</hi> or wanting in nothing. Thou who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt a hard ſhift to carry a little burden with thy little patience, wouldeſt ſink under a greater, therefore there is need that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould be ever perfecting, leſt at laſt we meet a burden too heavy for our weak ſhoulders. Take a few reaſons why the Chriſtian ſhould thus be compleating of his grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, becauſe grace is ſubject to decayes, and therefore ever needs compleating, as in an army eſpecially which often enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in battel, their armes are batter'd and broken, one man hath his helmet bent, another his ſword gap't, a third his piſtol unfix't; and therefore recruits are ever neceſſary. In one temptation the Chriſtian hath his helmet of hope beaten off his head, in another his patience hard put to it. The Chriſtian had need have an Armourers ſhop at hand to make up his loſſe, and that ſpeedily, for Satan is moſt like to fall on, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is leaſt prepared to receive his charge; <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired to ſift you</hi>; he knew they were at that time weakly provided, (Chriſt their Captain now to be taken from the head of their troop, diſcontents among themſelves, ſtriving who ſhould be greateſt, and their recruits of ſtronger grace, which the Spirit was to bring, not yet come.) Now he hath a deſign to ſurpriſe them: and therefore Chriſt carefully to prevent him, promiſeth ſpeedily to diſpatch his Spirit for their ſupply, and in the mean time ſends them to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſtand as it were in a body in their joynt ſupplications,<note place="margin">Acts 1.4.</note> upon their guard, while he comes to their relief, ſhewing us in the weakneſſe of our graces what to do, and whither to go for ſupply.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, becauſe Satan is compleating his skill and wrath. 'Tis not for nought that he is call'd the old Serpent, ſubtil by nature, but more by experience; wrathful by nature, yet every day more and more enraged; like a bull, the longer he is bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119001:48"/>
the more fury he ſhewes. And therefore we who are to grapple with him, now his time is ſo ſhort, had need come well appointed into the field.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it is the end of all Gods diſpenſations, to compleat his  Saints in their graces and comforts. Wherefore doth he lop and prune by afflictions, but to <hi>purge,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.2. Rom. 5.3</note> 
                        <hi>that they may bring forth more fruit</hi> (that is, fuller and fairer?) <hi>Tribulation works patience</hi>; 'Tis Gods appointment for that end: <hi>It works,</hi> that is, it encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Saints patience, it enrageth indeed the wicked, but meekens the Saints. 'Tis his deſign in the Goſpel preached to carry on his Saints, <hi>from faith to faith, Rom.</hi> 1.17. And accordingly he hath furniſhed his Church with inſtruments, and thoſe with gifts, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the body of Christ,</hi> Eph. 4.14. Wherefore doth the Scaffold ſtand, and the Workman on it, if the building go not up? For us not to advance under ſuch means, is to make void the counſel of God: Therefore the Apoſtle blames the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Jewes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. for their non-proficiency in the School of Chriſt. <hi>When for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again, which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O how few are there who endeavour thus to promove in their ſpiritual ſtate,<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and labour to perfect what is yet lacking in their knowledge, patience, and the reſt. Firſt, tell ſome of adding faith to faith, one degree of grace to another, and you ſhall finde they have more minde to joyne houſe to houſe, and lay field to field; their ſouls are athirſt, ever gaping for more, but of what? not of Chriſt, or Heaven: It is earth, earth they never think they have enough of, till death comes and ſtops their mouth with a ſhovel-full, digg'd out of their own grave. What a tormenting life muſt they needs have, who are alwayes crying for more weight, and yet cannot preſſe their covetous deſires to death? O Sirs, the only way, (if men would beleeve it) to quench this thirſt to the creature, were to enkindle another after Chriſt and Heaven. Get but a large heart vehemently thirſting after theſe, and the other will die alone. As the Fevouriſh thirſt doth when nature comes to her temper. Secondly, others labour not thus to perfect grace, becauſe they have a conceit they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect already, and upon this fancy throw away praying, hearing,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119001:49"/>
and all other Ordinances, as ſtrings for thoſe babes in grace, to be carried by, who are not arrived to their high attainments. O what fooles does pride make men! Truly Heaven were no ſuch deſirable place, if we ſhould be no more perfect, then, thus a ſort of people that are too high for this world, and too low for another. The way by which God cures this phrenſie of pride, we have in theſe days ſeen to be ſomething like that of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> To give them a heart of a beaſt, (I mean) for a time, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to fall into beaſtly practices, by which he ſhewes them how far they are from that perfection they dreamed of ſo vainly. Thirdly, others who have true grace, and deſire the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, yet are diſcouraged in their endeavour for more, from too deep a ſenſe of their preſent penury. Bid ſome ſuch labour to get more power of corruption, more faith on, and love to God, that they may be able to do the Will of God chearfully, and ſuffer it in the greateſt afflictions patiently, yea, thankfully; and they will never believe, that they whoſe faith is ſo weak, love ſo chill, and ſtock ſo little in hand, ſhould ever attain to any thing like ſuch a pitch: You may as well perſwade a beggar with one poor penny in his purſe, that if he will go and trade with that, he ſhall come to be Lord <hi>Major</hi> of <hi>London</hi> before he die: But why, poor hearts, ſhould you thus deſpiſe the day of ſmall things? Do you not ſee a little grain of muſtard ſeed ſpread into a tree, and weak grace compar'd to it for its growth at laſt as well as littleneſſe at firſt? Dareſt thou ſay thou haſt no grace at all? If thou haſt but any, (though the leaſt that ever any had to begin with) I dare tell thee, that he hath done more for thee in that, then he ſhould in making that which is now ſo weak, as perfect as the Saints grace is now in heaven. Firſt, he hath done more, conſidering it as an act of Power. There is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gulfe between no grace &amp; grace, then between weak grace and ſtrong, between a <hi>Chaos</hi> and nothing, then between a <hi>Chaos</hi> and this beautiful frame of heaven and earth. The firſt days work of both Creations is the greateſt. Secondly, conſider it as an act of grace, it is greater mercy to give the firſt grace of converſion, then to crown that with glory. It is more grace and condeſcent in a Prince to marry a poor Damoſel, then having married her to cloth her like a Prince; he was free to do the firſt or not, but his relation to her pleads ſtrongly for the other. God might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119001:49"/>
have choſe whether he would have given thee grace or no, but having done this, thy relation to him and his Covenant alſo do oblige him, to adde more and more till he hath fitted thee as a Bride for himſelf in glory.</p>

Thoſe military duties and field-graces, (as I may call faith, hope, and the reſt) they ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably diſcharged. In heaven we ſhall appear, not in armour, but in robes of glory; but here they are to be worne night and day: we muſt walk, work, and ſleep in them, or elſe we are not true ſouldiers of Chriſt: this <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth to endeavour, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16 <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence towards God and towards man.</hi> Here we have this holy man at his armes, training and exerciſing himſelf

in his poſtures, like ſome ſouldier by himſelf handling his pike, and inuring himſelf before the battel. Now the Reaſon of this is,</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Chriſt commands us to have our Armour on, our grace in exerciſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. <hi>Let your loines be girded about, and your lights burning.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks, either in a martial phraſe as to ſouldiers, or in a domeſtick as to ſervants: If as to ſouldiers, then let your loynes he girded, and your lights burning, is, that we ſhould be ready for a march, having our armour on, (for the belt goes over all,) and our match light, ready to give fire at the firſt alarm of a temptation. If as to ſervants, which ſeems more natural, then he bids us (as our Maſter that is gone abroad) not through ſloth or ſleep put off our clothes, and put out our lights, but ſtand ready to open when he ſhall come, though at midnight. 'Tis not fit the Maſter ſhould ſtand at the door knocking, and the ſervant within ſleeping; indeed there is no duty the Chriſtian hath in charge, but implies this daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe;<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.16, 17. 1 Pet. 1.13</note> 
                        <hi>Pray,</hi> but how? <hi>without ceaſing: Rejoyce,</hi> but when? <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: Give thanks,</hi> for what? <hi>in every thing.</hi> The ſhield of faith, and helmet of hope, we muſt hold them to the end. The ſumme of all which is, that we ſhould walk in the conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of theſe duties and graces. Where the ſouldier is plac't, there he ſtands, and muſt neither ſtir nor ſleep, till he be brought off. When Chriſt comes, that ſoule ſhall only have his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, whom <hi>he findes ſo doing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Satans advantage is great when grace is not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. When the devil found Chriſt ſo ready to receive his charge, and repel his temptation, he ſoon had enough, it is ſaid, <hi>He departed for a ſeaſon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 4.13</note> as if in his ſhameful retreat he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelf with hopes of ſurpriſing Chriſt unawares, at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſeaſon more advantagious to his deſigne; and we finde him coming again, in the moſt likely time indeed to have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his end, had his enemy been man, and not God. Now if this bold fiend did thus watch and obſerve Chriſt from time to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119001:50"/>
time, doth it not behove thee to look about thee, leſt he take thy grace at one time or other napping? what he miſſeth now by thy watchfulneſſe, he may gain anon by thy negligence. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hopes thou wilt be tired out with continual duty: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaith Satan, (when he ſees the Chriſtian up, and ſervent in duty) this will not hold long. When he findes him tender of conſcience, and ſcrupulous of occaſions to ſin, This is but for a while, ere long I ſhall have him unbend his bowe, and unbuckle his armour, and then have at him. Satan knows what orders thou keepeſt in thy houſe and cloſet, and though he hath not a key to thy heart, yet he can ſtand in the next room to it, and lightly hear what is whiſpered there: He hunts the Chriſtian by the ſent of his own feet, and if once he doth but ſmell which way thy heart enclines, he knows how to take the him; if but one door be unbolted, one work unmann'd, one grace of its car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage here is advantage enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, becauſe it is ſo awky a buſineſſe, and hard a work, to  recover the activity of grace once loſt, and to revive a duty in diſuſe: <hi>I have put off my coat,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3. She had given way to a lazy diſtemper, was laid upon her bed of ſloth, and how hard is it to raiſe her? her beloved is at the door, beſeeching her by all the names of love, which might bring to her remembrance the near relation between them: <hi>My Siſter, my Love, my Dove, open to me,</hi> and yet ſhe riſeth not; he tells her, <hi>his locks are filled with the drops of the night</hi>; yet ſhe ſtirs not. What is the matter? her coat was off, and ſhe is loath to put it on; ſhe had given way to her ſloth, and now ſhe knows not how to ſhake it off, ſhe could have been glad to have her Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veds company, if himſelf would have opened the door; and he deſired as much hers, if ſhe would riſe to let him in; and upon theſe termes they part. The longer a ſoule hath neglected duty, the more ado there is to get it taken up: partly through ſhame, the ſoul having played the truant, now knows not how to look God on the face; and partly from the difficulty of the work, being double to what another findes, that walks in the exerciſe of his grace; here is all out of order. It requires more time and pains for him to tune his inſtrument, then for another to play the leſſon. He goes to duty as to a new work, as a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that hath not look't on his book ſome while, his leſſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119001:51"/>
out of his head, whereas another that was but even now conning it over, hath it <hi>ad unguem.</hi> Perhaps 'tis an affliction thou art called to bear, and thy patience unexerciſed, little or no thoughts thou haſt had for ſuch a time; (while thou wert frisking in a full paſture) and now thou kickeſt and flingeſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even <hi>as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> Jer. 31.18. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as another goes meekly and patiently under the like croſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been ſtirring up his patience, and fitting the yoke to his neck. You know what a confuſion there is in a town, at ſome ſudden alarm in the dead of the night, the enemie at the gates, and they aſleep within, O what a cry is there heard! one wants his clothes, another his ſword, a third knows not what to do for powder; thus in a fright they run up and down, which would not be, if the enemie did finde them upon their guard, orderly waiting for his approath; Such a hubbub there is in a ſoule that keeps not his armour on, this piece and that will be to ſeek when he ſhould uſe it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we muſt keep grace in exerciſe in reſpect of others our fellow-ſouldiers. <hi>Paul</hi> had this in his eye when he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing himſelf to keep a good conſcience, that he might not be a ſcandal to others. The Cowardiſe of one may make others run; the ignorance of one ſouldier that hath not skill to handle his armes, may do miſchief to his fellow-ſouldiers about him; ſome have ſhot their friends for their enemies; the unwiſe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one Profeſſor makes many other faire the worſe. But ſay, thou doeſt not fall ſo far as to become a ſcandal, yet thou canſt not be ſo helpful to thy fellow-brethren as thou ſhouldeſt; God commanded the <hi>Reubenites and Gadites</hi> to go before their brethren ready armed, until the land was conquered: Thus, Chriſtian, thou art to be helpful to thy fellow-brethren, who have not (it may be) that ſettlement of Peace in their ſpirit as thy ſelf, not that meaſure of grace or comfort; Thou art to help ſuch weak ones, and go before them (as it were) arm'd for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; now if thy grace be not exerciſed, thou art ſo far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to thy weak brother. Perhaps thou art a Maſter or a Parent who haſt a family under thy wing, they fare as thou thriveſt; if thy heart be in a holy frame they fare the better in the duties thou performeſt, if thy heart be dead and down, they are loſers by the hand. So that as the Nurſe eats the more
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119001:51"/>
for the Babes ſake ſhe ſuckles, ſo ſhouldeſt thou for their ſake, who are under thy tuition, be more careful to exerciſe thy own grace, and cheriſh it.</p>

When any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion diverts him from communion with God, though he likes it never ſo well, yet it is unwelcome and unpleaſing to him, as you who are uſed to be in your ſhops from morning to night, how tedious is it for you to be abroad ſome days, though among good friends, becauſe you are not where your work and calling lies? A Chriſtian in duty is one in his calling, as it were in his ſhop where he ſhould be; yea, where he would be, and therefore far from being tedious. Religion is burdenſom to none, as to thoſe who are infrequent in the exerciſe of it. Uſe makes heavy things light, we hardly feel the weight of our clothes, becauſe fitted to us, and worne daily by us, whereas the ſame weight on our ſhoulder would trouble us: thus the grievouſneſſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties to carnal ones, is taken away in the Saints, partly by the fitneſſe of them to the Saints principles, as alſo by their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe in them. The diſciples, when newly entered into the wayes of Chriſt, could not pray much or faſt long; the bottles
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119001:52"/>
were new, and that wine too ſtrong, but by that time they had walk't a few yeares, they grew mighty in both; doeſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that heaven-way is rugged? be the oftner walking in it, and that will make it ſmooth.</p>

Wouldeſt thou know whether thou loveſt God? be frequent in exerting acts of love; the more the fire is blown up, the ſooner 'tis ſeen, and ſo of all other graces. Sometimes the ſoule is queſtioning whether it hath any patience, any faith; till God comes and puts him into an afflicted eſtate, (where he muſt either exerciſe this grace or periſh) and then it appeares like one that thinks he cannot ſwim, yet being thrown into the river, then uniting all his ſtrength he makes a ſhift to ſwim to land, and ſees what he can do. How oft have we heard Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſay, I thought I could never have endured ſuch a pain, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in ſuch a ſtrait, but now God hath taught me what he can do for me, what he hath wrought in me? and this thou

The firſt cry of the new creature, gives all the legions of hell an alarm; they are as much troubled at it, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were, when Chriſt was borne; and now they ſit in Councel to take away the life of this new born King. The Apoſtles met with more oppoſition and perſecution in their latter dayes, when endued with larger portions of the Spirit, but with temptations from Satan in their former when young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; as you may obſerve in the ſeveral paſſages recorded of them.

both from its own weakneſſe, and the ſtrength of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary corruption, (which commonly in ſuch is much unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) which makes it act with more difficulty and mixture, as in a fire newly kindled where the ſmoke is more then the flame, or like beer newly tunn'd which runs thick; ſo that though there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more ſtrength of affection in ſuch, that it works over into a greater abundance of duty then in others, yet with more dregs of carnal paſſions, which Satan knows, and therefore chooſeth to ſtir what he ſees troubled already.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when the Saint is beſet with ſome great affliction, This is as ſome blinde lane or ſolitary place, fit for this thief to call for his purſe in. An expert Captain firſt labours to make a breach in the wall, and then falls on inſtorming the City. Satan firſt got power from God to weaken <hi>Job</hi> in his eſtate, children, health and other comforts he had, and now tempts him to impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and what not? he lets Chriſt faſt fourty dayes before he comes, and then he falls to his work; as an army ſtayes till a Caſtle be pinch't for proviſion within, and then ſends a parley, never more likely to be embraced then in ſuch a ſtrait. A temptation comes ſtrong when the way to relief ſeems to lie through the ſin that Satan is wooing to; when one is poor and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan comes, What wilt ſtarve rather then ſtep over the hedge and ſteal for thy ſupply? this is enough to put fleſh and blood to the ſtand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when the Chriſtian is about ſome notable enterprize  for Gods glory, then Satan will lie like a Serpent in the way, <hi>an Adder in the path, that biteth his horſe-heels, ſo that his Rider ſhall fall backward.</hi> Thus he ſtood at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s right hand <hi>to reſiſt him.</hi> The right hand is the working hand, and his ſtanding there implies his deſire to hinder him in his enterprize. Indeed the devil was never friend to Temple-work, and therefore that work is ſo long a doing. What a handſom excuſe doth he help the Jews unto, <hi>The time is not come</hi>: Gods time was come,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.2, 6, 8.</note> but not the devils, and therefore he helps them to this poor ſhift, perverting the ſenſe of Providence as if it were not time, becauſe they were ſo poor, whereas they thrive no better becauſe they went no ſooner about the work, as God tells them plainly. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had a holy deſign in their thoughts, to go viſit the brethren in every City, and ſtrengthen their faith; the devil
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119001:58"/>
knew what a blow this might give to his Kingdome, their viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might hinder him in his Circuit, and he ſtirs up an unhappy difference between theſe two holy men, who grow ſo hot that they part in this ſtorme, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.30. There were two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable periods of Chriſts life, his <hi>Intrat</hi> and <hi>Exit,</hi> his entrance into his publick Miniſtery at his Baptiſme, and his finiſhing it at his paſſion, and at both we have the devil fiercely encountring him. The more publick thy place, Chriſtian, and the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent thy ſervice for God, the more thou muſt look that the devil will have ſome more dangerous deſign or other againſt thee, and therefore if every private ſouldier needs armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satans bullets of temptation, then the Commanders and Officers, who ſtand in the front of the battel, much more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, when he hath the preſence of ſome object to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his temptation. Thus he takes <hi>Eve</hi> when ſhe is near the tree, and had it in her eye while he ſhould make the motion, that aſſaulting two Ports at once, it might be the harder for her to hinder the landing of his temptation; and if <hi>Eves</hi> eye did ſo ſoon affect her heart with an inordinate deſire, then much more now is it eaſie for him by the preſence of the object, to excite and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate that luſt which lies dormant in the heart. As <hi>Naomi</hi> ſent her daughter to lie at <hi>Boaz</hi> his feet, knowing well, if he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her there, there were hope he might take her into his bed at laſt; If the Chriſtian can let the object come ſo near, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will promiſe himſelf his ſuit may in time be granted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould be our care if we would not yield to the ſin, not to walk by, or ſit at the door of the occaſion; Look not on that beauty with a wandring eye, by which thou wouldeſt not be taken Priſoner; parley not with that in thy thoughts, which thou meaneſt not to let into thy heart; converſation begets af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: ſome by this have been brought to marry thoſe, whom at firſt they thought they could not have liked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, after great manifeſtations of Gods love, then the Tempter comes. Such is the weak conſtitution of grace, that it can neither well bear ſmiles or frowns from God without a ſnare: As one ſaid of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, <hi>Totam nec pati poteſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem nec ſervitutem</hi>; It cannot well bear liberty nor bondage in the height: So neither can the ſoule, if God ſmile and opens

                     </gap>ke ſharp froſts, nip and even kill the flowers of grace; the Chriſtian is in danger on both hands, therefore Satan takes this advantage, when the Chriſtian is fluſh of comfort, even as a cheater, who ſtrikes in with ſome young heire, when he hath newly received his rents, and never leaves till he hath eaſed him of his money: thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan lies upon the catch, then to inveigle a Saint into one ſin or other, which he knows will ſoon leak out his joy. Had ever any a larger teſtimony from Heaven then <hi>Peter? Matth.</hi> 16.17. where Chriſt pronounceth him bleſſed, and puts a ſingular ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon him, making him the Repreſentative for all his Saints. No doubt this favour to <hi>Peter,</hi> ſtirred up the envious ſpirit the ſooner to fall upon him. If <hi>Joſephs</hi> party-coloured coat made the Patriarchs to plot againſt him their brother, no wonder malice ſhould prompt Satan to ſhew his ſpite, where Chriſt had ſet ſuch a mark of love and honour; and therefore we finde him ſoon at <hi>Peters</hi> elbowe, making him his inſtrument to tempt his Maſter, who ſoon eſpied his cloven foot, and rebukes <hi>Peter</hi> with a <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan.</hi> He that ſeem'd a Rock even now, through Satans policy, is laid as a ſtone of offence for Chriſt to ſtumble at. So <hi>David,</hi> when he had received ſuch wonderful mercies, ſetled in his throne with the ruine of his enemies, yea, pardoned for his bloody ſin, now ready to lay down his head with peace in the duſt: Satan chops in to cloud his clear evening, and tempts him to number the people; ſo ambitious is Satan, then chiefly to throw the Saint into the mire of ſin, when his coat is cleaneſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, at the houre of death, when the Saint is down and  proſtrate in his bodily ſtrength, now this coward falls upon him: 'tis the laſt caſt indeed he hath for the game, now or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, overcome him now and ever; as they ſay of the natural ſerpent, <hi>Nunquam niſi moriens producitur in longum</hi>: he never is ſeen at his length till dying: ſo this myſtical ſerpent never ſtrains his wits and wiles more, then when his time is thus ſhort. The Saint is even ſtepping into eternity, and now he treads upon his heele, which if he cannot trip up ſo as to hinder his arrival in

                  <p>Firſt, he hangs out falſe colours, and comes up to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the diſguiſe of a friend, ſo that the gates are opened to him, and his motions received with applauſe, before either be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; therfore he is ſaid to <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. Of all plots 'tis moſt dangerous when he appears in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle, and ſilvers his foul tongue with faire language. Thus in point of errour, he corrupts ſome in their judgements, by commending his notions for precious Goſpel-truths, and like a cunning Chapman puts off his old ware, (errours I mean that have layen long upon his hand) only turkening them a little after the mode of the times, and they go for new light, under the skirt of Chriſtian liberty; he conveys in Libertiniſme, by crying up the Spirit; he decries and vilifies the Scripture by magnifying faith: he labours to undermine repentance, and blow up good works; by bewailing the corruption of the Church in its adminiſtrations, he drawes unſtable ſouls from it, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſeth them, till at laſt they fall into a <hi>vertigo,</hi> and can ſee no Church at all in being. And he prevails no leſſe on the hearts and lives of men by this wile, then on their judgements. Under the notion of zeal, he kindles ſometimes a dangerous flame of paſſion and wrath in the heart, which like a raſh fire makes the Chriſtians ſpirit boile over into unchriſtian deſires of, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond policie he uſeth is to get intelligence of the Saints af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. This is one great wheele in the Politicians clock, to have Spies in all places, by whom they are acquainted with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and motions of their enemies, and this gives them advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as to diſappoint their deſignes, ſo more ſafely to compaſſe their own. 'Tis no hard matter for him to play his game well, that ſees his enemies hand. <hi>David</hi> knew how the ſquares went at Court, <hi>Jonathans</hi> arrowes carried him the newes, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he removed his quarters, and was too hard for his great enemy <hi>Saul.</hi> Satan is the greateſt Intelligencer in the world, he makes it his buſineſſe to enquire into the inclinations, thoughts, affections, purpoſes of the creature, that finding which humour abounds, he may apply himſelf accordingly, which way the ſtream goes, that he may open the paſſage of temptation, and cut the channel to the fall of the creatures affections, and not force it againſt the torrent of nature. Now if we conſider but the piercing apprehenſion of the Angelical nature, how quick he is to take the ſent which way the game goes by a word drop't, the caſt of an eye or ſuch a ſmall matter (ſignal enough to give him the alarm) his experience in heart-anatomy, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and (as it were) diſſected ſo many in his long practice, whereby his knowledge is much perfected, as alſo his great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to adde to both theſe, being as cloſe a Student as ever,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119001:60"/>
conſidering the Saints, and ſtudying how he may do them a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as we ſee in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, whom he had ſo obſerved that he was able to give an anſwer <hi>ex tempore</hi> to God what <hi>Jobs</hi> ſtate and preſent poſture was, and what might be the moſt probable means of obtaining his will of him; and beſides all this, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence that he hath with thoſe in and about the Chriſtian, from whom he learnes much of his ſtate, as <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Huſhai</hi> in <hi>Abſaloms</hi> counſel: all theſe conſidered, 'tis almoſt impoſſible for the creature to ſtir out of the cloſet of his heart, but it will be known whither he enclines; ſome corrupt paſſion or other will bewray the ſoule to him, as they did <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> who told him where he might finde him,<note place="margin">1 Sam 24 1.</note> 
                     <hi>in the wilderneſſe of Engedi.</hi> Thus will theſe give intelligence to Satan, and ſay, If thou wouldeſt ſurprize ſuch a one, he is gone that way, you ſhall have him in the wood of worldly employments, over head and eares in the deſires and cares of this life, ſee where another ſits under ſuch a bower, delighting himſelf in this childe, or that gift, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of mind, or the like; lay but the lime-twig there, and you ſhall ſoon have him in it. Now Satan having this intelligence, lets him alone to act his part; he ſure cannot be at a loſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when his ſcholars, (the Jeſuites I mean) have ſuch agility of minde, to wreath and caſt themſelves into any forme becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons they would ſeduce. Is ambition the luſt the heart favours? O the pleaſing projects that he will put ſuch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! how eaſily having firſt blown them up with vain hopes, doth he draw them into horrid ſins? Thus <hi>Human,</hi> that he may have a monopoly of his Princes favour, is hurried into that bloody plot (fatal at laſt to himſelf) againſt the Jewes. Is uncleanneſſe the luſt after which the creatures eye wanders? Now he'll be the Pander, to bring him and his Minion together. Thus he finding <hi>Amnon</hi> ſick of this diſeaſe, ſends <hi>Jonadah a deep-pated fellow,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in his gradual approaches to the ſoul. When he comes to tempt, he is modeſt &amp; asks but a little, he knows he may get that at many times, which he ſhould be denied if lie ask't all at once. A few are let into a city, when an army coming in a body, would be ſhut out, and therefore that he may beget no ſuſpition, he preſents may be a few general propoſitions, which do not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119001:60"/>
the depth of his plot; theſe like Scouts goe before, while his whole body lies hid as it were in ſome ſwamp at hand. Thus he wrigled into <hi>Eves</hi> boſome, whom he doth not at firſt daſh bid Take and eat, no, he is more mannerly then ſo, this would have been ſo hideous, that as the fiſh with ſome ſudden noiſe, by a ſtone caſt into the river, is ſcared from the bait, ſo would ſhe have been affrighted from holding parley with ſuch a one: no, he propounds a queſtion which ſhall make way for this, <hi>Hath God ſaid?</hi> art not miſtaken? could this be his meaning whoſe bounty lets thee eat of the reſt to deny thee the beſt of all? Thus he digs about and looſens the roots of her faith, and then the tree falls the eaſier the next guſt of tempta<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion. This is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous policy indeed. Many have yielded to go a mile with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that never intended to go two; but when once on the way, have been allured further and further, till at laſt they know not how to leave his company. Thus Satan leads poor creatures down into the depths of ſin by winding ſtaires, that let them not ſee the bottom whither they are going; Firſt he preſents an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ocaſions ſome thoughts, theſe ſet fire on the affections, and theſe fume up into the braine, and cloud the underſtanding, which being thus diſabled, now Satan dares a little more declare himſelf, and boldly ſolicite the creature to that it would even now have defied. Many who at this day lie in open profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, never thought they ſhould have roll'd ſo far from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion but Satan beguiled them, poor ſouls, with their modeſt beginnings. O Chriſtians, give not place to Satan, no not an inch in his firſt motions; he that is a beggar and a modeſt one without doors, will command the houſe if let in; yield at firſt, and thou giveſt away thy ſtrength to reſiſt him in the reſt, when the hem is worne, the whole garment will ravel out, if that be not mended by timely repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth way, wherein Satan ſhews his ſubtilty in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging  his temptations, is in his Reſerves. A wiſe Captain hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome freſh troops at hand to fall in at a pinch, when other are worſted. Satan is ſeldom at a loſſe in this reſpect, when one temptation is beat back, he ſoon hath another to fill up the gap, and make good the line. Thus he tempts Chriſt to diffidence and diſtruſt, by bidding him turne ſtones into bread, as if it were time now to carve for himſelf, being ſo long neglected of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119001:61"/>
as to faſt fourty dayes, and no ſupplies heard of; No ſooner had Chriſt quench't this dart with that, <hi>It is written, Man ſhall not live by bread alone,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 4 4, 5</note> 
                     <hi>but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> but he hath another on the ſtring which he let flie at him, tempting him to preſumption, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil taketh and ſets him on a pinacle,</hi> and bids, <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down headlong, for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If thou haſt ſuch confidence on God and his Word, as thou pretendeſt, ſhew it by caſting thy ſelf down, for thou haſt a Word between thee and the ground, if thou dareſt truſt God; and truly, though Chriſt had his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ready, and was prepared to receive his charge on the right hand and on the left, being ſo compleatly arm'd that no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation could come amiſſe, yet note we, Satans temptations on Chriſt, were like the Serpents motion on a rock, (of which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks) that makes no impreſſion, no dint at all, but on us they are as a Serpent on ſand or duſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 30.19</note> that leaves a print, when not in the heart, yet in the fancy, colours that which is next door to it, and ſo the object there is ready to ſlip in, if great care be not obſerv'd, eſpecially when he doth thus change his hand, as when we have reſiſted one way, fall on afreſh another, yea, plant his ſucceeding temptation upon our very reſiſtance in the former. Now it requires ſome readineſſe in our poſtures, and skill at all our weapons to make our defence, like a diſputant, when he is put out of his road, and hath a new queſtion ſtarted, or argument unuſual brought, now he is tried to purpoſe. And truly this is Satans way when he tempts the Chriſtian to neglect of duties of Gods worſhip (from his worldly occaſions, the multitude of them or neceſſity of following them) and this takes not, then he is on the other ſide, and is drawing the Chriſtian to the neglect of his worldly calling, out of a ſeeming zeale to promote his other in the Worſhip of God. Or firſt, he comes and labours to dead the heart in duty, but the Chriſtian too watchful for him there, then he is puffing of him up with an opinion of his enlargement in it, and ever he keeps his ſlieſt and moſt ſublimated temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the laſt.</p>

Satan is not alwayes beat back by the dint and power of conquering grace, but ſometimes he drawes off, and raiſeth his own ſiege, the more handſomely to get the Chriſtian out of his faſtneſſes and trenches, that ſo he may ſnap him on the plaines, whom he cannot come at in his works and Fortifications. Temptations ſend the Saint to his Caſtle, as the ſight of the dog doth the coney to her Burrough; Now the ſoule walks the rounds, ſtands upon its guard, dares not neglect duty, becauſe the enemy is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its very walls, ſhooting in his temptations continually; but when Satan ſeems to give the ſoule over, and the Chriſtian finds he is not haunted with ſuch motions as formerly, truly now he is prone to remit in his diligence, faile in his duty, and grow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infrequent or formal therein; As the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour decayed for want of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> troops to alarm them; let Satan tempt or not tempt, aſſault or retreat, keep thou in order, ſtand in a fighting poſture, let his flight ſtrengthen thy faith, but not weaken thy care.

Satan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders who can do his work to his greateſt advantage; and in this he is unlike God, who is not at all choice in his inſtruments, becauſe he needs none, and is able to do as well with one as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but Satans power being finite, he muſt patch up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Lions skin with the Foxes. Now the perſons Satan aimes at for his inſtruments are chiefly of foure ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, perſons of place and power. Secondly, perſons of parts and policie. Thirdly, perſons of holineſſe, or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſo. Fourthly, perſons of relation and intereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Satan makes choice of perſons of place and power. Theſe are either in the Common-wealth or Church, if he can he will ſecure the Throne and the Pulpit, as the two Forts that command the whole line. Firſt, men of power in the Common-wealth, 'tis his old trick to be tampering with ſuch. A Prince, a Ruler may ſtand for a thouſand; therefore ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> when he would have turned the Deputy from the faith; <hi>O full of all ſubtilty, thou child of the devil!

A wicked cauſe needs a ſmooth Oratour, bad ware a pleaſing Chapman, as in particular, his inſtruments he uſeth to ſeduce and corrupt the mindes of men are commonly ſubtile-pated men, ſuch, <hi>that if it were poſſible ſhould deceive the very elect.</hi> This made the Apoſtle ſo jealous of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom he had eſpouſed to Chriſt, leſt as <hi>Eve</hi> by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> ſo their <hi>minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> He muſt be a cunning devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that can draw off the Spouſes love from her beloved, yet there is ſuch a witchery in Satans inſtruments, that many have been brought to flie on the face of thoſe truths and ordinances, yea, Chriſt himſelf to whom they have ſeemed eſpouſed formerly. Now in three particulars this ſort of Satans inſtruments ſhew their Maſters ſubtilty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in aſperſing the good name of the ſincere meſſengers of Chriſt. Satans old trick to raiſe his credit upon the ruined reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts faithful ſervants. Thus he taught <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> to charge <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congregation is holy</hi>; they would make the people believe, that it was the pride of their heart, to claim a monopoly to themſelves,<note place="margin">Numb. 16 3, 19</note> as if none but <hi>Aaron</hi> and his fraternity were holy enough to offer incenſe, and by this ſubtile practice they ſeduced (for a while) in a manner, the whole Congregation to their ſide. So the lying Prophets (that were Satans Knights of the poſt to <hi>Ahab,</hi>) fell foul on good <hi>Micaiah.</hi> Our Saviour himſelf was no better handled by the Phariſees and their Confederates, and <hi>Paul</hi> the chief of the Apoſtles, his Miniſtery undermined, and his reputation blaſted by falſe teachers, as if he had been ſome weak ſorry Preacher,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.10.</note> 
                     <hi>His bodily preſence is weak,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and his ſpeech contemptible</hi>; and is this your admired man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in covering their impoſtures and errours with choice notions and excellent truthes. <hi>Arrius</hi> himſelf, and other dangerous inſtruments of Satan were too wiſe to ſtuffe their diſcourſes with nothing but heterodoxe matter, precious truths dropt from them with which they ſprinkled their corrupt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet with ſuch Art as ſhould not eaſily be diſcerned. This (as one obſervs) our Saviour warns his diſciples of, when he bids them <hi>beware of the leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> (that is, of their errours.) But why leaven? for the ſecret mixture of it with the wholeſom
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119001:63"/>
bread; you do not make your bread all of leaven, none would then eate it, but crumble a little into a whole batch, which ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers all: thus Chriſt doth tell the diſciples, that the Phariſees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many truths mixe their errours, and therefore it behoves them to beware, leſt with the truth the errour goes down alſo. Again, leaven is very like the dough, of the ſame grain with it, only differs in age and ſoureneſſe: thus Chriſt intimates the reſemblance of their errours to the truth, ſcraped, as it were, out of the Scriptures, but ſowered with their own falſe gloſſes. This indeed makes it eaſie for Chriſts ſheep to be infected with the ſcab of errour, becauſe that weed which breeds the rot is ſo like the graſſe that nouriſheth them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, their ſubtilty appears in holding forth ſuch principles  as are indulgent to the fleſh. This brings in whole ſhoales of ſilly ſoules into their net, the heart of man loves of life to ſhape a Religion according to its own humour, and is eaſie to believe that to be a truth, which favours its own inclination. Now there are three luſts that Satans inſtruments labour to gratifie in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Carnal Reaſon, Pride, and ſteſhly Liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Carnal reaſon, this is the great idol which the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent  part of the world worſhip, making it the very ſtandard of their faith, and from this bitter root have ſprung thoſe Arrian and Socinian hereſies. And truly he that will go no further then reaſon will carry him, may hold out in the plain way of the Moral Law, but when he comes to the depths of the Goſpel, muſt either go back, or be content that faith ſhould help reaſon over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, another luſt that Satan cockers, is pride. Man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally  would be a god to himſelf, [though for clambering ſo high he got his fall] and whatever doctrine nouriſheth a good opinion of man in his own eye, this is acceptable to him, and this hath ſpawned another fry of dangerous errours. The Pelagian and ſemi-Pelagian, which ſet nature upon its own legs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade man he can go alone to Chriſt, or at leaſt with a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal help, of an hand to lead, or argument to excite, without any creating work in the ſoule. O, we cannot conceive how glib ſuch ſtuffe goes down. If one Workman ſhould tell you that your houſe is rotten, and muſt be pull'd down, and all new materials prepared; and another ſhould ſay no ſuch matter,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119001:64"/>
ſuch a beam is good, and ſuch a ſparre may ſtand; a little coſt will ſerve the turne: it were no wonder that you ſhould liſten to him that would put you to leaſt coſt and trouble: the faithful ſervants of Chriſt tell ſinners from the Word, that man in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate is corrupt and rotten, that nothing of the old frame will ſerve, and there muſt needs be all new; but in comes an Arminian and blows up the ſinners pride, and tells him he is not ſo weak or wicked as the other repreſents him, if thou wilt thou mayeſt repent and beleeve, or at leaſt by exerting thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities, oblige God to ſuperadde what thou haſt not. This is the Workman that will pleaſe proud man beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Satan by his inſtruments nouriſheth that deſire of fleſhly liberty, which is in man by nature, who is a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> without yoke; and if he muſt wear any, that will pleaſe beſt, which hath the ſofteſt lining, and pincheth the fleſh leaſt, and therefore when the ſincere teachers of the Word will not abate of the ſtrictneſſe of the command, but preſſe ſincere obedience to it, then come Satans inſtruments and ſay, theſe are hard task-maſters, who will not allow one play-day in a yeare to the Chriſtian, but tie him to continual duty, we'll ſhew you an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier way to heaven: Come, ſaith the Papiſt, confeſſe but once a year to the Prieſt, (pay him well for his paines) and be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient ſon of the Church, and we'll diſpenſe with all the reſt. Come, ſaith the Familiſt, the Goſpel-Charter allows more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then theſe legal Preachers tell you of; they bid you repent and believe, when Chriſt hath done all theſe to your hand. What have you left to do but to nouriſh the fleſh? ſomething ſure is in it, that Impoſtors finde ſuch quick return for their ware, while Truth hangs upon the log; and is it not this? that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to afford heaven cheaper to their diſciples, then Chriſt will to his. He that ſells cheapeſt ſhall have moſt cuſtomers, though at laſt beſt will be beſt cheap; Truth with ſelf-denial, a better pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-worth, then errour with all its fleſh-pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Satan makes choice of ſuch as have a great name for holineſſe, none to <hi>a live bird</hi> to draw other birds into the net. But is it poſſible that ſuch ſhould do this work for the devil? yes, ſuch is the policy of Satan, and the frailty of the beſt, that the moſt holy men have been his inſtruments to ſeduce others, <hi>Abraham</hi> he tempts his wife to lie, <hi>Say thou art my Siſter.</hi> The old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119001:64"/>
leads the man of God out of his way, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the man, and the reverence of his age, 'tis like, gave autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his counſel. O how ſhould this make you watchful, whoſe long travel and great progreſſe in the wayes of God have gained you a name of eminency in the Church, what you ſay, do; or hold, becauſe you are file-leading men, and others look more on you: then their way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Satan chooſeth ſuch, as by relation or affection  have deep intereſt in the perſons he would gain. Some will kiſſe the childe for the Nurſes ſake, and like the Preſent for the hand that brings it. 'Tis like <hi>David</hi> would not have received that from <hi>Nabal,</hi> which he took from <hi>Abigail,</hi> and thanks her. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſent the apple by <hi>Eves</hi> hand to <hi>Adam. Delilah</hi> doth more with <hi>Samſon,</hi> then all the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> bands, <hi>Jobs</hi> wife brings him the poiſon, <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi> Some think Satan ſpared her life, when he ſlew his children and ſervants, (though ſhe was alſo within his Commiſſion) as the moſt likely inſtrument, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her relation and his affection, to lead him into temptation. Satan employes <hi>Peter</hi> a diſciple to tempt Chriſt, at another time his friends and kinsfolk. Some Martyrs have confeſt, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt work they met withal, was to overcome the prayers and tears of their friends and relations. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf could not get off this ſnare without heart-breaking: <hi>What mean ye to weep, and to break my heart?</hi> Acts 21.13.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, take heed of hiding ſin when thou haſt committed  it. This is one of the devices that are in mans heart, and as much Art and cunning is ſhewen in this, as in any one part of the ſinners trade. What a trick had the Patriarchs to blinde their fathers eye with a <hi>bloody coat?

The proper ſeat of ſin is the Will, of comfort the Conſcience; Satan hath not abſolute knowledge of, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over theſe, (being lock't up from any other but God; and therefore what he doth, either in defiling temptations, or diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting, is by wiles more then by open force, and he is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in troubling, to himſelf in tempting. Satan hath as the Serpent, away by himſelf; other beaſts, their motion is direct, right on, but the Serpent goes a skue (as we ſay) winding and wreathing its body, that when you ſee a ſerpent creeping along, you can hardly diſcerne which way it tends; thus Satan in his vexing temptations hath many intricate policies, turning this way and that way, the better to conceale his deſigne from the Saint, which will appear in theſe following methods.</p>

not proſtitute it ſelt to his luſt otherways, therfore to haunt it and ſcare it with thoſe imps of blaſphemy; As he ſerved <hi>Luther</hi> to whom he appeared, and when repulſed by him, went away and left a noiſome ſtinch behinde him in the room. Thus when the Chriſtian hath worſted Satan in his more pleaſing temptations, being madded, he belcheth forth this ſtinch of blaſphemous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to annoy and affright him, that from them the Chriſtian may draw ſome ſad concluſion or other; and indeed the Chriſtians ſin lies commonly more in the concluſion, which he draws from them (as that he is not a child of God) then in the motions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. All the counſel therefore I ſhall give thee in this caſe, is to do with theſe motions, as you uſe to ſerve thoſe vagrants and rogues that come about the countrey, whom, though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep from paſſing through your town, yet you look they ſettle not there, but whip them and ſend them to their owne home: Thus give theſe motions the Law, in mourning for them, reſiſting of them, and they ſhall not be your charge, (yea, 'tis like you ſhall ſeldomer be troubled with ſuch gueſts,) but if once you come to entertain them, and be Satans nurſe to them, then the Law of God will caſt them upon you.</p>

Thus he taught <hi>Jobs</hi> friends to pick up thoſe infirmities, which drop't from him in his diſtreſſe, and ſhoot them back in his face, as if indeed they had been ſent from God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him an hypocrite, and denounce his wrath for the ſame.</p>

Now you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Satans ſcope in accuſing the Chriſtian, and aggravating his ſin, is to unſaint him, and perſwade him he is but an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. O, ſaith Satan, now thou haſt ſhewen what thou art, ſee what a foule ſpot is on thy coat, this is not the ſpot of a childe; whoever that was a Saint commited ſuch a ſin after ſuch a ſort? All thy comforts and confidence which thou haſt bragg'd of, were falſe, I warrant you; thus you ſee Satan at one blow daſheth all in pieces. The whole fabrick of grace which God hath been rearing up many yeares in the ſoule, muſt now at one puffe of his malicious mouth be blown down, and all the ſweet comforts with which the Holy Spirit hath ſeal'd up Gods love, muſt be defaced with this one blot, which Satan drawes over the faire copy of the Saints evidence. Well, ſoule, for thy comfort know, if ever the Spirit of God hath begun a ſanctifying or comforting work, cauſing thee to hope in his mercy, he never is, will, or can be the meſſenger to bring contrary newes to thy ſoule, his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is not yea and nay, but <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> for ever. Indeed when the Saint playes the wanton, he can chide, yea, will frown and tell the ſoule roundly of its ſin, as he did <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan, Thou art the man,</hi> this thou haſt done, and paints out his ſin with ſuch bloody colours, as made <hi>Davids</hi> heart melt, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many drops of water: but that ſhall not ſerve his turn, he tells
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119001:69"/>
him what a rod is ſteeping for him (that ſhall ſmart to purpoſe,) one of his own houſe, no other then his darling ſon ſhall riſe up againſt him, that he may the more fully conceive how ill God took the ſin of him, a childe, a Saint, when he ſhall know what it is to have his beloved childe traiterouſly invade his Crown, and unnaturally hunt for his precious life; yet not a word all this while is heard from <hi>Nathan</hi> teaching <hi>David</hi> to unſaint himſelf, and call in queſtion the work of God in his ſoule. No, he had no ſuch commiſſion from God, he was ſent to make him mourne for his ſin, not from his ſin to queſtion his ſtate which God had ſo oft put out of doubt.</p>

When you finde your ſins ſo repreſented and aggravated to you, as exceeding either the mercy of Gods nature, or the grace of his Covenant, <hi>Hic ſe aperit diabolus</hi>: this comes from that foule liar. The Holy Spirit is Chriſts Spokeſman to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to ſouls, and to wooe ſinners to embrace the grace of the Goſpel, and can ſuch words drop from his ſacred lips, as ſhould break the match, and ſink Chriſts eſteem in the thoughts of the creature? you may know where this was mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When you hear one commend another for a wiſe or good man, and at laſt come in with a but that daſheth all, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily think he is no friend to the man, but ſome ſlie enemy that by ſeeming to commend, deſires to diſgrace the more: Thus when you finde God repreſented to you as merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but not to ſuch a great ſinner as you, to have power and ſtrength, but not able to ſave thee, you may ſay, Avant Satan, thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee.</p>

He is at Church aſſoon as thou canſt be, Chriſtian, for thy heart, yea, he ſtands under thy cloſet-window, and heares what thou ſayeſt to God in ſecret, all the while ſtudying
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119001:69"/>
how he may commence a ſuit againſt thee from thy duty; like thoſe that come to Sermons to carp and catch at what the Preacher ſaith, that they may make him an offender for ſome word or other miſ-placed; or like a cunning Opponent in the Schooles, while his adverſary is buſie in reading his poſition, he is ſtudying to confute it; and truly Satan hath ſuch an Art at this, that he is able to take our duties in pieces, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure them that they ſhall appear formal, though never ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, hypocritical, though enricht with much ſincerity. When thou haſt done thy duty, Chriſtian, then ſtands up this Sophiſter to ravel out thy work, there (will he ſay) thou playedſt the hypocrite, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but ſerving thy ſelf, here wandring, there nodding; a little further puft up with pride, and what wages canſt thou hope for at Gods hands, now thou haſt ſpoil'd his work, and cut it all out into chips? Thus he makes many poor ſoules lead a weary life, nothing they do but he hath a fling at, that they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſt pray or not, heare or not; and when they have prayed and heard, whether it be to any purpoſe or not: Thus their ſouls hang in doubt, and their dayes paſſe in ſorrow, while their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſtands in a corner, and laughs at the cheat he hath put upon them; as one, who by putting a counterfeit ſpider into the diſh, makes thoſe that ſit at table either out of conceit with the meat, that they dare not eat, or afraid of themſelves if they have eaten, leſt they ſhould be poiſoned with their meat.</p>

Doth it not behove thee to write thy Copy faire, when ſuch a Critick reades and ſcans it over?

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, let it make thee more humble. If Satan can charge  thee with ſo much in thy beſt duties, O what then can thy God
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119001:70"/>
do! God ſuffers ſometimes the infirmities of his people to be known by the wicked, (who are ready to check and frump them for them) for this end, to humble his people, how much more low ſhould theſe accuſations of Satan, which are in a great part too true, lay us before God?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, obſerve the fallacy of Satans argument, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, will help thee to anſwer his cavil: the fallacy is double.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, he will perſwade thee that thy duty and thy ſelf are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, proud, formal, &amp;c, becauſe ſomething of theſe ſins are to be found in thy duty: Now, Chriſtian, learn to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between pride in a duty, and a proud duty, hypocriſie in a perſon and an hypocrite, wine in a man and a man in wine. The beſt of Saints have the ſtirrings of ſuch corruptions in them and in their ſervices; theſe birds will light on an <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but comfort thy ſelf with this, that if thou findeſt a party within thy boſome pleading for God, and entering its proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, thou and thy ſervices are Evangelically perfect. God beholds theſe as the weakneſſes of thy ſickly ſtate here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and pities thee, as thou wouldeſt do thy lame childe; how odious is he to us that mocks one for natural defects, a blear eye, or a ſtammering tongue? ſuch are theſe in thy new nature. Obſervable is that in Chriſts prayer againſt Satan, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, is not this a brand pluck't out of the fire?</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, Lord, wilt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this envious ſpirit to twit thy poor childe with, and charge him for thoſe infirmities that cleave to his imperfect ſtate? he is but new pluck't out of the fire. No wonder there are ſome ſparks unquencht, ſome corruption unmortified, ſome diſorders unreformed in his place and calling, and what Chriſt did for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah,</hi> he doth unceſſantly for all his Saints, apologizing for their infirmities with his Father.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, his other fallacy is in arguing from the ſin that is in  our duties, to the non-acceptance of them. Will God, ſaith he, think'ſt thou, take ſuch broken groates at thy hand? Is he not a holy God? Now here, (Chriſtian) learn to diſtinguiſh and anſwer Satan. There is a double acceptance. There is an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a thing by way of payment of a debt, and there is an acceptance of a thing offered as a token of love, and teſtimony
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119001:70"/>
of gratitude. He that will not accept of broken money, or half the ſumme for payment of a debt: the ſame man, if his friend ſends him, though but a bent ſix pence, in token of his love, will take it kindly. 'Tis true (Chriſtian) the debt thou oweſt to God muſt be paid in good and lawful money, but (for thy comfort) here Chriſt is thy Pay-maſter; ſend Satan to him, bid him bring his charge againſt Chriſt, who is ready at Gods right hand to clear his accounts, and ſhew his diſcharge for the whole debt; but now thy performances and obedience come under another notion, (as tokens of thy love and thankfulneſſe to God,) and ſuch is the gracious diſpoſition of thy heavenly Father,<note place="margin">Pro. 19.22</note> that he accepts thy mite: Love refuſeth nothing that love ſends.

and thy ſorrow: Therefore thou art not humbled enough. What a plauſible argument is here at firſt bluſh? For the <hi>major,</hi> that there ought to be a proportion between ſin and ſorrow, this Satan will ſhew you Scripture for.<note place="margin">2 Chro. 33 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and an ordinary ſorrow will not ſerve his turne; <hi>He humbled himſelf greatly before the Lord.</hi> Now (ſaith Satan) weigh thy ſin in the balance with thy ſorrow; art thou as great a Mourner as thou haſt been a ſinner? ſo many yeares thou haſt waged war againſt the Almighty, making havock of his lawes, loading his patience till it groaned again, raking in the ſides of Chriſt with thy bloody dagger (while thou didſt grieve his Spirit, and reject his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and doeſt think a little remorſe (like a rolling cloud letting fall a few drops of ſorrow) will now be accepted? no, thou muſt ſteep in ſorrow as thou haſt ſoak't in ſin. Now to ſhew you the fallacy, we muſt diſtinguiſh of a twofold proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, an exact proportion of ſorrow to the inherent nature and demerit of ſin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is a proportion to the Law and Rule of the Goſpel. Now the firſt is not a thing feaſible, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done in the leaſt ſin is infinite, becauſe done to an infinite God; and if it could be feaſible, yet according to the tenour of the firſt Covenant it would not be acceptable; becauſe it had no clauſe to give any hope for an after-game by repentance; but the other which is a Goſpel-ſorrow,<note place="margin">Acts 5.31. Zech. 12.10.</note> this is indeed <hi>repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life,</hi> (both given by the Spirit of the Goſpel, and to be tried by the Rule of the Goſpel.) This is given for thy relief. As you ſee ſometimes in the high-way (where the waters are too deep for travellers,) you have a foot-bridge or Cauſey, by which they may ſcape the flood, and ſafely paſſe on; ſo that none but ſuch as have not eyes, or are drunk, will venture to go through the waters, when they may avoid the danger. Thou art a dead man, if thou think to anſwer thy ſin with proportionable ſorrow, thou wilt ſoon be above thy depth, and quackle thy ſelf with thy own teares, but never get over the leaſt ſin thou committedſt; go not on therefore as thou loveſt thy life, but turn aſide to this Goſpel-path, and thou eſcapeſt the danger. O you tempted ſoules, when Satan ſaith you are not humbled enough, ſee where you may be relieved; <hi>I am a Romane,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,) I appeal to Ceſar.</hi>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:119001:71"/>
I am a Chriſtian, (ſay) I appeal to Chriſts law; and what is the Law of the Goſpel concerning this? Heart-ſorrow is Goſpel-ſorrow; <hi>They were pricked in their heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2.37</note> and <hi>Peter</hi> (like an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Chirurgion) will not keep theſe bleeding Patients longer in pain with their wounds open; but preſently claps on the healing plaiſter of the Goſpel; <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Now a prick to the heart is more then a wound to the conſcience. The heart is the ſeat of life. Sin wounded there lies a dying. To do any thing from the heart makes it acceptable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.6. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <note place="margin">2 Co. 5.11</note> poor ſoul, hadſt thou ſate thus long in the devils ſtocks, if thou hadſt underſtood this aright? doth thy heart clear or condemn thee, when in ſecret thou art bemoaning thy ſin before God? if thy heart be falſe I cannot help you, no, not the Goſpel it ſelf,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.21</note> but if ſincere, thou haſt boldneſſe with God.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond argument Satan uſeth, is this: He whoſe ſorrow falls ſhort of theirs, that never truly repented, he is not humbled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: But, ſoul, thy ſorrow falls ſhort of ſome, that never truly repented; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Well, the firſt Propoſition is true, but how will Satan prove his <hi>minor</hi>? Thus, <hi>Ahab</hi> he took on for his ſin, and went in ſack-cloth. <hi>Judas</hi> he made bitter complaint. O (ſaith Satan) didſt thou not know ſuch a one that lay under terrour of conſcience, walking in a ſad mournful condition ſo many moneths, and every one took him for the greateſt Convert in the countrey? and yet he at laſt fell foully, and proved an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate; but thou never didſt feel ſuch ſmart, paſſe ſo many weary nights and days in mourning and bitter lamentation as he hath done, therefore thou falleſt ſhort of one that fell ſhort of repentance. And truly this is a ſad ſtumbling block to a ſoul in an houre of temptation. Like a ſhip ſunk in the mouth of the harbour, which is more dangerous to others then if it had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht in the open ſea. There is leſſe ſcandal by the ſins of the wicked, who ſink (as it were) in the broad ſea of profaneneſſe, then in thoſe who are convinced of ſin, troubled in conſcience, and miſcarry ſo near the harbour, within ſight, as it were, of ſaving grace. Tempted ſoules can hardly get over theſe without daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Am I better then ſuch a one that proved naught at laſt? Now to help thee a little to finde out the fallacy of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt diſtinguiſh between the terrours that accompany ſorrow, and the intrinſecal nature of this grace. The firſt which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119001:72"/>
are neceſſary may be ſeparated from the other, as the raging of the ſea, which is cauſed by the winde from the ſea, when the winde is down. From this diſtinction take two Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, one may fall ſhort of an hypocrite in the terrours that ſometimes accompany ſorrow, and yet have the truth of this grace, which the other with all his terrours wants. Chriſtians run into many miſtakes, by judging rather according to that which is acceſſary, then that which is eſſential to the nature of duties and graces. Sometimes thou heareſt one pray with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expreſſion (while thou canſt hardly get out a few broken words in duty,) and thou art ready to accuſe thy ſelf and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him; as if the gilt of the Key made it open the door the better; thou ſeeſt another abound with joy which thou wanteſt, and are ready to conclude his grace more and thine leſſe, whereas thou mayeſt have more real grace, only thou wanteſt a light to ſhew thee where it lies. Take heed of judging by acceſſaries, perhaps thou haſt not heard ſo much of the ratling of the chains of hell, nor in thy conſcience the out-cries of the damned, to make thy fleſh tremble, but haſt thou not ſeen that in a bleeding Chriſt which hath made thy heart melt and mourne, yea, loath and hate thy luſts more then the devil himſelf? Truly (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) 'tis ſtrange, to hear a Patient complain of his Phyſician, (when he findes his Phyſick work effectually, to the evacuating of his diſtempered humours, and the reſtoring his health) meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he was not ſo ſick as ſome others with the working of it; ſoule, thou haſt more reaſon to be bleſſing God that the convictions of his Spirit wrought ſo kindly on thee, to effect that in thee, without thoſe terrours which have coſt others ſo dear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this is ſo weak an argument, that contrariwiſe the more the terrours are, the leſſe the ſorrow is for ſin while they remain. Theſe are indeed preparatory ſometimes to ſorrow, they go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this grace, as auſtere <hi>John</hi> before meek <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But as <hi>John</hi> went down when Chriſt went up, his <hi>increaſe</hi> was <hi>Johns</hi> decreaſe; ſo as true godly ſorrow goes up, theſe terrours go down. As the winde gathers the clouds, but thoſe clouds ſeldom melt into a ſet rain, until the winde falls that gathered them: ſo theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours raiſe the clouds of our ſins in our conſciences, but when
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:119001:72"/>
theſe ſins melt into godly ſorrow, this layes the ſtorme preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; indeed, as the loud windes do blow away the raine, ſo theſe terrours do keep off the ſoule from this Goſpel-ſorrow. While the creature is making an out-cry, 'tis damn'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis damn'd, it is taken up ſo much with the feare of hell, that ſin as ſin, (which is the proper object of godly ſorrow) is little look't on or mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. A Murderer condemned to die, is ſo poſſeſt with the feare of death, and thought of the gallowes, that there lies the ſlaine body (it may be) before him, unlamented by him: but when his pardon is brought, then he can beſtow his teares free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his murdered friend; <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and mourne.</hi> Faith is the eye, this eye (beholding its ſin piercing Chriſt, and Chriſt pardoning its ſin) affects the heart, the heart affected ſighes, theſe inward clouds melt and run from the eye of faith in tears: and all this is done when there is no tempeſt of terrour upon the ſpirit, but a ſweet ſerenity of love and peace: and therefore, Chriſtian, ſee how Satan abuſeth thee, when he would perſwade thee thou art not humbled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, becauſe thy ſorrow is not attended with theſe legal ſorrowes.</p>

fully reſolved, as to dare to own the ſame, he frames his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt ſuch a ones cloſing with Chriſt and the promiſe; as if it were preſumption to aſſume that, (which is the only por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Elect) before we know our ſelves of that number. Now, Chriſtian, keep the Plains and thou art ſafe. 'Tis plain; we are not to make Election a ground for our faith, but our faith and calling a <hi>medium</hi> or argument to prove our Election. Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction indeed is firſt in order of divine acting. God chooſeth before we beleeve; yet faith is firſt in our acting. We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve before we can know we are elected, yea, by believing we know it. The Husbandman knowes 'tis Spring by the ſprouting of the graſſe, though he hath no Aſtrology to know the Poſition of the Heavens; thou mayeſt know thou art Elect, as ſurely by a work of grace in thee, as if thou hadſt ſtood by Gods elbowe when he writ thy name in the book of life. It had been preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for <hi>David</hi> to have thought he ſhould have been King, till <hi>Samuel</hi> anointed him, but then none at all; when thou believeſt firſt, and cloſeſt with Chriſt, then is the Spirit of God ſent to anoint thee to the Kingdom of Heaven: this is that holy oyle which is poured upon none but heires of glory; and 'tis no preſumption to reade what Gods gracious purpoſe was towards thee of old, when he prints thoſe his thoughts, and makes them legible in thy effectual calling; here thou doeſt not go up to heaven, and pry into Gods ſecrets, but heaven comes down to thee, and reveals them. Again, he will ask the Chriſtian what was the time of his Converſion; Art thou a Chriſtian (will he ſay) and doſt thou not know when thou commencedſt? now keep the Plains, &amp; content thy ſelf with this, that thou ſeeſt the ſtreams of grace, though the time of thy Converſion be like the head of <hi>Nylus,</hi> not to be found. God oft comes betimes, before groſſe ſins have deflowered the ſoule, and ſteals into the creatures bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome without much noiſe. In ſuch a caſe Satan doth but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe thee when he ſends thee on this errand; you may know the Sun is up, though you did not obſerve when it roſe. Again, what will become of thee (ſaith Satan) if God ſhould bring thee into ſuch an affliction on trial, when thou muſt burn or turn, or when all thy outward eſtate ſhall be rent from thee, no meal in the barrel, no money in the purſe; dareſt thou have ſo good an opinion of thy ſelfe, as to think that thy faith will hold out in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119001:76"/>
ſuch an houre of temptation? It thou haſt but half an eye, Chriſtian, thou mayeſt ſee what Satan drives at: this is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring queſtion; by the feare of future troubles he labours to bring thee into a neglect of thy preſent duty, and indiſpoſe thee alſo for ſuch a ſtare whenever it falls. If a man hath much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to do on the morrow, 'tis his wiſdom to diſcharge his minde thereof, (when compoſing to ſleep) leſt the thoughts thereof break his reſt, and make him the more unfit in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The leſſe reſt the ſoule hath in God and his promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning future events, the leſſe ſtrength it will finde to beare them when the pinch comes. When therefore thou art moleſted with ſuch feares, pacifie thy heart with theſe three plain Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, every event is the product of Gods Providence, not a ſparrow, much leſſe a Saint falls to the ground by poverty, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, perſecution, &amp;c. but the hand of God is in it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God hath put in caution <hi>he will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> He that enables thee in one condition, will in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. God learns his ſervants their whole trade. Grace is an univerſal principle. At the firſt moment of thy ſpiritual life ſuffering grace was infuſed as well as praying grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God is wiſe to conceale the ſuccours he intends in the ſeveral changes of thy life, that ſo he may draw thy heart into an entire dependance on his faithful promiſe. Thus to try the mettal of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith he let him go on, till his hand was ſtretch't forth, and then he comes to his reſcue. Chriſt ſends his diſciples to ſea, but ſtayes behinde himſelf, on a deſign to try their faith, and ſhew his love. Comfort thy ſelf therefore with this, though thou ſeeſt not thy God in the way, yet thou ſhalt finde him in the end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Satan perplexeth the tender conſciences of doubting Chriſtians with obſcure Scriptures, whoſe ſenſe lies too deep for their weak and diſtempered judgements, readily to finde out, and with theſe he hampers poor ſoules exceedingly; indeed as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy men delight in melancholy walks, ſo doubting ſoules moſt frequent ſuch places of Scripture in their muſing thoughts, as encreaſe their doubts; how many have I known that have look't ſo long on thoſe difficult places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. (which paſſe the underſtanding, as a ſwift ſtream the eye, ſo
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119001:76"/>
that the ſenſe is not perceived without great obſervation,) till their heads have turned round, and they at laſt (not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the difficulties,) have fallen down into deſpairing thoughts and words of their own condition, crying out, O they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt knowledge of the truth, and therefore no mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for them; who if they would have refreſhed their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings by looking off theſe places, (whoſe engraving is too curious to be long pored on by a weak eye,) they might have found that in other Scriptures plainly expreſt, which would have enabled them, as through a glaſſe, more ſafely to have view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe? Therefore, Chriſtian, keepe the Plaines; thou mayeſt be ſure 'tis thine enemy that gives thee ſuch ſtones to break thy teeth, when thy condition calls rather for bread and wine, ſuch Scriptures, I mean, as are moſt apt to nouriſh thy faith, and cheere thy drooping ſpirit. When thou meeteſt ſuch plain Scriptures which ſpeak to thy caſe, go over where it is fordable, and do not venture beyond thy depth. Art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid becauſe thou haſt ſinned ſince the knowledge of the truth, and therefore no ſacrifice remains for thee? See <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> caſe, how it patterns thine, and left upon record that their recovery may be a Key in thine hand to open ſuch places as theſe; mayeſt thou not ſafely conclude from theſe, this is not their meaning, that none can be ſaved that ſin after knowledge? Indeed in both thoſe places, it is neither meant of the falls of ſuch as ever had true grace, nor of a falling away in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acts of ſin, but of a total univerſal falling away from the Faith, (the doctrine of it as well as ſeeming practice of it.) Now if the root of the matter were ever in thee, other Scriptures will firſt comfort thee againſt thoſe particular apoſtaſies into which thou haſt relapſed, by ſweet promiſes inviting ſuch to return, and Precedents of Saints, who have had peace ſpoken to them after ſuch folly, and alſo they will ſatisfie thee againſt the other, by giving full ſecurity to thy faith, that thy little grace ſhall not die, being immortal, though not in its proper eſſence, becauſe but a creature, yet by Covenant, as it is a childe of Promiſe.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Dark Providences. From theſe Satan diſputes againſt  Gods love to, and grace in a ſoule. Firſt, he got a commiſſion to plunder <hi>Job</hi> of his temporal eſtate, and bereave him of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119001:77"/>
and then labours to make him queſtion his ſpiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and ſonſhip: his wife would have him entertain hard thoughts of God, (ſaying, <hi>Curſe God and die,</hi>) and his friends as hard thoughts of himſelf, (as if he were an hypocrite) and both upon the ſame miſtake, as if ſuch an afflicted condition and a gracious ſtate were inconſiſtent. Now (Chriſtian) keep the Plaines, and neither from this charge God fooliſhly for thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, nor thy ſelf as his. Reade the ſaddeſt Providence with the Comment of the Word, and thou canſt not make ſuch an harſh interpretation. As God can make a ſtreight line with a crooked ſtick, be righteous when he uſeth wicked inſtruments; ſo alſo gracious when he diſpenſeth harſh Providences. <hi>Joſeph</hi> kept his love, when he ſpake roughly to his brethren. I do not wonder that the wicked think they have Gods bleſſing, becauſe they are in the warme Sun: Alas, they are ſtrangers to Gods counſels, void of his Spirit, and ſenſual, judging of God and his Providence, by the report their preſent feeling makes of them; like little children, who think every one loves them that gives them plums. But 'tis ſtrange, that a Saint ſhould be at a loſſe for his afflicted ſtate, when he hath a Key to decipher Gods character: Chriſtian, hath not God ſecretly inſtructed thee by his Spirit from the Word, how to reade the ſhort-hand of his Providence? doeſt not thou know that the Saints afflictions ſtand for bleſſings? <hi>Every ſon whom he loves he corrects</hi>; and proſperity in a wicked ſtate, muſt it not be read a curſe? doth not God damne ſuch to be rich, honourable, victorious in this world, as well as to be tormented in another world? God gives them more of theſe then they ſeem to deſire ſometimes, and all to binde them faſter up in a deep ſleep of ſecurity, as <hi>Jael</hi> ſerved <hi>Siſera,</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119001:77"/>
dayes, and Jubilee-like Feſtivals, when God comes forth clothed with the robes of his mercy, and holds forth the Scepter of his grace more familiarly to his children then ordinary, bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their faith, ſincerity, &amp;c. and then the firmament is clear, not a cloud to be ſeen to darken the Chriſtians comfort. Love and joy are the ſoules repaſt and paſtime, while this feaſt laſts. Now when God withdrawes, and this chear is taken off, Satans work is how he may deface and weare off the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this teſtimony, which the ſoule ſo triumphs in for its ſpiritual ſtanding, that he may not have it as an evidence when he ſhall bring about the ſuite again, and put the ſoule to produce his writings for his ſpiritual ſtate, or renounce his claim. It behoves thee therefore to lay them up ſafely; ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may ſerve to non-ſuit thy accuſer many yeares hence; one affirmative from Gods mouth for thy pardoned ſtate, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more weight (though of old date) then a thouſand nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from Satans. <hi>Davids Songs of old</hi> ſpring in with a light to his ſoule in his midnight-ſorrowes.</p>

I finde indeed there have been ſome treaties of old between God and my ſoule; ſome hopes I have had, but theſe are now ſo defaced and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lined with back-ſlidings, repentances, and falls again, that now I queſtion all my evidences, whether true or counterfeit, what ſhould one in this caſe do?</p>

                        </label> Firſt, renew thy repentance, as if thou hadſt never repented.   Put forth freſh acts of faith, as if thou hadſt never believed. This ſeriouſly done will ſtop Satans mouth with an unexpected anſwer. Let him object againſt thy former actings as hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, what can he ſay againſt thy preſent repenting and beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which if true, ſets thee beyond his ſhot. It will be harder for Satan to diſprove the preſent workings of Gods gracious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whileſt the impreſſions thereof are freſh, then to pick an hole in thy old deeds and evidences. Acts are tranſient, and as wicked men look at ſins committed many yeares ſince, as little or none, by reaſon of that breadth of time which interpoſeth; ſo the Chriſtian upon the ſame account ſtands at great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to take the true aſpect of thoſe acts of grace, which ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119001:78"/>
long ago paſſed between God and him, though ſometimes even theſe are of great uſe. As God can make a ſinner poſſeſſe the ſins of his youth, as if they were newly acted to his terrour in his old age; ſo God can preſent the comforts and evidences which of old the Saint received, with thoſe very thoughts he had then of them, as if they were freſh and new.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And therefore ſecondly; If yet he haunts thee with the feares of thy ſpiritual eſtate, ply thee to the throne of grace, and beg a new copy of thy old evidence, which thou haſt loſt. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal is in the Pardon-Office in Heaven, whereof Chriſt is Maſter; if thou beeſt a Saint thy name is upon record in that Court; make thy moane to God, heare what newes from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, rather then liſten to the tales which are brought by thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie from hell. Did ſuch reaſon leſſe with Satan, and pray o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their feares more to God, they might ſooner be reſolved. Can you expect truth from a liar, and comfort from an enemy? Did he ever propheſie well of believers? Was not <hi>Job</hi> the Devils hypocrite, whom God vouch't for a non-ſuch in holineſſe, and prov'd him ſo at laſt? If he knew thou wert a Saint, would he tell thee ſo? if an hypocrite, he would be as loath thou ſhouldeſt know it; turn thy back therefore on him, and go to thy God: feare not, but ſooner or later he will give his hand again to thy Certificate. But look thou doeſt not raſhly paſſe a cenſure on thy ſelf, becauſe a ſatisfactory anſwer is not preſently ſent at thy deſire; the Meſſenger may ſtay long, and bring good newes at laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, ſhun battel with thine enemy while thou art in a fitter poſture? and that thou mayeſt draw into thy trenches, and make an honourable retreat into thoſe faſtneſſes and ſtrengths, which Chriſt hath provided for his ſick and wounded ſouldiers. Now there are two places of advantage into which deſerted ſouls may retire; the Name of God, and the abſolute Promiſes of the Goſpel; theſe I may call the faire Havens, which are then chiefly of uſe, when the ſtorme is ſo great that the ſhip cannot live at ſea. O, ſaith Satan, doeſt thou hope to ſee God? none but the pure in heart ſhall be bleſt with that viſion. Think'ſt thou to have comfort? that is the portion of the Mourners in ſpirit. Now, ſoule, though thou canſt not ſay (in the hurry of temptation) thou art the pure and the Mourner in ſpirit, yet
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119001:78"/>
then ſay thou believeſt God is able to work theſe in thee, yea, hath promiſed ſuch a mercy to poor ſinners, 'tis his Covenant, (<hi>He will give a new heart, a clean heart, a ſoft heart,</hi>) and here I wait, knowing, as there was nothing in the creature to move the great God to make ſuch Promiſes; ſo there can be nothing in the creature to hinder the Almighty his performance of them, where and when he pleaſeth. This act of faith, accompanied with a longing deſire after that grace thou canſt not yet finde, and an attendance on the meanes, though it will not fully ſatisfie all thy doubts, (may be) yet will keep thy head above water, that thou deſpaireſt not; and ſuch a ſhore thou need'ſt in this caſe, or the houſe falls.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, If yet Satan dogs thee, call in help, and keep not  the devils counſel. The very ſtrength of ſome temptations lies in the concealing of them, and the very revealing of them to ſome faithful friend, (like the opening and pricking of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume) gives the ſoule preſent eaſe: Satan knowes this too well; and therefore, as ſome thieves, when they come to rob an houſe, either gagge them in it, or hold a piſtol to their breaſt, frighting them with death, if they cry or ſpeak: Thus Satan that he may more freely rifle the ſoule of its peace and comfort, over-awes it ſo, that it dares not diſcloſe his temptation. O, ſaith Satan, if thy brethren or friends know ſuch a thing by thee, they'l caſt thee off, others will hoote at thee. Thus many a poor ſoul hath been kept long in its pangs by biting them in; thou loſeſt (Chriſtian) a double help by keeping the devils ſecret, the counſel and prayers of thy fellow-brethren; and what an invaluable loſſe is this?</p>

                  <p>THe ſecond Branch of the Apoſtles Argument followes, to excite them the more vigourouſly to their armes; and that is from the poſſibility, yea, certainty of ſtanding againſt this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile enemie, if thus arm'd, <hi>That ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the devil.</hi> So that this gives the Apoſtles argument its due temperament: for he meant not to ſcare them into a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly flight, or ſullen deſpaire of victory, when he tells them their enemy is ſo ſubtile and politick: but to excite them to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gourous reſiſtance, from the aſſured hope of ſtrength to ſtand in battel, and victoriouſly after it; which two I conceive are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that phraſe, (ſtanding againſt the wiles of Satan.

Look into the Word, you ſhall not finde a Saint, but hath been in the liſt with him, ſifted and winnowed more or leſſe by this enemy, yet at laſt we finde them all coming off with an honourable victory: as in <hi>David, Job, Peter, Paul,</hi>

He may make thee limp, but not bereave thee of thy life, and this bruiſe which he gives thee ſhall be rewarded with the <hi>breaking</hi> of his <hi>own head,</hi> that is, the utter ruine of him and his cauſe. Secondly, his food is here limited and appointed. Satan ſhall not devoure whom he will. The <hi>duſt</hi> is his food, which ſeems to reſtrain his power to the wicked, who are of the earth earthy, meere duſt; but for thoſe who are of a heavenly extraction, their graces are reſerved for Chriſts food, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.13. and their ſouls ſurely are not a morſel for the devils tooth.</p>

We finde Chriſt was not led of the evil ſpirit into the wilderneſſe to be tempted, but of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1.

He is but a bungler that hurts and hackles his own legs with his own axe; which God ſhould do, if his children ſhould be the worſe for Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Let the devil chooſe his way, God is for him at every weapon. If he'll try it by force of armes, and aſſault the Saints by perſecution, as <hi>the Lord of Hoſtes,</hi> he will oppoſe him. If by policy and ſubtilty, he is ready there alſo. The devil and his whole counſel are but fooles to God. Nay, their wiſdome, fooliſhneſſe. Cunning and Art commend every thing but ſinne. The more artificial the watch, the picture, &amp;c. the better; but the more wit and Art in ſin, the worſe, becauſe it is employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an All-wiſe God, that cannot be out-witted, and therefore will in the end but pay the workmen in greater damnation. <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men,</hi> yea then the wiſdome of men and devils, that is, the meanes and inſtruments which God op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Satan withal.

How is the great Scholar aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be baffled by a plain Countrey-mans argument? thus God calls forth <hi>Job</hi> to wreſtle with Satan and his Seconds, (for ſuch his three friends ſhewed themſelves in taking the devils part) and ſure he is not able to hold up the cudgels againſt the fencing-Maſter, who is beaten by one of the ſcholars.

Thus the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> help't to fulfil <hi>Joſephs</hi> dream, while they are thinking to rid their hands of him. To inſtance in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Satan by his temptations aimes at the defiling of the Chriſtians conſcience, and disfiguring that beautiful face of Gods image, which is engraven with holineſſe in the Chriſtians bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, he is an unclean ſpirit himſelf, and would have them ſuch, that he might glory in their ſhame; but God out-wits him, for he turneth the temptations of Satan to ſin, to the purging them from ſinne; they are the <hi>black ſoap</hi> with which God waſheth his Saints <hi>white.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:119001:81"/>Firſt, God uſeth the temptations of Satan to one ſin, as a preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive  againſt another; to <hi>Pauls thorn in the fleſh</hi> to prevent his pride. God ſends Satan to aſſault <hi>Paul</hi> on that ſide where he is ſtrong, that in the mean time he may fortifie him where he is weak. Thus Satan is befool'd, as ſometimes we ſee an army ſitting down before a town, where it waſts its ſtrength to no purpoſe, and in the mean time gives the enemy an advantage to recruit; and all this by the counſel of ſome <hi>Huſhai,</hi> that is a ſecret friend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide: God, who is the Saints true friend, ſits in the devils Councel, and over-rules proceedings there to the Saints advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; He ſuffers the devil to annoy the Chriſtian with temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to blaſphemy, atheiſme, and by theſe, together with the troubles of ſpirit they produce; the ſoule is driven to duty, is humbled in the ſenſe of theſe horrid apparitions in its imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſecured from abundance of formality and pride, which otherwiſe God ſaw invading him. As in a family, ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe falls out, which keeps the Maſter up later then ordinary, and by this the thief, who that night intended to rob him, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed; had not ſuch a ſoule had his ſpirit of prayer and diligence kept awake by thoſe afflicting temptations, 'tis likely Satan might have come as a ſeducer, and taken him napping in ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God purgeth out the very ſin Satan tempts to, even by his tempting. <hi>Peter</hi> never had ſuch a conqueſt over his ſelf-confidence, never ſuch an eſtabliſhment of his faith, as after his foule fall in the High Prieſts hall. He that was ſo well perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of himſelf before, as to ſay, Though all were offended with Chriſt, yet would not he, how modeſt and humble was he in a few dayes become,<note place="margin">Joh. 21.15.</note> when he durſt not ſay he loved Chriſt more then his fellow-brethren, to whom before he had preferr'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? what an undaunted Confeſſour of Chriſt and his Goſpel doth he prove before Councels and Rulers, who even now was daſh't out of countenance by a filly maid? and all this the product of Satans temptation ſanctified unto him. Indeed a Saint hath a diſcovery by his fall, what is the prevailing corruption in him, ſo that the temptation doth but ſtir the humour, which the ſoul having found out, hath the greater advantage to evacuate, by applying thoſe means, and uſing thoſe ingredients which do purge that malady <hi>cum delectu.</hi> Now the ſoule ſure will call all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119001:82"/>
out againſt this deſtroyer? <hi>Paul</hi> had not took ſuch pains to <hi>buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet his body,</hi> had he not found Satan knocking at that door.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God uſeth theſe temptations for the advancing of the whole work of grace in the heart. One ſpot occaſions the whole garment to be waſhed. <hi>David</hi> overcome with one ſinne, renewes his repentance for all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. A good husband when he ſeeth it rain in at one place, ſends for the Workman to look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the houſe. This indeed differenceth a ſincere heart from an hypocrite, whoſe repentance is partial, ſoft in one plot, and hard in another. <hi>Judas</hi> cries out of his treaſon, but not a word of his thievery and hypocriſie. The hole was no wider in his conſcience then where the bullet went in, whereas true ſorrow for one, breaks the heart into ſhivers for others alſo.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Satan by tempting one Saint hath a miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt others, either by encouraging them to ſin by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch a one, or diſcouraging them in their holy courſe by the ſcandal he hath given; but God here befooles him,</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, making the miſcarriages of ſuch a ſeaſonable caveat to others to look to their ſtanding. Doeſt thou ſee a meek <hi>Moſes</hi> provok't to anger, what watch and ward haſt thou need keep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy unruly heart? though loud winds do ſome hurt by blowing down here a looſe tyle, and there a turret, (which was falling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) yet the common good ſurmounts the private damage of ſome few; theſe being as a broom in Gods hand to ſweep and cleanſe the aire: ſo though ſome (that are wicked) are by Gods righteous judgement for the ſame hardened into further abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations by the Saints falls, yet the good which ſincere ſoules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by having their formality and ſecurity in a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree purged doth abundantly countervaile the other, who are but ſent a little faſter, whither they were going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God makes his Saints falls an argument for comfort to diſtreſſed conſciences. This hath been, and is as a feather,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119001:82"/>
(when the paſſage ſeems ſo ſtop't, that no comfort can be got down otherwiſe) to drop a little hope into the ſoule, to keep the creature alive from falling into utter deſpair; ſome have been revived with this, when next door to hell in their own feares. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> ſin was great, yet found mercy; <hi>Peter</hi> fell foully, yet now in heaven. Why ſitteſt thou here, O my ſoul, under the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of deſpair? up and call upon thy God for mercy, who hath pardoned the ſame to others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God hath a deſign in ſuffering Satan to trounce ſome  of his Saints by temptation, to train them up into a fitneſſe to ſuccour their fellow-brethren in the like condition: he ſends them hither to ſchool, (where they are under Satans ferular and laſh) that his cruel hand over them may make them ſtudy the Word and their own hearts, by which they get experience of Satans policies, till at laſt they commence Maſters in this Art of comforting tempted ſoules. It is an Art by it ſelf, <hi>to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the weary ſoule</hi>: 'tis not ſerving out an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip to humane Arts will furniſh a man for this: great Doctors have proved very dunces here, knowing no more how to handle a wounded conſcience then a Ruſtick the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inſtrument in diſſecting the body when an Anatomy-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is to be read. 'Tis not the knowledge of the Scripture (though a man were as well acquainted with it, as the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary with his pots and glaſſes in his ſhop, able to go directly to any promiſe on a ſudden,) will ſuffice. No, not grace it ſelfe, except exerciſed with theſe buffetings and ſoul-conflicts. Chriſt himſelf we finde trained up in this ſchool, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4. <hi>He waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mine eare to heare as the learned.</hi> Even as the Tutor calls up his Pupil to reade to him; and what is the Lecture which is read to Chriſt, that he may have the tongue of the learned to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the weary ſoule? ſee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>The Lord hath opened mine eare, and I was not rebellious, neither turned I away my back, I gave my back to the ſmiters, &amp;c.</hi> His ſufferings (which were all along mingled with temptations,) were the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from which Chriſt came out ſo learned, to reſolve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort diſtreſſed ſoules. So that the devil had better have let Chriſt alone, yea, and his Saints alſo, who do him but the greater diſſervice in comforting others; none will handle poor ſoules ſo gently as thoſe, who remember the ſmart of their owne heart-ſorrowes;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119001:83"/>
none ſo skilful in applying the comforts of the Word to wounded conſciences, as thoſe who have layen bleeding themſelves; ſuch know the ſymptomes of ſoul-troubles, and feel others pains in their own boſomes, which ſome that know the Scriptures, (for ſack of experience) do not, and therefore are like a novice Phyſician, who perhaps can tell you every plant in the Herbal, yet wanting the practick part, when a Patient comes, knowes not well how to make uſe of his skill: The Saints experiences help them to a ſoveraign treacle made of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions own fleſh, (which they through Chriſt have ſlain) and that hath a vertue above all other to expel the venome of Satans temptations from the heart.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Satan in tempting the Saint to ſin, labours to make a breach between God and the ſoule. He hates both, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labours to divide theſe dear friends. If I can (thinks he) get ſuch a one to ſin, God will be angry, and when angry he'll whip his childe foundly, this will be ſome ſport, and when God is correcting the Saint, he'll be queſtioning the love of God to him, and cooles in his love to God; ſo though I ſhould not keep him from heaven at laſt, yet he ſhall have little joy thither in the way. In this caſe God and the ſoul will be like man and wife fallen out, who neither of them look kindly one upon another. Now ſee how God befooles Satan in both theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, God uſeth his Saints temptations, as his method by which he advanceth the communications of his love unto them. The devil thought he had got the goale, when he got <hi>Adam</hi> to eate the forbidden fruit, he thought now he had man in the ſame predicament with himſelf, as unlikely ever to ſee the face of God, as thoſe Apoſtate ſpirits; but (alas!) this was by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to uſher in that great Goſpel-plot of ſaving man by Chriſt, who (aſſoon as this Prologue of mans fall is done) is brought upon the ſtage in that grand Promiſe of the Goſpel made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and at Gods command undertakes the charge of recovering loſt man out of Satans clutches, and re-inſtating him
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119001:83"/>
in his primitive glory, with an acceſſe of more then ever man had at firſt, ſo that the meaneſt lilly in Chriſts field, exceeds <hi>Adam</hi> in all his native Royalty. And as Satan ſped in his firſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo he is ſtill on the loſing hand: what got he by all his paines upon <hi>Job,</hi> but to let that holy man know at laſt how dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God loved him? When he foiled <hi>Peter</hi> ſo ſhamefully, do we not finde Chriſt owning <hi>Peter</hi> with as much love as ever? <hi>Peter</hi> muſt be the only diſciple, to whom by name the joyful newes of his reſurrection is ſent: <hi>Go tell my diſciples and Peter.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid, Be ſure let his ſad heart be comforted with this newes, that he may know I am friends with him for all his late cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe.</p>

                        <hi>But doth not this ſeem to countenance ſin, and make Christians heedleſſe, whether they fall into temptation or no? If God do thus ſhew his love to his Saints after their falls and foiles, why ſhould we be ſo ſhy of ſin, which ends ſo well at laſt?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we muſt diſtinguiſh between a ſoules being foiled  through his own infirmity, and his enemies ſubtilty and power over-matching him; and another, who through a falſe heart doth voluntarily proſtrate himſelf to the luſt of Satan; though a General will ſhew little pity to a ſouldier that ſhould traiterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw down his armes, and run to the enemy, yet if another in fighting receives a wound and be worſted, it will be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour for him to expreſſe his pity and love, no, though he ſhould ſend him out of the field in his own coach, lay him in his own bed, and appoint him his own Chirurgion. God doth not encourage wickedneſſe in his Saints, but pities weakneſſe. Even when the Saints fall into a ſin in its nature preſumptuous, they do not commit it ſo preſumptuouſly as others; there is a part true to God in their boſomes, though over-voted <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly, but the devil had his inſtruments to provoke him, quite againſt the good mans temper. <hi>David</hi> numbers the people, but ſee how the devil dogg'd and hunted him, till at laſt he got the better, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Satan ſtood up and provoked David to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Iſrael.</hi> How bravely did <hi>Job</hi> repel Satans darts? no wonder if in ſuch a ſhower ſome one ſhould get between the joynts of his armour. And for <hi>Peter,</hi> we know (good man) with what a loyal
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119001:84"/>
heart, yea, zealous he went into the field, though when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appear'd his heart fail'd him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, conſider but the way how God communicates his love after his Saints falls, not in ſinning, or for ſinning, but in mourning and humbling their ſouls for their ſins. Indeed did God ſmile on them, while acting ſinfully, this might ſtrengthen their ſin, as wine in a feaver would the diſeaſe; but when the fit is off, the venome of the diſeaſe ſpent, and breathed out in a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humiliation, now the creature lies low. Gods wine of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is a cordial to the drooping ſpirit, not fuel for ſin. When <hi>David</hi> was led into temptation firſt, he muſt be clad in ſack-cloth and mourning, and then God takes it off, and puts on the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of joy and praiſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.10, 15. <hi>Job,</hi> though he expreſt ſo much courage and patience, yet (bewraying ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities after he was baited long by ſo many freſh dogs, men and devils) he muſt cry <hi>peccavi,</hi> and abhor himſelf in duſt and aſhes, before God will take him into his armes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. and the ſame way God takes with all his children. Now to his Saints in ſuch a poſture, God may with ſafety to his honour and their good, give a larger draught of his love then ordinary; their feares and ſorrow which their ſin hath coſt them, will ſerve inſtead of water to daſh this ſtrong wine of joy, and take away its headineſſe, that it neither fume up into pride, nor occaſion them to reele backward into Apoſtaſie.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God doth thus to poure the greater ſhame upon  Satan, who is the great make-bate between God and the ſoule. How is the man aſhamed that hath ſtirr'd up variance between husband and wife, father and ſon, to ſee the breach made up, and all ſet themſelves againſt him? It went ill on Chriſts ſide, when <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were made friends, and can it go well with Satan to ſee all well between God and his children? If <hi>Eſther</hi> be in favour, <hi>Haman</hi> her enemy ſhall have his face covered. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this covers Satans face with ſhame, to ſee a poor Saint even now his priſoner, whom he had leave to rob and plunder, tempt and diſquiet, now ſitting in the Sun-ſhine of Gods love, while he like a ravening Lion takes on for the loſſe of his prey.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satans aime is to weaken the Saints faith on God, and cool his love to God, but befool'd in both; for, firſt God turnes their temptations, yea, their falls, to the further eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their faith, which (like the tree) ſtands ſtronger for its ſhaking, or like the Gyant <hi>Anteus,</hi> who in his wreſtling with <hi>Hercules</hi> is feigned to get ſtrength by every fall to the ground. Falſe faith indeed once foiled, ſeldom comes on again; but true faith riſeth and fights more valiantly, as we ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> and other Scripture-examples. Temptation to faith is as fire to gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. The fire doth not only diſcover which is true gold, but makes the true gold more pure; it comes out may be leſſe in bulk and weight, (becauſe ſevered from that ſoile and droſſe which embaſed it) but more in value and worth, when Satan is bound up, and the Chriſtian walks under the ſhines of divine favour, and encouragement of divine aſſiſtance; his faith may appear great, if compared with another under the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, and buffetings of Satan, but this is not equall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as if to try who is biggeſt of two men, we ſhould meaſure one naked, and the other over his clothes; or in comparing two
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119001:85"/>
pieces of gold, weigh one with the droſſe and dirt it contracts in the purſe, with the other purged from theſe in the fire; faith before temptation hath much heterogeneal ſtuffe that cleaves to it, and goes for faith; but when temptation comes, theſe are diſcovered. Now the Chriſtian feels corruption ſtir, which lay as dead before, now a cloud comes between the ſoule and the ſweet face of God, (the ſenſe of which latter, and the little ſenſe of the other bore up his faith before) but theſe bladders prick't, he comes now to learne the true ſtroke in this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Art of ſwimming on the promiſe, having nothing elſe to beat him up but that; and a little of this carries more of the precious nature of faith in it, then all the other; yea, is (like <hi>Gideons</hi> handful of men) ſtronger, when all theſe acceſſaries to faith are ſent away, then when they were preſent; and here is all the devil gets: in ſtead of deſtroying his faith which he aimes at, he is the occaſion of the refining of it, and thereby adding to its ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the love of tempted Saints is enkindled to Chriſt by their temptations, and foiles in their temptations. Poſſibly in the fit there may ſeem a damp upon their love, as when water is firſt ſprinkled upon the fire, but when the Conflict is a little over, and the Chriſtian comes to himſelf, his love to Chriſt will break out like a vehement flame; Firſt, the ſhame and ſorrow which a gracious ſoule muſt needs feele in his boſome for his ſinful miſcarriage, while under the temptation, will provoke him to expreſſe his love to Chriſt above others, as is ſweetly ſet forth in the Spouſe, who when the cold fit of her diſtemper was off, and the temptation over, beſtirs her to purpoſe, her lazy ſickneſſe is turned to love-ſickneſſe: ſhe findes it as hard now to ſit, as ſhe did before to riſe: ſhe can reſt in no place out of her Beloveds ſight, but runs and asks every one ſhe meets for him; and whence came all this vehemency of her zeale? all occaſioned by her undutiful carriage to her husband: ſhe part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo unkindly with him, that (bethinking what ſhe had done) away ſhe goes to make her peace. If ſins committed in unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy have ſuch a force upon a gracious ſoule, that the thought of them, though pardoned, will ſtill break and melt the heart into ſorrow, (as we ſee in <hi>Magdalen</hi>) and prick on to ſhew zeal for God above others, (as in <hi>Paul</hi>) how much more will the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119001:85"/>
ſins of a Saint, who after ſweet acquaintance with Jeſus Chriſt, lifts up the heel againſt that boſome where he hath layen, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yea, diſſolve the heart as into ſo many drops of water, and that ſorrow provoke him to ſerve God at a higher rate then others? No childe ſo dutiful in all the family, as he who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from his rebellion. Again ſecondly, as his own ſhame, ſo the experience which ſuch a one hath of Chriſts love above others will encreaſe his love. Chriſts love is fuel to ours. <hi>Ex iiſdem nutrimur quibus constamus</hi>; as it gives its being, ſo it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords growth: It is both Mother and Nurſe to our love. The more Chriſt puts forth his love, the more heat our love gets, and next to Chriſts dying love, none greater then his ſuccouring love in temptation. The Mother never hath ſuch advantage to ſhew her affection to her childe, as when in diſtreſſe, ſick, poor or impriſoned; ſo neither hath Chriſt to his children as when tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, yea, worſted by temptation. When his children lie in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans priſon, bleeding under the wounds of their conſciences, this is the ſeaſon he takes to give an experiment of his tender heart in pitying, his faithfulneſſe in praying for them, his mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in ſending ſuccour to them, yea, his dear love in viſiting them by his comforting Spirit. Now when the ſoul hath got off ſome great temptation, and reades the whole hiſtory thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (wherein he findes what his own weakneſſe was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Satan, nay, his unfaithfulneſſe in complying with Satan, which might have provok't Chriſt to leave him to the fury of Satan) now to ſee both his folly pardoned, and ruine graciouſly prevented, and that by no other hand, but Chriſts coming in to his reſcue (as <hi>Abiſhai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.</note> when that gyant thought to have flaine him.) This muſt needs exceedingly endear Chriſt to the ſoul. At the reading of ſuch records the Chriſtian cannot but enquire, (as <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> concerning <hi>Mordecai,</hi> who by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering a treaſon had ſaved the Kings life,) what honour hath been done to his ſweet Saviour for all this. And thus Jeſus Chriſt, whom Satan thought to bring out of the ſoules favour, and liking, comes in the end to ſit higher and ſurer in the Saints affections then ever.</p>

God will not only be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Saints in glory for his love in their ſalvation, but for his wiſdom in the way to it. The love of God in ſaving them will be the ſweet draught at the marriage-feaſt, and the rare wiſdom of God in effecting this, as the curious workmanſhip with which the cup ſhall be enamel'd. Now wiſdom appears moſt in untying knots, and wading through difficulties. The more croſſe wards there are in a buſineſſe, the more wiſdome to fit a key to the lock, to make choice of ſuch means as ſhall meet with the ſeveral turnings in the ſame. On purpoſe therefore doth God ſuffer ſuch temptations to intervene, that his wiſdom may be the more admired in opening all theſe, and leading his Saints that way to glory, by which Satan thought to have brought them to hell. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are bid <hi>remember all the way that God led them in the wilderneſſe for fourty yeares,</hi> Deut. 8.2. The Hiſtory of theſe warres (Chriſtian) will be pleaſant to reade in heaven, though bloody to fight on earth. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talk't with Chriſt on <hi>Tabor,</hi> (an Embleme of the ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which ſhall paſſe between Chriſt and his Saints in glory,) and what was their talk, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.30. but of his death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings? It ſeems a diſcourſe of our ſufferings and temptations, are not too low a ſubject for that bliſſeful ſtate. Indeed this left out, would make a blemiſh in the faire face of Heavens glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Could the damned forget the way they went into hell, how oft the Spirit of God was wooing, and how far they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119001:86"/>
by the conviction of it; in a word, how many turnes and returnes there were in their journey forward and backward, what poſſibilities, yea, probabilities they had for heaven, when on earth; were but ſome hand ſo kinde as to blot theſe torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages out of their memories, it would eaſe them wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. So were it poſſible glorified Saints could forget the way, wherein they went to glory, and the ſeveral dangers that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terven'd from Satan, and their own back-ſliding hearts, they and their God too would be loſers by it, I mean in regard of his manifeſtative glory. What is the glory wherein God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at <hi>Zions</hi> deliverance? thoſe royal garments of ſalvation, that make him ſo admired of men and Angels? but the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his Attributes, according to what every one hath done towards their ſalvation. Now wiſdom being that which the creature chiefly glories in, (and choſen by Satan for his firſt bait, who made <hi>Eve</hi> believe ſhe ſhould be like God in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdome) therefore God, to give Satan the more ſhameful fall, gives him leave to uſe his wits and wiles in tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and troubling his children, in which lies his great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the Saints, that ſo the way to his own Throne (where his Wiſdome ſhall at laſt, as well as his mercy ſit in all its Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty) may be paved with the ſculls (as I may ſo ſpeak) of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>

If all the devils wits and wiles will not ſerve him to overcome one ſingle ſouldier in Chriſts Camp, much leſſe ſhall he ever ruine the whole Army. Theſe are dayes of great confuſions in the Chriſtian world, and the chief feare of a gracious heart is for the <hi>Ark,</hi> leſt that ſhould fall into the enemies hand, (and when this <hi>Palladium</hi> is taken, the City of God (his Church,) be trod under the feet of pride,) I confeſſe Satan ſeems to get ground daily; he hath ſtrangely wrigled into the boſomes and principles of many, who by the fame of their Profeſſion and zeal, had obtained in the opinion of others, to be reckoned among the chief of Chriſts Worthies in their generation. He hath ſadly corrupted the truths of Chriſt, brought a diſ-eſteem on Ordinances, (that by this, and as a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this, the wombe of the Goſpel is become in a great meaſure barren, and her children which hang upon her breaſts,

thrive not in love and holineſſe as of old, when the milk was not ſo much nor that ſo ſpiritfull) he hath had advantage by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the godly, to harden thoſe that are wicked into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſdain of Religion, and by the bloody wars of late yeares, to boile up the wrath of the Popiſh and profane crue to a higher pitch of rage and fury againſt Chriſts little remnant then ever: ſo that if ever God ſhould ſuffer the ſword to fall into their hand, they are diſciplin'd and fitted to play the bloody butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on Chriſts ſheep above their fore-fathers, (neither are they ſo creſt-fallen, but that they can hope for ſuch a day, yea, take up ſome of thoſe joyes upon truſt afore-hand to ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while the reſt follow.) And now (Chriſtian) may be their confidence, together with the diſtracted ſtate of Chriſts affaires in the world, may diſcompoſe thy Spirit, concerning the iſſue of theſe rolling Providences that are over our heads, but be ſtill, poor heart, and know that the conteſt is not between the Church and Satan, but between Chriſt and him. Theſe are the two Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Stand now, O ye Army of Saints, ſtill by faith, to ſee the All-wiſe God wreſtle with a ſubtil devil. If you live not to ſee the period of theſe great confuſions, yet generations after you ſhall behold the Almighty ſmite off this <hi>Geliah</hi>'s head with his own ſword, and take this cunning hunter in the toile of his own policies, that ſaith which aſcribes greatneſſe and wiſdom to God, will ſhrink up Satans ſubtilty into a <hi>nigrum nihil,</hi> a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Incredulitiment diabolum, quaſi leonem, qui fide fortes deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt quaſi vermiculum.

If Satan had been to ſet out his own power, he could have challeng'd no more then is here granted him. See here the difference between Chriſt dealing with his followers, and Satan with his. Satan dares not let ſinners know who that God is they fight againſt; this were enough to breed a mutiny in the devils camp. Silly ſoules they are drawn into the field by a falſe report of God and his wayes, and are kept there together with lies and faire tales, but Chriſt is not afraid to ſhew his Saints their enemy in all his Power and Principality, the Weakneſſe of God being ſtronger then the powers of hell.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119001:89"/>
it were in a ring to behold the bloody iſſue of that duel. Now this is more fierce then to fight in an army, where though the battel be ſharp and long, the ſouldier is not alwayes engaged, but falls off when he hath diſcharged, and takes breath a while: yea, poſſibly may eſcape without hurt or ſtroak, becauſe there the enemies aime is not at this or that man, but at the whole heap, but in wreſtling one cannot ſcape ſo, he being the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object of the enemies fury, muſt needs be ſhaked and tried to purpoſe. Indeed the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The Chriſtians life is a continual wreſtling.<note place="margin">Doct.</note> He is as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid of himſelf, borne <hi>a man of ſtrife,</hi> or what the Prophet to <hi>Aſa,</hi> may be ſaid to every Chriſtian; <hi>From hence thou ſhalt have wars,</hi> from thy ſpiritual birth to thy natural death, from the houre when thou firſt diddeſt ſet thy face to heaven, till thou ſhalt ſet thy foot in heaven. <hi>Iſraels</hi> march out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was in Goſpel-ſenſe our taking the field againſt ſin and Satan, and when had they peace? not till they lodged their colours in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. No condition</hi> wherein the Chriſtian is here below is quiet. Is it proſperity or adverſity, here is work for both hands, to keep pride and ſecurity down in the one, faith and patience up in the other: no place which the Chriſtian can call priviledg'd ground. <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi> wreſtled with the wicked inhabitants thereof, his <hi>righteous ſoule being vexed with their unclean converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And how fares he at <hi>Zoar</hi>? do not his own daughters bring a ſpark of <hi>Sodoms</hi> fire into his own bed, whereby he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with luſt? Some have thought if they were but in ſuch a family, under ſuch a Miniſtery, out of ſuch occaſions: O then they ſhould never be tempted as now they are; I confeſſe change of aire is a great help to weak nature, and theſe forenamed as vantage-ground againſt Satan; but think'ſt thou to flie from Satans preſence thus? No, though thou ſhould'ſt take the wings of the morning he would flie after thee, theſe may make him
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119001:90"/>
change his method in tempting, but not lay down his deſigne; ſo long as his old friend is alive within, he will be knocking at thy door without. <hi>No duty</hi> can be performed without wreſtling; The Chriſtian needs his ſword as much as his trowel. He wreſtles with a body of fleſh; this to the Chriſtian in duty is as the beaſt to the traveller; he cannot go his journey without it, and much ado to go with it. If the fleſh be kept high and luſty, then 'tis wanton and will not obey; if low, then it's weak and ſoon tires: Thus the Chriſtian rids but little ground, becauſe he muſt go his weak bodies pace. He wreſtles with a body of ſin as well as of fleſh, this mutters and murmures when the ſoule is taking up any duty. Sometimes it keeps the Chriſtian from duty, ſo that he cannot do what he would. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I would have come once and again, but Satan hindred me.</hi> I would have prayed may the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſay at ſuch a time, and meditated on the Word I heard, the mercies I received at another, but this enemy hindred. 'Tis true indeed, grace ſwayes the Scepter in ſuch a ſoule, yet as School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes taking their time when their Maſter is abroad do ſhut him out, and for a while lord it in miſrule, though they are whip't for it afterwards: thus the unregenerate part takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage when grace is not on its watch to diſturb its government, and ſhut it out from duty, though this at laſt makes the ſoul more ſevere in mortifying, yet it coſts ſome ſcuffle before it can reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its throne, and when it cannot ſhut from duty, yet then is the Chriſtian wofully yok't with it in duty; it cannot do what it doth as it would; many a letter in its copy doth this enemy ſpoil, while he joggs him with impertinent thoughts; when the Chriſtian is a praying, then Satan and the fleſh are a prating; he cries, and they louder, to put him out or drown his cry. Thus we ſee the Chriſtian is aſſail'd on every ſide by his enemy; and how can it be other, when the ſeeds of war are laid deep in the natures of both, which can never be rooted up till the devil ceaſe to be a devil, ſin to be ſin, and the Saint to be a Saint? Though wolves may ſnarle at one another, yet ſoon are quiet again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the quarrel is not in their nature; but the Wolfe and the Lamb can never be made friends. Sin will luſt againſt grace, and grace draw upon ſin whenever they meet.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when they wreſtle againſt his Spirit. We reade of the  Spirits ſtriving with the creature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man.</hi> Where the ſtriving is not in anger and wrath to deſtroy them, (that God could do without any ſtir or ſcuffle) but a loving ſtrife and conteſt with man. The old world was running with ſuch a cariere headlong into their ruine, he ſends his Spirit to interpoſe, and by his counſels and reproofes to offer, as it were, to ſtop them and reclaim them. As if one ſeeing another ready to offer violence on himſelf, ſhould ſtrive to get the knife out of his hand, with which he would do the miſchief. Or one that hath a purſe of gold in his hand to give, ſhould follow another by all manner of entreaties, ſtriving with him to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119001:91"/>
accept and take it. Such a kinde of ſtrife is this of the Spirits with men. They are the luſts of men, (thoſe bloody inſtruments of death, with which ſinners are miſchieving themſelves) that the holy Spirit ſtrives by his ſweet counſels and entreaties to get out of our hands. They are Chriſts, his grace and eternal life he ſtrives to make us accept at the hands of Gods mercy; and for repulſing the Spirit thus ſtriving with them, ſinners are juſtly counted fighters againſt God: <hi>Ye ſtiffe-necked, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart and ears,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 7.51</note> 
                        <hi>ye do alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now there is a twofold ſtriving of the Spirit, and ſo of our wreſtling againſt it. Firſt, the Spirit ſtrives in his meſſengers with ſinners. They coming on his errand, and not their owne, he voucheth the faithful counſels, reproofs and exhortations which they give as his own act. <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>Preacher of righteouſneſſe,</hi> what he ſaid to the old world, is call'd <hi>the Preaching of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.19. The pains that <hi>Moſes, Aaron</hi> and other ſervants of God took in inſtructing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is call'd the inſtruction of the Spirit, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.20. ſo that when the Word, which Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters bring in his Name, is rejected, the faithful counſels they give are thrown at ſinners heels and made light of; then do they ſtrive with the Spirit, and wreſtle againſt Chriſt as really, as if he viſibly in his own perſon had been in the Pulpit, and preached the ſame Sermon to them. When God comes to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſinners, it will prove ſo; then God will rub up your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and minde you of his ſtriving with you, and your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde reſiſting him. <hi>They, whether they will heare, or whether they will forbear,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 2.5.</note> 
                        <hi>ſhall know they had a Prophet among them.</hi> Now men ſoon forget whom and what they hear; ask them what was preſt upon their conſcience in ſuch a Sermon, they have forgot; what were the precious truthes laid out in another, and they are loſt: &amp; well were it for them if their memories were no better in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world: it would eaſe their torments more then a little. But then they ſhall know they had a Prophet among them, and what a price they had with him in their hands, though it was in fooles keeping. They ſhall know what he was, and what he ſaid, though a thouſand years paſt, as freſh as if it were done but laſt night. The more zealous and compaſſionate, the more painful and powerful he was in his place, the greater ſhall their ſin be found, to break from ſuch holy violence offered to do
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119001:91"/>
them good. Surely God will have ſomething for the ſweat, yea, lives of his ſervants which were worne out in ſtriving with ſuch rebellious ones. May be yet, ſinners, your firmament is clear, no cloud to be ſeen that portends a ſtorme; but know (as you uſe to ſay) winter does not rock in the clouds, you ſhall have it at laſt: every threatening which your faithful Miniſters have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt you out of the Word, God is bound to make good. <hi>He confirmeth the Word of his ſervant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. 44.25.</note> 
                        <hi>and performeth the counſel of his meſſengers,</hi> and that in judgement againſt ſinners, confirming the threatenings, as well as in mercy performing the promiſes, which they declare as the portion of his children. But it will be time enough to ask ſuch on a ſick-bed, or a dying houre, whether the words of the Lord delivered by their faithful Preachers have not taken hold of them. Some have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed with horrour they have, as the Jewes, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Like as the Lord of hoſts thought to do unto us, ſo hath he dealt with us.</hi> Secondly, the Spirit ſtrives with men more immediately, when he makes his inward approaches to the conſciences of men, deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their own boſoms the caſe with them; one while he ſhews them their ſins in their bloody colours, and whether they will ſurely bring them, if not look't to timely, which he doth ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, that the creature ſmells ſometimes the very fire and brimſtone about him, and is at preſent in a temporary hell; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while he falls a parlying and treating with them, making gracious overtures to the ſinner, if he will return at his reproof, preſents the grace of the Goſpel, and opens a door of hope for his recovery, yea, falls a wooing and beſeeching of him to throw down his rebellious armes, and come to Chriſt for life, whoſe heart is in a preſent diſpoſition to receive and embrace the firſt motion the returning ſinner makes for mercy. Now when the Spirit of God follows the ſinner from place to place, and time to time, ſuggeſting ſuch motions, and renewing his old ſuit, and the creature ſhall fling out of the Spirits hands thus ſtriving with him <hi>re infectâ,</hi> as far from renouncing his luſts, or taking any liking to Chriſt as ever: This is to reſiſt the Spirit to his face, and it carries ſo much malignity in it, that (even where it hath not been final) poor humbled ſoules have been ſo over-ſet with the horrour of it, that they could not for a long time be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but that it was the unpardonable ſin. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119001:92"/>
ſinners, how you uſe the Spirit when he comes, knocking at the door of your hearts: Open at his knock, and he will be your gueſt, you ſhall have his ſweet company; repulſe him, and you have not a Promiſe hee'll knock again. And if once he leave ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with thee, unhappy man, thou art loſt for ever; thou lieſt like a ſhip caſt up by the waves upon ſome high rock, where the tide never comes to fetch it off. Thou mayeſt come to the Word, converſe with other Ordinances, but in vain. 'Tis the Spirit in them, which is both tide and winde, to ſet the ſoule afloat, and carry it on, or elſe it lies like a ſhip on dry ground which ſtirs not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we wreſtle againſt God when we wreſtle with his Providence, and that two wayes; Firſt, when we are diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his providential diſpoſure of us. Gods carving for us doth not pleaſe us ſo, but that we are objecting againſt his dealings towards us, at leaſt muttering ſomething with the fool in our hearts, which God heares as lightly as man our words. God counts then we begin to quarrel with him, when we do not acquieſce in, and ſay Amen to his Providence whatever it is. He calls it <hi>a contending with the Almighty, Iob.</hi> 40.1. yea, <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of God.</hi> And he is a bold man ſure that dare finde fault with God, and article againſt heaven. God challengeth him, whoever he is that doth this, to anſwer it at his peril. <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth God, let him anſwer it, v.</hi> 2. of the chapter fore-mentioned. It was high time for <hi>Iob</hi> to have done, when he heares what a ſenſe God puts upon thoſe unwary words, which drop't from him in the anguiſh of his Spirit, and paroxyſme of his ſufferings; contend with the Almighty? reprove God? Good man, how blank he is, and cries out, <hi>I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</hi> Let God but pardon what is paſt, and he ſhall hear ſuch language no more. O Sirs, take heed of this wreſtling above all other. Contention is uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, with whomſoever it is we fall out. Neighbours or friends, wife or husband, children or ſervants: but worſt of all with God. If God cannot pleaſe thee, but thy heart riſeth againſt him, what hopes are there of thy pleaſing him, who will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing kindly from that man who is angry with him? And how can love to God be preſerved in a diſcontented heart, that is alwayes muttering againſt him? Love cannot think any evil of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119001:92"/>
God, nor endure to heare anyſpeak evil of him, but it muſt take Gods part, as <hi>Ionathan Davids,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> ſpake baſely of him, and when it cannot be heard, will like him ariſe and be gone. When afflicted, love can allow thee to groan, but not to grumble. If thou wilt eaſe thy incumbred ſpirit into Gods boſome by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and humbly wreſtle with God on thy knees, love is for thee, and will help thee to the beſt arguments thou canſt uſe to God; But if thou wilt vent thy diſtempered paſſions, and ſhew a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous ſpirit againſt God, this ſtabs it to the heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we wreſtle againſt Providence, when uncorrigible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the various diſpenſations of God towards us. Providence has a voice, if we had an eare; mercies ſhould draw, afflictions drive; now when neither faire meanes nor foule do us good, but we are impenitent under both; this is to wreſtle againſt God with both hands. Either of theſe have their peculiar aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. One is againſt love, and ſo diſ-ingenuous; the other is againſt the ſmart of his rod, and therein we ſlight his anger, and are cruel to our ſelves in kicking againſt the pricks. Mercy ſhould make us aſhamed, wrath afraid to ſin. He that is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, has not the ſpirit of a man. He that is not afraid when ſmitten, is worſe then the beaſt, who ſtands in aw of whip &amp; ſpur. Sometimes mercy (eſpecially theſe outward mercies, which have a pleaſing reliſh to the carnal part in a Chriſtian) hath prov'd a ſnare to the beſt of men, but then affliction uſeth to recover them; but when affliction makes men worſe, and they harden themſelves againſt God, to ſin more and more while the rod is on them, what is like to reclaim them? few are made better by proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, whom afflictions make worſe. He that will ſin, though he goes in pain, will much more if that once be gone. But take heed of thus conteſting with God. There is nothing got by ſcuffling with God, but blows, or worſe. If he ſay he will afflict thee no more, 'tis even the worſt he can ſay; 'tis as much as if he ſhould ſay he'll be in thy debt till another world, and there pay thee altogether. But if he means thee mercy, thou ſhalt hear from him in ſome ſharper affliction then ever. He hath wedges that can rive thee, wert thou a more knotty piece then thou art. <hi>Are there yet the treaſures of wickedneſſe, and the ſcant meaſure that is abominable?</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Mic. 6.9</note> ſaith God to <hi>Iſrael</hi>) what uncorrigible, though <hi>the Lords voice crieth unto the City,</hi> bidding you <hi>hear the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119001:93"/>
rod, and him that hath appointed it?</hi> See what courſe God reſolvs on, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Therefore will I make thee ſick in ſmiting of thee.</hi> As if he had ſaid, my other Phyſick I ſee was too weak, it did not work or turne your ſtomack, but I will prepare a potion that ſhall make you ſick at heart.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It reproves thoſe who ſeem to wreſtle againſt ſin, but not according to the Word of Command that Chriſt gives. There is a Law in wreſtling which muſt be obſerv'd, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>If a man alſo ſtrive for Masteries, yet is he not crowned except he ſtrive lawfully.</hi> He alludes to the Romane games, to which there were Judges appointed to ſee that no foule play were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered contrary to the Law for wreſtling; the prize being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch, though they did foile their adverſary, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle improves to make the Chriſtian careful in his war, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a ſtricter Law and Diſcipline, that requires not only valour to fight, but obedience to fight, by order and according to the Word of Command: Now few do this that go for great Wreſtlers.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, ſome while they wreſtle againſt one ſin, embrace ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in this caſe 'tis not the perſon wreſtles againſt ſin, but one ſin wreſtles with another, and 'tis no wonder to ſee thieves fall out when they come to divide the ſpoil; Luſts are <hi>divers, Tit.</hi> 3.3. and 'tis hard to pleaſe many Maſters, eſpecially when their commands are ſo contrary; when pride bids lay on in bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, laviſh out in entertainment; covetouſneſſe bids lay up, when malice bids revenge; carnal policy ſaith, conceal thy wrath, though not forgive. When luſt ſends to his whores, hypocriſie pulls him back for ſhame of the world. Now is he Gods Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion that reſiſts one ſin at the command of another, it may be a worſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ſome wreſtle, but they are preſt into the field, not Voluntiers, their ſlaviſh feare ſcares them at preſent from their luſt; ſo that the Combate is rather betwixt their Conſcience and Will, then them and their luſt, Give me ſuch a ſin ſaith Will; No, ſaith conſcience, it will ſcall'd, and throwes it away. A man may love the wine though he is loath to have his lips burnt. <hi>Hypocrites themſelves are afraid to burne.</hi> In ſuch Combates the Will at laſt prevails, either by bribing the underſtanding to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the luſt it deſires in a more pleaſing dreſſe, (that conſcience
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119001:93"/>
may not be ſcared with ſuch hideous apparitions of wrath) or by pacifying conſcience with ſome promiſe of repentance for the future, or by forbearing ſome ſin for the preſent, which it can beſt ſpare, thereby to gain the reputation of ſomething like a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; Or if all this will not do, then (prompted by the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its luſt) the Will proclaims open war againſt conſcience, ſinning in the face of it, like ſome wilde horſe, (impatient of the ſpur which pricks him, and bridle that curbs him) gets the bit between his teeth, and runs with full ſpeed, till at laſt he eaſeth himſelf of his Rider; and then where he ſees fatteſt paſture, no hedge or ditch can withhold him, till in the end you finde him, ſtarving in ſome pound for his treſpaſſe: Thus many ſin at ſuch rate, that conſcience can no longer hold the reines, nor ſit the ſaddle. but is thrown down and laid for dead; and then the wretches range where their luſts can have the fulleſt meal, till at laſt they pay for their ſtollen pleaſures moſt dearly, when conſcience comes to it ſelf, purſues them, and takes them more ſurely by the throat then ever, never to let them go till it brings them before Gods Tribunal.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, others wreſtle with ſin, but they do not hate it, and  therefore they are favourable to it, and ſeek not the life of ſin as their deadly enemy; theſe wreſtle in jeſt, and not in earneſt; the wounds they give ſin one day, are healed by the next. Let men reſolve never ſo ſtrongly againſt ſin, yet it will creep again into their favour, till the love of ſin be quenched in the heart, and this fire will never the of it ſelf, the love of Chriſt muſt quench the love of ſin, as <hi>Ierome</hi> excellently, <hi>

Thou haſt more valour then <hi>Moſes,</hi> who would not ſtir without God, no, though he ſent an Angel for his Lieutenant. Thou art wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then <hi>Iacob,</hi> who to overcome <hi>Eſau,</hi> now marching up, turnes from him, and falls upon God; he knew if he could wreſtle with God, he might truſt God to deale with his brother. Engage God and the back-door is ſhut, no enemy can come behinde thee, yea, thine enemy ſhall fall before thee. <hi>God turne the counſel of Achitophel into fooliſhneſſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Heaven ſaith Amen to his prayer, and the wretch <hi>hangs himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, be very careful of giving thine enemy hand-hold. Wreſtlers ſtrive to faſten upon ſome part or other, which gives them advantage more eaſily to throw their adverſary; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which, they uſed, Firſt, to lay aſide their garments. Secondly, to anoint their bodies. For the firſt, Chriſtian, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to put off the old man which is moſt perſonal, that corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, which <hi>David</hi> calls his own iniquity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. This is the skirt which Satan layes hold of, obſerve what it is, and mortifie it daily, then Satan will retreat with ſhame, when he ſees the head of that enemy upon the wall, which ſhould have betrayed thee into his hands. Secondly, the Romane wreſtlers uſed to anoint their bodies; ſo do thou, bathe thy ſoul with the frequent meditation of Chriſts love. Satan will finde little wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, where Chriſts love dwells, love will kindle love, and that will be as a wall of fire to keep off Satan, it will make thee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the offer of a ſinne, and as oile ſupple thy joynts, and make
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119001:94"/>
agile to offend thy enemy. Think how Chriſt wreſtled in thy quarrel, ſin, hell and wrath had all come full mouth upon thee, had not he coped with them in the way. And canſt thou finde in thy heart to requite his love, by betraying his glory into the hands of ſin, by cowardiſe or treachery: ſay not thou loveſt him, ſo long as thou canſt lay thoſe ſins in thy boſome, which pluck't his heart out of his boſome. It were ſtrange if a childe ſhould keep, and delight to uſe no other knife, but that wherewith his father was ſtabb'd.</p>

Sometimes the Chriſtian hath his enemy on the hip, yea, on the ground, can ſet his foot on the very neck of his pride, and throw away his unbelief, as a thing abſurd and unreaſonable; now (as a wiſe wreſtler) fall with all thy weight upon thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; though man think it foule play to ſtrike when his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is down, yet do not thou ſo complement with ſin, as to let it breath or riſe.

Learne a little wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Serpents brood, who when they had Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their foot, never thought they had him ſure enough; no, not when dead, and therefore both ſeale and watch his grave.

'Tis ſtrange, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very houre ſeems not a day, and everyday a year, till death ſounds thy joyful retreat, and calls thee off the field, where the bullets flie ſo thick, and thou art fighting for thy life with thy deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, to come to Court, where not ſwords, but palmes are ſeen in the Saints hands; not drums, but harps; not groanes of bleeding ſouldiers and wounded conſciences, but ſweet and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing muſick is heard of triumphing Victors caroling the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God and the Lambe, through whom they have overcome. Well, Chriſtians, while you are below, comfort your ſelves with theſe things; There is a place of Reſt remains for the people of God: You do not beat the aire, but wreſtle for a Heaven that is yonder above theſe clouds; you have your worſt firſt, the beſt will follow. You wreſtle but to win a Crown, and win to wear it, yea wear never to loſe it, which once on none ſhall take off, or put you to the hazard of battel more. Here we overcome to fight again, the battel of one temptation may be over, but the war remaines. What peace can we have, as long as devils can come abroad out of their holes, or anything of ſinful nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in our ſelves unmortified? which will even fight upon its knees, and ſtrike with one arme while the other is cut off; but when death comes, the laſt ſtroak is ſtruck: this good Phyſician will perfectly cure thee of thy ſpiritual blindneſſe and lameneſſe, (as the Martyr told his fellow at the ſtake bloody <hi>Bonner</hi> would do their bodily.) What is it, Chriſtian, which takes away the joy of thy life, but the wreſtlings and combates which this boſome-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy puts thee to?

'Tis life which is thy loſſe, and death which is thy gaine. Be but willing to endure the rending of this vaile of thy fleſh, and thou art where thou wouldeſt be, out of the reach of ſin, at reſt in the boſome of thy God. And why ſhould a ſhort evil of paine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright thee more, then the deliverance from a continual torment of ſins evil raviſh thee?

It is uſual in Scripture ſuch manner of phraſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.12. <hi>Call not thy friends to dinner, but the poore</hi>; that is, not only thoſe, ſo as to neglect the poor.

So, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.20. <hi>Fleſh and blood cannot inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdome of God,</hi> that is, ſinful mortal fleſh, as it's expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the words following. So, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.21. I conſulted not with fleſh and blood, that is, carnal reaſon. Now this boſome-enemy may be called fleſh, partly from its derivation, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from its operation; from its derivation, becauſe it's derived and propagated to us by natural generation; thus <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to beget <hi>a ſon in his own likeneſſe,</hi> ſinful as he was, as well as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and miſerable; yea, the holieſt Saint on earth having fleſh in him, derives this corrupt and ſinful nature to his childe, as the circumciſed Jew begat an uncircumciſed childe; and the wheat cleanſ'd and fann'd (being ſowen) comes up with a husk, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi>

If fleſhly reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand ſpiritual truths when thus accommodated, and the notions of the Goſpel tranſlated into its own language, what skill is it like to have of them, if put to reade them in their original tongue? I mean, if this garment of carnal expreſſion were taken off, and ſpiritual truths in their naked hue preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its view. The motions of the natural will are carnal, and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>minde the things of the fleſh.</hi> All its deſires, delights, cares, feares, are in and of carnal things; it ſavours ſpiritual food no more then an Angel fleſhly. <hi>Omnis vita guſtu ducitur:</hi> What we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reliſh we will hardly make our daily food.

Now according to this Interpretation the ſenſe of the Apoſtle is not, as if the Chriſtian had no combate with his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, (for in another place it's ſaid, the Spirit luſts againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh againſt the Spirit, and this enemy is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <gap reason="foreign">

The Chriſtian wreſtles not with his naked corruption, but with Satan in them; were there no devil, yet we ſhould have our hands full in reſiſting the corruptions of our own hearts, but the acceſſe of this enemy makes the battel more terrible, becauſe he heads them who is a Captain ſo skilful and experienced. Our ſin is the engine, Satan is the Engineer; luſt the bait, Satan the Angler; when a ſoule is enticed by his own luſt, he is ſaid to be tempted, <hi>James</hi> 1.14. becauſe both Satan and our own luſt concur to the compleating the ſinne.</p>

Man hath a Heaven-borne ſoule, which makes him a kin to Angels, yea, to the God of them who is the Father of Spirits; but this is paſſed by in ſilence, as if God would not owne that which is tainted with ſin, and not the creature God at firſt made it, or becauſe the ſoul, though of

ſuch noble extraction, yet being ſo immerſt in ſenſuality, deſerves no other name then fleſh, which part of man levels him with the beaſt, and is here intended to expreſſe the weakneſſe and frailty of mans nature.

Fleſh can only wound fleſh, he may kill thee, but not hurt thee, why ſhouldeſt thou feare to be ſtript of that which thou haſt reſign'd already to Chriſt? 'tis the firſt leſſon thou learneſt, if a Chriſtian, to deny thy ſelf, take up thy croſſe, and follow thy Maſter; ſo that the enemy comes too late; thou haſt no life to loſe, becauſe thou haſt given it already to Chriſt, nor can man take away that without Gods leave; all thou haſt is enſured; and though God hath not promiſed thee immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from ſuffering in this kinde, yet he hath undertaken to beare thy loſſe, yea, to pay thee a hundred fold, and thou ſhalt not ſtay for it till another world. Again, thou ought'ſt not to feare fleſh. Our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. thrice in the compaſſe of ſixe verſes, commands us not to feare man; if thy heart quailes at him, how wilt thou behave thy ſelf in the liſt againſt Satan, whoſe little finger is heavier then mans loines? The <hi>Romanes</hi> had <hi>arma praeluſoria</hi>; weapons rebated or cudgels, which they were tried at before they came to the ſharp. If thou canſt not beare a bruiſe in thy fleſh from mans cudgel and blunt weapon, what wilt thou do when thou ſhalt have Satans ſword in thy ſide? God counts himſelf reproached when his children feare a ſorry man; therefore we are bid, Sanctifie the Lord, and not to feare their feare. Now if thou wouldeſt not feare man who is but fleſh; Labour,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to mortifie thy own fleſh. Fleſh only feares fleſh: when the ſoule degenerates into carnal deſires and delights, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he falls into carnal feares.

                     <p>The ſecond thing follows: The conjuncture of the Saints e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; We have not to do with naked man, but with man led on by Satan; not with fleſh and blood, but Principalities and Powers acting in them. There are two ſorts of men the Chriſtian wreſtles with, good men and bad. Satan ſtrikes in with both.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Chriſtian wreſtles with good men. Many a ſharp conflict there hath been betwixt Saint and Saint, ſcuffling in the dark through miſ-underſtanding of the truth, and each other: <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> at ſtrife. <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> juſtled with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for the wall, till God interpoſed and ended the quarrel by his immediate ſtroak on <hi>Miriam.</hi> The Apoſtles even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Maſter, were at high words, conteſting who ſhould be greateſt. Now in theſe Civil wars among Saints, Satan is the great kindle-coale, though little ſeen, becauſe, like <hi>Ahab,</hi> he fights in a diſguiſe, playing firſt on one ſide, and then on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aggravating every petty injury, and thereupon provoking to wrath and revenge: therefore the Apoſtle dehorting from anger, uſeth this argument, <hi>Give no place to the devil</hi>; as if he had ſaid, Fall not out among your ſelves, except you long for the devils company, who is the true ſouldier of fortune (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon phraſe is.) living by his ſword, and therefore haſtes thither where there is any hope of war. <hi>Gregory</hi> compares the Saints in their ſad differences to two cocks, which Satan the Maſter of the pit ſets on fighting, in hope, when kill'd to ſup with them at night. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.6. <hi>The mouth of the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man calls for ſtroakes.</hi> Indeed we by our mutual ſtrifes give the devil a ſtaffe to beat us with; he cannot well work without fire, and therefore blows up theſe coales of contention, which he uſeth as his forge, to heat our ſpirits into wrath, and then we

are malleable, eaſily hammer'd as he pleaſeth. Contention puts the ſoul into diſorder, and <hi>inter arma ſilent leges.</hi> The Law of grace acts not freely, when the Spirit is in a commotion; Meek <hi>Moſes</hi> provok't, ſpeaks unadviſedly. Me thinks this (if nothing elſe will) ſhould ſound a retreat to our unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that this <hi>Joab</hi> hath a hand in them, he ſets this evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit betwixt brethren, and what folly is it for us to bite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure one another to make hell ſport? we are prone to miſtake our heat for zeal, whereas commonly in ſtrifes between Saints, it is a fire-ſhip ſent in by Satan to break their unity and order; wherein while they ſtand they are an Armado invincible, and Satan knows he hath no other way but this to ſhatter them: when the Chriſtians language which ſhould be one, begins to be confounded, they are then neare a ſcattering; 'tis time for God to part his children, when they cannot live in peace together.</p>

The <hi>Sabeans</hi> plunder'd <hi>Job,</hi> but went on Satans errand.

oft in a day are they pull'd out of their thrones by the wiſhes of their diſcontented ſubjects: But Satan hath the heart of all his ſubjects.

                     <p>Secondly, God permits this his Principality, in order to the glorifying of his Name in the recovery of his Elect from the power of this great Potentate. What a glorious Name will God have when he hath finiſhed this war, wherein at firſt he found all poſſeſſed by this enemy, and not a man of all the ſons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to offer himſelf as a Voluntier in this ſervice, till made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the day of his Power? this, this will gain God a Name above every name, not only of creatures, but of thoſe by which himſelf was known to his creature. The workmanſhip of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth gave him the Name of Creatour, Providence of Preſerver, but this of Saviour, wherein he doth both the former, preſerve his creature which elſe had been loſt, and create a new creature, I mean the Babe of Grace, which, through God, ſhall be able to beat the devil out of the field, who was able to drive <hi>Adam</hi> (though created in his full ſtature) out of Paradiſe, and may not all the other works of God empty themſelves as rivers into this ſea, loſing their names, or rather ſwelling into one of Redemption? Had not Satan taken Gods Elect priſoners, they would not have gone to heaven with ſuch acclamations of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. There are three expreſſions of a great joy in Scripture; the joy of a woman after her travel, the joy of harveſt, and the joy of him that divideth the ſpoil: the exultaton of all theſe is wrought upon a ſad ground, many a paine and teare it coſts the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling woman, many a feare the husbandman, perils and wounds the ſouldier, before they come at their joy, but at laſt are paid for all, the remembrance of their paſt ſorrows feeding their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent joyes. Had Chriſt come and entered into affinity with

our nature, and return'd peaceably to heaven with his Spouſe, finding no reſiſtance; though this would have been admirable love, and that would have afforded the joy of marriage, yet this way of carrying his Saints to heaven will greaten the joy, as it addes to the nuptial Song, the triumph of a Conquerour, who hath reſcued his Bride out of the hands of Satan, as he was lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to the chambers of hell.</p>

As Chriſt had his Saints in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court; ſo the devil his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the outward Court of his viſible Church. Thou muſt therefore have ſomething more to exempt thee from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then living within the pale, and giving an outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Ordinances of Chriſt, Satan will yield to this, and be no loſer: As a King lets his Merchants trade to, yea, live in a forreign Kingdome, and while they are there learn the language, and obſerve the cuſtomes of the place; this breaks not their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, nor all that thy loyalty to Satan.

                     <p>Firſt, how came he into the throne? Satan had once the quiet poſſeſſion of thy heart: thou waſt by birth as the reſt of thy neighbours, Satans vaſſal, yea, haſt oft vouch't him in the courſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119001:104"/>
of thy life to be thy Liege Lord, how then comes this great change? Satan ſurely would not of his own accord reſigne his Crown and Scepter to Chriſt; and for thy ſelf thou wert nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to renounce, nor able to reſiſt his, power: this then muſt only be the fruit of Chriſts victorious armes, whom <hi>God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, Asts</hi> 5.31.

Didſt thou ever hear a voice from heaven in the Miniſtery of the Word calling out to thee, as once to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo as to lay thee at Gods foot, and make thee face about for heaven, to ſtrike thee blinde in thine own apprehenſion, who before hadſt a good opinion of thy ſtate, to tame and meeken thee; ſo as how thou art willing to be led by the hand of a childe after Chriſt? Did ever Chriſt come to thee, as the Angel to <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon, rowſing thee up, and not only cauſing the chaines of darkneſſe and ſtupidity to fall off thy minde and conſcience, but make thee obedient alſo, that the iron gate of thy Will hath opened to Chriſt before he left thee? then thou haſt ſomething to ſay for thy freedome: But if in all this I be a Barbarian, and the language I ſpeak be ſtrange, thou knoweſt no ſuch work to have paſſed upon thy ſpirit, then thou art yet in thy old priſon; can there be a change of Government in a Nation by a Conquerour that invades it, and the ſubjects not heare of this? one King unthroned, and another crowned in thy ſoule, and thou hear no ſcuffle all this while? The regenerating Spirit is compared to the <hi>winde, John</hi> 3.8. His firſt attempts on the ſoule may be ſo ſecret, that the creature knows not whence they come, or whither they tend; but before he hath done, the <hi>ſound</hi> will be heard throughout the ſoule, ſo as it cannot but ſee a great change in it ſelf, and ſay, I that was blinde, now I ſee; I that was as hard as ice, now relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin; now my heart gives, I can melt and mourne for it. I that was well enough without a Chriſt, yea, did wonder what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaw in him, to make ſuch a do for him, now have changed my note with the <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem</hi>; and for what, is your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved (as I ſcornfully have ask't) I have learn't to ask where he is, that I might ſeek him with you.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to whom goeſt thou for protection? as it belongs to  the Prince to protect his ſubjects, ſo Princes expect their ſubjects ſhould truſt them with their ſafety; the very bramble bids, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9.15. <hi>If in truth ye anoint me King, then put your trust under my ſhadow.</hi> Now who hath thy confidence?

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119001:105"/>
of their Prince and his Councel; when wrong'd, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to their Prince in his Laws for right; and when they do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Prince, they ſubmit to the penalty of the Law; and beare his diſpleaſure patiently, till humbling themſelves they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his favour, and do not in a diſcontent fall to open rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus a gracious ſoule follows his Chriſtian calling, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himſelf to God as a faithful Creatour, to be ordered by his wiſe Providence. If he meets with violence from any, he ſcornes to beg aid of the devil to help him, or be his own Judge to right himſelf; No, he acquieſceth in the counſel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Word of God gives him.

And when God comes to afflict him for any diſloyal carriage, in ſtead of accepting the puniſhment for his ſin, and ſo to own him for his Soveraign Lord, that may righteouſly puniſh the faults of his diſobedient ſubjects, his heart is fill'd with rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and in ſtead of waiting quietly and humbly, (like a good ſubject) till God upon his repentance receives him into his favour, his wretched heart (preſenting God as an enemy to him) will not ſuffer any ſuch gracious and amiable thought of God to dwell in his boſome, but bids him look for no good at his hand. <hi>This evil is of the Lord, why ſhould I wait on the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer?</hi> whereas a gracious heart is moſt encouraged to wait from this very conſideration that drives the other away; Becauſe 'tis the Lord afflicts, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.6.</p>

Let devils and devilliſh men do their own work, but let not thy hand (O Chriſtian) be upon thy dear Saviour. But this is too litle to bid thee not play the traitour. If thou haſt any loyal blood running in thy veines, thy own heart will ſmite thee when thou rendeſt the leaſt skirt of his holy Law; thou canſt as well carry burning coales in thy boſome, as hide any treaſon there againſt thy dear Soveraign. No, 'tis ſome noble enterpriſe I would have thee think upon, how thou mayeſt advance the Name of Chriſt higher in thy heart, and world too as much as in thee lies. O how kindely did God take it, that <hi>David</hi> (when peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſet in his throne) was caſting about, not how he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain himſelf with thoſe pleaſures, which uſually corrupt and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119001:107"/>
debauch the Courts of Princes in times of peace, but how he might ſhew his zeal for God, in building a houſe for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that had rear'd a throne for him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. And is there nothing (Chriſtian) thou canſt think on, wherein thou mayeſt eminently be inſtrumental for God in thy generation? He is not a good ſubject that is all for what he can get of his Prince, but never thinks what ſervice he may do for him. Nor he the true Chriſtian, whoſe thoughts dwell more on his own happineſſe then the honour of his God. If ſubjects might chuſe what life ſtands beſt for their own enjoyment, all would deſire to live at Court with their Prince: But becauſe the Princes honour is more to be valued then this: therefore noble ſpirits (to do their Prince ſervice) can deny themſelves the delicacies of a Court, to jeopard their lives in the field, and thank their Prince too for the honour of their employment. Bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> upon theſe termes was willing to have his day of coronation in glory prorogued, &amp; he to ſtay as companion with his brethren in tribulation here, for the furtherance of the Goſpel. This indeed makes it <hi>opera pretium vivere,</hi> worth the while to live, that we have by it a faire opportunity, (if hearts to husband it) in which we may give a proof of our real gratitude to our God, for his redeeming love in reſcuing us out of the power of the Prince of darkneſſe, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating us into the Kingdome of his dear Son. And therefore (Chriſtian) loſe no time, but what thou meaneſt to do for God, do it quickly: Art thou a Magiſtrate? now it will be ſoon ſeen on whoſe ſide thou art; if indeed thou haſt renounced allegiance to Satan, and taken Chriſt for thy Prince, declare thy ſelf an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to all that bear the name of Satan, and march under his colours. Study well thy commiſſion, and when thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt the duty of thy place, fall to work zealouſly for God. Thou haſt thy Princes ſword put into thy hand, be ſure thou uſe it, and take heed how thou uſeſt it; that when call'd to deliver it up, and thy account alſo, it may not be found ruſty in the ſheath through ſloth and cowardiſe, beſmeared with the blood of violence, nor bent and gap't with partiality and injuſtice. Art thou a Miniſter of the Goſpel? thy employment is high, an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, and that not from ſome petty Prince, but the great God to his rebellious ſubjects. A calling ſo honourable, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> diſdained not to come in extraordinary from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119001:107"/>
to perform it, call'd therefore <hi>the meſſenger of the Covenant</hi>;<note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> yea, he had to this day ſtay'd on earth in perſon about it, had he not been call'd to reſide as our <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> and Advocate in heaven with the Father: and therefore in his bodily abſence he hath intruſted thee and a few more to carry on the Treaty with ſinners, which when on earth himſelf began. And what can you do more acceptable to him, then to be faithful in it, as a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on which he hath ſet his heart ſo much? As ever you would ſee his ſweet face with joy, (you that are his Ambaſſadours) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to your work, and labour to bring this Treaty of Peace to a bleſſed iſſue between God and thoſe you are ſent to. And then if ſinners will not come off, and ſeal the Articles of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, you ſhall (as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to his ſervant) be cleare of your oath. Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> he not gathered, yet you ſhall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord. And let not the private Chriſtian ſay he is a dry tree, and can do nothing for Chriſt his Prince, becauſe he may not bear the Magiſtrates fruit or Miniſters. Though thou haſt not a commiſſion to puniſh the ſins of others with the ſword of juſtice, yet thou mayeſt ſhew thy zeal, in mortifying thy own with the ſword of the Spirit, and mourne for theirs alſo: though thou mayeſt not condemn them on the bench, yet thou mayeſt, yea, oughteſt by the power of a holy life to convince and judge them. Such a Judge <hi>Lot</hi> was to the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Though thou art not ſent to preach and baptize, yet thou mayeſt be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful helpful to them who are. The Chriſtians prayers whet Magiſtrates and Miniſters ſword alſo. O pray, Chriſtian, and pray again, that Chriſts Territories may be enlarged; never go to heare the Word, but pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> Loving Princes take great content in the acclamations and good wiſhes of their ſubjects as they paſſe by. <hi>A vivat rex,</hi> Long live the King, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a loyal breath, though poor, is more worth then a ſubſidy from thoſe who deny their hearts while they part with their money. Thou ſerveſt a Prince (Chriſtian) who knowes what all his ſubjects think of him, and he counts it his honour, not to have a multitude feinedly ſubmit to him, but to have a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that love him and cordially like his government, who if they were to chuſe their King, and make their own lawes they ſhould live under every day would deſire no other then himſelf, nor any other lawes then what they have already from his mouth. It was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119001:108"/>
no doubt great content to <hi>David,</hi> that he had the hearts of his people ſo,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.26.</note> as <hi>Whatever the King did, pleaſed them all.</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God took it as well, that what he did pleaſed <hi>David</hi>; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>David</hi> was as content under the rule and diſpoſure of God as the people were under his; witneſſe the calmneſſe of his Spirit in the greateſt affliction that ever befell him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>Behold, here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> Loyal ſoule! he had rather live in exile with the good Will of God, then have his throne, if God will not ſay 'tis good for him.</p>

                     <p>THis is the Second Branch of the Deſcription, wherein Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is ſet forth by his might and Power. This gives weight to the former, were he a Prince, and not able to raiſe a force that might dread the Saints, the ſwelling name of Prince were contemptible; but he hath power anſwerable to his dignity, which in five particulars will appear.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in his names; Secondly, his nature; Thirdly, his number; Fourthly, his order and unity; Laſtly, the mighty works that are attributed to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for the firſt, he hath names of great power called the <hi>ſtrong man, Luke.</hi> 11.21. ſo ſtrong that he keeps his houſe in peace in defiance of all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> none on earth being able to cope with this giant: Chriſt muſt come from Heaven to deſtroy him and his works, or the field is loſt. He is call'd the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119001:108"/>
                        <hi>roaring lion,</hi> which beaſt commands the whole forreſt; If he roares all tremble, yea, in ſuch a manner, as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates, that he goes amongſt them, and they ſtand exanimated while he chooſeth his prey without reſiſtance; ſuch a lion is Satan, who leads ſinners <hi>captive at his will,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.26. <hi>He takes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi> as the word is, as the Fowler the bird, which with a little ſcrap is enticed into the net; or as the Conquerour his coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy, who has no heart to fight, but yields without conteſt. Such cowards the devil finds ſinners, he no ſooner appears in a motion, but they yield; They are but a very few noble ſpirits and thoſe are the children of the moſt High God, who dare va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly oppoſe him, and in ſtriving againſt ſin reſiſt to blood. He is call'd the <hi>great red dragon,</hi> who with his taile, wicked men his inſtruments, ſweeps down the third part of the ſtars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>The Prince of the power of the aire,</hi> becauſe as a Prince can muſter his ſubjects, and draw them into the field for his ſervice, ſo the devil can raiſe the <hi>poſſe coeli aërii.</hi> In a word, he is call'd <hi>the God of this world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. becauſe ſinners give him a God-like worſhip, feare him as the Saints do God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the devils nature ſhewes his power: 'Tis Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, ye his Angels, that excel in ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 103.20. Strength is put for Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.25. <hi>They did eat Angels food,</hi> Heb. the food of the mighty. In two things the power of Angelical nature will appear; In its Superiority, and in its Spirituality.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, its Superiority, Angels are the top of the Creation; man himſelf made a little lower then the Angels. Now in the works of Creation, the Superiour hath a power over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; the beaſts over the graſſe and herb, man over the beaſts, and Angels over man.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Spirituality of their nature. The weakneſſe of man is from his fleſh: his ſoule made for great enterprizes, but weighed down with a lump of fleſh, is forced to rowe with a ſtrength ſuitable to its weak Partner; but now the devils being Angels have no ſuch incumbrance, no ſumes from a fleſhly part to cloud their underſtanding, which is clear and piercing; no clog at their heele to retard their motion, which for ſwiftneſſe is ſet out by the winde and flame of fire. Yea, being ſpiritual they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119001:109"/>
cannot be reſiſted with carnal force, fire and ſword hurt not them. The Angel which appear'd to <hi>Manoah,</hi> went up in the fire that conſumed the ſacrifice, though ſuch hath been the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and is at this day of ſuperſtitious ones, that they think to charme the devil with their carnal exorciſmes; hence the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Reliques, Croſſe, holy water, yea, and among the Jewes themſelves in corrupter times, who thought by their phylacteries and Circumciſion, to ſcare away the devil, which made ſome of them expound that, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.8. of Circumciſion, <hi>Every man hath his ſword on his thigh, becauſe of feare in the night.</hi> By ſword on the thigh, they expound Circumciſion, which they will vainly have given as a charme againſt evil ſpirits that affright them in the night. But alas, the devil cares for none of theſe, no, not for an Ordinance of God, when by fleſhly confidence we make it a ſpell: he hath been often bound with theſe fetters and chaines, (as is ſaid of him in the Goſpel) and the chaines have been plucked aſunder by him, neither could any man thus tame him. He eſteems, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Leviathan, iron as ſtraw, and braſſe as rotten wood.</hi> It muſt be a ſtronger then the ſtrong man muſt binde him, and none ſtronger but God the Father of ſpirits. The devil loſt indeed by his fall much of his power, in relation to that holy and happy eſtate in which he was created, but not his natural abilities, he is an Angel ſtill, and hath an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the number of devils addes to their power. What lighter then the ſand? yet number makes it weighty? what creature leſſe then lice? yet what plague greater to the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? How formidable then muſt devils be, who are both for nature ſo mighty, and for number ſuch a multitude? there are devils enough to beleaguer the whole earth; not a place under heaven where Satan hath not his troops; not a perſon without ſome of theſe curſed ſpirits haunting and watching him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goes; yea, for ſome ſpecial ſervice he can ſend a legion to keep garriſon in one ſingle perſon, as, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. and if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can be ſpared to attend one, to what a number would the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-rolle of Satans whole army amount if known? And now tell me, if we are not like to finde our march difficult to heaven, (if ever we mean to go thither) that are to paſſe through the very quarters of this multitude, who are ſcattered over the face of all
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119001:109"/>
the earth. When armies are disbanded and the roads full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bautch't ſouldiers, wandering up and down, it's dangerous tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling: we heare then of murders and robberies from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Theſe powers of hell are that party of Angels, who for their mutiny and diſobedience were caſhier'd heaven, and thruſt out of that glorious hoſt, and ever ſince they have ſtragled here below, endeavouring to do miſchief to the children of men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially travelling in heavens road.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, their unity and order makes their number formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. We cannot ſay there is love among them, that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire cannot live in a devils boſome, yet there is unity and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as to this, they are all agreed in their deſigne againſt God and man: ſo their unity and conſent is knit together by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, not of love, but of hatred and policy; Hatred againſt God and his children which they are filled with; and policy, which tells them, that if they agree not in their deſigne, their Kingdome cannot ſtand. And how true they are to this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brotherhood, our Saviour gives a faire teſtimony, when he ſaith, <hi>Satan fights not againſt Satan.</hi> Did you ever heare of any mutiny in the devils army? or that any of thoſe Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did freely yield up one ſoule to Chriſt? They are many, and yet but one ſpirit of wickedneſſe in them all. <hi>My name,</hi> ſaid the devils, (not our name,) <hi>is legion.</hi> The devil is call'd the <hi>Leviathan, Iſa.</hi> 27.1. <hi>The Lord with his ſtrong ſword ſhall puniſh Leviathan,</hi> from their cleaving together of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> compact or joyned together, uſed for the Whale, <hi>Jeb</hi> 4. whoſe ſtrength lies in his ſcales, which are ſo knit, that he is, as it were, covered with armour. Thus theſe curſed ſpirits do accord in their machinations, and labour to bring their inſtruments into the ſame league with them, not contented with their bare obedience, but where they can obtain it do require an expreſſe oath of their ſervants to be true to them, as in witches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, the mighty works that are attributed to theſe evil  ſpirits in Scripture declare their power, and theſe either reſpect the elementary, ſenſible, or intellectual part of the world. The Elementary, what dreadful effects this Prince of the power of the aire is able to produce on that, ſee in the Word; he cannot indeed make the leaſt breath of aire, drop of water, or ſpark of fire, but he can, if let looſe, (as Reverend Maſter <hi>Caryl</hi> ſaith
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119001:110"/>
on <hi>Job</hi> 1.) go to Gods ſtore-houſe, and make uſe of theſe in ſuch a ſort, as no man can ſtand before him; he can hurle the ſea into ſuch a commotion, that the depths ſhall boile like a pot, and diſturb the aire into ſtormes and tempeſts, as if heaven and earth would meet. <hi>Jobs</hi> children were buried in the ruines of their houſe by a puffe of his mouth, yea, he can go to Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, (as the former Author ſaith) and let off the great ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of heaven, cauſing ſuch dreadful thunder and lightning, as ſhall not only affright, but do real execution, and that in a more dreadful way then in the ordinary courſe of nature. If mans Art can ſo ſublimate nature, as we ſee in the invention of powder, that hath ſuch a ſtrange force, much more able is he to draw forth its power. Again, over the ſenſitive world his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is great, not only the beaſts, as in the herd of ſwine, hurried by him into the deep; but over the bodies of men alſo, as in <hi>Iob,</hi> whoſe ſore boiles were not the breakings out of a diſtempered nature, but the print of Satans ſangs on his fleſh, doing that ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, which in nature would have required more time to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ripen: and the demoniacks in the Goſpel grievouſly vexed and tormented by him. But this the devil counts ſmall game, his great ſpite is at the ſoules of men, which I call the Intellectual world, his cruelty to the body is for the ſoules ſake. As Chriſts pity to the bodies of men, (when on earth) healing their diſeaſes, was in a ſubſerviency to the good of their ſoules, bribing them with thoſe mercies ſuitable to their carnal deſires, that they might more willingly receiv mercies for their ſouls, from that hand which was ſo kind to their bodies, as we give children ſomthing that pleaſeth them, to perſwade them to do ſomething that pleaſeth them not, go to ſchool, learn their book: ſo the devil who is cruel, as Chriſt is meek, and wiſheth good neither to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor ſoule, yet ſhewes his cruelty to the body, but on a deſign againſt the ſoule, knowing well that the ſoule is ſoon diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the perturbation of the other, the ſoule cannot but lightly heare, (and ſo have its peace and reſt broken by the groanes and complaints of the body) under whoſe very roof it dwells; and then it is not ſtrange, if as for want of ſleep the tongue talk idly, ſo the ſoule ſhould break out into ſome ſinful carriage, which is the bottom of the devils plot on a Saint. And as for other poor ſilly ſoules, he gaines little leſſe then a God like fear and dread
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119001:110"/>
of them by that power he puts forth (through divine permiſſion) in ſmiting their goods, beaſts and bodies, as among the Indians at this day. Yea, there are many among our ſelves plainly ſhew what a throne Satan hath in their hearts upon this account, ſuch who, as if there were not a God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> go for help and cure to his Doctours, wizzards I mean. And truly had Satan no other way to work his will on the ſoules of men, but by this vantage he takes from the body, yet conſidering the degeneracy of mans ſtate, how low his ſoule is ſunk beneath its primitive extraction, how the body which was a lightſome houſe is now become a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to it, that which was its ſervant is now become its Maſter; it is no wonder he is able to do ſo much. But beſides this, he hath as a ſpirit a neerer way of acceſſe to the ſoule, and as a ſuperiour ſpirit, yet more over man a lower creature. And above all, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got within the ſoule by mans fall, he hath now far more power then before; ſo that where he meets not reſiſtance from God he carrries all before him: As in the wicked, whom he hath ſo at his devotion, that he is (in a ſenſe) ſaid to do that in them, which God doth in the Saints. God works effectually in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. Satan worketh effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the children of diſobedience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the ſame word with the former places, he is in a manner as effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious with them, as the holy Spirit with the other. His deluſions ſtrong, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. They return not <hi>re infectâ.</hi> The Spirit <hi>enlightens,</hi> he <hi>blindes</hi> the mindes of thoſe that believe not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. The Spirit <hi>fills</hi> the Saints, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thy heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias, Acts.</hi> 5.3. <hi>The Spirit fills with knowledge, and the fruits of righteouſneſſe</hi>; Satan fills with envy and all unrighteouſneſſe. The holy Spirit fills with comfort; Satan the wicked with terrours: As in <hi>Saul</hi> vexed by an evil ſpirit; and <hi>Iudas,</hi> into whom 'tis ſaid he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when he had ſatisfied his luſt upon him, (as <hi>Amnon</hi> on <hi>Tamar</hi>) ſhuts the door of mercy upon him, and makes him that was even now Traitour to his Maſter, Hangman to himſelfe. And though Saints be not the proper ſubjects of his power, yet they are the chief objects of his wrath, his foot ſtands on the wickeds back, but he wreſtles with theſe, and when God ſteps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, he is far above their match: He hath ſent the ſtrongeſt among them home, trembling and crying to their God, with the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119001:111"/>
blood running about their conſciences. He is mighty, both as a tempter to and for ſin, knowing the ſtate of the Chriſtians affairs ſo wel, &amp; able to throw his fire-bals ſo far into the inward ſenſes, (whether they be of luſt or horrour) and to blow up theſe with ſuch unwearied ſolicitations, that if they at firſt meet not with ſome ſuitable diſpoſitions in the Chriſtian, at which (as from looſe cornes of powder) they may take fire, (which is moſt ordinary) yet in time he may bring over the creature by the length of the ſiege, and continued volleys of ſuch motions, to liſten to a parley with them, if not a yielding to them. Thus many times he even wearies out the ſoule with importunity.</p>

No greater plague can befall a man then power without grace. Such great ones in the world, while here, make a brave ſhew, like chief Commanders and field-Officers at the head of their Regiments, the common ſouldiers are poor creatures to them; but when the Army is beaten, and all taken priſoners, then they fling off their ſcarfe and feather, and would be glad to paſſe for the meaneſt in the army. Happy would devils be, Princes and great ones in the world be, if then they could appear in the habit of ſome poor ſneaks to receiv their ſentence as ſuch, but then their titles, and dignity, and riches ſhall be read, not for their honour, but further ſhame and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

If the devil be ſo mighty, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens way ſo full of them, then ſure it will coſt hot water before we diſplay our banners upon the walls of that new <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Yet it is plain many think otherwiſe by the proviſion they make for their march.

All (if you ask them) will tell you they are on their way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but how few care for the company of the Saints, as if they needed not their fellowſhip in their journey? Moſt go naked, without ſo much as any thing like armour, have not enough to gaine the name of Profeſſours at large; others, it may be, will ſhew you ſome vaine ſlighty hopes on the mercy of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Scripture-bottom for the ſame, and with theſe content themſelves, which will like a ruſty unſound piſtol flie in their own face, when they come to uſe it, and is it any wrong to ſay theſe make nothing of getting heaven? Surely theſe men, (many
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:119001:112"/>
of whom thrive ſo well in the world) never got their eſtates with ſo little care as they think to get heaven. Ask them why they follow their trade ſo cloſe, they will tell you eſtates are not got by ſleeping, families are not provided for with the hands in the pocket, they meet with many rooks and cheaters in their dealing, who ſhould they not look to themſelves would ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them: and are there none that thou needeſt feare will put a cheat on thy ſoule, and bereave thee of thy crown of glory if they can? thou art blinder then the Prophets ſervant, if thou ſeeſt not more devils encompaſſing thee then he ſaw men about <hi>Samaria.</hi> Thy worldly trade they will not hinder, nay, may be help thee to ſinful tricks in that to hinder thee in this: but if once thou reſolveſt to ſeek out for Chriſt and his grace, they will oppoſe thee to thy face; they are under an oath, as <hi>Pauls</hi> enemies were, to take away the life of thy ſoul if they can; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate creatures themſelves, who know their doom is irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, and ſell their own lives they will as dear as they can.

Let them feare him who feare not God. What are theſe mountains of power and pride before thee, O Chriſtian, who ſerveſt a God that can make a worme threſh a mountain? the greateſt hurt he can do thee, is by nouriſhing this falſe fear of him in thy boſome: It is obſerved (<hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) of ſome beaſts in the forreſt, <hi>Plerunque ſuperant leonem ferientem, quae non ſuſtinent rugientem:</hi> Though they are too hard for the Lion in fight, yet tremble when he roares, Thus the Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he comes to the pinch indeed, is able through Chriſt to trample Satan under his feet, yet before the conflict ſtands trembling at the thought of him. Labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to get a right underſtanding of Satans power, and then this Lion will not appear ſo fierce, as you paint him in your melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly fancy.

at any time you are beſet with the feares of his power.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is a derived power; he hath it not in himſelf, but by  pattent from another, and that no other but God: <hi>All powers are of him,</hi> whether on earth or in hell. This truth ſubſcribed in faith would firſt ſccure thee (Chriſtian) that Satans power ſhall never hurt thee. Would thy Father give him a ſword to miſchief thee his childe? <hi>I have created the Smith</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that bloweth the coales, I have created the waſter to deſtroy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſures them, <hi>that no weapon formed againſt them ſhall proſper,</hi> Iſa. 54.16, &amp;c. If God provides his enemies armes, they ſhall (I warrant you) be ſuch as will do them little ſervice. When <hi>Pilate</hi> thought to ſcare Chriſt, with what he could do towards the ſaving or taking away of his life, he replies, <hi>that he could do nothing except it were given from above, Iohn</hi> 19.10. as if he had ſaid, Do your worſt, I know who ſeal'd your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this conſidered, would meeken and quiet the ſoule, when troubled by Satan within, or his inſtruments without; 'Tis  Satan buffets, man perſecutes me, but God who gives them both power. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) bids him curſe. The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) hath given, and the Lord hath taken.</hi> This kept the Kings peace in both their boſomes. O Chriſtian, look not on the Jayler that whips thee, may be he is cruel, but reade the warrant, who wrote that, and at the bottome thou ſhalt finde thy Fathers hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Satans power is limited, and that two ways; he cannot  do what he will, and he ſhall not do what he can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, he cannot do what he will. His deſires are boundleſſe, they  walk not only to and fro here below, but in heaven it ſelf, where he is pulling down his once fellow-Angels, knocking down the carved-work of that glorious Temple, as with axes and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, yea, unthroning God, and ſetting himſelf in his place, this foole ſaith in his heart, There is no God; but he cannot do this, nor many other things which his canker'd malice ſtirres him up to wiſh; he is but a creature, and ſo hath the length of his Tedder to which he is ſtaked and cannot exceed; and if God be ſafe then thou alſo, for thy life is hid with Chriſt in God; <hi>If I live</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you ſhall live alſo.</hi> You are engraven on the table of his heart, if he plucks one away, he muſt the other alſo.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119001:113"/>
                        <hi>Again,</hi> as he cannot hurt the <hi>being</hi> of God, ſo he cannot pry into the <hi>boſeme</hi> of God. He knowes not <hi>mans,</hi> much leſſe the thoughts of <hi>God.</hi> The Aſtrologers nor their Maſter could bring back <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dream. As men have their cloſets for their own privacy, where none can enter in but with their Key: ſo God keeps the heart as his withdrawing room, ſhut to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf, and therefore when he takes upon him to foretel events: if God teach him not his leſſon, nor ſecond cauſes help him, he is beſide his book; ſo to ſave his credit, delivers them dubiouſly, that his text may beare a gloſſe ſuitable to the effect whatever it is. And when he is bold to tell the ſtate of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is no weight to be laid on his judgment. <hi>Job</hi> was an hypocrite in his mouth, but God proved him a liar. Again, thirdly, he cannot-hinder thoſe purpoſes and counſels of God he knows. He knew Chriſt was to come in the fleſh and did his worſt, but could not hinder his landing, though there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny devices in his heart, yet the counſel of the Lord concerning him did ſtand, yea, was delivered by the midwifery of Satan ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, and his inſtruments executing his luſt as they thought, but fulfilling Gods counſel againſt themſelves. Fourthly, he cannot raviſh thy will, <hi>Diabolus non eſt juſſor vitiorum, ſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centor.</hi> He cannot command thee to ſin againſt thy will; he can <hi>motum agere,</hi> make the ſoule go faſter, that is, on its way, as the winde carries the tide with more ſwiftneſſe, but he cannot turn the ſtream of the heart contrary to its own courſe and tendency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Satans power is ſo limited, that he ſhall not do what he can. God lets out ſo much of his wrath as ſhall praiſe him, and be as a ſtream to ſet his purpoſe of love to his Saints on work, and then lets down the flood-gate by reſtraining the reſidue thereof; God ever takes him off before he can finiſh his work on a Saint. He can (if God ſuffers him) rob the Chriſtian of much of his joy, and diſturb his peace by his cunning inſinuations, but he is under command; he ſtands like a dog by the Table while the Saints ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The want of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration loſeth God his praiſe, and us our comfort, God having lock't up our comfort in the performance of our duty. Did the Chriſtian conſider what Satans power is, and who damms it up;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119001:113"/>
This would alwayes be a Song of praiſe in his mouth. Hath Satan power to rob and burn, kill and ſlay, torment the body, diſtreſſe the minde? whom may I thank that I am in any of theſe out of his hands? doth Satan love one better then <hi>Job</hi>? or am I out of fight, or beſide his walk? is his courage cool'd, or his wrath appeaſ'd, that I ſcape ſo well? no, none of theſe, his wrath is not againſt one, but all the Saints; his eye is on thee, and his arme can reach thee; his ſpirit is not cow'd, nor his ſtomack ſtay'd with thoſe millions he hath devoured, but keen as ever; yea, ſharper, becauſe now he ſees God ready to take away, and the end of the world drawing on ſo faſt. 'Tis thy God alone whom thou art beholden to for all this, his eye keepeth thee; when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan finds the <hi>good man</hi> aſleep, then he finds our <hi>good God</hi> awake; therefore thou art not conſumed, becauſe he changeth not. Did his eye ſlumber or wander one moment, there would need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flood to drown thee, yea, the whole world, then what would come out of this dragons mouth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Satans power is miniſterial, appointed by God for  the ſervice and benefit of the Saints: 'Tis true (as its ſaid of the proud <hi>Aſſyrian,) be weaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo</hi>;<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.7.</note> but it is in his heart to deſtroy thoſe he tempts: but no matter what he thinks: as <hi>Luther</hi> comforted himſelf, when told what had paſſed at the diet at <hi>Noremburg</hi> againſt the Proteſtants, that <hi>it was decreed one way there, but otherwiſe in heaven</hi>; ſo for the Saints comfort, the thoughts which God thinks to them are peace, while Satans are ruine to their graces, and deſtruction to their ſoules; and his counſel ſhall ſtand in ſpite of the devil. The very <hi>mittimus</hi> which God makes, when he commits any of his Saints to the devils priſon, runs thus, <hi>Deliver ſuch a one to Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. ſo that tempted Saints may ſay, we had periſhed if we had not periſhed to our own thinking. This <hi>Leviathan,</hi> while he thinks to ſwallow them up, is but ſent of God, (as the whale to <hi>Jonah</hi>) to waft them ſafe to land. <hi>Some of them of underſtanding ſhall fall to try them, and to purge them, and to make them white,</hi> Dan. 11.35. This God intends when he lets his children fall into temptation, as we do with our lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, the ſpots they get at our feaſts are taken out by waſhing, rubbing and laying them out to bleech. The Saints ſpots are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119001:114"/>
moſt got in peace, plenty and proſperity, and they never recover their whiteneſſe to ſuch a degree as when they come from under Satans ſcouring. We do too little, not to feare Satan, we ſhould comfort our ſelves with the uſefulneſſe and ſubſerviency of his temptations to our good. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> who are Chriſts. He that hath given life to be yours, hath given death alſo. He that hath given heaven for your inheritance, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> his Miniſters and Ordinances to help you thither; hath given the world with all the afflictions of it, yea, the Prince of it too, with all his wrath and power in order to the ſame end. This indeed is love and wiſdom in a riddle, but you who have the Spirit of Chriſt can unfold it.</p>

its gates ſtand alwayes open; never durſt this fiend look into that holy place ſince he was firſt expell'd, but rangeth to and fro here below as a vagabond creature, excommunicated the preſence of God, doing what miſchief he can to Saints in their way to heaven; but is not this matter of great joy, that Satan hath no power there, where the Saints happineſſe lies? What haſt thou (Chriſtian) which thou needeſt value that is not there? Thy Chriſt is there, and if thou loveſt him, thy heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which lives in the boſome of its beloved. Thy friends, and kindred in Chriſt are there, or expected; with whom thou ſhalt have a merry meeting in thy Fathers houſe, notwithſtanding the ſnare on <hi>Tabor,</hi> the plots of Satan which lie in the way. O friends get a title to that Kingdome, and you are above the flight of this Kite. This made <hi>Job</hi> a happy man indeed, who when the devil had plundered him to his skin, and worried him almoſt out of that too, could then vouch Chriſt in the face of death and devils to be his Redeemer, whom he ſhould with thoſe eyes, that now ſtood full with briniſh teares, behold, and that for himſelf as his own portion. It is ſad with him indeed, who is robbed of all he is worth at once, but this can never be ſaid of a Saint. The devil took away <hi>Jobs</hi> purſe, (as I may ſay) which put him into ſome ſtraits, but he had a God in Heaven that put him into ſtock again. Some ſpending money thou haſt at preſent in thy purſe, in the activity of thy faith, the evidence of thy ſon-ſhip, and comfort flowing from the ſame, enlargement in duty and the like, which Satan may for a time diſturb, yea, deprive thee of but he cannot come to the rolls, to blot thy name out of the book of life; he cannot null thy faith, make void thy relation, dry up thy comfort in the Spring, though dam up the ſtream; nor hinder thee a happy iſſue of thy whole war with ſinne, though worſt thee in a private skirmiſh; theſe all are kept in Heaven, among Gods own Crown-Jewels, who is ſaid to keep us by his <hi>power through faith unto ſalvation.</hi>

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119001:116"/>
this world,</hi> that is, ſuch who are in darkneſſe. This word is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſometimes to expreſſe the deſolate condition of a creature in ſome great diſtreſſe, <hi>Iſa</hi> 150. <hi>He that walks in darkneſſe, and ſees no light</hi>; ſometimes to expreſſe the nature of all ſin; ſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1. ſin is called the work of darkneſſe; ſometimes the particular ſin of ignorance; often ſet out by the darkneſſe of the night, blindneſſe of the eye, all theſe I conceive may be mean't, but chiefly the latter; for though Satan makes a foule ſtir in the ſoule; that is, in the dark of ſorrow, whether it be from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſſes or inward deſertions; yet if the creature be not in the darkneſſe of ſinne at the ſame time, though he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb his peace as an enemy, yet cannot be ſaid to rule as a Prince.

                     <p>Firſt, for the darkneſſe of ſin in general.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the darkneſſe of ignorance in ſpecial; and the ſenſe will be, that the devils rule is over thoſe that are in a ſtate of ſin and ignorance, not over thoſe who are ſinful or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſo he would take hold of Saints as well as others; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe who are in a ſtate of ſin, which is ſet out by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, <hi>Ruler of the darkneſſe,</hi> the more to expreſſe the fulneſſe of the ſin and ignorance that poſſeſſeth Satans ſlaves; and the Notes will be two.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Every ſoul in a ſtate of ſin is under the rule of Satan.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, the reaſon why ſin is ſet out by darkneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, how every one in ſuch a ſtate appears to be under the devils rule. For the firſt,</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, ſin may be called darkneſſe, becauſe the ſpring and common cauſe of ſin in man is darkneſſe. The external cauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who is the great promoter of it, he is a curſed ſpirit held in chaines of darkneſſe. The internal is the blindneſſe and darkneſſe of the ſoule: we may ſay when any one ſins, he doth he knowes not what, as Chriſt ſaid of his murtherers. Did the creature know the true worth of the ſoul, (which he now ſells
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119001:117"/>
for a ſong,) the glorious amiable nature of God and his holy wayes, the matchleſſe love of God in Chriſt, the poiſonfull nature of ſin, and all theſe not by a ſudden beam darted into the window at a Sermon, and gone again, like a flaſh of lightning, but by an abiding light; this would ſpoile the devils market, and poor creatures would not readily take this toad into their boſomes; ſin goes in a diſguiſe, and ſo is welcome.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is darkneſſe, becauſe it brings darkneſſe into the ſoul, and that naturally and judicially.</p>
                     <p>Firſt Naturally. There is a noxious quality in ſin offenſive to the underſtanding, which is to the ſoule what the eye and palate are to the body; It diſcernes of things, and diſtinguiſheth true from falſe, as the eye white from black: It tryeth words as the mouth taſteth meats. Now as there are ſome things bad for the ſight, and others bad for the palate vitiating it, ſo that it ſhall not know ſweet from bitter; ſo here ſin beſots the creature, and makes it injudicious, that he who could ſee ſuch a practice abſurd and baſe in others before, when once he hath drunk of this inchanting cup himſelf, (as one that hath for done his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) is mad of it himſelf, not able now to ſee the evil of it, or uſe his reaſon againſt it. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> before he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch't his conſcience, thinks the Witch worthy of death; but after he had trodden his conſcience hard with other foule ſins, goes to ask counſel of one himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſin brings darkneſſe judiciouſly; ſuch have been threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, whoſe eare God hath been trying to open and inſtruct, and have run out of Gods ſchool into the devils, by <hi>rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light,</hi> that they ſhall <hi>die without knowledge, Iob</hi> 36.10, 12. What ſhould the candle burn waſt, when the creature hath more minde to play then work?</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Thirdly, Sinne runs into darkneſſe. Impoſtors bring in their <hi>damnable Hereſies privily,</hi> like thoſe who ſell bad ware, loath to come to the Market, where the Standard tries all; but put it off in ſecret: ſo in moral wickedneſſe, ſinners like beaſts go out in the night for their prey, loath to be ſeen, afraid to come where they ſhould be found out. Nothing more terrible to ſinners then light of truth, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>becauſe their deeds are evil. Felix</hi> was ſo netled with what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, that he could not ſit out the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but flings away in haſte, and adjourns the hearing of <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="215" facs="tcp:119001:117"/>
till a convenient ſeaſon, but he never could finde one. The Sun is not more troubleſome in hot Countreys, then truth is to thoſe who ſit under the powerful preaching of it; and therefore as thoſe ſeldome come abroad in the heat of the day, and when they muſt, have their devices over their heads to skreene them from the Sun; ſo ſinners ſhun as much as may be the preaching of the Word; but if they muſt go to keep in with their relations, or for other carnal advantages, they, if poſſible, will keep off the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of truth, either by ſleeping the Sermon away, or prating it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with any fooliſh imagination which Satan ſends to beare them company and chat with them at ſuch a time: or by chooſing ſuch a coole Preacher to ſit under, whoſe toothleſſe diſcourſe ſhall rather flatter then trouble, rather tickle their fancy then prick their conſciences; and then their ſore eyes can look upon the light. <hi>Froreſeentem amant veritatem qui non redarguentem</hi>: they dare handle and look on the ſword with delight when in a rich ſcabbard, who would run away to ſee it drawn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Sinne is darkneſſe for its uncomfortab'eneſſe, and  that in a threefold reſpect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Darkneſſe is uncomfortable, as it ſhuts out of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. What could the Egyptians do under the plague of darkneſſe but ſit ſtill? and this to an active ſpirit is trouble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Thus in a ſtate of ſinne man is an unſerviceable creature, he can do his God no ſervice acceptably, ſpoiles everything he takes in hand, like one running up and down in a ſhop when win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows ſhut, doth nothing right. It maybe writ on the grave of every ſinner, who lives and dies in that ſtate, Here lies the man, that never did God an hours work in all his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Darkneſſe is uncomfortable in point of enjoyment;  be there never ſuch rare pictures in the roome, if dark, who the better? A ſoul in a ſtate of ſinne may poſſeſſe much, but enjoyes nothing: this is a ſore evil, and little thought of. One thought of its ſtate of enmity to God, would drop bitterneſſe into every cup; all he hath ſmells of hell fire, and a man at a rich feaſt would enjoy it ſure but little, if he ſmelt fire, ready to burn his houſe and himſelf in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Darkneſſe fills with terrours, fears in the night are  moſt dreadfull; a ſtate of ſin is a ſtate of fear. Men that owe much, have no quiet, but when they are aſleep, and not then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119001:118"/>
the cares and fears of the day ſink ſo deep, as makes their reſt troubleſome and unquiet in the night. The wicked hath no peace, but when his conſcience ſleeps, and that ſleeps but broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, awaking often with ſick fits of terrour: when he hath moſt proſperity, he is ſcared like a flock of birds in a corn-field at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very piece going off He eats in fear, and drinks in fear; when afflicted, he expects worſe behinde, and knows not what this cloud may ſpread to, and where it may lay him; whether in hell or not he knows not, and therefore trembles (as one in the dark) not knowing but his next ſtep may be into the pit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, ſin leads to utter darkneſſe; utter darkneſſe is darkneſſe to the utmoſt. Sin in its full height, and wrath in its full heat together; both univerſal, both eternal. Here's ſome mixture, peace and trouble, paine and eaſe; ſin and thoughts of repenting, ſin and hopes of pardon; there the fire of wrath ſhall burn without ſlacking, and ſin run parallel with torment; hell-birds are no changelings; their torment makes them ſin, and their ſin feeds their torment, both unquenchable, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fuel to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, let us ſee how it appears, that ſuch as are under a ſtate of ſin, are under the rule of Satan. Sinners are call'd the children of the devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.10. and who rules the childe but the Father? they are ſlaves; who rules the ſlave but the Maſter? they are the very manſion-houſe of the devil; where hath a man command, but in his own houſe? <hi>I will go to my houſe, Mat.</hi> 12.44. As if the devil had ſaid, I have walk't among the Saints of God, to and fro, knocking at this door and that, and none will bid me welcome, I can finde no reſt; well. I know where I may be bold; I'le even go to my own houſe, and there I am ſure to rule the roſte without controul; and <hi>when he comes, he findes it empty, ſwept and garniſhed</hi>; that is, all ready for his entertainment. Servants make the houſe trim and handſom againſt their Maſter come home, eſpecially when he brings gueſts with him, as here the devil brings <hi>ſeven more.</hi> Look to the ſinner, there is nothing he is or hath, but the devil hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over it: <hi>He rules the whole man,</hi> their mindes blinding them. All the ſinners apprehenſion of things are ſhaped by Satan: he looks on ſin with the devils ſpectacles: he reads the Word with the devils comment: he ſees nothing in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119001:118"/>
colours, but is under a continual deluſion. The very wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a wicked man is ſaid to be <hi>devilliſh, James</hi> 3.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>devil-like,</hi> becauſe taught by the devil, and alſo ſuch as the devils is, <hi>wiſe only to do evil. He commands their Wills,</hi> though not to force them, yet effectually to draw them. <hi>His work</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye will do.</hi> You are reſolved on your way, the devil hath got your hearts, and him you will obey: and therefore when Chriſt comes to recover his throne, he findes the ſoule in an uproare, as <hi>Epheſus</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon, crying him down, and <hi>Diana</hi> up. We will not have this man reigne over us, what is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? <hi>He rules o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all their members,</hi> they are call'd <hi>weapons of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> all at the devils ſervice; as all the armes of a Kingdome, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Prince againſt any that ſhall invade. The head to plot, the hand to act, the feet ſwift to carry the body up and down about his ſervice; <hi>He rules over all he hath.</hi> Let God come in a poor member, and beſeech him to lend him a penny, or beſtow a morſel to refreſh his craving bowels; and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous wretch his hand of charity is withered, that he cannot ſtretch it forth; but let Satan call, and his purſe flies open and heart alſo. <hi>Nabal</hi> that could not ſpare a few fragments for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and his followers, this churle could make <hi>a feaſt like a Prince,</hi> to ſatiate his own luſt of gluttony and drunkenneſſe. <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands their time,</hi> when God calls to duty, to pray, to hear, no time all the week to be ſpared for that; but if the ſinner hears there is a merry meeting, a knot of good fellows at the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; all is thrown aſide to wait on his Lord and Maſter; calling left at ſix and ſevens, yea, wife and children crying, (may be ſtarving) while the wretch is pouring out their very blood, (in waſting their livelihood) at the foot of his luſt. The ſinner is in the <hi>bond of iniquity,</hi> and being bound he muſt obey. He is ſaid to go after his luſt, <hi>as the fool to the ſtocks, Prov.</hi> 7.22. The pinion'd malefactour can aſſoon untie his own armes and legs, and ſo run from his Keeper, as he from his luſts. <hi>They are ſervants,</hi> and their members inſtruments of ſin: even as the Workman takes up his axe and it reſiſts not; ſo doth Satan diſpoſe of them, except God ſaith nay.</p>
                     <p>See here the deplored condition of every one in a ſtate of ſin.<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> He is under the rule of Satan, and government of hell, What

tongue can utter, what heart can conceive the miſery of this ſtate? It was a diſmal day which Chriſt foretold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>When the abomination of deſolation ſhould be ſeen, ſtanding in the Holy place; then (ſaith Chriſt) let him that is in Judea flee into the mountains.</hi> But what was that to this? they were but men, though abominable; theſe devils. They did but ſtand in the material Temple, &amp; defile and deface that: but theſe diſplay their banners in the ſoules of men, pollute that throne, which is more glorious then the material heaven it ſelf, made for God alone to ſit in. They exerciſed their cruelties at furtheſt on the bodies of men, killing and torturing them: here the precious ſoules of men are deſtroyed. When <hi>David</hi> would curſe to purpoſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God, he prayes, that <hi>Satan may be at their right hand.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange ſinners ſhould no more tremble at this, who ſhould they ſee but their ſwine, or a beaſt bewitch't and poſſeſt of the devil run headlong into the ſea, would cry out as half undone: and is not one foul more worth then all theſe? what a plague is it to have Satan poſſeſſe thy heart and ſpirit, hurrying thee in the fury of thy luſts to perdition? O poor man! what a ſad change haſt thou made? Thou who wouldeſt not ſit under the meek and peaceful Government of God thy rightful Lord, art paid for thy rebellion againſt him, in the cruelty of this Tyrant who writes all his Lawes in the blood of his ſubjects, and why will you ſit any longer, (O ſinners) under the ſhadow of this <hi>Bramble,</hi> from whom you can expect nothing but eternal fire, to come at laſt and devoure you? Behold, Chriſt is in the field, ſent of God to recover his right, and your liberty. His royal Standard is pitch't in the Goſpel, and Proclamation made, that if any poor ſinners, weary of the devils Government, and heavy laden with the miſerable chaines of his ſpiritual bondage, (ſo as theſe irons of his ſins enter into his very ſoule to afflict it with the ſenfe of them) ſhall thus come, and repair to Chriſt: he ſhall have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from Gods juſtice, the devils wrath, and ſins dominion; In a word,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.

                        <hi>he ſhall have reſt,</hi> and that <hi>glorious.</hi> Uſually when a people have been ground with the oppreſſion of ſome bloody Tyrant, they are apt enough to long for a change, and to liſten to any overture that gives them hope of liberty, though reached by the hand of a ſtranger, who may prove as bad as the other, yet bondage is ſo grievous, that people deſire to change, (as
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119001:119"/>
ſick men their beds) though they finde little eaſe thereby. Why then ſhould deliverance be unwelcome to you, ſinners? Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance brought not by a ſtranger whom you need feare, what his deſigne is upon you; but your near Kinſman in blood, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean you ill, but he muſt firſt hate his own fleſh;<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14, 15.</note> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever did that? To be ſure not he, who though he took part of our fleſh, that he might have the right of being our Redeemer: yet would have no kindred with us in the ſinfulneſſe of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And 'tis ſin that makes us cruel, yea, to our own fleſh.<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> What can you expect from him but pure mercy, who is himſelf pure? They are <hi>the mercies of the wicked which are cruel.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it (Sirs) Chriſt counts it his honour, that he is a King of a willing people, and not of ſlaves. He comes to make you free, not to bring you into bondage; to make you Kings, not vaſſals. None give Chriſt an evil word, but thoſe who never were his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Enquire but of thoſe who have tried both Satans ſervice and Chriſts; they are beſt able to reſolve you what they are. You ſee when a ſoul comes over from Satans quarters unto Chriſt, and has but once the experience of that ſweetneſſe which is in his ſervice, there is no getting him back to his old drudgery, as they ſay of thoſe, who come out of the North, (which is cold and poor) they like the warme South ſo well, they ſeldome or never go back more. What more dreadful to a gracious ſoul then to be delivered into the hands of Satan? or fall under the power of his luſts? It would chooſe rather to leap into a burning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, then be commanded by them. This is the great requeſt a childe of God makes, that he would rather whip him in his houſe, then turne him out of it to become a prey to Satan. O ſinners, did you know (which you cannot till you come over to Chriſt and embrace him as your Lord &amp; Saviour) what the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Chriſts ſervants are, &amp; what gentle uſage Saints have at Chriſts hands, you would ſay thoſe were the only happy men in the world, which ſtand continually before him.

Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is a Prince that loves to ſee his people thrive, and grow rich under his Government.

                        <hi>that they might obtain a better reſurrection.</hi> But what a riddle is this, that forlorne ſoules bound with the chaines of their luſts, and the irreſiſtible decree of God for their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (if they believe not on the Lord Jeſus,) ſhould, as they are driving to execution, refuſe deliverance? This may ſet heaven and earth on wondring. Surely, dying in their ſins, they cannot hope for a better reſurrection then they have a death. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid rather, that they do not firmly believe they ſhall have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſurrection; and then no wonder they make ſo light of Chriſts offer, who think themſelves ſafe, when once earth't in this burrough of the grave. But let ſinners know, 'tis not the grave can hold them, when the day of Aſſize comes, and the Judge calls for the priſoners to the bar. The grave was never intended to be a Sanctuary to deſend ſinners from the hand of juſtice, but a cloſe Priſon to ſecure them againſt the day of trial, that they may be forth-coming. Then ſinners ſhall be digg'd out of their burroughs, and dragg'd out of their holes to anſwer their contempt of Chriſt and his grace. O how will you be aſtoniſh't to ſee him become your Judge, whom you now refuſe to be your King? to heare that Goſpel witneſſe againſt you for your damnation, which at the ſame time ſhall acquit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their ſalvation? what think you to do, ſinners, in that day? wilt thou cry and ſhream for mercy at Chriſts hands?

then are unprofitable, when no place left for repentance, either in Chriſts heart or thine own. Or meaneſt thou to apply thy ſelf to thy old Lord, in whoſe ſervice thou haſt undone thy ſoule, and cry to him, as ſhe to <hi>Ahab,</hi> Help, O King: Alas, thine eye ſhall ſee him in the ſame condemnation with thy ſelf. Hadſt thou not better now renounce the devils rule, while thou mayeſt be received into Chriſts Government? poure out thy tears and cries now for mercy and grace when they are to be had, then to ſave them for another world to no purpoſe?</p>

                        </label> The difficulty of this great work lies not in prevailing with Chriſt to receive thee for his ſubject,   who refuſeth none that in truth of heart deſire to come under his ſhadow. It doth not ſtand with his deſigne to reject any ſuch. Do Phyſicians uſe to chide their Patients away? Lawyers their Clients? or Generals diſcourage thoſe who fall off from the enemy, and come to their ſide? ſurely no. When <hi>David</hi> was in the field, 'tis ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Every one that was in diſtreſſe, in debt, or in diſcontent ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themſelves to him, and he became a Captain over them.</hi> And ſo will Chriſt be to every one that is truly diſcontented with Satans Government, and upon an inward diſlike thereof repairs to him. But the maine buſineſſe will be to take thee off from thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to thy luſts and Satan, till which be done, Chriſt will not own thee as a ſubject, but look on thee as a Spy. It fares with ſinners as with ſervants. There may be fallings out between them and their Maſters, and high words paſſe between them, that you would think they would take up their pack and be gone in all haſte: but the fray is ſoon over, and by next morning all is forgot, and the ſervants are as hard at their work as ever. O how oft are ſinners taking their leave of their luſts, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving warning to their old Maſters, they will repent and reform, and what not? but in a few dayes they have repented of their repentance, and deformed their reformings, which ſhewes they were drunk with ſome paſſion, when they thought or ſpake this; and no wonder they reverſe all when they come to their true temper. Now becauſe Satan has many policies, by which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:119001:121"/>
he uſeth to keep his hold of ſinners; I ſhall diſcover ſome of them, which if thou canſt withſtand, it will be no hard matter to bring thee out of his power and rule.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Satan doth his utmoſt, that ſinners may not have any ſerious thoughts of the miſerable ſtate they are in, while under his rule; or heare any thing from others, which might the leaſt unſettle their mindes from his ſervice. Conſideration (he knowes) is the firſt ſtep to repentance: He that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his wayes what they are, and whither they lead him, is not like to change them in haſte. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtirr'd not, while <hi>Moſes</hi> came, and had ſome diſcourſe with them about their woful ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and the gracious thoughts of God towards them; and then they begin to deſire to be gone. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſoon bethought him what conſequence might follow upon this, and cunningly labours to prevent by doubling their task: <hi>Ye are idle, ye are idle, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſay, Let us go, and do ſacrifice to the Lord. Go thorefore and work,</hi> Exod. 5.17, 18. As if he had ſaid, Have you ſo much ſpare time to think of gadding into the wilderneſſe, and have you your ſeditious Conventicles, (<hi>Moſes</hi> and you) to lay your plots together? I'le break the knot, give them more work, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them all over the land to gather ſtraw, that they may not meet to entice one anothers hearts from my ſervice. Thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is very jealous of the ſinner, afraid every Chriſtian that ſpeaks to him, or Ordinance he hears ſhould inveigle him. By his good-will he ſhould come at neither, no, nor have a thought of heaven or hell from one end of the week to the other, and that he may have as few as may be, he keeps him full-handed with work. The ſinner grindes, and he is filling the hopper, that the Mill may not ſtand ſtill. He is with the ſinner as ſoone as he wakes, and fills his wretched heart with ſome wicked thoughts, which as a morning draught may keep him from the infection of any favour of good, that may be breathed on him by others in the day-time. All the day long he watcheth him, as the Maſter would do his man, that he feares will run away. And at night he like a careful Jayler locks him up again in his chamber with more bolts and fetters upon him, not ſuffering him to ſleep as he lies on his bed, <hi>till he hath done ſome miſchief.</hi> Ah, poor wretch! was ever ſlave ſo look't to?<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> as long as the devil can keep thee thus, thou art his own ſure enough. The Prodigal <hi>came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:119001:121"/>
before he came to his Father. He conſidered with himſelf what a ſtarving condition he was in, his huskes were poor meat, and yet he had not enough of them neither, and how eaſily he might mend his commons, if he had but grace to go home and humble himſelf to his Father. Now and not till now he goes: Reſolve thus poor ſinner to ſit down and conſider what thy ſtate is, and what it might be, if thou wouldeſt but change the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Satan for the ſweet Government of Jeſus Chriſt. Firſt, ask thy ſoule, whether the devil can, after thou haſt worne out thy miſerable life herein his drudg'ry, prefer thee to a happy ſtate in the other world, or ſo much as ſecure thee from a ſtate of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wo? If he cannot, whether there be not one <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who is able and willing to do it? and if ſo, whether it be not bloody cruelty to thy precious ſoul, to ſtay any longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of this bramble, when thou mayeſt make ſo bleſſed a change? A few of theſe thoughts abidingly laid home to thy ſoule, (may God ſtriking in with them) ſhake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the devils priſon, and make thee haſte as faſt from him, as one out of a houſe on fire about his eares.</p>
                     <p n="2">2ly. Satan hath his inſtruments to oppoſe the meſſengers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which God ſends by them to bring the ſinner out of Satans rule. When <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, up ſtart <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> to reſiſt him. When <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth to the <hi>Deputy,</hi> the devil hath his Chaplain at Court to hinder him: <hi>Elymas,</hi> one that was <hi>full of all ſubtilty and miſchief.</hi> Some or other (to be ſure) he will finde, when God is parlying with a ſinner, and perſwading him to come over to Chriſt, that ſhall labour to clog the work. Either carnal friends, theſe he ſends to plead his cauſe, or old companions in wickedneſſe, theſe beſtir them, one while labouring to jeer him out of his new way, or if that take not, by turning their old love into bitter wrath againſt him for playing the Apoſtate, and leaving him ſo. Or if yet he will not be ſtopt in his way, then he hath his daubing Preachers, (ſtill like <hi>Iobs</hi> meſſengers the laſt the worſt) who with their ſoul-flattering, or rather murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine ſhall go about to heal his wound ſlightly. Now as ever you deſire to get out of Satans bondage, have a care of all theſe, harden thy ſelf againſt the entreaties of carnal friends and relations. Reſolve, that if thy children ſhould hang about thy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119001:122"/>
knees to keep thee from Chriſt, thou wilt throw them away. If thy father and mother ſhould lie proſtrate at thy foot, rather then not go to Chriſt, to go over their very backs to him. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can we part with their love upon ſuch advantageous termes as theſe. And for thy brethren in iniquity, I hope thou doeſt not mean to ſtay while thou haſt their good will, then even ask the devils alſo. Heaven is but little worth if thou haſt not a heart to deſpiſe a little ſhame, and beare a few frumps from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> for thy hopes of it. Let them ſpit on thy face, Chriſt will wipe it off; let them laugh ſo thou winneſt. If they follow not thy example before they die, the ſhame will be their own; God himſelf ſhall ſpit it on their face before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and then kick them into hell. And laſtly, ſcape but the ſnare of thoſe flatterers, who uſe their tongues only to lick ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conſciences whole with their <hi>placentia</hi>'s ſoothing doctrine, and thou art faire for a Chriſt; ask not counſel of them, they may go about to give you eaſe, but all thoſe ſtitches with which they ſowe up thy wounds, muſt be ripp't open, or thou dieſt for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Satan labours to while off the ſinner with delayes. Floating, flitting thoughts of repenting he feares not, he can give ſinners leave to talk what they will do; ſo he can beg time, and by his Art keep ſuch thoughts from coming to a head, and ripening into a preſent reſolution; few are in hell but thought of repenting; but Satan ſo handled the matter, that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pitch upon the time in earneſt when to do it. If ever thou meaneſt to get out of his clutches, flie out of his doors, and run for thy life, whereever this warning findes thee ſtay not, though in the midſt of thy joyes, with which thy luſts entertain thee: As the paper which came to <hi>Brentius,</hi> (from that Senatour his dear friend) took him at ſupper with his wife and children, and bade him flee <hi>citò, citiùs, citiſſimè</hi>; which he did, leaving his dear company and ſweet cheere; ſo do thou or elſe thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thy ſtay when 'tis too late. A viſion charged the <hi>wiſe men</hi> to go back another way, and not ſo much as ſee <hi>Herod,</hi> though he had charged them otherwiſe. O go not back, drunkard, to thy good fellows; adulterer to thy Queanes; covetous wretch, to thy uſury and unlawful gaine: turne another way, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie not the devil a moment. The command ſaith, now re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119001:122"/>
the Imperative hath no future tenſe. God ſaith, <hi>To day, while it is to day</hi>: The devil ſaith, To morrow; which wilt thou obey, God or him? Thou ſayeſt, thou meaneſt at laſt to do it, then why not now? Wilt thou ſtand with God for a day or two, huckle with him for a penny? Heaven is not ſuch a hard pennyworth, but thou mayeſt come up to his termes: And which is the morrow thou meaneſt? thou haſt but a day in thy life for ought thou knoweſt, where then canſt thou find a morrow for repentance? but ſhouldeſt thou have as many dayes to come is <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived, yet know, ſin is hereditary, and ſuch ſort of diſeaſes grow more upon us with our years. 'Tis with long accuſtomed ſinners, as with thoſe who have ſate long under a Government, they rather like to be as they are, (though but ill on it) then think of a change, or like thoſe who in a journey have gone out of their way all the day, will rather take any new way, overhedge and ditch, then think of going ſo far back to be ſet right.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Satan labours to comprimiſe the buſineſſe, and bring it to a compoſition between him and Chriſt: when conſcience will not be pacified, then Satan for quiets ſake will yield to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with <hi>Moſes</hi>: after much ado he is willing they ſhould go, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.28. <hi>And Pharaoh ſaid, I will let you go, that you may ſacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderneſſe.</hi> But then comes in his caution, <hi>only you ſhall not go very farre away.</hi> Thus Satan will yield the ſinner may pray, and heare the Word, and make a goodly Profeſſion, ſo he doth not go very far, but that he may have him again at night. If God hath the mattins, he looks for the vigils, and thus he is content the day ſhould be divided. Doth conſcience preſſe a reformation and change of the ſinners courſe, rather then faile, he'll grant that alſo: yet as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he yielded they ſhould go, he meant <hi>their little ones ſhould ſtay behinde as a pledge for thoſe that went,</hi> Exod. 10.11. So Satan muſt have ſome one ſin that muſt be ſpared, and no matter though it be a little one. Now if ever you would get out of the devils rule, make no compoſition with him. Chriſt will be King or no King. Not a hoofe muſt be left behinde, or any thing which may make an errand for thee afterwards to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Take therefore thy everlaſting farewel of every ſin, as to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119001:123"/>
the ſincere and fixt purpoſe of thy heart, or thou doeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Paul</hi> joynes his faith and his purpoſe togethes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. not the one without the other. At the promulgation of the Law in <hi>Sinai,</hi> God did, as it were, give <hi>Iſrael</hi> the oath of Allegiance to him; then he told them what law he would rule them by, and they gave their conſent: this was the <hi>eſpouſal</hi> which God puts them in minde of, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. in which they were ſolemnly married together, as King and ſubjects. Now mark, before God would do this, he will have them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> They could not obey his lawes, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s idolatrous cuſtomes alſo, and therefore he will have them out, before he ſolemnly eſpouſeth them to be a Nation peculiarly his. Thou muſt be a widow before Chriſt marry thee, he will not lie by the ſide of anothers wife. O that it were come to this! then the match would ſoon be made between Chriſt and thee. Let me ask thee, poor ſoul, haſt thou ſeriouſly conſidered who Chriſt is, and what his ſweet Government is? and couldeſt thou finde in thy heart (out of an inward abhorrency of ſin and Satan, and a liking to Chriſt) to renounce ſin and Satan, and chooſe Chriſt for thy Lord? Doth thy ſoule ſay as <hi>Rebecca, I will go,</hi> if I could tell how to get to him. But alas, I am here a poore priſoner, I cannot ſhake off my fetters, and ſet my ſelf at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come unto Chriſt. Well, poor ſoul, canſt thou groan heartily under thy bondage? then for thy comfort know, thy deliverance is at the door; he that heard the cry of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> will hear thine alſo, yea, come and ſave thee out of the hands of thy luſts. He will not, as ſome, who entangle thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by making love to thee, and then give over the ſuit, and come at thee no more. If Chriſt has won thy heart, he'll be true to thee, and be at all the coſt to bring thee out of thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-houſe alſo, yea, take the paines to come for thee himſelfe, and bring with him theſe wedding-garments in which he will carry thee from thy priſon to his Fathers houſe with joy, where thou ſhalt live not only as a ſubject under his Law, but as a Bride in the boſome of his love, and what can be added to thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more? when thy Prince is thy husband, and that ſuch a Prince to whom all other are vaſſals, even the Prince of the world himſelf; and yet ſo gracious, that his Majeſty hinders not his familiar converſe with thee a poor creature, but addes to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119001:123"/>
the condeſcent thereof, therefore God chooſeth to mixe names of greatneſſe and relation together; the one to ſweeten the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Thy Maker is thy husband, thy Redeemer the Holy One of Iſrael. The God of the whole earth ſhall he be called, Iſa.</hi> 54.5. And to uſher in thoſe promiſes with titles of greateſt dread and terrour to the creature, that hold forth the greateſt condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love; How can God ſtoop lower then to come and dwell with a poor humble ſoule? which is more, then if he had ſaid ſuch a one ſhould dwell with him; for a beggar to live at Court is not ſo much as the King to dwell with him in this cottage. Yet this promiſe is uſher'd in with the moſt magnificent titles; <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabits eternity, whoſe Name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. and why ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles? but to take away the feares, which his Saints are prone to take up from them. Will the high and lofty One, (ſaith the humble ſoule) look on me a poor worme? will the Holy God come near ſuch an unclean creature, (ſaith the contrite one?) <hi>Iſaiah</hi> himſelf cried he was undone at the ſight of God, and this attribute proclaim'd before him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. Now God prefixeth theſe, that the creature may know his Majeſty and holineſſe, which ſeems ſo terrible to us, are no prejudice to his love; yea, ſo gracious a Prince is thy husband, that he delights rather his Saints ſhould call him by names of love, then ſtate. <hi>Thou ſhalt call me Iſhi, and ſhalt no more call me Baali,</hi> Hoſ. 2.16. that is, my Husband, not my Lord.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Ignorance opens the door for Satan to enter in with his troops of luſts; where the watch is blinde, the City is ſoon taken: an ignorant man ſins, and like drunken <hi>Lot,</hi> he knowes not when the tempter comes, nor when he goes: he is like a man that walks in his ſleep, knowes not where he is, nor what he does. <hi>Father, forgive them,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>they know not what they do.</hi> The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. having reproved the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of ſome, <hi>verſe</hi> 32. who made the conſideration of death, by which others are awed from ſinne, a provocative to ſinne, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die,</hi> he gives an account of this abſurd reaſoning; <hi>All have not the knowledge of God.</hi> An ignorant perſon is a man in ſhape, and a beaſt in heart. <hi>There is no knowledge in the land,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.2: and ſee what a regiment followes this blinde Captain, ſwearing; lying, killing, ſtealing, and what not?

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ignorance as it lets ſin in, ſo it locks it up, and the ſoule in it, ſuch a one lies in Satans inner dungeon, where no light of conviction comes, darkneſſe inclines to ſleep, a blinde minde and a drowſie conſcience go together. When the ſtorme aroſe, the mariners who were awake fell a praying to their God; but the ſleeper feares nothing. Ignorance layes the ſoule aſleep under the hatches of ſtupidity. God hath planted in the beaſt a natural feare of that which threatens hurt to it. Go to thruſt a beaſt into a pit, and it hangs back, nature ſhewes its abhorrency. Man being of a nobler nature, and ſubject to more dangers, God hath ſet a double guard on him, as a natural feare of danger, ſo a natural ſhame that covers the face at the doing of any unworthy action. Now an ignorant man hath ſlipt from both theſe his Keepers: he ſins and bluſheth not, becauſe he knowes not his guilt: he wants that Magiſtrate within, which ſhould put him to ſhame; neither is he afraid, becauſe he knowes not his danger;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:119001:124"/>
and therefore he playes with his ſin; as the childe with the waves, that by and by will ſwallow him up. Conſcience is Gods alarm to call the ſinner up; It doth not alwayes ring in his eare that hath knowledge, being uſually ſet by God to go off at ſome ſpecial houre; when God is ſpeaking in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or ſtriking in a Providence; but in an ignorant ſoule, this is ſilent. The Clock cannot go when the weights are taken off; Conſcience is only a witneſſe to what it knows.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, ignorance ſhuts out the means of recovery. Friends  and Miniſters, yea, Chriſt himſelf ſtands without, and cannot help the creature, as ſuch threatenings and promiſes, all of no uſe; he feares not the one, he deſires not the other, becauſe he knows neither: Heaven-way cannot be found in the dark, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt thing God doth, is to ſpring in with a light, and let the creature know where he is, and what the way is to get out of his priſon-houſe, without which all attempts to eſcape are in vain. There is ſome ſhimmering light in all, <hi>Non dantur purae tenebrae,</hi> I think, is good Divinity as well as Philoſophy: and this night-light may diſcover many ſins, produce inward prickings of conſcience for them, yea, ſtir up the creature to ſtep aſide, rather then drown in ſuch broad waters. There are ſome ſins ſo cruel and coſtly, that the moſt proſtrate ſoul may in time be weary of their ſervice for low ends: but what will all this come to, if the creature be not acquainted with Chriſt the true way to God, faith and repentance the only way to Chriſt? ſuch a one after all this buſle, in ſtead of making an eſcape from Satan, will run full into his mouth another way. There are ſome wayes, which at firſt ſeem right to the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; yet winde about ſo inſenſibly, that when a man hath gone far, and thinks himſelf near home, he is carried back to the place from whence he ſet forth. This will befall every ſoule ignorant of Chriſt, and the way of life through him; after many yeares travel, as they think, towards heaven by their good meanings, blinde devotions and reformation, when they ſhall expect to be within ſight of heaven, they ſhall finde themſelves even where they were at firſt, as very ſlaves to Satan as ever.</p>

'Tis the ſoul is the child rather then the body: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Scripture put for the whole man. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> went forth <hi>with all the ſouls they had gotton in Haran,</hi> Gen. 12. ſo <hi>All the ſouls that came with</hi> Jacob <hi>into</hi> Egypt, that is, all the perſons. The body is but the ſheath; and if one ſhould leave his ſword with you to be kept ſafely for him, would you throw away the blade, and onely preſerve the ſcabbard? And yet parents do commonly judge of their care and love to their children by their providing for the outward man, by their breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that teaching them how to live like men (as they ſay) when they are dead and gone, and comport themſelves to their civil place and rank in the world, Theſe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are commendable, but is not the moſt weighty buſineſſe of all forgotten in the meane time, while no endeavour is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they may live as Chriſtians, and know how to carry themſelves in duty to God and man as ſuch? and can they do this without the knowledge of the holy rule they are to walk by? I am ſure <hi>David</hi> knew no means effectual without this, and therefore propounds the queſtion, <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?</hi> and he reſolves it in the next words, <hi>By taking heed thereto according to thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.9. And how ſhall they compare their way and the Word together, if not inſtructed? our children are not borne with Bibles in their heads or hearts. And who ought to be the inſtructer if not the parent? yea, who will do it with ſuch natural affection? As I have heard ſometimes a mother ſay in other reſpects, Who can take ſuch pains with my childe, and be ſo careful as my ſelf that am its Mother? Bloody parents then they are who acquaint not their
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119001:125"/>
children with God or his Word; what do they but put them under a neceſſity of periſhing, if God ſtirre not up ſome to ſhew more mercy then themſelves to them. Is it any wonder to hear that ſhip to be ſunk, or daſht upon the rock, which was put to ſea without card or compaſſe? no more is it, they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph themſelves in ſin and perdition, that are thruſt forth into the world (which is a ſea of temptation) without the knowledge of God or their duty to him. In the fear of God think of it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: your children have ſouls, and theſe God ſet you to watch over; It will be a poor account at the laſt day, if you can only ſay, Lord, here are my children. I bred them compleat Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, left them rich and wealthy. The ruſt of that ſilver you left them will witneſſe your folly and ſinne, that you would do ſo much for that which ruſts, and nothing for the enriching their mindes with the knowledge of God, which would have endured for ever; happy if you had left them leſſe money and more knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider it hath ever been the Saints practice to inſtruct and teach their children the way of God. <hi>David</hi> we finde dropping inſtruction into his ſonne <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 28.9. <hi>Know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde.</hi> Though a King, he did not put it off to his Chaplins, but whetted it on him with his own lips. Neither was his Queen <hi>Bathſheba</hi> forgetful of her duty, her gracious counſel is upon record, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. and that ſhe may do it with the more ſeriouſneſſe and ſolemnity, we finde her ſtirring up her motherly bowels, to let her ſonne ſee, that ſhe fetcht her words deep, even from her heart. <hi>What my ſon! and what the ſonne of my womb! and what the ſonne of my vows?</hi> Ver. 2. Indeed that counſel is moſt like to go to the heart, which comes from thence. Parents know not what impreſſion ſuch melting expreſſions of their love mingled with their inſtructions leave on their children. God bids <hi>draw forth our ſouls to the hungry,</hi> that is more then draw our purſe, which may be done, and the heart hard and churliſh. Thus we ſhould draw forth our ſouls with our inſtructions. What need I tell of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Mother and Grandmother who acquainted him with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture from his youth? And truly I think, that man calls in queſtion his own Saintſhip, that takes no care to acquaint his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119001:126"/>
childe with God, and the way that leads to him. I have known ſome, that though prophane themſelves, have been very ſolicitous, their children ſhould have good education; but never knew I a Saint that was regardleſſe whether his childe knew God or not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is an act of great unrighteouſneſſe not to inſtruct our children. We read of ſome <hi>that hold the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>: among others thoſe Parents do it, that lock up the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe ſaving truths from their children, which God hath imparted to themſelves. There is a double unrighteouſneſſe in it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt they are unrighteous to their children, who may lay as much claime to their care of inſtructing them, as to their labour and induſtry in laying up a temporal eſtate for them. If he ſhould do unrighteouſly with his childe, that ſhould not endeavour to provide for his outward maintenance, or having gathered an eſtate, ſhould lock it up, and deny his childe neceſſaries, then much more he that lives in ignorance of God, whereby he renders himſelf incapable of providing for his childes ſoul; but moſt of all, he that having gather'd a ſtock of knowledge, yet hides it from his childe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are unrighteous to God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, in that they keep that talent in their own hands which was given to be paid out to their children. When God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd himſelf to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he had reſpect to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children, and therefore we finde God promiſing himſelf this at <hi>Abraham</hi>'s hands, upon which he imparts his minde to him concerning his purpoſe of deſtroying <hi>Sodom; Shall I hide from Abraham</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that thing Which I do? I know that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18.17, 19. The Church began at firſt in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and was preſerv'd by the godly care of Parents in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing their children and houſhold in the truths of God, whereby the knowledge of God was tranſmitted from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation; and though now the Church is not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch ſtrait limits, yet every private family is as a little nurſery to the Church; if the nurſery be not carefully planted, the Orchard will ſoon decay. O could you be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Chriſtians, that your children when you are laid in the duſt, ſhould be turn'd into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119001:126"/>
and prove a generation that do not know God? Atheiſme needs not be planted, you do enough to make your children ſuch, if you do not endeavour to plant Religion in their mindes. The very neglect of the Gardner to ſowe and dreſſe his garden, gives advantage enough to the weeds to come up. This is the difference between Religion and Atheiſme, Religion doth not grow without planting, but will die even where it is planted without watering. Atheiſme, irreligion, and profaneneſſe are weeds will grow without ſetting, but they will not die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plucking up, all care and means little enough to ſtub them up. And therefore you that are Parents, and do not teach your children, deale the more unrighteouſly with God, becauſe you neglect the beſt ſeaſon in their whole life for planting in them the knowledge of God, and plucking up the contrary weeds of atheiſme and irreligion. Young weeds come up with moſt eaſe, ſimple ignorance in youth becomes wilful ignorance, yea, impudence in age, you will not inſtruct them when young, and they will ſcorne their Miniſters ſhould when they are old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, you deale unrighteouſly with God, that traine not  up your children in the knowledge of God, becauſe your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if you be Chriſtian Parents are Gods children; they ſtand in a foederal relation to him, which the children of others do not; and ſhall Gods children be nurtured with the devils edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? Ignorance is that which he blindes the mindes of the children of diſobedience withal. Shall Godschildren have no better breeding? The children of a Jew God made account were borne to him; <hi>Thy ſons and daughters whom thou haſt borne to me,</hi> Ezek. 16.20. God had by the Covenant which he made with that people, married them unto himſelf, and therefore as the wife bears her children to her husband, (they are his children) ſo God calls the children of the Jews his, and complains of it as an horrible wickedneſſe in them, that they ſhould not bring them up as his: but offer them up to <hi>Molech, They have ſlain my children,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>v.</hi> 21. And are not the children of a Chriſtian his children as well as the Jewes were? hath God recall'd or altered the firſt Covenant, and cut off the entaile; and dareſt thou ſlay not only thy children, but the Lords alſo? and is not ignorance that bloody knife that doth it?
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119001:127"/>
                        <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge,</hi> Hoſea 4.6. Do you not tremble to offer them not to <hi>Molech,</hi> but the devil, whom before you had given up to God, when you brought them to that ſolemn ordinance of Baptiſme, and there deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man that they might become Covenant-ſervants to the Lord? and haſt thou bound them to him, and never teach them, either who their Lord and Maſter is, or what their duty is as his ſervants? of thy own mouth God will condemn thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, conſider you who are Parents, that by not inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your children, you entitle your ſelves to all the ſins they ſhall commit to their death. We may ſin by a proxy, and make anothers fact our own. <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſaith God by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi>) <hi>ſlaine him with the ſword of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Ammon,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.9. So thou mayeſt pierce Chriſt, and ſlay him over and over with the bloody ſword of thy wicked children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou beeſt not the more careful to train them up in the feare of God: There might be ſomething ſaid for that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who when the Scholar abuſed him, fell upon the Maſter and ſtruck him. Indeed 'tis poſſible he might be in the moſt fault. When the childe breaks the Sabbath, it is his ſin; but more the fathers, if he never taught him what the command of God was. And if the Parent be acceſſary to the ſin of the childe, it will be hard for him to eſcape a Partnerſhip, yea, a Precedency in the puniſhment. O what a ſad greeting will ſuch have of their children at the great day! will they not then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you to be the murderers of their precious ſoules, and lay their blood at your door, curſing you to your face that taught them no better? But grant, that by the interpoſition of thy time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repentance, thou ſecureſt thy ſoule from the judgement of that day; yet God can ſcourge thee here for the neglect of thy duty to them. How oft do we ſee children become heavy croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ſuch Parents? It is juſt that they ſhould not know their duty to thee, who didſt not teach them their duty to God; or if thou ſhouldeſt not live ſo long to ſee this, yet ſure thou canſt not but go in ſorrow to thy grave, to leave children behind thee that are on their way to hell. Some think, that <hi>Lots</hi> lingring ſo long in <hi>Sodom,</hi> was his loathneſſe to leave his ſons in law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, to periſh in the flames. No doubt (good man) it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119001:127"/>
was very grievous to him, and this might make him ſtay plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, till the Angel pull'd him away. And certainly nothing makes holy Parents more loath to be gone out of this Sodomitical world, then a deſire to ſee their children out of the reach of that fire, (before they go) that God will rain upon the heads of ſinners. You know not how ſoon the meſſenger may come to pluck you hence; do your beſt while you are among them to win them home to God.</p>

Let this ſtir up your bowels  of compaſſion towards thoſe many ignorant ſoules in your reſpective Congregations, who know not the right hand from the left. This, this is the great deſtroyer of the countrey, which Miniſters ſhould come forth againſt with all their care and ſtrength. More are ſwept to hell with this plague of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual darkneſſe then any other. Where the light of knowledge and conviction is, there commonly is a ſenſe and pain that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the ſinner when he doth evil, which forceth ſome now and then to enquire for a Phyſician, and come in the diſtreſſe of their ſpirits to their Miniſter or others for counſel, but the ignorant ſoul feels no ſuch ſmart; if the Miniſter ſtay till he ſends for him to inſtruct him, he may ſooner hear the bell go for him, then any meſſenger come for him; you muſt ſeek them out, and not expect that they will come to you. Theſe are a ſort of people that are afraid more of their remedy, then their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſtudy more to hide their ignorance, then how they may have it cured, which ſhould make us pity them the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can pity themſelves ſo little. I confeſſe, it is no ſmall unhappineſſe to ſome of us, who have to do with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that we have neither time nor ſtrength to make our addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to every particular perſon in our Congregations, and attend on them as their needs require, and yet cannot well ſatisfie our conſciences otherwiſe. But let us look to it, that though we cannot do to the height of what we would, we be not found wanting in what we may. Let not the difficulty of our Province make us like ſome, who when they ſee they have more work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hands then they can well diſpatch, grow ſick of it, and ſit down out of a lazy deſpondency, and do juſt nothing. He that hath a great houſe running to ruine, and but a ſmall purſe; 'tis better for him to repair now a little, and then a little
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:119001:128"/>
then let all fall down, becauſe he cannot do it all at once. Many Miniſters may complain of their Predeceſſours, that they left them their people more out of repair then their houſes, and this makes the work great indeed. As the Jewes, who were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the ſtones out of the heaps of rubbiſh, before they could build the wall, yet it went up, becauſe <hi>the people had a minde to work.</hi> Nehem. 4. O if once our hearts were but fill'd with zeal for God, and compaſſion to our peoples ſouls, we would up and be doing, though we could but lay a brick a day, and God would be with us. May be you who finde a people rude and ſottiſhly ignorant, like ſtones in the quarry, and trees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell'd, ſhall not bring the work to ſuch perfection in your dayes as you deſire; yet as <hi>David</hi> did for <hi>Solomon,</hi> thou mayeſt by thy paines in teaching and inſtructing them, prepare materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for another who ſhall rear the Temple. Its very ordinary for one Miniſter to enter into the labours of another; to reap thoſe by a work of Converſion, in whom a former Miniſter hath caſt the ſeed of knowledge and conviction: And when God comes to reckon with his Workmen, the Plough-man and Sower ſhall have his penny, as well as the Harveſt-man and Reaper. O its a bleſſed thing to be (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith he was,) eyes to the blinde, much more to blinde ſoules; ſuch are the Miniſters. God himſelf calls <hi>Pastours after his own heart, that feed his people with knowledge and understanding,</hi> Jer. 3.15. But wo to thoſe that are acceſſary to their peoples ignorance. Now a Miniſter may be acceſſary to the ignorance of his people,</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by his own ignorance. Knowledge is ſo fundamental to the work and calling of a Miniſter, that he cannot be one without it. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt rejected knowledge, I will alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me: ſeeing thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy children,</hi> Hoſ. 4.6. The want of knowledge in a Miniſter is ſuch a defect, as cannot be ſupplied by any thing elſe; be he never ſo meek, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, bountiful, unblameable, if he hath not skill to divide the Word aright, he is not cut out for a Miniſter. Every thing is good, as its good for the end it is appointed to; a knife, though it had a haft of diamonds, yet if it will not cut 'tis no knife. A bell, if not ſound, is no bell. The great work of a Miniſter is to teach others, his lips are to preſerve knowledge, he ſhould be as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119001:128"/>
converſant in the things of God, as others in their particular trades. Miniſters are called Lights; if the light then be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, how great is the darkneſſe of that people like to be? I know theſe ſtars in Chriſts hands are not all of the ſame magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; there is a greater glory of gifts and graces ſhines in ſome then others; yet ſo much light is neceſſary to every Miniſter, as was in the ſtar the wiſe men ſaw at Chriſts birth, to be able out of the Word to direct ſinners the ſafe and true way to Chriſt and ſalvation. O Sirs, it is a ſad way of getting a living by killing of men, as ſome unskilful Phyſicians do; but much more to get a temporal livelihood by ruining ſouls, through our ignorance. He is a cruel man to the poor Paſſengers, who will undertake to be Pilot, when he never ſo much as learn't his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe.</p>

Its all one if the Nurſe hath no  milk in her breaſts, or having, drawes it not forth to her childe. There is a wo to the <hi>Idol-ſhepherd,</hi> Zech. 11. ſuch as have mouthes, but ſpeak not; lips, but not to feed the people with knowledge. It ſhall be the peoples ſin, if they feed not when bread is before them, but wo to us if we give them not meat in due ſeaſon. O Sirs, what ſhall we ſay to our Lord that truſts us, if thoſe abilities which he hath given us as market-money to buy bread for our people, be found wrapt up in a napkin of ſloth? if that time wherein we ſhould have been teaching and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſhall appear to be waſted in our pleaſures, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about our carnal profits. That ſervant ſhall have but a ſad welcome of his Maſter when he comes home, that ſhall be found out of the way with the Key, and the family ſtarving in the mean time for want of proviſion.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, by his unedifying preaching, when he preacheth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound  doctrine, which doth not perfect the underſtanding, but corrupt it. Better he did leave them in ſimple ignorance, then colour their mindes with a falſe die; or when that he preacheth is frothy and flaſhy, no more fit to feed their ſoules, then husks the Prodigals belly, which when they know they are little the wiſer for their ſoules good. Or when his diſcourſes are ſo high flown, that the poor people ſtand gazing, as thoſe who have loſt the ſight of their Preacher, and at the end of the Sermon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what he would have. Or thoſe who preach only truths,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119001:129"/>
that are for the higher forme of Profeſſours, who have their ſenſes well exerciſed, excellent may be for the building up three or foure eminent Saints in the Congregation; but in the mean time, the weak ones in the family, (who ſhould indeed chiefly be thought on, becauſe leaſt able to guide themſelves, or carve for themſelves) theſe are forgotten. He ſure is an unwiſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that makes a Scaffold as high as <hi>Pauls</hi> ſteeple, when his work is at the bottom, and he is to lay the foundation, whereas the Scaffold ſhould riſe as the building goes up. So <hi>Paul</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in his doctrine, as his hearers do in knowledge; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on unto perfection. Let us.</hi> It is well indeed when the people can keep pace with the Preacher, To preach truths and notions above the hearers capacity, is like a Nurſe, that ſhould go to feed the childe with a ſpoon too big to go into its mouth. We may by ſuch preaching pleaſe our ſelves, and ſome of higher attainments, but what ſhall poor ignorant ones do in the mean time. He is the faithful ſteward that conſiders both. The Preacher is (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf) <hi>a debt or both to the Greek and to the Barbarian, to the wiſe and to the unwiſe,</hi> Rom. 1.14. to prepare truths ſuitable to the degree of his hearers.

He that will do any good in the Miniſters calling, muſt be as careful as the Fiſher, that he doth nothing to ſcare ſoules away from him, but all to allure and invite, that they may be toll'd within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his net.</p>

Lawyers have their Clients, and Phyſicians their Patients: theſe are ſought after, and call'd up at midnight for counſel: but alas! the ſoule, which is more worth then raiment and body too, that is neglected, and the Miniſter ſeldom thought on, till both theſe be ſent away. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps when the Phyſician gives them over for dead, then we muſt come and cloſe up thoſe eyes with comfort, which were never opened to ſee Chriſt in his truth, or be counted cruel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will not ſprinkle them with this holy water, and anoint them for the Kingdome of Heaven, though they know not a ſtep of the way which leads to it. Ah, poor wretches! what comfort would you have us ſpeak to thoſe, to whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks terrour? Is heaven ours to give to whom we pleaſe? or is it in our power to alter the lawes of the moſt High, and ſave thoſe whom he condemns? Do you not remember the curſe that is to fall upon his head, <hi>that maketh the blinde to wander out of the way? Deut.</hi> 27.18. what curſe then would be our portion, if we ſhould confirm ſuch blinde ſoules, that are quite out of the way to heaven, encouraging you to go on and expect to reach heaven at laſt, when God knows your feet ſtand in thoſe paths that lead to eternal death? No, 'tis writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, we cannot, and God will not reverſe it; you may reade your very names among thoſe damned ſoules which Chriſt comes in flaming fire to take vengeance on, who the Apoſtle tells us are ſuch, <hi>that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.8. And therefore in the feare of God, let this provoke you, of what age or ſexe, rank or condition ſoever in the world, to labour for the ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt, <hi>whom to know is life eternal. Are you young</hi>? Enquire after God betimes, while your parts are freſh, and memory ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throng of worldly cares divert you, or luſts of youth debauch you. The feet of thoſe luſts which have buried milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others in perdition, ſtand ready to carry you the ſame way, if preventing grace come not and deliver you out of their hands, by ſeaſoning your mindes with the knowledge of God. This morning-draught may prevent thy being infected with the ill ſavours thou mayeſt receive from the corrupt examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Nay, how long thy ſtay may be in the world thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not, ſee whether thou canſt not finde graves of thy length in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119001:130"/>
the burial place; and if thou ſhouldeſt die ignorant of God and his Law, what would then become of thee? The ſmall bruſh and the old logs, young ſinners, and thoſe that are withered with age meet and burn together. Or if thou ſhouldeſt ſtay a while longer here, may be becauſe thou wilt not learn now, God will not teach thee then: Or if thou ſhouldeſt in thy old age get acquaintance with God, yet 'tis ſad to be ſowing thy ſeed, when thou ſhouldeſt be reaping thy ſheaves, learning to know God, when thou mighteſt be comforting thy ſelf from the old acquaintance thou haſt enjoyed with him. <hi>Are you old and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?</hi> Alas, poor creatures! your life in the ſocket, and this candle of the Lord not ſet up and lighted in your underſtanding? your body bowing to the duſt, and nature tolling the paſſing bell, as it were, and you (like one going into the dark) know not whither death will lead you or leave you. 'Tis like the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of age, make you wiſh your bones were even laid at reſt in the grave: but if you ſhould dye in this condition, your poor ſoules would even wiſh they were here again with their old burdens on their back; aches and diſeaſes of old age are grievous, but damned ſoules would thank God, if he would bleſſe them with ſuch a heaven, as to lie in theſe paines to eſcape the torments of the other: O bethink you before you go hence; the leſſe time you have, the more diligence you muſt uſe to gain knowledge; we need not be earneſt, (one would think) to bid the poor priſoner learne his book, that cannot reade, when he knows he ſhall be hang'd if he read not his neck-verſe. 'Tis not indeed the bare knowing the truths of the Goſpel, ſaves; but the groſſe ignorance of them to be ſure will damn ſoules. <hi>Are you poor?</hi> It is not your poverty is your ſin or miſery, but your ignorance where the true treaſure lies. Were you Gods poor, rich in knowledge and faith, you were happy, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Better is a poor and wiſe childe, then a fooliſh King, who will no more be admoniſh't</hi>; yea, ſo happy, that did the Princes of the world underſtand themſelves aright, they would wiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in your clothes, how ragged ſoever they are, rather then be in their own robes; there are better making for you in heaven which you ſhall put on, when theirs ſhall be pull'd off to their ſhame: It will not then trouble you that you were, while in the world, poor; but it will torment them that they were ſo rich and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:119001:131"/>
great, and ſo poore to God and beggarly in their ſoules.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Are you rich?</hi> Labour for the knowledge of the moſt high. <hi>Solomon</hi> had more of the worlds treaſure then a thouſand of you have, and yet we finde him hard at prayer, tugging with God for knowledge, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.10. All theſe outward enjoyments are but <hi>vaginae bonorum,</hi> as afflictions are <hi>vaginae malorum.</hi> I am afraid many men think themſelves priviledged by their worldly greatneſſe from this duty, as if God were bound to ſave them, becauſe rich. Alas, Sirs, there are not ſo many of you like to come there. I muſt confeſſe, it would make one tremble to think what a ſmall number thoſe among the great ones that ſhall be ſaved, are ſummed up into. <hi>Not many great, not many rich</hi>; Why ſo few ſaved? Becauſe ſo few have ſaving knowledge. O the Atheiſme, the ignorance, the ſottiſh barbariſme that is to be found even in thoſe that the world applaud, and even worſhip becauſe of their lands and eſtates, who yet are not able to give any account of their faith? A poore leather-coat Chriſtian will ſhame and catechize a hundred of them. If heaven were to be purchaſed with houſe and lands, then theſe would carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the poore Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, they have their hundreds and thouſands ly by them for a purchaſe alwayes, but this money is not currant in heavens exchange. <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>

Theſe have ſuch a high opinion of themſelves, that they take it ill any ſhould ſuſpect them as ſuch; theſe of all men are moſt out of the way, to knowledge they are too good to learne of man as they think, and too bad to be taught of God. The gate into Chriſts Schoole is low, and theſe cannot ſtoop. The Maſter himſelfe is ſo humble and lowly, that he will not teach a proud Scholar. Therefore firſt become a foole in thy owne eye. A wiſer man then thy ſelfe hath confeſſed as much, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2, 3. <hi>I am more brutiſh then any man, and have not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a man.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, be faithful with that little knowledge thou haſt. Art thou convinced this is a ſinne, and that is a duty? Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the light cloſe, you know not what this little may grow to; We uſe to ſet up our children with a little ſtock at firſt, and as they uſe it, ſo we adde. The Kingdome of God comes of ſmall beginnings. God complains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh in their knowledge,</hi> Jer. 10.14. he doth not ſay brutiſh in their ignorance, had they ſinned becauſe they did not know better, this would have excuſed <hi>à tanto,</hi> but they did that which was brutiſh and unreaſonable, as their worſhiping graven images notwithſtanding they knew to the contrary. That man ſhall not excel in knowledge who proſtitutes it to ſinne, <hi>Job</hi> 36.12. <hi>If they obey not, they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and ſhall die without knowledge.</hi> A candle pent up cloſe in a dark lanthorn, ſwailes out apace: and ſo doth light ſhut up in the conſcience, and not ſuffered to come forth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Thoſe Heathens that are charged for <hi>holding the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 1.18. the next news you hear of them is, that <hi>they became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned,</hi> ver. 21.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, ply the throne of grace. <hi>Bene oraſſe eſt bene stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duiſſe</hi>;  he is the beſt ſtudent in divinity, that ſtudies moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knee. Knowledge is a divine gift, all light is from heaven. God is the Father of light, and prayer puts the ſoule under the pupillage of God. <hi>If any one lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God.</hi> This is more then naked knowledge, wiſdome how to uſe it. Study may make one a great Scholar in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but prayer makes a wiſe Chriſtian, as it obtains ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied knowledge, without which it is no perfect gift, but <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, a gift and no gift. Pray then with an humble bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, God gives it to all that ask, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, candidly, liberally; not like proud man who will rather put one to ſhame who is weak for his ignorance, then take the paines to teach him. Thy petition is very pleaſing to God. Remember how <hi>Solomon</hi> ſped upon the like occaſion, and promiſe thy ſelf the ſame ſucceſſe. Chriſts School is a free School; he denies none that come to him, ſo they will ſubmit to the orders of the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119001:132"/>
School; and though all have not an anſwer in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledge (it is not needful that all ſhould be <hi>Solomons</hi> in knowledge, except all were to be <hi>Solomons</hi> in place) yet the meaneſt diſciple that Chriſt ſends forth ſhall be furniſhed with ſaving knowledge, enough to fit him for his admittance into heavens Academy. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and after bring me to glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, thou muſt beſtow ſome time for thy diligent ſearch after truth. Truth lies deep, and muſt be digged for. Since man was turned out of Paradiſe he can do nothing without labour, except ſinne (this follows his hand indeed) but this treaſure of knowledge calls for ſpade and Mattock. We are bid <hi>ſearch the Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Many ſhall runne to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be encreaſed</hi>; a Metaphor from Merchants, who beſtirre themſelves to get an eſtate, runne to and fro, firſt in one land, then in another, where-ever they hear of any thing to be got, thither they poſt, though to the ends of the earth: Thus muſt the ſoul runne from one duty to another, one while read, and anon meditate of what he hath read, then pray over his meditations, and aske counſel after all. What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, and how underſtand you that? <hi>Non ſchola Epicuri fecit magnos viros ſed contubernium.</hi> There is more light got ſometimes by a ſhort conference with the Preacher, then by his whole Sermon. Be ſure thou compaſſe all the means for knowledge within the walk of thy endeavour. In this thy ſearch for knowledge obſerve three things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the end thou propoſeſt that it be pure and holy, not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know, as ſome do, who labour for knowledge, as many for eſtates, and when they have got it look on their notions, as they on their bags of money, but have not a heart to uſe their knowledge for their own or others good; this is a ſore evil. Speculative knowledge like <hi>Rachel</hi> is faire, but barren. Not to be known and admired by others for thy ſtature in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above thy Brethren, verily it is too baſe an end to aime at in ſeeking knowledge, eſpecially ſuch as is the knowledge of God and Chriſt. To ſee a Heathen ſtudy for knowledge in Philoſophy, and then carry all his labour to this market, and think himſelf rewarded with obtaining the name for a wiſe man, is though baſe, yet more tolerable: but for one that knows God,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119001:132"/>
and what it is to enjoy him, for ſuch a one to content himſelf with a blaſt or two of ſorry mans vain breath, this is folly with a witneſſe, look thou flieſt higher in thy end then ſo. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for knowledge that thou mayeſt fear God whom thou knoweſt, thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.33. <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end.</hi> The Word of God is called a light unto our feet, not to our tongues meerly to talk of, but feet to walk by; Endeavour for it, not that thou may'ſt ſpread thy own name, but celebrate Gods As <hi>David</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, when he underſtands the precepts of God, then he will talk of his wondrous works, he will trumpet the fame of them, and thereby awaken others to enquire after God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when thy end is right ſet, then thou muſt be  conſtant in thy endeavour after it. The myſteries of Chriſt are not learnt in a day. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 6.3. Some are in a good mood (may be) and they will look into the Bible, and read a chapter or two, and away they go for a week, and never practiſe it more; like ſome boyes if at School one day truant all the week after: is it any wonder ſuch thrive not in knowledge? It is a good ſpeech of <hi>Bernard, Tantum diſtat studium à lectione, quantum amicitia ab hoſpitio, ſocialis affectio à fortuit â ſalutatione.</hi> The ſtudy of the Word, and the reading of it differs as much, as the friendſhip of ſuch who every day converſe lovingly together, doth from the acquaintance one hath with a ſtranger at an Inne, or whom he ſalutes as he paſſeth by in the ſtreet. If you will get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge indeed, you muſt not onely ſalute the Word now and then, but walk with it, and enter into daily converſe with it. The three men (who were indeed Angels) that ſtood by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> as he ſat at his Tent-door, were reſerved, and ſtrange, till <hi>Abraham</hi> invited them into his Tent, and entertain'd them friendly; and then Chriſt who was one among them (as appears by the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> given him in ſeveral verſes, and alſo by what he promiſed he would do for <hi>Sarah,</hi> ver. 10. not what God would do, which if a created Angel he would) begins to diſcover himſelf to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and reveale his ſecrets to him. That ſoul above others ſhall be acquainted with the ſecrets of God in his Word, that doth not ſlightly read the Word, and as it were complement with it, at his tent-doore,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119001:133"/>
but deſires more intimacy with it, and therefore entertaines it within his ſoul by frequent meditating of it. <hi>David</hi> compares the Word for ſweetneſſe to <hi>the honey and the honey-combe.</hi> Indeed it is ſo full, that at firſt reading ſome ſweetneſſe will now and then drop from it, but he that doth not preſſe it by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaves the moſt behinde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Be ſure thou takeſt the right order and method. Arts and Sciences have their rudiments, and alſo their more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and deep notions; and ſure the right end to begin at, is firſt to learn the principles: he (we ſay) is not like to make a good Scholar in the Univerſity, that never was good Grammar-Scholar. And they cannot be ſolid Chriſtians, that are not inſtructed in the grounds of Chriſtianity. The want of this is the cauſe why many are ſo unſtedfaſt. Firſt, of this way and then of that, blown like glaſſes into any ſhape, as falſe Teachers pleaſe to breath. Alas, they have no center to draw their lines from; think it no diſgrace you who have runne into error, and loſt your ſelves in the labyrinths of deep points (which now are the great diſcourſe of the weakeſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors) to be ſet back to learn the firſt principles of the Oracles of God better; too many are as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in another caſe, <hi>pudoris magìs memores quàm ſalutis,</hi> more tender of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation then their ſalvation, who are more aſhamed to be thought ignorant, then careful to have it cured.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If thou wouldſt attain to divine knowledge, wait on the Miniſtery of the Word. As for thoſe who neglect this, and come not where the Word is Preacht, they do like one that ſhould turn his back on the Sunne that he may ſee it; if thou wouldſt know God, come where he hath appointed thee to learn. Indeed, where the meanes is not, God hath extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes, as a Father if no School in Town, will teach his childe at home, but if there be a publick School, thither he ſends him: <hi>God maketh manifeſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>the ſavour of his knowledge by us in every place,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.14. Let men talk of the Spirit what they pleaſe. He will at laſt be found a quencher of the Spirit, that is, a deſpiſer of Prophecy; they both ſtand cloſe together, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Quench not the Spirit. Deſpiſe not Propheſying.</hi> But it is not enough, to ſit under the meanes; Wofull experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us this, there are ſome no Sun will tan, they keep their old
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119001:133"/>
complexion under the moſt ſhining and burning light of the Word preached, as ignorant and prophane as thoſe that never ſaw Goſpel-day; and therefore if thou wilt receive any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall advantage by the Word, take heed how thou heareſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Look thou beeſt a wakefull hearer. Is it any wonder he ſhould go away from the Sermon no wiſer then he came, that ſleeps the greateſt part of it away, or heares betwixt ſleeping and waking? It muſt be in a dreame ſure, if God reveales any thing of his mind to him. So indeed God did to the Fathers of old, but it was not as they prophanely ſlept under an Ordinance. O take heed of ſuch irreverence. He that compoſeth himſelfe to ſleep (as ſome do) at ſuch a time, or he that is not humbled for it, and that deeply; both of them betray a baſe and low eſteeme they have of the Ordinance. Surely thou thinkeſt but meanly of what is delivered, if it will not keep thee awake, yea, of God himſelfe, whoſe meſſage it is. See how thou art reproved by the awfull carriage of a Heathen, and that a King. <hi>Ehud</hi> did but ſay to <hi>Eglon, I have a meſſage from God unto thee,</hi> And <hi>he aroſe out of his ſeate, Judge</hi> 3.20. And thou clapeſt downe on thy ſeat to ſleep; O how dareſt thou put ſuch an affront upon the great God? How oft did you fall aſleep at dinner, or telling your money? And is not the Word of God worth more then theſe? I ſhould wonder if ſuch Sermon-ſleepers do dreame of any thing but hell-fire. 'Tis dangerous you know to fall aſleep with a candle burning by our ſide; ſome have been ſo burnt in their beds; but more dangerous to ſleep while the candle of the Word is ſhining ſo neare us. What if you ſhould ſinke downe dead like <hi>Eatychus</hi>? here is no <hi>Paul</hi> to raiſe you as he had; and that you ſhall not, where is your ſecurity?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thou muſt be an attentive hearer. He that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, but wanders with his eye or heart, what doth he but ſleep with his eyes open? It were as good the ſervants ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in his bed, as when up, not to minde his Maſters buſineſſe. When God intends a ſoul good by the Word, he drawes ſuch a one to liſten and hearken heedfully to what is delivered; as we ſee in <hi>Lydia, who</hi> ('tis ſaid) <hi>attended unto the things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul. And thoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1948. <hi>The people were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to heare him.</hi> They did hang on him as you ſhall ſee Bees on ſome ſweet flower, or as young birds on the bills of their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119001:134"/>
dammes as they feed them; that is, the ſoul which ſhall get light and life by the Word. <hi>Heare ye children, and attend to know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Prov.</hi> 4.1. Labour therefore in hearing the Word to fixe thy quickſilver-minde, and ſet thy ſelfe to heare, as 'tis ſaid <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> did to pray; and that thou maieſt, before thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, get thy heart into ſome deep ſenſe of thy ſpirituall wants, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of thy ignorance of the things of God, and thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored condition by reaſon of it; till the heart be toucht, the minde will not be fixt. Therefore you may obſerve, 'tis ſaid, <hi>God open'd the heart of</hi> Lydia, <hi>that ſhe attended, Acts</hi> 16.14. The Minde goes of the Wils errand; we ſpend our thoughts upon what our hearts propoſe. If the heart hath no ſenſe of its ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or no deſires after God, no wonder ſuch a one liſtens not what the Preacher ſaith; his heart ſends his mind another way. <hi>They ſit before thee as my people</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſſe</hi>; They do not come out of ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or deſire to heare for any good to their ſoules, then they would apply themſelves wholly to the work; no, it is their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe hath their hearts; and therefore as ſome idle ſervant, when he hath waited on his Maſter; brought him to his pew, then he goes out to his good fellowes at the Alehouſe, and comes no more till Sermon be almoſt done: ſo do the thoughts of moſt when they go to the Ordinance, they ſlip out in the ſtreet, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket or ſhop, you may finde them any where but about the duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and all becauſe theſe have their hearts more then God and his Word.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Thou muſt be a retentive hearer, without this the worke will ever be to begin againe. Truths to a forgetfull hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are as a ſeale ſet on water, the impreſſion laſts no longer then the ſeale is on; the Sermon once done, and all is undone; be therefore very carefull to faſten what thou heareſt on thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which that thou maieſt do,</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, receive the truth in the love of it, An affectionate hearer will not be a forgetfull hearer. Love helpes the memory; <hi>Can a woman forget her childe,</hi> or <hi>a maide her ornaments, or a bride her attire?</hi> No, they love them too well: Were the truths of God thus precious to thee, thou wouldeſt with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> think of them day and night. Even when the Chriſtian through weakneſſe of memory cannot remember the very words
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119001:134"/>
he heares, to repeate them; yee then he keeps the power and ſavour of them in his ſpirit; as when ſugar is diſſolved in wine, you cannot ſee it, but you may taſte it; when meat is eaten and digeſted, it is not to be found as it was received, but the man is cheered and ſtrengthened by it, more able to walke and work then before, by which you may know it is not loſt: ſo you may taſte the truths the Chriſtian heard in his ſpirit, ſee them in his life. Perhaps if you aske him what the particulars were the Miniſter had about faith, mortification, repentance, and the like, he cannot tell you; yet this you may finde, his heart is more broken for ſin, more enabled to rely on the promiſes, and now weaned from the world. As that good woman anſwered one, that coming from Sermon, ask't her what ſhe remembred of the Sermon? ſaid, ſhe could not at preſent recal much, but ſhe heard that which ſhould make her reforme ſome things as ſoon as ſhe came home.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, meditate on what thou heareſt; by this <hi>David</hi> got  more wiſdome then his teachers. Obſerve what truth, what Scripture is cleared to thee in the Sermon more then before, take ſome time in ſecret to converſe with it, and make it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by familiar to thy underſtanding. Meditation to the Sermon is what the harrow is to the ſeed, it covers thoſe truths, which elſe might have been pickt or waſht away. I am afraid there are many proofs turned down at a Sermon, that are hardly turned up, and lookt on any more, when the Sermon is done; and if ſo, you make others believe you are greater traders for your ſouls, then you are indeed; as if one ſhould come to a ſhop and lay by a great deal of rich ware, and when he hath done, goes away, and never calls for it. O take heed of ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The hypocrite cheats himſelf worſt at laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, diſcharge thy memory of what is ſinful. We wipe  our table-book, and deface what is there ſcribled, before we can write new. There is ſuch a contrariety betwixt the truths of God and all that is frothy and ſinful, that one puts out the other; if you would retain the one, you muſt let the other go.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſe.</head>
                  <p>THeſe words are the fourth branch in the deſeription, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedneſſes,</hi> and our conteſt or combate with them as ſuch expreſt by the adverſative particle [<hi>Againſt</hi>] in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, not ſpirits, but ſpirituals. The words preſent us with theſe three doctrinal Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the devils are ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the devils are ſpirits extremely wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, theſe wicked ſpirits do chiefly annoy the Saints with, and provoke them to ſpiritual wickedneſſes. Firſt, of the firſt.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>SECT. I.</head>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they are ſpirits. Spirit is a word of various acception in Scripture. Amongſt other uſed often to ſet forth the eſſence and nature of Angels good and evil, both which are called ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119001:135"/>
The holy Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits?</hi> The evil: <hi>There came forth a ſpirit and ſtood before the Lord, and ſaid, I will perſwade him,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21. that ſpirit was a devil. How oft is the devil call'd the unclean ſpirit, foule ſpirit, lying ſpirit, &amp;c. Sin did not alter their ſubſtance, for then, as one ſaith well, that nature and ſubſtance which tranſgreſt could not be puniſh't.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the devil is a ſpirit, that is, his eſſence is immaterial and  ſimple, not compounded (as corporal beings are) of matter and forme: <hi>Handle and ſee me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his diſciples, that thought they had ſeen a Spirit) <hi>a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have,</hi> Luke 24.39. If they were not thus imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, how could they enter into bodies and poſſeſſe them, as the Scripture tells us they have, even a legion into one man? <hi>Luke</hi> 8.30. one body cannot thus enter into another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the devils are ſpiritual ſubſtances, not qualities, or  evil motions, ariſing from us, as ſome have abſurdly conceived. So the Sadduces, and others following them deny any ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Angel good or evil: but this is ſo fond a conceit, that we muſt both forfeit our reaſon, and deny the Scriptures to maintain it, where we finde their Creation related, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. the fall of ſome from their firſt eſtate, <hi>Jude 6.</hi> and the ſtanding of others called the Elect Angels; The happineſſe of the one, who behold Gods face; and their employment, are ſent out to attend on the Saints as ſervants on their Maſters heirs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. The miſery of the other, reſerved in chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto the judgement of the great day; and their preſent work, which is to do miſchief to the ſouls and bodies of men, as far as they are permitted; all which ſhew their ſubſiſtence plain enough. But ſo immerſt is ſorry man in fleſh, that he will not eaſily beleeve what he ſees not with his fleſhly eyes; upon the ſame account we may deny the being of God himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe inviſible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, they are entire ſpiritual ſubſtances, which have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very  very one proper exiſtence: and thus they are diſtinguiſh't from the ſouls of men, which are made to ſubſiſt in a humane body; and together with it to make one perfect man; ſo that the ſoule, though when ſeparated from the body, it doth exiſt, yet hath a tendency to union with its body again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:119001:136"/>Fourthly, they are, though entire ſpiritual ſubſtances, yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, being but creatures. God only is the uncreated, infinite, and abſolutely ſimple Spirit, yea Father of all other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p>Now from this ſpiritual nature of the devil, we may further ſee what a dreadful enemy we have to grapple with.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, as ſpirits they are of vaſt intellectual abilities. Sorry man, while in this dark priſon of the body, hath not light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know what Angelical perfections are; that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in knowledge all other creatures we know, becauſe as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits they come neareſt by Creation to the Nature of God that made them; the heavens are not lift higher from the earth, then Angels by knowledge from man, while on earth. Man by Art hath leatn't to take the height of the ſtars of heaven, but where is he that can tell how far in knowledge Angels exceed man? 'Tis true, they have loſt much of that knowledge they had, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all their knowledge as holy Angels, what now they know of God hath loſt its ſavour, and they have no power to uſe it for their own good. What <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith of wicked men, may be ſaid of them; <hi>What they know naturally in theſe things they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt themſelves.</hi> They know the holineſſe of God, but love him not for it, as the Elect Angels do, and themſelves by Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation did. They know the evil of ſin, and love it not the leſſe; but though they are ſuch fooles for themſelves, yet have ſubtilty too much for all the Saints on Earth, if we had not a God to play our game for us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as ſpirits they are inviſible, and their approaches alſo. They come and you ſee not your enemy. Indeed this makes him ſo little feared by the ignorant world, whereas it is his greateſt advantage if rightly weighed. O if men have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of the devil, or heare a noiſe in the night, they cry, The devil, the devil, and are ready to runne out of their wits for feare; but they carry him in their hearts, and walk all the day long in his company, and feare him not. When thy proud heart is clambering up to the pinacle of honour in thy ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, who ſets thee there but the devil? When thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous heart is big with all manner of uncleanneſſe and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, who but Satan hath been there, begetting theſe brats on thy whoriſh ſpirit? When thou art raging in thy paſſion,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119001:136"/>
throwing burning coales of wrath and fury about with thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed tongue, where was it ſet on fire but of hell? When thou art hurried like the ſwine into the precipice, and even choakt with thy own drunken vomit, who but the devil rides thee?</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, as ſpirits they are immortal. Of other enemies you  may hear news at laſt that they are dead which ſought thy life, as the Angel told <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Herod.</hi> Perſecuting men walk a turne or two upon the ſtage, and are call'd off by death, and there is an end of all their plots; but devils die not, they will hunt thee to thy grave, and when thou dieſt they will meet thee in another world, to accuſe and torment thee there alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, they are unwearied in their motions. When  the fight is over among men; the Conquerour muſt ſit down and breathe, and ſo loſeth the chaſe, becauſe not able to purſue it in time. Yea, ſome have given over their Empires, as glutted with the blood of men, and weary of the work, when they cannot have their will as they deſired: Thus <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian,</hi> becauſe he ſaw he did but mowe a medow, that grew the thicker for the cutting down (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians martyred) he throws away his Scepter in a pet. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did the like (ſome ſay) upon the ſame reaſon, becauſe he could not root out the Lutherans. But the devils ſpirit is never cowed, nor he weary of doing miſchief, though he hath never ſtood ſtill ſince firſt he began his walk to and fro the world. O what would become of us if a God were not at our back, who is infinitely more the devils odds then he ours?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they are wicked ſpirits; wicked in the abſtract, as  in the Text, and call'd by way of eminency in ſin, <hi>The wicked one,</hi> Mat. 13.19. As God is called the holy one, becauſe <hi>none holy as the Lord.</hi> So, the devil the wicked one, becauſe he is a none ſuch in ſinne. In a few particulars let us endeavour to take the height of the devils ſinne, and the rather that we may judge of the degrees of ſins, and ſinners among the ſons of men, the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119001:137"/>
neerer God in holineſſe, the more holy; the liker the devil, the more wicked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, theſe Apoſtate Angels are the inventers of ſinne; the firſt that ſounded the Trumpet of rebellion againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and led the dance to all that ſinne which ſince hath filled the world. Now what tongue can accent this ſinne to its full? for ſuch a noble creature whom God had ſet on the top as it were of all the creation neereſt to himſelf, from whom God had kept nothing but his own royal diadem, for this Peere and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite of the Court without any cauſe or ſolicitation from any other, to make this bold and blaſphemous attempt to ſnatch at Gods own Crown, this paints the devil blacker then the thoughts of men and Angels can conceive. He is called <hi>the father of lies,</hi> as thoſe who found out any Art, are called the father of it. <hi>Jubal the father of all ſuch as handle the harp, and organ</hi>; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Muſick; and this is a dreadful aggravation, becauſe they ſinned without a Tempter. And though man is not in ſuch a degree capable of this aggravation, yet ſome men ſinne after the very ſimilitude of the devils tranſgreſſion in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, who as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1.30. ſtiles them, <hi>are inventers of evil things.</hi> Indeed ſinne is an old trade, found out to our hand; but as in other trades and arts, ſome famous men ariſe, who adde to the inventions of others, and make trades and arts (as it wtre) new; ſo there ever are ſome infamous in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that make old ſinnes new by ſuperadding to the wickedneſſe of others. Uncleanneſſe is an old ſinne from the beginning, but the <hi>Sodomites</hi> will be filthy in a new way, and therefore it carries their name to this day. Some invent new errrors, others new oathes, ſuch as are of their own coyning, hot out of the mint, they ſcorne to ſweare after the old faſhion. Others new devices of perſeuting, as <hi>Julian</hi> had a way by himſelf different from all before him; and to the end of the world every age will exceed other in the degrees of ſinning <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and the mockers of the old world, were but children and bunglers to the ſcoffers and <hi>cruel mockers</hi> of the laſt time. Well take heed of ſhewing thy wit in inventing new ſinnes, leſt thou ſtirre up God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent new puniſhments. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the wicked, and a strange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity?</hi> Job 31.3. <hi>Sodom</hi> ſinned after a new mode, and God deſtroys them after a new
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119001:137"/>
way, ſends hell from above upon them. Some have invented new opinions, Monſtrous errors, and God hath ſuited their monſtrous errors with births as monſtrous of their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they were not onely the inventers of ſinne, but  are ſtill the chief tempters to, and promoters of ſinne in the world, therefore call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the tempter; and ſinne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the work of the devil,</hi> whoever commits it; as the houſe goes by the name of the Maſter-workman, though he uſeth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants hands to build it. O take heed of ſoliciting others to ſinne; thou takeſt the Devils office (as I may ſay) out of his hand: let him do it himſelf if he will; make not thy ſelf ſo like him. To tempt another is worſe then to ſinne thy ſelf. It ſpeaks ſinne to be of great growth in that man, that doth it knowingly and willingly. Herbs and flowers ſhed not their ſeed till ripe, creatures propagate not, till of ſtature and age. What do thoſe, that tempt others, but diffuſe their wicked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and practices, and as it were raiſe up ſeed to the devil; thereby-to keep up the name of their infernal Father in the world? this ſhews ſin is mighty in them indeed. Many a man though ſo cruel to his own ſoul as to be drunk or ſweare, yet will not like this in a childe or ſervant; what are they then but devils incarnate, who teach their children the devils Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, to ſweare and lie, drink and drab? If you meet ſuch, be not afraid to call them (as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Elymas,</hi> when he would have perverted the Deputy) children of the devil, full of all ſubtilty and miſchief, and enemies of all righteouſneſſe. O do you not know what you do, when you tempt? I'le tell you. you do that, which you cannot undo by your own repentance; thou poiſoneſt one with errour, initiateſt another in the devils School, (Alehouſe I mean) but afterwards may be thou ſeeſt thy miſtake, and recanteſt thy errour, thy folly, and giveſt over thy drunken trade; art thou ſure now to rectifie and convert them with thy ſelfe? alas poor creatures! this is out of thy power, they may be will ſay as he (though he did it upon a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) that was ſolicited to turne back to popery by him, who had before perſwaded him to renounce the ſame, <hi>You have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me one turn, but ſhall not give me another.</hi> And what a grief to thy ſpirit will it be, to ſee theſe going to hell on thy errand,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119001:138"/>
and thou not able to call them back? thou mayeſt cry out as <hi>Lam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, They are not barely wicked, but maliciouſly wicked. The Devill hath his name <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to denote his ſpightfull nature, his deſire to vex and miſchief others. When he drawes ſouls to ſinne, it is not becauſe he taſtes any ſweetneſſe, or findes any profit therein; he hath too much light to have any joy or peace in ſin: he knows his doome, and trembles at the thought of it, and yet his ſpightful nature makes him vehemently deſire and unceſſantly endeavour the damnation of ſouls. As you ſhall ſee a mad dogge run after a flock of ſheep, kill one, then another, and when dead, not able to eate of their fleſh, but kills to kill: ſo Satan is carried out with a boundleſſe rage againſt man, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Saints, he would not, if he could, leave one of Chriſts flock alive; ſuch is the height of his malice againſt God whom he hates with a perfect hatred, and becauſe he cannot reach him with a direct blow, therefore he ſtrikes him at ſecond hand through his Saints; that wicked arme which reacheth not to God, is extended againſt theſe excellent on the earth, well knowing the life of God is in a manner bound up in theirs. God cannot outlive his honour, and his honour ſpeeds as his mercy is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted or depreſſed; this being the attribute God meanes to honour in their ſalvation ſo highly, and therefore maligned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt by Satan. And this is the worſt that can be ſaid of theſe wicked ſpirits, that they maliciouſly ſpite God, and in God the glory of his mercy.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Firſt this may help us to conceive more fully what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate wickedneſſe of mans nature is, which is ſo hard to be known, becauſe it can never be ſeen at once, it being a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whoſe immenſity conſiſts not in the ſtreame of actual ſinne (that is viſible, and may ſeem little) but in the ſpring that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119001:138"/>
unceſſantly feeds this, but here is a glaſſe that will give us the ſhape of our hearts truly like themſelves. Seeſt thou the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous pitch and height of wickedneſſe that is in the devil, all this there is in the heart of every man, there is no leſſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe potentially in the tameſt ſinner on earth, then in the devils themſelves, and that one day thou whoever thou art wilt ſhew to purpoſe, if God prevent thee not by his renewing grace, thou art not yet fledg'd, thy wings are not grown to make thee a flying Dragon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thou art of the ſame brood, the ſeed of this ſerpent is in thee, and the devil begets a child like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; thou yet ſtandeſt in a ſoile not ſo proper for the ripening of ſinne, which will not come to its fulneſſe till tranſplanted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell. Thou who art here ſo maidenly and modeſt, as to bluſh at ſome ſinnes out of ſhame, and forbear the acting of others out of fear: when there thou ſhalt ſee thy caſe as deſperate as the devil doth his, then thou wilt ſpit out thy blaſphemies with which thy nature is ſtuft, with the ſame malice that he doth. The Indians have a conceit that when they die, they ſhall be transform'd into the deformed likeneſſe of the devil, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their language they have the ſame word for a dead man and the devil; ſinne makes the wicked like him before they come there, but indeed they will come to their countenance more fully there, when thoſe flames ſhall waſh off that paint, which here hides their complexion. The Saints in heaven ſhall be like the Angels in their alacrity, love and conſtancy to ſerve God, and the damned like the devils in ſinne as well as puniſhment. This one conſideration might be of excellent uſe to unbottome a ſinner, and abaſe him ſo as never to have high thought of himſelf. It is eaſie to runne down a perſon whoſe life is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and convince him of the evil of his actions, and make him confeſſe what he doth is evil; but here is the thicket we loſe him in, he will ſay, 'tis true, I am overſeen, I do what I ſhould not, God forgive me: but my heart is good. Thy heart good, ſinner? and ſo is the devils, his nature is wicked and thine as bad as his.

                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the ſubject; when the ſpirit or heart is the ſtage whereon ſinne is acted, this is a ſpiritual ſinne; ſuch

                     <p>Firſt, of the firſt, Satan labours what he can to provoke the Chriſtian to heart-ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſtirre up and foment theſe inward motions of ſinne in the Chriſtians boſome; hence it is he can go about no duty but theſe (his Impes I may call them) haunt him, one motion or other darts in to interrupt him, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of himſelfe, <hi>When he would do good, evil was preſent with him</hi>; if a Chriſtian ſhould turne back, when ever theſe croſſe the way of him, he ſhould never go on his journey to heaven. It is the chief game the devil hath left to play againſt the children of God; now his field-army is broken, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power taken away which he had over them, to come out of theſe his holds where he lies ſculking, and fall upon their rear with theſe ſuggeſtions. He knows his credit now is not ſo great with the ſoul, as when it was his ſlave; then no drudgery work was ſo baſe that it would not do at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but now the ſoul is out of his bondage, and he muſt not think to command anothers ſervant as his own: No, all he can do is to watch the fitteſt ſeaſon (when the Chriſtian leaſt ſuſpects) and then to preſent ſome ſinful motion handſomely dreſt up to the eye of the ſoul, that the Chriſtian may (before he is aware) take this brat up and dandle it in his thoughts, till at laſt he makes it his own by embracing it; and this he knowes will defile the ſoul, and may be this boy ſent in at the window may open the door to let in a greater thief; or if he ſhould not ſo prevaile, yet the guilt of theſe heart-ſinnes, yea their very neighbour-hood will be a ſad vexation to a gracious heart,

whoſe nature is ſo pure that it abhorres all filthineſſe (ſo that to be haunted with ſuch motions is, as if a living man ſhould be chain'd to a ſtinking carcaſe, that where ever he goes he muſt draw that after him) and whoſe love is ſo dear to Chriſt that it cannot bear the company of thoſe thoughts without amazement and horrour, which are ſo contrary and abuſive to his beloved.

What enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment  findes Satan when he comes with theſe ſpirituals of wickedneſſe, and ſolicites thee to dwell on them? canſt thou diſpenſe with the filthineſſe of thy ſpirit, ſo thy hands be clean? or doſt thou wreſtle againſt theſe heart-ſinnes as well as others? I do not ask whether ſuch gueſts come within thy door, for the worſt of ſinnes may be found in the motions of them, not only paſſing by the door of a Chriſtian, but looking in alſo, as holy motions may be found ſtirring in the boſome of wicked men: but I ask thee whether thou canſt finde in thy heart to lodge theſe gueſts and bid them welcome. 'Tis like thou wouldſt not be ſeen to walk in the ſtreet with ſuch company, not lead a whore by the hand through the Town, not violently break open thy neighbours houſe to murder or rob him: but canſt thou not under thy own roofe, in the withdrawing room of thy ſoul let thy thoughts hold up an unclean luſt, while thy heart commits ſpeculative folly with it? canſt thou not draw thy neighbour into thy den, and there rend him limb from limb by thy malice, and thy heart not ſo much as cry murder, murder? In a word canſt thou hide any one ſinne in the vance roofe of thy heart, there to ſave the life of it when enquired after by the Word and Spirit, as <hi>Rahab</hi> hid the ſpies, and ſent the King of <hi>Jerichoes</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to purſue them, as if they had been gone?

in the love of thy ſoul; know it or thou ſhalt another day know it to thy coſt, thou art ſtark naught.

Firſt, conſider, Chriſtian, heart-ſinnes are ſinnes as well as any; <hi>The thought of fooliſhneſſe is ſinne,</hi> Prov. 24.9. Mercury is poiſon in the water diſtill'd, as well as in the groſſe body. Uncleanneſſe, covetouſneſſe, murder, are ſuch in the heart as well as in the outward act; every point of hell, is hell. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, conſider thy ſpirit is the ſeat of the holy Spirit. He takes up the whole heart for his lodging, and 'tis time for him to be gone when he ſees his houſe let over his head. Defile not thy ſpirit, till thou art weary of his company. Thirdly, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there may be more wickedneſſe in a ſinne of the heart, then of the hand and outward man; for the aggravation of theſe is taken from the behaviour of the heart in the act. The more of the heart and ſpirit is let out, the more malignity is let in to any ſinfull act. <hi>To back-ſlide in heart,</hi> is more then to back-ſlide; 'tis the comfort of a poor ſoul when tempted and troubled for his relapſes, that though his foot ſlides back, yet his heart turnes not back, but faceth Heaven and Chriſt at the ſame time; ſo <hi>to erre in the heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 3.10.</note> is worſe then to have an errour in the head; therefore God aggravates <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſinne with this, <hi>They do alwayes erre in their heart.</hi> Their hearts runne them upon the errour, they liked idolatry, and ſo were ſoon made to believe what pleaſed them beſt.

The widowes two mites ſurpaſſed all the reſt, Chriſt himſelfe being judge; ſo in ſinne, though the internal acts of ſinne in thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem light upon mans balance if compared with outward acts, yet theſe may be ſo circumſtanciated that they may exceed the other in Gods account; <hi>Peter</hi> layes the accent of <hi>Magus</hi> his ſinne on the wicked <hi>thought,</hi> which his words betrayed to be in

Fourthly, if Satan get into thy ſpirit and defile it, O how hard wilt thou finde it to ſtay there? thou haſt already ſipt of his broth, and now art more likely to be overcome at laſt to ſit down and make thy full meale of that, which by taſting hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated thy palate already.

Sin is as truly the off-ſpring of the ſoule as children are of our bodies, and it findes as much favour in our eyes, yea more, for the ſinner can ſlay a ſon to ſave a ſin alive, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.7. and of all ſinnes none are more made on then theſe heart ſins.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe they are the firſt-born of the ſinful heart, and the chiefeſt ſtrength of the ſoule is laid out upon them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe the heart hath more ſcope in them then in outward acts. The proud man is ſtaked down oft to a ſhort ſtate, and cannot ruffle it in the world, and appear to others in that pomp he would; but within his own boſome he can ſet up a ſtage, and in his own fooliſh heart preſent himſelf as great a Prince as he pleaſeth.

In a word, theſe inward luſts of the heart have nothing but the conſcience of a Deity to quell them. Other ſins put the ſinner to ſhame before men, and as ſome that believed on Chriſt, durſt not confeſſe him openly becauſe they loved the praiſe of men, ſo there are ſinners who are kept from vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their luſts openly, for the ſame tenderneſſe to their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but here is no feare of that, if they can but forget that heaven ſees them, or perſwade themſelves there is no danger from thence; the coaſt then is clear, they may be as wicked as they pleaſe.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, be earneſt with God in prayer to move and order thy heart in its thoughts and deſires. If the tongue be ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly thing that few can tame; O what is the heart where ſuch a multitude of thoughts are flying forth as thick as bees from the hive, and ſparks from the furnace! It is not in man, not in the holieſt on earth to do this without divine aſſiſtance.

As a ſervant, when the childe he tends is troubleſome, and will not be ruled by him, calls out to the father to come to him, who no ſooner ſpeaks but all is whiſt with him; No doubt holy <hi>David</hi> found his heart beyond his skill or power, that makes him ſo oft do its errand to God. Indeed God hath promiſed thus much to his children, to order their ſteps for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.22. only he looks they ſhould bring their hearts to him for that end. <hi>Commit thy work to the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Prov. 16.3. or ordered. Art thou ſetting thy face towards an Ordinance, where thou art ſure to meet Satan, who will be diſturbing thee with worldly thoughts, and may be worſe?

Take heed what thou importeſt at theſe; vaine diſcourſe ſeldome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth without leaving ſome tincture upon the heart, as unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome aire inclines to putrefaction things ſweet in themſelves: ſo unſavoury diſcourſe to corrupt the minde that is pure; look thou breatheſt therefore in a clear aire. And for thy eye, let it not wander, wanton objects cauſe wanton thoughts. <hi>Job</hi> knew his eye and his thoughts were like to go together, and therefore to ſecure one, he covenants with the other, <hi>Job</hi> 31, 1.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, often reflect upon thy ſelf in a day, and obſerve what  company is with thy heart. A careful Maſter will ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non be looking into his work-houſe, and ſee what his ſervants are doing, and a wiſe Chriſtian ſhould do the ſame. We may know by the noiſe in the ſchool, the Maſter is not there: much of the miſ-rule in our boſomes ariſeth from the neglect of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts. Now when thou art parlying with thy ſoule, make this threefold enquiry.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, whether that which thy heart is thinking on be good  or evil. If evil and wicked, ſuch as are proud, unclean, diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts, ſhew thy abhorrency of them, and chide thy ſoul ſharply for ſo much as holding conference with them, of which nought can come, but diſhonour to God, and miſchief to thy own ſoul, and ſtirre up thy heart to mourn for the evil neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood of them, and by this thou ſhalt give a teſtimony of thy faithfulneſſe to God. When <hi>David</hi> mourn'd for <hi>Abner,</hi> all <hi>Iſrael</hi> 'tis ſaid <hi>underſtood that day, that it was not of the King to ſtay Abner:</hi> Thy mourning for them will ſhew theſe thoughts are not ſo much of thee, as of Satan.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if they be not broadly wicked, enquire whether  they be not empty, frothy, vaine imaginations, that have no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the glory of God, thy own good or others; and if ſo, leave not till thou haſt made thy ſelfe apprehenſive of Satans deſigne on thee in them; though ſuch are not for thy purpoſe, yet they are for his, they ſerve his turne to keep thee from bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Why ſitteſt thou here idle (thou ſhouldeſt ſay to thy ſoul) when thou haſt ſo much to do for God and thy ſoul, and ſo little time to diſpatch it in?</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if thou findeſt they are good for matter thy heart is buſied about, then enquire whether they be good for time and manner, which being wanting they degenerate,</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, for the ſeaſon; that is good fruit which is brought forth in its ſeaſon. Chriſt liked the work his mother would have put him upon as well as her ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 2. but his time was not come. Good thoughts and meditations miſplaced, are like ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scripture, good truths, but bad expoſitions; they fit not the place they are drawn from, nor theſe the time. To pray when we ſhould hear, or be muſing on the Sermon when we ſhould pray, this is to rob God one way to pay him another.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, tarefully obſerve the manner. Thy heart may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate a good matter, and ſpoile it in the doing. Thou art may be muſing of thy ſinnes, and affecting thy heart into a ſenſe of them, but ſo, that while thou art ſtirring up thy ſorrow thou weakeneſt thy faith on the promiſe, that is thy ſinne. He is a bad Chirurgion, that in opening a veine goes ſo deep that he cuts an artery, and lames the arme if not kills the man. Or thou art thinking of thy family and providing for that, this thou oughteſt to do and wert worſe then an infidel if thou neglecteſt, but may be theſe thoughts are ſo diſtracting and diſtruſtfull as if there were no promiſe, no providence to relieve thee. God takes this ill, becauſe it reflects upon his care of thee; O how near doth our duty here ſtand to our ſinne! ſo much care is neceſſary bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt to the ſoul, a little more ſinks it under the waves of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe; like ſome things very wholeſome, but one degree more of hot or cold would make them poiſon.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How Satan labours to corrupt the Chriſtians minde with errour.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecond ſort of ſpiritual ſinnes are ſuch as are not only acted in the ſpirit, but are converſant about ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects proper to the ſoules nature that is a ſpirit, and not laid out in carnal paſſions of fleſhly luſts, in which the ſoul acts but as a Pander for the body, and partakes of their delights only by way of ſympathy; for as the ſoul feels the bodies pains no other way then by ſympathy, ſo neither doth it ſhare in the pleaſures of the fleſh by any proper taſte it hath of them, but only from its neer neighbourhood with the body doth ſympathize with its joy; but in ſpiritual wickedneſſes that corrupt the minde, here the ſoul moves in its own ſphere, with a delight proper to it ſelfe; and there are no leſſe of theſe then the other. There is hardly a fleſhly luſt, but hath ſome ſpiritual ſinne analogical to it, as they ſay there is no ſpecies of creatures on the land but may be pattern'd in the ſea: Thus the heart of man can produce ſpiritual ſinnes anſwering carnal luſts; for whoredom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of the fleſh, there is idolatry call'd in Scripture ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual adultery, from which the ſeat of Antichriſt is call'd ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Sodom</hi>; for ſenſual drunkenneſſe, there is a drunkenneſſe of the minde intoxicating the judgement with errour, a drunkenneſſe of the heart in cares and feares; for carnal pride in beauty, riches, honour, there is a ſpiritual pride of gifts graces, &amp;c. Now Satan in an eſpecial manner aſſaults the Chriſtian with ſuch as theſe; it would require a larger diſcourſe then I can allow to runne over the ſeveral kindes of them; I ſhall of many pick out two or three. As firſt, Satan labours to corrupt the mind with erroneous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, he was at work at the very firſt plantation of the Goſpel, ſowing his darnel, aſſoon almoſt as Chriſt his wheate, which ſprung up in pernicious errours, even in the Apoſtles times, which made them take the weeding-hook into their hands, and in all
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119001:144"/>
their Epiſtles labour to countermine Satan in this deſign. Now Satan hath a double deſign in this his endeavour to corrupt the mindes of men, eſpecially Profeſſours, with errour.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, he doth this in deſpite to God, againſt whom he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vent his malice at a higher rate then by corrupting his truth, which God hath ſo highly honoured, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</hi> Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bears the Name of God, but in his Word and truth therein contained 'tis writ at length, and therefore he is more choice of this, then of all his other works; he cares not much what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the world and all in it, ſo he keeps his Word, and ſaves his truth. Ere long we ſhall ſee the world on a light flame, the heavens and earth ſhall paſſe away, <hi>but the Word of the Lord endures for ever.</hi> When God will, he can make more ſuch worlds as this is, but he cannot make another truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will not loſe one <hi>iota</hi> thereof. Satan knowing this, ſets all his wits on work to deface this truth, and disfigure it by unſound doctrine. The Word is the glaſſe in which we ſee God, and ſeeing him are changed into his likeneſſe by his Spirit. If this glaſſe be crackt, then our conceptions we have of God will miſ-repeſent him unto us, whereas the Word in its native clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſets him out in all his glory unto our eye.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he endeavours to draw into this ſpiritual ſin of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as the moſt ſubtil and effectual means to weaken, if not deſtroy the power of godlineſſe in them. The Apoſtle joynes the Spirit of power and a ſound minde together, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.7. Indeed the power of holineſſe in practice depends much on the foundneſſe of judgement. Godlineſſe is the childe of truth, and it muſt be nurſt, if we will have it thrive with no other milk then of its own mother. Therefore we are exhorted <hi>to deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that we may grow,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, if this milk be but a little daſh't with errour, it is not ſo nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive All errour, how innocent ſoever any may ſeem, (like the Ivy) draws away the ſtrength of the ſouls love from holineſſe. <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells us, Whoredom and wine take away the heart; now
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:119001:144"/>
errour is ſpiritual adultery. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his eſpouſing them to Chriſt; when a perſon receives an errour, he takes a ſtranger into Chriſts bed, and it is the nature of adulterous love to take away the wiſes heart from her true husband, that ſhe delights not in his company ſo much as of her adulterous lover: and do we not ſee it at this day fulfill'd? do not many ſhew more zeal in contending for one errour, then for many truths? how ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are the hearts of many taken off from the wayes of God, their love cool'd to the Ordinances and Meſſengers of Chriſt? and all this occaſioned by ſome corrupt principle got into their boſomes, which controuls Chriſt and his truth, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and her ſon did <hi>Sarah</hi> and her childe. Indeed Chriſt will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy true conjugal love from the ſoule, till like <hi>Abraham</hi> he turns theſe out of doors. Errour is not ſo innocent a thing as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think it; it is as unwholeſome food to the body, that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the ſpirits and ſurfeits the whole body, which ſeldom paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away and not break out into ſores. As the knowledge of Chriſt carries a ſoule above the pollutions of the world, ſo er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour entangles and betrayes it to thoſe luſts, whoſe hands it had eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Satan in drawing a ſoule into this ſpiritual ſin hath a  deſigne to diſturb the peace of the Church, which is rent and ſhattered when this fire-ſhip comes among them. <hi>I hear</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) there are diviſions among you, and I partly beleeve it, for there muſt be hereſies,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.18, 19. implying that diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the natural iſſue of hereſie. Errour cannot well agree with errour, except it be againſt the truth, then indeed (like <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>) they are eaſily made friends, but when truth ſeems to be overcome, and the battel is over with that, then they fall out among themſelves, and therefore it is no wonder if it be ſo troubleſom a neighbour to truth. O Sirs, what a ſweet ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and peace was there among Chriſtians a dozen years ago; me thinks the looking back to thoſe bleſſed dayes in this reſpect, (though they had alſo another way their troubles, yet not ſo uncomfortable, becauſe that ſtorme united, this ſcatters the Saints ſpirits) is joyous to remember in what unity and love Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians walk't, that the Perſecutors of thoſe times might have ſaid, as their Predeceſſours did of the Saints in primitive times, <hi>See how they love one another</hi>; but now alas they may jeere and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:119001:145"/>
ſay, See how they that loved ſo dearly are ready to pluck one anothers throats out.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</note>The application of this ſhall be only in a word of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all, eſpecially you who bear the Name of Chriſt by a more eminent Profeſſion of him. O beware of this ſoul-infection, this leproſie of the head. I hope you do not think it needleſſe, for 'tis the diſeaſe of the times. This plague is begun, yea, ſpreads apace; not a flock, a Congregation hardly that hath not this ſcab among them. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Preacher the beſt of us all may write after, and he preſſeth this home upon the Saints, yea, in the conſtant courſe of his preaching it made a piece of his Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30, 31. he ſets us Preachers alſo on this work: <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the flock; for I know this, that after my departure ſhall grievous wolves enter; alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things</hi>; therefore watch. And then he preſents his own example, that he hardly made a Sermon for ſeveral yeares, but this was part of it to warn every one night and day with teares. We need not propheſie what Impoſtors may come upon the ſtage, when we go off: There are too many at preſent above board of this gang, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſciples after them. And if it be our duty to warn you of them, ſurely 'tis yours to watch, leſt you by any of them be led into temptation in this houre thereof, wherein Satan is let looſe in ſo great a meaſure to deceive the Nation. May you not as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be ſowered with this leaven, as the diſciples whom Chriſt bids beware? Are you priviledged above thoſe famous Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> many of which were bewitched with falſe teachers, and in a manner turned to another Goſpel? Is Satan grown Orthodox, or have his inſtruments loſt their cunning, who hunt for ſouls? In a word, is there not a ſympathy between thy corrupt heart and errour? Haſt thou not a diſpoſition, which like the <hi>fomes</hi> of the earth, makes it natural for theſe weeds to grow in thy ſoile. Seeſt thou not many proſtrated by this enemy, who ſate upon the mountain of their faith, and thought it ſhould never have been removed, ſurely they would
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:119001:145"/>
have tooke it ill to have been told you are the men and women that will decry Sabbaths, which now ye count holy; you will turn Pelagians, who now defie the name; you will deſpiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie it ſelf, who now ſeem ſo much to honour the Prophets; you will throw family-duties out of doors, who dare not now go out of doors, till you have prayed there. Yet theſe, and more then theſe are come to paſſe, and doth it hot behove thee (Chriſtian) to take heed leſt thou falleſt alſo? and that thou mayeſt not,</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, make it thy chief care to get a through change of thy  heart. If once the root of the matter be in thee, and thou beeſt bottom'd by a lively faith on Chriſt, thou art then ſafe, I do not ſay wholly free from all errour, but this I am ſure, free from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphing thy ſoule in damning errour. <hi>They went out from us,</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John) but they were not of us, for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> 1 John 2.19 As if he had ſaid, they had ſome outward Profeſſion, and common work of the Spirit with us, which they have either loſt or carried over to the devils quarters, but they never had the unction of the ſanctifying Spirit. By this, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. he diſtinguiſheth them, and comforts the ſincere ones, who poſſibly might feare their own fall by their departure: <hi>But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.</hi> 'Tis one thing to know a truth, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing to know it by unction. An hypocrite may do the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Saint only the latrer It is this unction which gives the ſoule the ſavour of the knowledge of Chriſt; thoſe are the fit prey for Impoſtors, who are enlightened, but not enlivened. O it's good to have the heart eſtabliſh't with grace, this as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor will keep us from being ſet a drift, and carried about with divers and ſtrange doctrines, as the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, ply the work of mortification. Crucifie the fleſh  daily. Hereſie though a ſpiritual ſinne, yet by the Apoſtle reckon'd among the deeds of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. becauſe it is occaſioned by fleſhly motives, and nouriſht by carnal food and fuel. Never any turn'd Heretick, but fleſh was at the bottome, either they ſerv'd their belly, or a luſt of pride; 'twas the way to Court, or ſecur'd their eſtates, and ſaved their lives, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the reward of truth is fire and fagot; ſome pad or other
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:119001:146"/>
is in the ſtraw when leaſt ſeen, and therefore it's no wonder that hereſies ſhould end in the fleſh, which in a manner ſprang from it. The rheume in the head aſcends in fumes from the ſtomack, and returnes thither, or unto the lungs which at laſt fret and ulcerate: Carnal affections firſt ſend up their fumes to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, clouding that, yea, bribing it to receive ſuch and ſuch principles for truths, which imbraced, fall down into the life corrupting that with the ulcer of profaneneſſe. So that, Chriſtian, if once thou canſt take off thy engagements to the fleſh, and become a free-man, ſo as not to give thy vote to gratifie thy carnal fears or hopes, thou wilt then be a ſure friend to truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, waite conſcionably on the Miniſtery of the Word. Satan commonly ſtops the eare from hearing ſound Doctrine, before he opens it to embrace corrupt. This is the method of ſoules apoſtatizing from truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>They ſhall turn their eares from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables.</hi> Satan like a cunning thief drawes the ſoul out of the road into ſome lane or corner, and there robs him of the truth. By rejecting of one Ordinance we deprive our ſelves of the bleſſing of all other: ſay not that thou prayeſt to be led into truth, he will not hear thy prayer if thou turneſt thine eare from hearing the law. He that loves his child, when he ſees him play the truant, will whip him to ſchool: If God loves a ſoul, he will bring him back to the Word with ſhame and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, When thou heareſt any unuſual Doctrine, though never ſo pleaſing, make not up the match haſtily with it: have ſome better teſtimony of it before you open your heart to it. The Apoſtle indeed bids us <hi>entertain ſtrangers,</hi> for ſome have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd Angels unawares, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. but he would not have us carried about with <hi>strange Doctrine,</hi> verſ. 9. by this I am ſure ſome have entertained devils. I confeſſe. 'tis not enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a doctrine, becauſe ſtrange to us, but ground we have to wait and enquire. <hi>Paul</hi> marvelled that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſo ſoon removed from him, who had called them unto the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel; they might ſure have ſtayed till they had acquainted <hi>Paul</hi> with it, and asked his judgement; what, no ſooner an Impoſtour come into the countrey and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his pack, but buy all his ware at firſt ſight? O friends,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:119001:146"/>
were it not more wiſdom to pray ſuch new notions over and over again, to ſearch the Word and our hearts by it, yea, not to truſt our own hearts, but call in counſel from others. If your Miniſter have not ſuch credit with you, yet the moſt holy, humble and eſtabliſh't Chriſtians you can finde. Errour is like fiſh, which muſt be eaten new, or it will ſtink, When thoſe dangerous errours ſprung up firſt in <hi>New England,</hi> O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled were many of the Churches? what an outis was made, as if ſome mine of gold had been diſcovered; but in a while, when thoſe errours came to their complexion, and it was perceived whither they were bound, to deſtroy Churches, Ordinances, and Power of Godlineſſe: then ſuch as feared God, who had ſtept aſide, returned back with ſhame and ſorrow.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Pride of Gifts, and how Satan tempts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian thereto.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecond ſpiritual wickedneſſe which Satan provokes unto, eſpecially the Saint, is ſpiritual pride. This was the ſin made him of a bleſſed Angel a curſed devil, and as it was his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, ſo he chiefly labours to derive it to the ſons of men: and he ſo far prevailed on our firſt Parents, that ever ſince this ſin hath and doth claim a kinde of regency in the heart, making uſe both of bad and good to draw her chariot. Firſt, of evil; Pride enters into the labours of other ſins, they do but work to make her brave, as ſubjects to uphold the ſtate and grandure of their Prince: Thus you ſhall ſee ſome drudge and droile, cheat, coſen, oppreſſe; and what mean they? O 'tis to get an eſtate to maintain their pride. Others fawn and flatter, lie, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and for what? to help pride up ſome mount of honour. Again, it maketh uſe of that which is good, it can work with
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119001:147"/>
Gods own tooles, his Ordinances, by which the holy Spirit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth his Kingdom of grace in the hearts of his Saints. Theſe often are proſtituted to pride. A man may be very zealous in prayer and painful in preaching, and all the while pride is the Maſter whom he ſerves, though in Gods livery. It can take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the holieſt actions, and hide it ſelf under the ſkirt of vertue it ſelf. Thus while a man is exerciſing his charity pride may be the idol in ſecret for which he laviſheth out his gold ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is hard ſtarving this ſin, becauſe there is nothing almoſt but it can live on; nothing ſo baſe that a proud heart will not be lift up with, and nothing ſo ſacred but it will profane, even dare to drink in the bowles of the Sanctuary, nay, rather then ſtarve it will feed on the carcaſes of other ſins; <hi>Difficilè valde vitatur peccatum, quod ex victoriâ vitiorum naſcitur.</hi> This mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion pride will ſtir up the ſoule to reſiſt, yea, in a manner kill ſome ſins, that ſhe may boaſtingly ſhew the head of them, and blow the creature up with the conceit of himſelf above others; as the Phariſee who through pride bragged that he was not as the Publicane; ſo that pride, if not look't to, will have to do every where, and hath a large ſphere it moves in. Nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (without divine aſſiſtance) the creature hath or doth, but will ſoon become a prey to this devourer; but I am not to handle it in its latitude. Pride is either converſant about carnal objects, as pride of beauty, ſtrength, riches and ſuch like, or about ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; the latter we ſhall ſpeak a little to. I confeſſe for the former, poſſibly a Saint may be catched in them, no ſin to be ſlighted, yet not ſo commonly, for ordinarily pride is of thoſe perfections which are ſuitable, if not proper to the ſtate and calling we are in: thus the Muſician, he is proud of the skill he hath in his Art, by which he excells others of his rank. The Scholar, though he can play perhaps as well, yet is not proud of that, but looks on it as beneath him; no, he is proud of his learning and choice notions, and ſo of others. Now the life of a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian, is ſuperiour to the life of man as a man; and therefore doth not value himſelf by theſe which are beneath him, but in higher and more raiſed perfections, which ſuit a Chriſtians calling. As a natural man is proud of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuitable to his natural eſtate, as honour, beauty; ſo the Chriſtian is prone chiefly, to be puffed up with perfections ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:119001:147"/>
to his life; I ſhall name three: pride of Gifts, pride of Grace, pride of Priviledges; theſe are the things which Satan chiefly labours to entangle him in.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="section">
                     <head>SECT. I.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, Pride of Gifts. By Gifts I mean thoſe ſupernatural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, with which the Spirit of God doth enrich and endow the mindes of men, for edification of the body of Chriſt; of which gifts the Apoſtle tells us there is great diverſity, and all from the ſame Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. There is not greater vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of colours, and qualities in plants and flowers, with which the earth like a carpet of needle-work is variegated fOr the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſervice of man, then there is of gifts in the mindes of men, natural and ſpiritual to render them uſeful to one another, both in civil ſocieties and Chriſtian fellowſhip. The Chriſtian as well as man is intended to be a ſociable creature, and for the better managing this ſpiritual Common-wealth among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; God doth wiſely and graciouſly provide and impart gifts, ſuitable to the place every one ſtands in to his brethren, as the veſſels are larger or leſſe in the body natural, according to their place therein. Now Satan labours what he can to taint theſe gifts, and fly-blow them with pride in the Chriſtian, that ſo he may ſpoile the Chriſtians trade and commerce, which is mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally maintained by the gifts and graces of one another. Pride of gifts hinders the Chriſtians trade, at leaſt thriving by their commerce two wayes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, pride of gifts is the cauſe why we do ſo little good with them to others.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, why we receive ſo little good from the gifts of others.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, pride of gifts hinders the doing of good by them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that upon a threefold account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, pride diverts a man from aiming at that end; ſo far as  pride prevails the man prayes, preaches, &amp;c. rather to be thought good by others, then to do good to others; rather to enthrone himſelf then Chriſt, in the opinions and hearts of his hearers. Pride carries the man aloft, to be admired for the height of his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:119001:148"/>
parts and notions, and will not ſuffer him to ſtoop ſo low as to ſpeak of plain truths, or if he does, not plainly; he muſt have ſome fine lace, though on a plain ſtuffe, ſuch a one may tickle the eare, but very unlikely to do real good to the ſoules: alas, it is not that he attends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if this painted <hi>Jezabel</hi> of pride be perceived to look out at the window in any exerciſe, whether of preaching, prayer, or conference, it doth beget a diſdain in the ſpirits of thoſe that heare ſuch a one both good and bad. 'Tis a ſin very odious to a gracious heart, and oft-times makes the ſtomack go againſt the food; though good, through their abhorrency of that pride they ſee in the inſtrument. It is indeed their weakneſſe, but wo to them that by their pride lead them into temptation! nay, thoſe that are bad and may be in the ſame kinde, like not that in another which they favour in themſelves, and ſo prejudiced, return as bad as they went.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, pride of gifts robs us of Gods bleſſing in the uſe of them. The humble man may have Satan at his right hand to oppoſe him, but be ſure the proud man ſhall finde God himſelf there to reſiſt him, whenever he goes about any duty. God proclaims ſo much, and would have the proud man know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he meets him he will oppoſe him; <hi>he reſiſts the proud.</hi> Great gifts are beautiful as <hi>Rachel,</hi> but pride makes them alſo barren like her. Either we muſt lay ſelf aſide, or God will lay us aſide.</p>
                     <p>

Grace is too much neglected, where gifts are too highly prized; we are commanded to be clothed with humility.

                  <p>SEcondly, pride of grace. This is another way Satan aſſaults the Chriſtian. 'Tis true, grace cannot be proud, yet 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a Saint may be proud of his grace, there is nothing the Chriſtian hath or doth, but this worme of pride will breed in it. The world we live in is corruptible, and all here is ſubject to putrefie, as things kept in a rafty muggiſh room, ſubject them to mould. It is not the nature of grace, but the ſalt of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant keeps and preſerves the purity of it; in heaven indeed we ſhall be ſafe. But how can a Saint be ſaid to be proud of his grace? Then a ſoule is proud of his grace, when he truſts in his grace. Truſt and confidence is an incommunicable flower of Gods Crown as Soveraign Lord, even among men it goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with royalty. Set up a King, and as ſuch he expects you ſhould give him this, as the undoubted Prerogative of his place, and therefore to ſeek protection from any other, is (as it were) to ſet up another King, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15. <hi>If indeed you anoint me King over you, then come and put your truſt under my ſhadow</hi>; therefore when a ſoule puts his truſt in any thing beſide God, he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119001:153"/>
ſets up a Prince, a King, an Idol, to which he gives Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away. Now it doth not make the ſin leſſe, that it is the grace of God we crown, then if it were a luſt we crowned. 'Tis ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to worſhip a holy Angel as well as a curſed devil, to make our grace a god, as well as our belly our god, nay rather it addes to it, becauſe that is now uſed to rob him of his glory, which ſhould have brought him in the greateſt revenue of glory; certainly the more treaſure you put into your ſervants hands, the greater wrong to you for him to run away with it. I doubt not but <hi>David</hi> could have borne it better to have ſeen a Philiſtine drive him from his throne then a ſonne, an <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom.</hi> But how can or may a Saint be ſaid to truſt in his grace?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by truſting to the ſtrength of his grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by truſting on the worth of his grace. Indeed a profeſſed truſt in grace, I conceive, cannot ſtand with grace: but there is an oblique kinde of truſt, or that which by interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſavour of it. Satan is ſlie in his aſſaults.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, of the firſt, to truſt in the ſtrength of grace is to be proud of grace. This is oppoſed to that poverty of ſpirit ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. by which a man lives in the continual ſenſe of his ſpiritual beggery and nothingneſſe, and ſo hath his recourſe to Chriſt, as the poor to the rich mans door, knowing he hath nothing at home to maintain him. Such a one was <hi>Paul,</hi> not able to do any thing of himſelf; he is not aſhamed to let the world know that Chriſt carries his purſe for him. <hi>Our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> yea, after many years trading, this holy man ſees nothing he hath got, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13. <hi>I count not my ſelf to have apprehended:</hi> he is ſtill preſſing forward; ask him how he lives, he'll tell you who keeps houſe for him; <hi>I live, yet not I,</hi> Gal. 2.20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ask a beggar where he hath his meat, cloathes, &amp;c. he'll ſay, <hi>I thank my good Maſter</hi>; Now Satan chiefly labours to puffe the ſoul up with an over-weening conceit of his own ability, as the readieſt means to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſnare; Satan knows 'tis Gods method to give his children
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119001:153"/>
into his hands, when once they grow proud and ſelf-confident: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was left to a temptation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. <hi>to try him.</hi> Why? God had tried him to purpoſe a little before in an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; what needs this? O <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> heart was lift up after his affliction. It was time for God to let the tempter alone a little to foile him; probably now <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had high thoughts of his grace; O he would never do as he had done before, and God will let him ſee what a weak creature he is. <hi>Peter</hi> makes a whip for his own back in that bravado; <hi>Though all ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee, yet will not I.</hi> Chriſt now in meer mercy muſt ſet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan on him, to lay him on his back; that ſeeing the weakneſſe of his faith, he might be diſmounted from the height of his pride. All that I ſhall ſay from this, is to ent<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eat thee (Chriſtian) to have a care of this kinde of pride. You know what <hi>Joah</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> when he perceived his heart lift up with the ſtrength of his Kingdom, and therefore would have the people numbered; <hi>The Lord God adde unto thy people, how many ſoever they be, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold; but why doth my Lord the King delight in this thing?</hi> 2 Sam. 24.3. The Lord adde to the ſtrength of thy grace a hundred fold, but why delighteſt thou in this? why ſhouldeſt thou be lift up? is it not grace? ſhall the Groom be proud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he rides on his Maſters horſe? or the mud wall becauſe the Sun ſhines on it? mayeſt thou not ſay of every dram of grace, as the young man of his hatchet, <hi>Alas, Muſter, it is borrowed?</hi> nay, not only borrowed, but thou canſt not uſe it without his skill and ſtrength that lends it thee. O beware of this, let not thoſe vain thoughts lodge in thee, left thou enter into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is a breach a whole troop of ſins may enter at, yea will, except ſpeedily fill'd up.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it will make thee ſoon grow looſe and negligent in thy  duty. 'Tis ſenſe of inſufficiency keeps a ſoul at work, to pray and heare, as want in the houſe and hutch holds up the market, no man comes thither to buy what he hath at home. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, go down to Egypt for corne, that we live and not die.</hi> Thus ſaith the needy Chriſtian, Up ſoul to thy God, thy faith is weak, thy patience almoſt ſpent, ply thee to the throne of grace, go with thy homer to the Ordinances, and get ſome ſupplies. Now a ſoule conceited of his ſtore, hath another ſong; <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou art richly laid in for many dayes.</hi> Let the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119001:154"/>
ſoule pray, thy faith is ſtrong; let the weake lie at the breaſt, thou art well grown up; nay, 'tis well if it goes not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a deſpiſing of Ordinances, except they have ſome more courtly fate then ordinary: ſuch a paſſe were the <hi>Corinthians</hi> come to, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye reign like Kings without us.</hi> I pray obſerve how he layes the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent on the particle <hi>now</hi>; now ye are rich, as if he had ſaid, I knew the time, if <hi>Paul</hi> had been come to town, and newes ſpread abroad in the City that <hi>Paul</hi> was to preach, you would have flock't to hear him, and bleſſed God for the ſeaſon, but then you were poor and empty; now ye are full, you have got to a higher attainment; <hi>Paul</hi> is a plain fellow now, he may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his cheere to a hungry people if he will, we are well apaid. And when once the heart is come to this, 'tis eaſie to judge what will follow.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this truſting to the ſtrength of grace will make the ſoule bold and venturous. The humble Chriſtian is the wary Chriſtian, he knows his weakneſſe, and this makes him afraid. I have a weak head, ſaith he, I may be ſoon diſputed into an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and hereſie, and therefore I dare not come where ſuch ſtuffe is broach't, leſt my weak head ſhould be intoxicated: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident man he'll ſip of every cup, he fears none; no, he is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh't in the truth, a whole team of hereticks ſhall not draw him aſide. I have a vain light heart, ſaith the humble ſoule; I dare not come among wicked debautch't company, left I ſhould at laſt bring the naughty man home with me: but one truſting to the ſtrength of his grace, dares venture into the devils quarters. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> into the rout of Chriſts enemies, and how he came off you know; there his faith had been ſlain on the place, had not Chriſt founded a retreat, by the ſeaſonable look of love he gave him. Indeed I have read of ſome bragging Philoſophers, who did not think it enough to be temperate, except they had the object for intemperance preſent; and therefore they would go into Taverns and Whore-houſes, as if they meant to beat the devil on his own ground; but the Chriſtian knows an enemy nearer then ſo, which they were ignorant of; and that he need not go over his own threſhold to challenge the devils He hath luſt in his boſome that will be hard enough for him all his dayes, without giving it the vantage ground. Chriſtian, I know no ſin,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119001:154"/>
but thou mayeſt be left to commit it, except one. It was a bold ſpeech of him, and yet a good man (as I have heard,) If <hi>Clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> die of the plague, ſay <hi>Clapham</hi> had no faith, and this made him boldly go among the infected. If a Chriſtian, thou ſhalt not die of ſpiritual plagues, yet ſuch may have the plague-ſores of groſſe ſins running on them for a time, and is not this ſad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? therefore walk humbly with thy God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this high conceit of the ſtrength of thy grace will  make thee cruel and churliſh to thy weak brethren in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, a ſin that leaſt becomes a Saint, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If any one be overtaken, you that be ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch a one with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>; but how ſhall a ſoul get ſuch a meek ſpirit? It follows, <hi>conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be tempted.</hi> What makes men hard to the poor? they think they ſhall never be ſo themſelves. Why are many ſo ſharp in their cenſures, but becauſe they truſt too much to their grace, as if they could never fall? O you are in the body, and the body of ſin in you, therefore feare. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> uſed to ſay, when he heard any ſcandalous ſin of a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour; <hi>Hodie illi, cras mihi.</hi> He fell to day, I may ſtumble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond way a ſoule may be proud of his grace, is by reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing  on it for his acceptance with God. The Scripture calls inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace <hi>our own righteouſneſſe,</hi> (though God indeed be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it) and oppoſeth it to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which alone is called the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of God, Rom.</hi> 10.1. Now to reſt on any grace inherent, is to exalt our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe above the righteouſneſſe of God; and what pride will this amount to? If this ware ſo, then a Saint when he comes to heaven might ſay, This is Heaven which I have built, my grace hath purchaſed; and thus the God of Heaven ſhould become tenant to his creature in Heaven. No, God hath caſt the order of our ſalvation into another method, of grace, but not of grace in us, but grace to us. Inherent grace hath its place and office to accompany ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. but not procure it. This is Chriſts
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119001:155"/>
work, not graces. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> waited on the Lord at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they had their bounds, not a man muſt come up beſides <hi>Moſes</hi> to treat with God, no, not touch the Mount leſt they die: thus all the graces of the Spirit wait on God, but none come up to challenge any acceptance of God beſides faith, which is a grace that preſents the ſoul not in its own garments. But you will ſay, what needs all this? where is the man that truſts in his grace? Alas, where is the Chriſtian that doth fully ſtand clear, and freely come his off his own righteouſneſſe? he is a rare Pilot indeed, that can ſteere his faith in ſo direct a courſe, as not now and then to knock upon this duty, and run on ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that grace. <hi>Abraham</hi> went in to <hi>Hagar</hi>; and the children of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith are not perfectly dead to the Law, and may be found ſometimes in <hi>Hagars</hi> armes, witneſſe the fluxe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxe of our faith, according to the various aſpect of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: when this ſeems full, then our faith is at a ſpring-tide, and covers all the mountains of our fears; but let it ſeem to wain in any ſervice or duty, then the <hi>Jordan</hi> of our faith flies back, and leaves the ſoule naked. The devils ſpight is at Chriſt, and therefore ſince he could not hinder his landing, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all he could, nor work his will on his perſon when he was come; he goes now in a more refined way to darken the glory of his ſufferings, and the ſufficiency of his righteouſneſſe, by blending ours with his; this doctrine of Juſtification by faith, hath had more works and batteries made againſt it, then any other in the Scripture. Indeed many other errours were but his ſlie approaches to get nearer to undermine this; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he connot hide this truth, (which now ſhines in the Church like the Sun in its ſtrength) then he labours to hinder the practical improvement of it, that we (if he can help it) ſhall not live up to our own principles, making us at the ſame time, that in our judgement we profeſſe acceptance only through Chriſt, in our practice confute our ſelves. Now there is a double pride in the ſoule he makes uſe of for this end, the one I may call a mannerly pride, the other a ſelf-applauding pride.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a mannerly pride, which comes forth in the habit and guiſe of humility, and that diſcovers it ſelf, either at the ſoules firſt coming to Chriſt, and keeps him from cloſing with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or afterward in the daily courſe of a Chriſtians walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119001:155"/>
with God, which keeps him from comfortable living on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, when a poor ſoul is ſtaved off the promiſe by the ſenſe of his own unworthineſſe and great unrighteouſneſſe; tell him of a pardon, alas, he is ſo wrapt up with the thoughts of his own vileneſſe, that you cannot faſten it upon him. What, will God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take ſuch a toad as he is into his boſome, diſcount ſo many great abominations at once, and receive him into his favour, that hath been ſo long in rebellious armes againſt him? he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve it, no, though he heares what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for ſin, he refuſeth to be comforted. Little doth the ſoule think what a bitter root ſuch thoughts ſpring from, thou thinkeſt thou doeſt well thus to declaim againſt thy ſelf, and aggravate thy ſins; indeed thou canſt not paint them black e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or entertain too low and baſe thoughts of thy ſelfe for them: But what wrong hath God and Chriſt done thee, that thou ſhouldeſt ſo unworthily reflect upon the mercy of the one, and merit of the other? Mayeſt thou not do this, and be tender of the good Name of God alſo? Is there no way to ſhew thy ſenſe of thy ſin, except thou aſperſe thy Saviour? Canſt thou not charge thy ſelf, but thou muſt condemn God, and put Chriſt and his blood to ſhame before Satan, who triumphs more in this then all thy other ſins? In a word, though thou like a wretch haſt undone thy ſelf, and damned thy ſoule by thy ſins, yet art thou not willing God ſhould have the glory of pardoning them, and Chriſt the honour of procuring the ſame? or art thou like him in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.3. <hi>who could not dig, and to beg was aſhamed.</hi> Thou canſt not earne heaven by thy own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and is thy ſpirit ſo ſtout that thou wilt not beg it for Chriſts ſake, yea, take it at Gods hands, who in the Goſpel comes a begging to thee, and beſeecheth thee to be reconciled to him? Ah ſoule, who would ever have thought there could have lien ſuch pride under ſuch a modeſt veile? and yet none like it. 'Tis horrible pride for a beggar to ſtarve, rather then take an alms at a rich mans hands: a malefactour rather to chooſe his halter then a pardon from his gracious Princes hand: but here is one infinitely ſurpaſſing both; a ſoule pining and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in ſin, and yet rejecting the mercy of God, and the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng hand of Chriſt to ſave him, Though <hi>Abigail</hi> did not
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:119001:156"/>
think her ſelf worthy to be <hi>Davids</hi> wife, yet ſhe thought <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was worthy of her, and therefore ſhe humbly accepted his offer, and makes haſte to go with the meſſengers: That's the ſweet frame of heart indeed, to lie low in the ſenſe of your own vileneſſe, yet to believe; to renounce all conceit of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in our ſelves, yet not therefore to renounce all hope of mercy, but the more ſpeedily to make haſte to Chriſt that wooes us. All the pride and unmannerlineſſe lies in making Chriſt ſtay for us, who bids his meſſengers invite poor ſinners to come and tell them <hi>all things are ready.</hi> But may be thou wilt ſay ſtill, it is not pride that keeps thee off, but thou canſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ever God will entertain ſuch as thou art. Truly, thou mendeſt the matter but little with this, either thou keepeſt ſome luſt in thy heart, which thou wilt not part with to obtain the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the promiſe, and then thou art a notorious hypocrite, who under ſuch an out-cry for thy ſins, canſt drive a ſecret trade with hell at the ſame time; or if not ſo, thou doeſt diſcover the more pride in that thou dareſt ſtand out, when thou haſt nothing to oppoſe againſt the many plain and clear promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but thy peremptory unbelief. God bids the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his wayes, and turne to him, and he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him; but thou ſayeſt thou canſt not believe this for thy own ſelf. Now who ſpeaks the truth? One of you two muſt be the liar, either thou muſt take it with ſhame to thy ſelf, for what thou haſt ſaid againſt God and his promiſe, (and that is thy beſt courſe) or thou muſt proudly, yea, blaſphemouſly caſt it upon God, as every unbeliever doth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. Nay, thou makeſt him forſworn for God, to give poor ſinners the greater ſecurity in flying for refuge to Chriſt, who is that <hi>hope ſet</hi> before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. hath ſworn they ſhould have ſtrong conſolation: <hi>O beatos quorum cauſâ Deus jurat! O miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimos ſi nec juranti credamus.</hi> Tertul. de poenit. O happy we, for whoſe ſake God puts himſelf under an oath; but O miſerable we, who will not believe God, no, not when he ſweares!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when the ſoul hath ſhot the great gulfe, and got into a ſlate of peace and life by cloſing with Chriſt, yet this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly pride Satan makes uſe of in the Chriſtians daily courſe of duty and obedience, to diſturb him and hinder his peace and comfort. O how unchearfully, yea, joyleſly do many precious
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:119001:156"/>
ſoules paſſe their dayes! If you enquire what is the cauſe, you ſhall finde all their joy runs out at the crannies of their imperfect duties and weak graces; they cannot pray as they would, and walk as they deſire with evenneſſe and conſtancy; they ſee how ſhort they fall of the holy rule in the Word, and the patterne which others more eminent in grace do ſet before them, and this though it doth not make them throw the Promiſes away, and quite renounce all hope in Chriſt, yet it begets many ſad fears and ſuſpitions, yea, makes them ſit at the feaſt Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and not know whether they may eat or not. In a word, as it robs them of their joy, ſo Chriſt of that glory which he ſhould receive from their rejoycing in him, I do not ſay, (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) thou oughteſt not to mourn for thoſe defects thou findeſt in thy graces and duties, nay, thou couldeſt not approve thy ſelf to be ſincere, if thou didſt not. A gracious heart, ſeeing how far ſhort his renewed ſtate (forthe preſent) falls of mans primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holineſſe by Creation, cannot but weep and mourn, (as the Jewes to behold the ſecond Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) yet (Chriſtian even while the tears are in thy eyes for thy imperfect graces, (for a ſoule riſeth with his grave-clothes on) thou ſhouldeſt rejoyce, yea, triumph over all theſe thy defects by faith in Chriſt, <hi>in whom thou art compleat,</hi> Col. 1.10. while imperfect in thy ſelfe. Chriſts preſence in the ſecond Temple, (which the firſt had not) made it (though comparatively mean) more glorious then the firſt <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.9 how much more doth his preſence in this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual temple of a gracious heart, imputing his righteouſneſſe to cover all its uncomelineſſe, make the ſoule glorious above man at firſt? This is a garment for which (as Chriſt ſaith of the lilie) we neither ſpin nor toile; yet <hi>Adam</hi> in all his created royalty was not ſo clad, as the weakeſt believer is with this on his ſoul. Now, Chriſtian, conſider well what thou doeſt, while thou ſitteſt languiſhing under the ſenſe of thy own weakneſſes, and refuſeſt to rejoyce in Chriſt, and live comfortably on the ſweet priviledges thou art intereſſed in by thy marriage to him. Doeſt thou not bewray ſome of this ſpiritual pride working in thee? O, if thou couldeſt pray without wandering, walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limping, believe without wavering, then thou couldeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and walk chearfully, It ſeems, ſoule, thou ſtayeſt to bring the ground of thy comfort with thee, and not to receive it pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

O how much better were it if thou wouldeſt ſay with <hi>David: Though my houſe,</hi> my heart, <hi>be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me a Covenant ordered in all things and ſure</hi>; and this is all my deſire, all my confidence; Chriſt I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to all my ſins, Chriſt to all wants, he is my all in all and all above all. Indeed all thoſe complaints of our wants and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſo far as they withdraw our hearts from relying chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on Chriſt, they are but the language of pride hankering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Covenant of works. O 'tis hard to forget our mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, which is ſo natural to us, labour therefore to be ſenſible of it, how grievous it is to the Spirit of Chriſt. What would a husband ſay, if his wife in ſtead of expreſſing her love to him, and delight in him, ſhould day and night do nothing but weep and cry to think of her former husband that is dead? The Law (as a Covenant) and Chriſt are compared to two husbands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Ye are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him who is raiſed from the dead.</hi> Now thy ſorrow for the defect of thy own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, when it hinders thy rejoycing in Chriſt, is but a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after thy other husband, and this Chriſt cannot but take unkindely, that thou art not as well pleaſed to lie in the boſome of Chriſt, and have thy happineſſe from him as with your old husband the Law.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, thy grace cannot thrive ſo long as thou thus reſteſt on it. A legal ſpirit is no friend to grace, nay, a bitter enemy againſt it, as appeared by the Phariſees in Chriſts time. Grace comes not by the Law, but by Chriſt; thou mayeſt ſtand long enough by it, before thou getteſt any life of grace into thy ſoule, or further life into thy grace. If thou wouldeſt have this, thou muſt ſet thy ſelf under Chriſts wings by faith; from his Spirit in the Goſpel alone, comes this kindly natural heat to hatch thy ſoul to the life of holineſſe, and increaſe what thou haſt and thou canſt not come under Chriſts wings, till thou comeſt from under the ſhadow of the other, by renouncing all expectation from thy own works and ſervices. You know <hi>Reubens</hi> curſe, that he ſhould not excel, becauſe he went up into his fathers bed; when other tribes encreaſed, he ſtood at a little number. By truſting in thy own works thou doeſt worſe by Chriſt, and ſhalt thou excel in grace? Perhaps ſome of you have been long Profeſſours, and yet come to little growth in love to God, humility, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſſe, mortification, and 'tis worth the digging to ſee what lies at the root of your Profeſſion, whether there be not a legal principle that hath too much acted you. Have you not thought to carry all with God from your duties and ſervices, and too much laid up your hopes in your own actings? Alas, this is as ſo much dead earth, which muſt be thrown out, and Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principles laid in the room thereof; try but this courſe, and ſee whether the ſpring of thy grace will not come on apace. <hi>David</hi> gives an account how he came to ſtand and flouriſh, when ſome
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119001:158"/>
that were rich and mighty, on a ſudden withered and came to nothing. <hi>Lo,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this is the man that made not God his ſtrength, but truſted in the abundance of his riches. But I am like a green olive-tree in the Houſe of God; I truſt in the mercy of God forever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 52.7, 8. While others truſt in the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of their own righteouſneſſe and ſervices and make not Chriſt their ſtrength, do thou renounce all, and truſt in the mercy of God in Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be like a green olive when they fade and wither.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſtian, you will not thrive in true comfort ſo long as you reſt in any inherent work of grace, and do not ſtand clear of your own actings and righteouſneſſe. Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort ſprings from a Goſpel-root, which is Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> Now a ſoule that reſts on any holineſſe in himſelf; he graffs his comfort upon himſelf, not Chriſt; he ſucks his own breaſt, not Chriſts; and ſo makes Chriſt a dry nurſe: and what comfort can grow on that dry tree? The Spirit is our Comforter as well as our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Counſellour. Now as the Spirit when he teacheth comes not with any new or ſtrange truth, but takes of Chriſts owne; (what he findes in the Word) ſo where he comforts, he takes of Chriſts own, his righteouſneſſe, not our own: Chriſt is the matter and ground of his comfort: all cordials are but Chriſt diſtill'd, and made up in ſeveral promiſes: his acting, not ours; his ſuffering, not ours; his holineſſe, not ours; he doth not ſay, Soul, rejoyce, thou art holy; but, Soule, triumph, Chriſt is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and is <hi>the Lord thy righteouſneſſe</hi>; Not, Soul, thou prayeſt ſweetly, feare not; but thou haſt an Advocate with the Father, Chriſt the righteous: ſo that the firſt ſtep to the receiving of comfort from the Spirit, is to ſend away all Comforters of our own. As in learning of the Spirit, he that will be taught by him, muſt firſt become a fool, (that is, no way lean to his own underſtanding,) ſo he that would be comforted, muſt firſt be emptied of all ſelf-ſupports, muſt not lean to his owne comforts. As a Phyſician firſt bids his Patient caſt off all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he hath tampered with, he asks what Phyſick he hath had from them, takes off their plaiſters, throws away their Phyſick, and goes about the work <hi>de novo</hi>: So the Spirit when he comes
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119001:159"/>
to comfort a poor ſoul; Firſt, perſwades the ſoule to ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all its old Phyſicians. O, ſaith the ſoule, I have been in the hand of ſuch a duty, ſuch a courſe of obedience, and have thought ſure now I ſhall be well, and have comfort now I do this duty, ſet upon ſuch a holy courſe. Well, ſaith the Spirit, if you will have me do any thing, theſe muſt all be diſmiſt in point of confidence. Now, and not till how, is the ſoule a ſubject fit to receive the Spirits comforts. And therefore, friends, as you love your inward peace, beware what veſſel you draw your comfort from. Grace is finite, and ſo cannot afford much. 'Tis leaking, and ſo cannot hold long; thou drinkeſt in a riven diſh, that haſt thy comfort from thy grace. 'Tis mixt, and ſo weak; and weak grace cannot give ſtrong conſolation, and ſuch thou needeſt, eſpecially in ſtrong conflicts; Nay laſtly, thy comfort which thou draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from it is ſtollen, thou doeſt not come honeſtly by it, and ſtollen comforts will not thrive with thee. Oh, what folly is it for the childe to play the thief for that which he may have freely and more fully from his Father, who gives and reproacheth not? that comfort which thou wouldeſt filch out of thy own righteouſneſſe and duties; behold, it is laid up for thee in Chriſt, from whoſe fulneſſe thou mayeſt carry as much as thy faith can hold, and none to check thee, yea, the more thou improveſt Chriſt for thy comfort, the more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome; we are bid <hi>to open our mouth wide, and he will fill it.</hi>

If thou hadſt a thouſand lives, thou wouldeſt owe them all to him: but thou art beholden to God exceedingly, that he will call for theſe in this way, which has ſuch an honour and reward attending it. He might have ſuffered thee to live in thy luſts, and at laſt to ſuffer the loſſe of all theſe for them. O how many die at the Gallowes as Martyrs in the devils cauſe, for felonies, rapes and murders! Or he might withdraw his grace, and leave thee to thy own cowardiſe and unbelief, and then thou wouldeſt ſoon ſhew thy ſelf in thy colours. The ſtouteſt Champions for Chriſt, have been taught how weak they are if Chriſt ſteps aſide. Some that have given great teſtimony of their faith and reſolution in Chriſts cauſe, even to come ſo near dying for his Name, as to give themſelves to be bound to the ſtake, and fire to be kindled upon them, yet then their hearts have failed, as that holy man Mr. <hi>Benbridge</hi> in our <hi>Engliſh Martyrol.</hi> who thruſt the faggots from him, and cried out, <hi>I recant, I recant.</hi> Yet this man, when

The more thou glorieſt in God that gives thee ſtrength to ſuffer for him, the leſſe thou wilt boaſt of thy ſelf: A thankful heart and a proud cannot dwell together in one boſome.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, conſider what a foule blot pride gives to all thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, where it is not bewailed and reſiſted, it alters the caſe. The old ſaying is, that 'tis not the puniſhment, but the cauſe makes the Martyr; we may ſafely ſay further, it is not barely the cauſe, but the ſincere frame of the heart in ſuffering for a good cauſe, that makes a man a Martyr in Gods ſight. Though thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt give thy body to be burnt, if thou haſt not an humble heart of a ſufferer for Chriſt, thou turneſt Merchant for thy ſelf. Thou denieſt but one ſelf to ſet up another, runneſt the hazard of thy eſtate and life to gain ſome applauſe, may be, and reare up a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to thy honour in the opinions of men; thou doeſt no more in this caſe then a ſouldier, who for a name of valour will venture into the mouth of death and danger, only thou ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy pride under a religious diſguiſe, but that helps it not, but makes it the worſe. If thou wilt in thy ſufferings be a ſacrifice acceptable to God, thou muſt not only be ready to offer up thy life for his truth, but ſacrifice thy pride alſo, or elſe thou mayeſt tumble out of one fire into another, ſuffer here from man, as a ſeeming champion for the Goſpel, and in another world from God, for robbing him of his glory in thy ſufferings.</p>

Indeed the genuine and natural effect, which ſuch diſcoveries of divine love
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119001:161"/>
have on a gracious ſoule, is to humble it. The ſight of mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the ſenſe of ſin, and that ſenſe diſſolves the ſoule kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into ſorrow, as we ſee in <hi>Magdalen.</hi> The heart which poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was hard and frozen in the ſhade, will give and thaw in the Sun-ſhine of love, and ſo long all pride is hid from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures eye. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>ye ſhall remember your wayes, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, &amp;c.</hi> And when ſhall this be, but when God would ſave them from all their uncleanneſſes, as appears? <hi>v.</hi> 25. yet notwithſtanding this, there remain ſuch dregs of corruption unpurged out of the beſt, that Satan findes it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to make the manifeſtations of Gods love an occaſion of pride to the Chriſtian: and truly God lets us ſee our proneneſſe to this ſin in the ſhort ſtay he makes, when he comes with any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſcoveries of his love. The Comforter ('tis true) abides for ever in the Saints boſome, but his joyes they come, and are gone again quickly. They are as exceedings, with which he feaſts the believer, but the cloth is ſoon drawn; and why ſo, but becauſe we cannot bear them for our every day food? A ſhort interview of heaven, and a viſion of love now and then upon the mount of an ordinance or affliction, cheeres the ſpirits of drooping Chriſtians, who might they have leave to build Tabernacles there, and dwell under a conſtant ſhine of ſuch manifeſtations, would be prone to forget themſelves, and think they were Lords of their own comforts. If holy <hi>Paul</hi> was in danger of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this diſtemper of pride from his ſhort rapture, to prevent which God ſaw it needful to let him blood with a thorne in the fleſh, would not our blood much more grow too rank, and we too crank and wanton, if we ſhould feed long on ſuch luſcious food? And therefore, if ever (Chriſtian) thou hadſt need to watch, then is the time when comforts abound, and God dandles thee moſt on the knee of his love, when his face ſhines with cleareſt manifeſtations, leſt this ſin of pride (as a thief in the candle) ſhould ſwaile out thy joy. To prevent which thou ſhouldeſt do well; Firſt, to look that thou meaſureſt not thy grace by thy comfort, leſt ſo thou beeſt led into a falſe opinion, that thy grace is ſtrong, becauſe thy comforts are ſo. Satan will be ready to help forward ſuch thoughts as a fit <hi>medium</hi> to life thee up, and ſlacken thy care in duty for the future. Such diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119001:162"/>
do indeed bear witneſſe to the truth of thy grace, but not to the decree and meaſure of it; the weak childe may be, yea, is oftner in the lap then the ſtrong. Secondly, do not ſo much applaud thy ſelf in thy preſent comfort, as labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it for the glory of God. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p and eate, ſaith the Angel to the Prophet, becauſe the journey is too great for thee.</hi> The manifeſtations of Gods love are to fit us for our work. It is one thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the light of our comfort, and another to go forth in the power of the Spirit comforting us (as Giants refreſhed with this wine) to run our race of duty and obedience with more ſtrength and alacrity. He ſhews his pride, that ſpends his time in telling his money meerly to ſee how rich he is; but he his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that layes out his money and trades with it. The boaſter of his comforts will loſe what he hath, when he that improves his comforts in a fuller trade of duty ſhall adde more to what he hath. Thirdly, remember thou dependeſt on God for the continuance of thy comfort. They are not the ſmiles thou hadſt yeſterday can make thee joyous to day, any more then the bread thou didſt then eate can make thee ſtrong without more; thou needeſt new diſcoveries for new comforts: let God hide his face, and thou wilt ſoon loſe the ſight, and forget the taſte of what thou even now hadſt. It is beyond our skill or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to preſerve thoſe impreſſions of joy, and comfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Gods favour on our ſpirits, which ſometimes we finde; as Gods preſence brings thoſe, ſo when he goes he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them away with him, as the ſetting-Sun doth the day. We would laugh heartily at him, who when the Sun ſhines in at his window, ſhould think by ſhutting that to impriſon the Sun-beams in his chamber; and doeſt thou not ſhew as much folly, who thinkeſt becauſe thou now haſt comfort, thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhalt never be in darkneſſe of Spirit more? The believers comfort is like <hi>Iſraels</hi> Manna: 'tis not like our ordinary bread and proviſion; we buy at market and lock up in our Cupboards where we can go to it when we will; no, it is rained as that was from heaven. Indeed God provided for them after this ſort to humble them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Who fed thee in the wilderneſſe with Manna which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee.</hi> It was not becauſe ſuch mean food, that God is ſaid to humble them; for it was delicious food; therefore call'd <hi>Angels food,</hi>
                        <pb n="305" facs="tcp:119001:162"/>
Pſal. 78.25. Such as if Angels did eate, might ſerve them. But the manner of the diſpenſing it, from hand to mouth, every day their portion and no more, ſo that God kept the key of their Cupboard, they ſtood to his immediate allowance; and thus God communicates our ſpiritual comforts for the ſame end to humble us. So much for this ſecond ſort of ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>I had thought to have inſtanced in ſome other, as hypocriſie, unbelief, formality; but poſſibly the ſubject being general, what I have already ſaid may be thought but a digreſſion, and that too long.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore conclude this branch of <hi>ſpiritual wickedneſſe,</hi> in a word to thoſe who are yet in a natural and unſanctified ſtate, which is to ſtir them up from what I have ſaid (concerning Satans aſſaulting beleevers with ſuch temptations;) to conſider ſeriouſly, how that Satans chief deſigne againſt them alſo lies in the ſame ſins. Theſe are the wickedneſſes he labours to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph you in above all others. If ever you periſh, it will be by the hand of theſe ſins. 'Tis your feared conſcience, blinde minde, and dedolent impenitent heart, will be your undoing if you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry finally. Other ſins, the devil knowes, are preparatory to theſe, and therefore he drawes thee into them to bring thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe. Two wayes they prepare a way to ſpiritual ſins; Firſt, as they naturally diſpoſe the ſinner to them; 'tis the nature of ſin to blinde the minde, ſtupifie the conſcience, harden the heart, as is implied, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Leſt your heart be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin.</hi> As the feet of Travellers beat the high way hard, ſo does walking in carnal groſſe ſins the heart; they benumbe the conſcience, ſo that in time the ſinner loſes his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and can carry his luſts in his heart, (as Bedlams their pins in their very fleſh) without pain and remorſe. Secondly, as they do provoke God by a judiciary act to give them up to theſe ſins, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.65. <hi>Give them obſtinacy of heart,</hi> (ſo 'tis in your margin) <hi>thy curſe unto them</hi>; and when the devil hath got ſinners at this paſſe, then he hath them under lock and key. They are the fore-runners of damnation; if God leave thy heart hard and unbroken up, 'tis a ſad ſigne he means not to ſowe the ſeed of grace there. O ſinners pray, (as he did requeſt <hi>Peter</hi> for him) that none of theſe things may come upon you; which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119001:163"/>
that they may not, take heed thou rejecteſt not the offers he makes to ſoften thee. Gods hardening is a conſequent of, and a puniſhment for our hardening our own hearts. 'Tis moſt true what <hi>Proſper</hi> ſaith, <hi>Poteſt homo invitus amittere temporalia, non niſi volens amittere spiritualia</hi>: A man may loſe temporals againſt hia will, but not ſpirituals; God will harden none, damn none againſt their will.</p>

Indeed all the Chriſtian hath, or deſires as a Chriſtian is heavenly; the world is extrinſecal, both to his being and happineſſe; it is a ſtranger to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and intermeddles not with his joy nor grief. Heap all the riches and honours of the world upon a man, they will not make him a Chriſtian; heap them on a Chriſtian, they will not make him a better Chriſtian.

So far as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace prevails in the heart of a Saint, he hath put off the world in the deſire of it, and joy in it; ſo that theſe blowes are not much felt: and therefore they are his heavenly treaſures, which are the booty Satan waits for.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Chriſtians nature is heavenly, borne from above; As Chriſt is the Lord from heaven, ſo all his off-ſpring are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and holy: now Satans deſign is to debaſe and deflower this; 'tis the precious life of this new creature that he hunts for; he hath loſt that beauty of holineſſe which once ſhone ſo gloriouſly on his Angelical nature; and now like a true Apoſtate he endeavours to ruine that in the Chriſtian which he hath loſt himſelf. The ſeeds of this warre are ſowen in the Chriſtians na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; you are holy, that he cannot endure; <hi>Milet feri faciem,</hi> was <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſpeech, when to fight with the Romane Citizens, he bade his ſouldiers ſtrike at their face, theſe Citizens (ſaid he) love their beauty, marre that and marre all. The ſoul is the face whereon Gods image is ſtamp't: holineſſe is the beauty of this face, which makes us indeed like God, this Satan knowes God loves, and the Saint is chary of; and therefore he labours to wound and disfigure this, that he may at once glory in the Chriſtians ſhame, and poure contempt upon God in breaking his image; and is it not worth engaging limbe and life in battel againſt this enemy, who would rob us of that which makes us like God himſelf? Have you forgot the bloody Articles of peace
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:119001:164"/>
that <hi>Nahaſh</hi> offered to the men of <hi>Jabeſh-Gilead</hi>? no peace to be had, except they would let him thruſt out their right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which how it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained reade, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 11.6. The face is not ſo deformed that hath loſt its eye, as the ſoule is that loſeth its holineſſe; and no peace to be expected at Satans hands except he may deprive us of this: Me thinks at the thought of this, the Spirit of the Lord ſhould come upon the Chriſtian, and his anger ſhould be kindled much more againſt this curſed ſpirit, then <hi>Sauls</hi> and the men of <hi>Iſraels</hi> was againſt <hi>Nahaſh</hi>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Chriſtians trade is heavenly; the merchandize  he deals for is of the growth of that heavenly Countrey, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven.</hi> Every mans converſation is ſuitable to his calling; he whoſe trade lies in the earth minds earthly things: and he whoſe trade is heavenly followes that cloſe. <hi>Every man mindes his own buſineſſe,</hi> the Apoſtle tells us. You may poſſibly finde a Tradeſman out of his ſhop now and then, but he is as a fiſh out of the water, never in his element till he be in his calling again. Thus when the Chriſtian is about the world, and the worldling about heavenly matters, both are men out of their way, not right girt, till they get into their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment again. Now this heavenly trade is that which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan doth in an eſpecial manner labour to ſtop. Could the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian enjoy but a free trade with heaven a few years without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, he would ſoon grow a rich man, too rich indeed for earth; but what with loſſes ſuſtained by the hands of this Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Satan, and alſo the wrong he receives by the treachery of ſome in his own boſome, (that like unfaithful ſervants hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with this robber) he is kept but low in this life, and much of his gaines are loſt. Now the Chriſtians heavenly trade lies either within doors or abroad; he can be free in neither, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is at his heels in both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, within doores. This I may call his home-trade which  is ſpent in ſecret between God and his own ſoule, here the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian drives an unknown trade: he is at heaven and home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, richly laden in his thoughts with heavenly meditations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world knows where he hath been. Every creature he ſees is a text for his heart to raiſe ſome ſpiritual matter and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from: Every Sermon he heares cuts him out work
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:119001:165"/>
to make up and enlarge upon when he gets alone. Every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is as winde to his ſailes, and ſets his heart a moving in ſome heavenly affection or other ſuitable to the occaſion. One while he is wrap't up with joy in the conſideration of mercy, another while melted into godly ſorrow from the ſenſe of his ſins. Sometimes exalting God in his praiſes, anon abuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before God for his own vileneſſe. One while he is at the breaſt of the Covenant, milking out the conſolations of the Promiſes; at another time working his heart into a holy awe and feare of the threatenings. Thus the Chriſtian walks aloft, while the baſe worldling is licking the duſt below. One of theſe heavenly pearles which the Chriſtian trades for, is more worth then the worldling gets with all his ſweat and travel in his whole life. The Chriſtians feet ſtand where other mens heads are; he treads on the Moon, and is clothed with the Sun; he looks down on earthly men (as one from a high hill doth upon thoſe that live in ſome fenne or moore) and ſees them buried in a fog of carnal pleaſures and profits, while he breaths in a pure heavenly aire, but yet not ſo high as to be free from all ſtormes and tempeſts; many a ſad guſt he hath from ſin and Satan without. What elſe mean thoſe ſad complaints and groans, which come from the children of God, that their hearts are ſo dead and dull, their thoughts ſo roving and unfixt in duty, yea, many times ſo wicked and filthy, that they dare hardly tell what they are, for feare of ſtaining their own lips, and offending the eares of others by naming them? Surely, the Chriſtian findes it in his heart to will and deſire he could meditate, pray, heare, and live after another ſort then this, doth he not? yes, I durſt be his ſurety he doth. But ſo long as there is a devil tempts, and we continue within his walk, it will be thus more or leſſe, as faſt as we labour to clear the ſpring of our hearts, he will be labouring to royle or ſtop it again; ſo that we have two works to do at once, to performe a duty, and watch him that oppoſeth us, trowel and ſword both in our hands. They had need work hard indeed, who have others continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to pull down, as they are labouring to rear up the building.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that part of the Chriſtians trade, which lies abroad, is heavenly alſo. Take a Chriſtian in his relations, calling,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:119001:165"/>
neighbourhood, he is a heavenly trader in all; the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of his life is to be doing or receiving ſome good; that company is not for him that will neither give nor take this. What ſhould a Merchant be where there is no buying nor ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Every one labours (as his calling is) to ſeat himſelf where trade is quickeſt, and he is likeſt to have moſt takings. The Chriſtian (where he may chooſe) takes ſuch in relations near to himſelf, (husband, wife, ſervants) as may ſuite with his heavenly trade, and not ſuch as will be a pull-back to him; he falls in with the holieſt perſons as his deareſt acquaintance: if there be a Saint in the town where he lives, he'll finde him out, and this ſhall be the man he will conſort with; and in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with theſe and all elſe, his chief work is for heaven, his heavenly principle within inclines him to it. Now, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larums hell. What, not contented to go to heaven himſelf, but by his holy example, gracious ſpeeches, ſweet counſels, ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reproofs, will he be trading with others, and labour to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them along with him alſo? This brings the Lion fell and mad out of his den, ſuch to be ſure ſhall finde the devil in their way to oppoſe them. <hi>I would have come,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) but Sacan hindered me.</hi> He that will vouch God, and let it appear by the tenure of his converſation that he trades for him, ſhall have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies enough if the devil can help him to ſuch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Chriſtians hopes are all heavenly, he lots not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on  any thing the world hath to give him. Indeed he would think himſelf the moſt miſerable man of all others, if here were all he could make of his Religion. No, 'tis heaven and eternal life that he expects; and though he be ſo poor as not to be able to make a Will of a groat, yet he counts himſelf a greater heire, then if he were childe to the greateſt Prince on earth. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance he ſees by faith, and can rejoyce in the hope of the glory which it will bring him. The maſquery and cheating glory of the great ones of this world, moves him not to envy their fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pomp, but when on the dunghil himſelf, he can forget his own preſent ſorrowes to pity them in all their bravery, knowing that within a few dayes the croſſe will be off his back, and the crowns off their heads together, their portion will be ſpent when he ſhall be to receive all his. Theſe things entertain him with ſuch joy that they will not ſuffer him to acknowledge himſelf
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119001:166"/>
miſerable, when others think him and the devil tells him, he is ſuch. This, this torments the very ſoule of the devil, to ſee the Chriſtian under ſaile for heaven, fill'd with the ſweet hope of his joyful entertainment when he comes there, and therefore he raiſeth what ſtormes and tempeſts he can, either to hinder his arrival in that bleſſed Port, (which he moſt deſires, and doth not wholly deſpair of) or at leaſt to make it a troubleſome winter-voyage, (ſuch as <hi>Pauls</hi> was, in which they ſuffered ſo much loſſe,) and this indeed very often he obtains in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that by his violent impetuous temptations beating long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chriſtian, he makes him throw over much precious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his joyes and comforts; yea, ſometimes he brings the ſoul through ſtreſſe of temptation to think of quitting the ſhip, while for the preſent all hope of being ſaved ſeems to be taken away. Thus you ſee what we wreſtle with devils for. We come to <hi>Application.</hi>

Why then do you not embrace them? or are they the worſe, becauſe they come ſwimming to you in the blood of Chriſt? oh how ill muſt Chriſt take it to be thus uſed, when he comes on ſuch a gracious ambaſſage? may he not ſay to thee as once he did to thoſe officers ſent to attach him, <hi>Do you come out againſt me as a thief with ſwords and staves?</hi> If he be a thief, 'tis only in this, that he would ſteal your ſins from you, and leave heaven in the room: O, for the love of God think what you do, 'tis eternal life you put away from you, in doing of which, <hi>you judge your ſelves unworthy of it,</hi> Acts 13.46.</p>

Among thieves there are ſome ye call <hi>Setters,</hi> who enquire where a booty is to be had, which when they have found, and know ſuch a one travels with a charge about him, then they employ ſome other to rob him, and are themſelves not ſeen in the buſineſſe.

Thus he conſidered the admirable graces of <hi>Job,</hi> and caſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout how he might beſt rob him of his heavenly treaſure: and who but his wife and friends muſt do this for him? (well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his tale would receive credit from their mouths.) O friends, ask your conſciences, whether you have not done the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſome ſervice of this kinde in your dayes. Poſſibly you have a childe or ſervant who once look't heaven-ward, but your brow-beating of them ſcared them back, and now (may be) they are as carnal as you would have them: or poſſibly thy wife before acquainted with thee, was full of life in the wayes of God, but ſince ſhe hath been tranſplanted into thy cold ſoile, what by thy frothy ſpeeches and unſavoury converſation, at beſt thy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and formality, ſhe is now both decayed in her graces, and a loſer in her comforts.

None but would be glad their ſouls might be ſaved at laſt, but where is the man or woman that makes it appear by their vigourous endeavour that they mean in earneſt? what warlike preparation do they make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, (who lies between them and home?) where are their armes, where their skill to uſe them, their reſolution to ſtand to them, and conſcionable care to exerciſe themſelves dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the uſe of them? Alas, this is a rarity indeed, not to be found in every houſe, where the Profeſſion of Religion is hang'd out at the door; if woulding and wiſhing will bring them to heaven, then they may come thither; but as for this wreſtling and fighting, this making Religion our buſineſſe, they are as far from theſe, as at laſt they are like to be from heaven. They are of his minde in <hi>Tully,</hi> who in a Summers day, as he lay lazing himſelf on the graſſe, would ſay, <hi>O utinam hoc eſſet laborare!</hi> O that this were to work, that I could lie here and do my day-labour! Thus many melt and waſte their lives in ſloth, and ſay in their hearts, O that this were the way to heaven! but will uſe no means to furniſh themſelves with grace for ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; I have read of a great Prince in <hi>Germany,</hi> invaded by a more potent enemy then himſelf, yet from his friends and Allies, (who flock't in to his help) he ſoon had a goodly Army, but had no money (as he ſaid) to pay them, but the truth is, he was loath to part with it, for which ſome in diſcontent went away, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not vigourouſly attend his buſineſſe, and ſo he was ſoon beaten out of his Kingdome; and his coffers (when his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace was rifled) were found thrack't with treaſure. Thus he was ruined, as ſome ſick men die, becauſe unwilling to be at coſt to pay the Phyſician. It will adde to the miſery of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoules, when they ſhall have leiſure enough to conſider what they have loſt in loſing God, to remember what means, offers and talents they once had, towards the obtaining of everlaſting life, but had not a heart to uſe them.</p>

for heaven, and that which leads to heaven alſo? Earthly things God is pleaſed to retaile; all have ſome, none have all; but in heavenly treaſure he will not break the whole piece, and cut it into remnants. If thou wilt have heaven, thou muſt have Chriſt; if Chriſt, thou muſt like his ſervice as well as his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; no holineſſe, no happineſſe. If God would cut off ſo much as would ſerve mens turnes, he might have cuſtomers enough. <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf likes one end of the piece, <hi>he would die like a righteous man,</hi> though live like a wizzard as he was; no, God will not deal with ſuch pedling Merchants; that man alone is for God, and God for him, who will come roundly up to Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and take all off his hands. One fitly compares holineſſe and happineſſe to thoſe two ſiſters, <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel.</hi> Happineſſe like <hi>Rachel</hi> ſeems the fairer, (even a carnal heart may fall in love with that,) but holineſſe like <hi>Leah</hi> is the elder and beautiful alſo, though in this life it appears with ſome diſadvantage, her eyes being blear'd with teares of repentance, and her face fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed with the works of mortification; <hi>but this is the Law of that heavenly countrey,</hi> that the younger Siſter muſt not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed before the elder.

Gods fence is too low to keep a graceleſſe heart in bounds, when the game is before him; but a ſoule that hath heaven in its eye is ruled by heavens law: he dares not ſtep out of heavens road to take up a crown, as we ſee in <hi>Davids</hi> carriage towards <hi>Saul.</hi> Indeed in ſo doing he ſhould croſſe himſelf in his own grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which is the glory of God, and the happineſſe of his own ſoul in enjoying of him; upon theſe very termes the ſervants of God have refuſed to be rich and great in the world, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe lay at ſtake; <hi>Moſes</hi> threw his Court-preferment at his heels, <hi>refuſing to be call'd the ſon of Pharaohs daughter.

                     <p>Firſt, the Saint improves his earthly things for an heavenly end, where layeſt thou up thy treaſure? doeſt thou beſtow it on thy voluptuous paunch, thy hawks and thy hounds, or lockeſt thou it up in the boſome of Chriſts poor members? what uſe makeſt thou of thy honour and greatneſſe, to ſtrengthen the hands of the godly or the wicked? and ſo of all thy other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments; A gracious heart improves them for God; when a Saint prayes for theſe things, he hath an eye to ſome heavenly end. If <hi>David</hi> prayes for life, it is not that he may live, but <hi>live and praiſe God,</hi> Pſal. 119 175. When he was driven from his regal throne by the rebellious armes of <hi>Abſalom</hi>; ſee what his deſire was and hope, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. <hi>The King ſaid to Zadock, Carry back the Ark of God into the City: if I ſhall-finde favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it and his habitation.</hi> Mark, not ſhew me <hi>my Crown, my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> but <hi>the Ark,</hi> the <hi>Houſe of God.</hi>

                        <pb n="318" facs="tcp:119001:170"/>Secondly, a gracious heart purſues earthly things with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferency, ſaving the violence and zeal of his ſpirit for the things of heaven; he uſeth the former as if he uſed them not, with a kinde of non-attendency, his head and heart is taken up with higher matters, how he may pleaſe God, thrive in his grace, enjoy more intimate communion with Chriſt in his Ordinances, in theſe he ſpreads all his ſailes, plyes all his oares, ſtrains every part and power: thus we finde <hi>David</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his full ſpeed; <hi>My ſoul preſſeth hard after thee,</hi> Pſal. 63. And before the Ark we finde him dancing with all his might. Now a carnal heart is clean contrary, his zeal is for the world, and his indifferency in the things of God, he prays as if he did not pray, &amp;c. he ſweats in his ſhop, but chills and growes cold in his cloſet; O how hard to pully him up to a duty of Gods worſhip, or to get him out to an Ordinance? No weather ſhall keep him from the market; raine, blow or ſnow he goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if the Church-path be a little wet, or the aire ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cold, 'tis apology enough for him if his pue be empty; when he is about any worldly buſineſſe, he is as earneſt at it, as the idolatrous Smith in hammering of his image; <hi>who</hi> (the Prophet ſaith) <hi>worketh it with the ſtrength of his armes, yea, he is hungry, and his ſtrength faileth, he drinketh not, and is faint,</hi> Iſa. 44.12. ſo zealous is the muck-worme in his worldly employments, that he will pinch his carcaſe, and deny himſelf his repaſt in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to purſue that; The Kitchin there ſhall wait on the ſhop: But in the worſhip of God, 'tis enough to make him ſick of the Sermon, and angry with the Preacher, if he be kept beyond his houre; here the Sermon muſt give place to the Kitchin: ſo the man for his pleaſures and carnal paſtime, he tells no clock at his ſports, and knows not how the day goes; when night comes, he is angry that it takes him off; but at any heavenly work, O how is the man puniſh't? time now hath got leaden heels he thinks; all he does at a Sermon is to tell the clock, and ſee how the glaſſe runs: if men were not willing to deceive themſelves, ſurely they might know which way their heart goes by the ſwift motion, or the hard tugging and ſlow pace it ſtirs, as well as they know in a boat, whether they row againſt the tyde, or with it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Chriſtian uſeth theſe things with a holy feare,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:119001:170"/>
leſt earth ſhould rob heaven, and his outward enjoyments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his heavenly intereſt; he eats in feare, works in feare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in his abundance with feare: as <hi>Iob</hi> ſanctified his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by offering a ſacrifice, out of a feare leſt they had ſinned; ſo the Chriſtian is continually ſanctifying his earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by prayer, that ſo he may be delivered from the ſnare of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Chriſtian is heavenly in his keeping of earthly  things. The ſame heavenly Law which he went by in getting, he obſerves in holding them. As he dares not ſay he will be rich and honourable in the world, but if God will; ſo neither that he will hold what he hath, he only keeps them while his heavenly Father calls for them that at firſt gave them: If God will continue them to him, and entaile them on his poſterity too, he bleſſeth God, and ſo he deſires to do alſo when he takes them away. Indeed Gods meaning in the great things of this world, which ſometimes he throwes in upon the Saints, is chiefly to give them the greater advantage of expreſſing their love to him, in denying them for his ſake. God never intended by that ſtrange Providence in bringing <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaho</hi>'s Court, to ſettle him there in worldly pomp and grandure, (a carnal heart indeed would have expounded Providence, and imported it as a faire occaſion put into his hands by God to have advanced himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throne, (which ſome ſay he might in time have done,) but as an opportunity to make his faith and ſelf-denial more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently conſpicuous in throwing all theſe at his heels, for which he hath ſo honourable a remembrance among the Lords Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25. And truly a gracious ſoule reckons he cannot make ſo much of his worldly intereſts any other way, as by offering them up for Chriſts ſake; however that Traitour thought <hi>Maries</hi> ointment might have been carried to a better market, yet no doubt that good woman her ſelf was only trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that ſhe had not one more precious to poure on her dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours head. This makes the Chriſtian ever to hold the ſacrificing knife at the throat of his worldly enjoyments, ready to offer them up when God calls; over-board they ſhall go, rather then hazard a wrack to faith or a good conſcience; he ſought them in the laſt place, and therefore he will part with them in the firſt. <hi>Naboth</hi> will hazard the Kings anger, (which at laſt coſt him his
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119001:171"/>
life,) rather then ſell an acre or two of land which was his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. The Chriſtian will expoſe all he hath in this wotld to preſerve his hopes for another: <hi>Iacob</hi> in his march towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> ſent his ſervants with his flocks before, and came himſelf with his wives behinde; if he can ſave any thing from his brothers rage, it ſhall be what he loves beſt: If the Chriſtian can ſave any thing, it ſhall be his ſoule, his intereſt in Chriſt and Heaven, and then no matter if the reſt go, even then he can ſay, not as <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 33.9, 11.</note> I have <gap reason="foreign">

Thou haſt a heavenly ſoul in thy boſome, loſe that, and where canſt thou have another? There is but one heaven, miſſe that, and where can you take up your lodging but in hell?

for ſinne.</hi> O that men would think on theſe things!

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, earthly things are ſuch, as it is a great uncertainty, whether with all our labour we can have them or not. The world, though ſo many thouſand years old, hath not learn't the Merchant ſuch a method of trading, as that from it he may infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly conclude he ſhall at laſt get an eſtate by his trade: nor the Courtier ſuch rules of comporting himſelf to the humour of his Prince, as to aſſure him he ſhall riſe. They are but few that carry away the prize in the worlds lottery, the greater number have only their labour for their paines, and a ſorrowful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance left them of their egregious folly, to be led ſuch a wilde gooſe chaſe after that, which hath deceived them at laſt. But now for heaven and the things of heaven, there is ſuch a clear and certain rule laid down, that if we will but take the counſel of the Word, we can neither miſtake the way, nor in that way miſcarry of the end. <hi>As many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and the whole Iſrael of God.</hi> There are ſome indeed who run, and yet obtain not this prize, that ſeek &amp; find not; knock and find the door ſhut upon them but it is, becauſe they do it either not in the right manner, or in the right ſeaſon. Some would have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but if God ſave them he muſt ſave their ſins alſo, for they do not mean to part with them; and how heaven can hold God and ſuch company together judge you; As they come in at one door, Chriſt and all thoſe holy ſpirits with him would run out at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Ungratful wretches, that will not come to this glorious feaſt, unleſſe they may bring that with them, which would diſturb rhe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:119001:173"/>
joy of that bliſſeful ſtate, and offend all the gueſts that ſit at the Table with them, yea, drive God out of his own manſion-houſe. A ſecond ſort would have heaven, but like him in <hi>Ruth, ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. who had a minde to his Kinſman <hi>Elimelechs</hi> land, and would have paid for the purchaſe, but he liked not to have it by marrying <hi>Ruth,</hi> and ſo miſſed of it: Some ſeem very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to have heaven and ſalvation, if their own righteouſneſſe could procure the ſame, (all the good they do, and duties they performe they lay up for this purchaſe) but at laſt periſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cloſe not with Chriſt, and take not heaven in his right. A third ſort are content to have it by Chriſt, but their deſires are ſo impotent and liſtleſſe, that they put them upon no vigourous uſe of means to obtain him, and ſo (like the ſluggard) they ſtarve, becauſe they will not pull their hands out of their boſome of ſloth to reach their food that is before them: for the world they have mettal enough, and too much, they trudge far and near for that, and when they have run themſelves out of breath, can ſtand and <hi>pant after the duſt of the earth,</hi> as the Prophet phraſeth it, <hi>Amos 2.7.</hi> But for Chriſt and obtaining intereſt in him, O how key-cold are they! there is a kinde of cramp invades all the powers of their ſoules when they ſhould pray, hear, examine their hearts, draw out their affections in hungrings and thirſtings after his grace and Spirit. 'Tis ſtrange to ſee how they even now went full ſoop to the world, are ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly becalm'd, not a breath of winde ſtirring to any purpoſe in their ſoules after theſe things, and is it any wonder that Chriſt and Heaven ſhould be denied to them that have no more mind to them? Laſtly, ſome have zeal enough to have Chriſt &amp; Heaven, but it is when the Maſter of the houſe is riſen, and hath ſhut to the door, and truly then they may ſtand long enough rapping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any come to let them in. There is no Goſpel preached in another world; but as for thee poor ſoul, who art perſwaded to renounce thy luſts, throw away the conceit of thy own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that thou mayeſt run with more ſpeed to Chriſt, and art ſo poſſeſt with the excellency of Chriſt, thy own preſent need of him, and ſalvation by him, that thou panteſt after him more then life it ſelf; In Gods Name go on and ſpeed, be of good comfort, he calls thee by name to come unto him, that thou mayeſt have reſt for thy ſoul. There is an office in the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119001:173"/>
Word, where thou mayeſt have thy ſoule and its eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe enſured to thee: Thoſe that come to him, as he will himſelf in no wiſe caſt away, ſo not ſuffer any other to pluck them away. <hi>This day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Zaccheus) ſalvation is come to thy houſe,</hi> Luke 19.9. Salvation comes to thee (poore ſoul) that openeſt thy heart to receive Chriſt, thou haſt eternal life already, as ſure as if thou wert a glorified Saint, now walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that heavenly City. O Sirs, if there were a free trade proclaimed to the <hi>Indies,</hi> enough gold for all that went, and a certainty of making a ſafe voyage, who would ſtay at home? But alas, this can never be had: all this, and infinitely more may be ſaid for heaven; and yet how few leave their uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hopes of the world to trade for it; what account can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given for this, but the deſperate atheiſme of mens hearts? they are not yet fully perſwaded whether the Scripture ſpeaks true or not, whether they may relie upon the diſcovery that God makes in his Word of this new-found land, and thoſe mines of ſpiritual treaſure, there to be had as certain. God open the eyes of the unbelieving world, (as he did the Prophets ſervants,) that they may ſee theſe things to be realities and not fictions; 'tis faith only that gives a being to theſe things in our hearts. By faith <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw him that was inviſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, earthly things when we have them, we are not ſure  of them; like birds, they hop up and down, now on this hedge, and anon upon that, none can call them his own: rich to day, and poor to morrow: In health when we lie down, and arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pangs of death before midnight: Joyful Parents, one while ſolacing our ſelves with the hopes of our budding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and may be ere long knocks one of <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers at our door to tell us they are all dead; now in honour, but who knows whether we ſhall not live to ſee that butied in ſcorn and reproach? The Scripture compares the multitude of people to waters, the great ones of the world ſit upon theſe waters; as the ſhip floates upon the waves, ſo do their honours upon the breath and favour of the multitude; and bow long is he like to ſit that is carried upon a wave? one while they are mounted up to heaven, (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the ſhip) and then down again they fall into the deep. <hi>We have ten parts in the King,</hi> (ſay the men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) 2 Sam. 19.45. and in the very next verſe,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119001:174"/>
                     <hi>Sheba</hi> doth but ſound a trumpet of ſedition, ſaying, <hi>We have no part in David, no inheritance in the ſon of Jeſſe,</hi> and the winde is in another corner preſently: for it's ſaid, <hi>Every man of Iſrael went up from after David, and followed Sheba.</hi> Thus was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> cried up and down, and that almoſt in the ſame breath. Unhappy man he, that hath no ſurer portion then what this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able world will afford him. The time of mourning for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of all earthly enjoyments is at hand, we ſhall ſee them as <hi>Eglons</hi> ſervants did their Lord, fallen down dead before us, and weep becauſe they are not. What folly then is it to dandle this vaine world in our affections, whoſe joy like the childes laughter on the mothers knee, is ſure to end in a cry at laſt, and neglect heaven and heavenly things which endure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? O remember <hi>Dives</hi> ſtirring up his pillow, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to reſt, how he was call'd up with the tydings of death, before he was warme in this his bed of eaſe, and laid with ſorrow on another, which God had made for him in flames, from whence we hear him roaring in the anguiſh of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. O ſoule, couldeſt thou get but an intereſt in the heavenly things we are ſpeaking of, theſe would not thus ſlip from under thee; heaven is a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, Chriſt an abiding portion, his graces and comforts ſure waters that faile not, but ſpring up unto eternal life. The quailes that were food for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> luſt ſoon ceaſed, but the rock that was drink to their faith followed them; this rock is Chriſt: make ſure of him and he will make ſure of thee, he'll follow thee to thy ſick-bed, and lie in thy boſome, chearing thy heart with his ſweet comforts, when worldly joyes lie cold upon thee, (as <hi>Davids</hi> cloathes on him) and no warmth of comfort to be got from them. When thy outward ſenſes are lock't up, that thou canſt neither ſee the face of thy dear friends, nor hear the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and comfort they would give thee, then he will come (though theſe doors be ſhut) and ſay, Peace be to thee my dear childe; feare not death or devils, I ſtay to receive thy laſt breath, and have here my Angels waiting, that aſſoon as thy ſoule is breathed out of thy body, they may carry and lay it in my boſome of love, where I will nouriſh thee with thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal joyes that my blood hath purchaſed, and my love prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:119001:174"/>Fourthly, earthly things are empty and unſatisfying. We  may have too much, but never enough of them, they oft breed loathing, but never content and indeed how ſhould they, being ſo diſproportionate to the vaſt deſires of theſe immortal ſpirits that dwell in our boſomes? A ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be fed with ſuch, and what hath the world, but a few bones covered over with ſome fleſhly delights to give it? The leſſe is bleſſed of the greater, not the greater of the leſſe. Theſe things therefore being ſo far inferiour to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, he muſt look higher if he will be bleſſed, even to God himſelf who is the Father of ſpirits. God intended theſe things for our uſe, not enjoyment; and what folly is it to think we can ſqueaze that from them, which God never put in them? They are breaſts, that moderately drawn, yield good milk, ſweet refreſhing, but wring them too hard, and you will ſuck nothing but winde or blood from them. We loſe what they have, by expecting to finde what they have not; none find leſſe ſweetneſſe and more diſſatisfaction in theſe things, then thoſe who ſtrive moſt to pleaſe themſelves with them. The cream of the creature floats a top, and he that is not content to fleet it, but thinks by drinking a deeper draught to finde yet more, goes further to ſpeed worſe, being ſure by the diſappointment he ſhall meet to pierce himſelf through with many ſorrows. But all theſe feares might happily be eſcaped, if thou wouldeſt turn thy back on the creature, and face about for heaven: labour to get Chriſt, and through him hopes of heaven, and thou takeſt the right road to content, thou ſhalt ſee it before thee, and enjoy the proſpect of it as thou goeſt, yea, finde that every ſtep thou draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nearer and nearer to it; O what a ſweet change wouldeſt thou finde? As a ſick man coming out of an impure unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome climate, where he never was well, when he gets into freſh aire or his native ſoile: ſo wilt thou finde a cheering of thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and reviving thy ſoule with unſpeakable content and peace. Having once cloſed with Chriſt, firſt the guilt of all thy ſinnes is gone, and this ſpoil'd all thy mirth before; all your dancing of a childe, when ſome pin pricks it will not make it quiet or merry; well, now that pin is taken out which robbed thee of the joy of thy life. Secondly, thy nature is renewed and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; and when is a man at eaſe, if not when he is in health?
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119001:175"/>
and what is holineſſe, but the creature reſtored to his right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in which God created him? Thirdly, thou becomeſt a childe of God, and that cannot but pleaſe thee well (I hope) to be ſon or daughter to ſo great a King. Fourthly, thou haſt a right to heavens glory, whither thou ſhalt ere long be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take and hold poſſeſſion of that thy inheritance for ever, and who can tell what that is? <hi>Nicephorus</hi> tells us of one <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barus,</hi> a great man, that (hearing ſo much of Chriſts fame, by reaſon of the miracles he wrought,) ſent a Painter to take his picture, and that the Painter when he came was not able to do it, becauſe of that radiancy and divine ſplendor which ſate on Chriſts face. Whether this be true or no, I leave it; but to be ſure, there is ſuch a brightneſſe on the face of Chriſt glorified, and that happineſſe which in heaven Saints ſhall have with him, as forbids us that dwell in mortal fleſh to conceive of it aright, much more to expreſſe; 'tis beſt going thither to be informed, and then we ſhall confeſſe we on earth heard not halfe of what we there finde, yea, that our preſent conceptions are no more like to that viſion of glory we ſhall there have, then the Sunne in the Painters table, is to the Sunne it ſelf in the Heavens. And if all this be ſo, why then do you ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not, yea, for that which keeps you from that which can ſatisfie? Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are like ſome traſh, which doth not only not nouriſh, but take away the appetite from that which would. Heaven and heavenly things are not reliſhed by a ſoule vitiated with theſe. Manna, though for deliciouſneſſe called Angels food, yet but light bread to an Egyptian palate. But theſe ſpiritual things depend not on thy opinion, O man, whoever thou art (as earthly things in a great meaſure do) that the value of them ſhould riſe or fall as the worlds exchange doth, and as vain man is pleaſed to rate them; think gold dirt, and it is ſo; for all the royal ſtamp on it, Count the ſwelling titles of worldly honour (that proud duſt brags ſo in) vanity, and they are ſuch: but have baſe thoughts of Chriſt, and he is not the worſe; ſlight heaven as much as you will, it will be heaven ſtill, and when thou comeſt ſo far to thy wits with the Prodigal, as to know which is beſt fare, husks or bread; where beſt living, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong hogs in the field, or in thy Fathers houſe, then thou wilt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119001:175"/>
know how to iudge of theſe heavenly things better, till then go and make the beſt market thou canſt of the world, but look not to finde this pearle of price, true ſatisfaction to thy ſoul in any of the creatures ſhops; and were it not better to take it when thou mayeſt have it, then after thou haſt wearied thy ſelf in vaine in following the creature, to come back with ſhame, and may be miſſe of it here alſo, becauſe thou wouldeſt not have it when it was offered?</p>

The weight of the whole building lies on theſe ground-cells, more then on ſuperſtructory truths. In a Kingdome there are ſome ſtaple commodities and trades, without which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale could not ſubſiſt, as wool, corne, &amp;c. in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and theſe ought to be encouraged above others, (which though they be an ornament to the Nation, yea, adde to the riches of it, yet are not ſo neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of it) Thus here; there is an excellent uſe of our other Miniſterial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as they tend to beautifie and adorne, yea, enrich the Chriſtian with the knowledge of ſpiritual myſteries; but that which is chiefly to be regarded is the conſtant faithful opening of thoſe main truths of the Goſpel.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>thoſe truthes are oft to be preach't, which Miniſters obſerve to be moſt undermined by Satan or his instruments in the judgements and lives of their people.</hi> The Preacher muſt read and ſtudy his people as diligently as any book in his ſtudy; and as he findes them, diſpenſe like a faithful ſteward unto them. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice that the <hi>Galatians</hi> had been in ill handling by falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who had even bewitch't them back to the Law in that great point of Juſtification, and ſee how he bea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s upon that point. Our people complain, we are ſo much, ſo oft reproving the ſame errour or ſin, and the fault is their own, becauſe they will not leave it; who will blame the dog for continuing to bark, when the thief is all the while in the yard? Alas, alas, it is not once or twice rowſing againſt ſin will do it. When people think the Miniſter ſhews his lazineſſe, becauſe he preacheth the ſame things, he may then be exerciſing his patience, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exhort and reprove thoſe who oppoſe, waiting, if at laſt God will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth. We are bid ro lift up our voice like a trumpet, and would you have us ceaſe while the battel laſts, or ſound a retreat when it ſhou'd be a battel?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>truths of daily uſe and practice.</hi> Theſe are like bread and ſalt, whatever elſe is on, theſe muſt be on the board every meale. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was of this minde, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of theſe things, though ye know them.</hi> He had (you may ſee) been ſpeaking of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and duties, that they could not paſſe a day without the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of them, and therefore will be ever their Monitour, to ſtir up their pure mindes about them. All is not well, when a man is weary of his ordinary food, and nothing will go down but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; the ſtomack is ſickly, when a man delights rather to pick ſome ſallet, then eate of ſolid meat, and how far this dainty age is gore in this ſpiritual diſeaſe, I think few are ſo far come to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:119001:177"/>
themſelves, as yet to conſider and lament. O Sirs, be not weary as in doing, ſo not in hearing thoſe ſavoury truths preach't you have daily uſe of, becauſe you know them, and have heard them often; faith and repentance will be good doctrine to preach and heare to the end of the world; you may as well quarrel with God, becauſe he hath made but one heaven, and one way to it, as with the Preacher for preaching theſe over and over; if thy heart were humble, and thy palate ſpiritual, old truths would be new to thee every time thou heareſt them. In heaven the Saints draw all their wine of joy, (as I may ſo ſay at one tap) and ſhall to all eternity, and yet it never taſtes flat. God is that one object their ſoules are filled with, and never weary of, and can any thing of God and his love be weariſome to thee in the hearing here? I am not all this while an Advocate for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Loyterer in our Lords vineyard; for any ſlothful ſervant in the work of the Goſpel, who wraps up his talent in idleneſſe, or buries it in the earth, (where (may be) he is digging and playing the worldling all the week, and then hath nothing to ſet before his people on the Lords day, but one or two old mouldy loaves, which were kneaded many yeares before.) This is not the good Steward, here is the old, but where are the new things which he ſhould bring out of his treaſure? If the Miniſter labours not to increaſe by ſtock, he is the worſt thief in the Pariſh. It is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a man truſted with the improving of Orphans eſtates, to let them lie dead by him, much more for a Miniſter not to improve his gifts, (which I may call the town-ſtock given for the good of the ſoules of both rich and poor:) if that <hi>Preacher</hi> was wiſe, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.9. who ſtill <hi>taught the people knowledge,</hi> that is, was ever going on, endeavouring to build them higher in knowledge, and that he might, did <hi>give good heed, and ſought out, and ſet in order many Proverbs</hi>; then ſurely he will be proved a fooliſh Preacher at laſt, that waſtes his time in ſloth, or ſpends more of it in ſtudying how to adde to his eſtate out of his peoples, then how to adde to their gifts and graces, by a conſcionable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to increaſe his own.</p>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119001:178"/>
fleſh, which had growne over it? And <hi>Jonah,</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a holy Prophet) when God wou'd ſend him on an errand to <hi>Ni neveh,</hi> he hath his <hi>ſhoes</hi> to ſeek, I mean that preparation and readineſſe with which his minde ſhould have been ſhod, to have gone at the firſt call. Good <hi>Hezikiah</hi> we finde how near his helmet of hope was of being beaten off his head, who tells us himſelf what his thoughts were in the day of his diſtreſſe, that he <hi>ſhould not ſee the Lord in the land of the living,</hi> expecting that God would never let go his hold, <hi>till like a Lion he had broke his bones, and at laſt made an end of him.</hi> Even <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe, famous for faith, yet had his fits of unbelief and diſtruſtful qualms coming over his valiant heart; now in this caſe the Chriſtians care ſhould be to get his armour ſpeedily repaired. A battered helmet is next to no helmet in point of preſent uſe; grace in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, is like a man pull'd off his legs by ſickneſſe; if ſome meanes be not uſed to recover it, little ſervice will be done by it, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort received from it. Therefore Chriſt gives this Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> (to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle) this counſel, <hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence ſhe was fallen, to repent and do her firſt works,</hi> How many does a declining Chriſtian wrong at once?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, he wrongs God, and that in a high degree, becauſe  God reckons upon more honour to be paid him in by his Saints grace, then by all other talents which his creatures have to trade with in the world. He can in ſome ſenſe better bear the open ſins of the world, then the decayes of his Saints graces; they by abuſing their talents rob him but of his <hi>oyle, flaxe and wool</hi>: But the Chriſtian by the other, bereaves him of the glory which ſhould be paid him from his faith, zeal, patience, ſelf-denial, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and the reſt. Suppoſe a Maſter ſhould truſt one ſervant with his mony, and another with his child to be look't to; would he not be more diſpleaſed to ſee his dear childe hurt, or almoſt kill'd by the negligence of the one, then his money ſtollen by the careleſneſſe of the other? Grace is the new creature, the birth of the Spirit, when this comes to any harme by the Chriſtians care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe walking it muſt needs go nearer the heart of God, then the wrong he hath from the world, who are truſted with nothing like this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he that declines in grace, and labours not to repair  it, he wrongs his brethren who have a ſhare in one anothers grace;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:119001:179"/>
he wrongs his whole body that ſeeks not cure for a wound in any member. We are bid <hi>to love one another, 2 epiſt. of John 5. v.</hi> but how ſhall we ſhew our love to one another? the very next words will direct us, <hi>And this is love, that we walk after his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> Indeed we ſhew little love to our brethren by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereby we are ſure either to enſnare them or grieve them; and how to let grace go down, and ſin not go up is a riddle to any that know what they both are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Chriſtian wrongs himſelf in not endeavouring to repaire his broken armour, and recover his declining grace. By this he loſes the evidence of his inheritance, at leaſt ſo blots it that it cannot be ſo clearly perceived by him. A declining Chriſtian muſt needs be a doubting Chriſtian, becauſe the common ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of an hypocrite, is to wear and waſte like a ſtake ſet in the ground, (which rots, while true grace like the tree grows.) Is not this the knot which the devil poſeth many poor ſoules withal, and findes them work for many yeares to untie? If thou wert a Chriſtian thou wouldeſt grow. Right Saints go from ſtrength to ſtreugth, and thou goeſt from ſtrength to weakneſſe. They go up the hill to <hi>Zion,</hi> every Ordinance and Providence is a ſtep that bears them nearer Heaven; but thou goeſt down the hill, and art further from thy ſalvation then when thou didſt firſt believe (as thou thoughteſt;) and doth it ſtand wirh thy wiſdom, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, to put a ſtaffe into the dev<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ls hand, an argument into his mouth, to diſpute againſt thy ſalvation with? If you held an eſtate by the life of a childe, which upon the death of it ſhould all go away from you, that childe I warrant you ſhould be well look't unto; his head ſhould not ake, but you would poſt to the Phyſician for counſel; I pray what is your evidence for that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eſtate you hope for? Is it not Chriſt within you? Is not this new creature (wh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Not live; a man in a conſumption has little joy of his life, he neither findes ſweetneſſe in his meat, nor delight in his work, as a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

ſtrength enfeebled by temptation? but the Chriſtian in a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning condition, he taſtes not the promiſe, every command is grievous, and every duty burdenſome to him: he goes in pain like one whoſe foot is out of joynt, though the way be never ſo pleaſant. And he is as unfit to die as he is to live, ſuch a one can like no more to hear the newes of death, then a tenant that wants his rent doth to hear of the quarter-day.

                  <p>Firſt, negatively, and that in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Friſt, Chriſtian, do not judge grace to be fallen weaker, becauſe  thy ſenſe of corruption is grown ſtronger: This oft lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119001:180"/>
of poor ſouls complaints in this caſe O they never felt pride, hypocriſie and other corruptions ſo haunt them as now; none knows how they are vexed with theſe, and the like beſides themſelves. Now let me ask thee who makeſt this ſad moane, whether thou doeſt not think theſe corruptions were in thee before thou didſt thus feel them? how oft haſt thou prayed as formally, and not been troubled? how oft haſt thou ſtood chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the ſame luſts, and thy ſoule hath not been laid low before the Lord with ſuch abaſement of thy ſelf as now? deal faithfully between God and thy ſoule, and tell not a lie for God by bearing falſe witneſſe againſt thy ſelf. If it be thus, thou haſt rather a comfortable ſigne of grace growing then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying. Sin cannot be on the getting hand, if the ſenſe of ſin grow quick; this is the concomitant of a thriving ſoul, none ſo full of complaints of their own hearts as ſuch; the leaſt ſin goes now to their very ſoules, which makes them think viler of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is not the increaſe of ſin in them, but the advance of their love to Chriſt makes them judge ſo: when the Sun ſhines with ſome power, and the year gets up, we obſerve, though we may have froſts and ſnow, yet they do not lie long, but are ſoon diſſolved by the Sun, O 'tis a ſweet ſigne that the love of Chriſt ſhines with a force upon thy ſoule, that no corruptions can lie long in thy boſome, but they melt into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and bitter complaints. That is the decaying ſoul where ſinne lies bound up and frozen, little ſenſe of, or ſorrow for it appears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Take heed thou thinkeſt not grace decayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy comfort withdrawes. The influence of the Sun comes where the light of it is not to be found, yea, is mighty, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in thoſe mines of gold and ſilver, which are concocted by the ſame. And ſo may the actings of grace be vigourous in thee, when leaſt under the ſhines of his countenance. Did ever faith triumph more then in our Saviour, crying, <hi>My God, my God</hi>; here faith was at its <hi>meridian,</hi> when it was midnight in reſpect of joy. Poſſibly thou comeſt from an Ordinance, and bringeſt not home with thee thoſe ſheaves of comfort thou uſeſt to do, and therefore conclude grace acted not in thee as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. Truly if thou haſt nothing elſe to go by, thou mayeſt wrong the grace of God in thee exceedingly. Becauſe thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119001:180"/>
is extrinſecal to thy duty, a boon which God may give or not, yea, doth give to the weak, and deny to the ſtrong. The traveller may go as faſt, and rid as much ground, when the Sun doth not ſhine, as when it doth; though (indeed he goes not ſo merrily on his journey) nay, ſomtimes he makes the more haſt; the warm Sun makes him ſometime to lie down and loyter, but when dark and cold he puts on with more ſpeed. Some graces thrive beſt (like ſome flowers) in the ſhade, ſuch as humility, dependance on God, &amp;c,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, take heed thou doeſt not miſtake, and think thy  grace decayes, when may be it is only thy temptations increaſe, and not thy grace decreaſe. If you ſhould hear a man ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot to day run ſo faſt, when a hundred weight is on his back, as he could yeſterday without any ſuch a burden, that therefore he was grown weaker, you would ſoon tell him where his miſtake lies. Temptation lies not in the ſame heavineſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way upon the Chriſtians ſhoulder; obſerve therefore whether Satan is not more then ordinary let looſe to aſſault thee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy temptations come not with more force and violence then ever; poſſibly, though thou doeſt not with the ſame faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity overcome theſe, as thou haſt done leſſe, yet grace may act ſtronger in conflicting with the greater, then in overcoming the leſſe. The ſame ſhip, that when lightly ballaſted, and favoured with the winde goes mounting, at another time deeply laden, and going againſt winde and tide, may move with a ſlow pace, and yet they in the ſhip take more pains to make it ſail thus, then they did when it went faſter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, poſitively, how thou mayeſt conclude that grace is declining; and that in a threefold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in reference to temptations to ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in reference to the duties of Gods worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the frame of thy heart in worldly employments.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when thou art not ſo wakeful to diſcover the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings  of ſin upon thee as formerly; at one time we finde <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him, when he but rent the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment: at another time when his eye glanced on <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> he takes no ſuch notice of the ſnare Satan had him in, and ſo is led from one ſin to another, which plainly ſhewed that grace in him was

                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:119001:182"/>
heavy-eyed, and his heart not in ſo holy a frame as it had been. If an enemy comes up to the gates, and the ſentinel not ſo much as give an alarm to the City of his approach, it ſhewes he is off his guard, either fallen aſleep, or worſe: If grace were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and thy conſcience had not contracted ſome hardneſſe, it would do its office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when a temptation to ſin is diſcovered, and thou findeſt thy heart ſhut up that thou doeſt not pray againſt it, or not with that zeal and holy indignation, as formerly upon ſuch occaſions; it is a bad ſigne, that luſt hath got an advantage of thy grace, that thou canſt not readily betake thy ſelfe to thy armes. Thy affections are bribed, and this makes thee ſo cold a Suitour at the throne of grace, for helpe againſt thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when the arguments prevailing moſt with thee to reſiſt temptations to ſin, or to mourn for ſin committed, are more carnal and leſſe Evangelical then formerly: may be thou remembreſt when thy love to Chriſt would have ſpit fire on the face of Satan tempting thee to ſuch a ſin; but now that holy fire is ſo abated, that if there were not ſome other carnal motives to make the vote full, it would hazard to be carried for it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then againſt it; and ſo in mourning for a ſin there is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly now ſome ſlaviſh arguments, (like an onion in the eye, which makes thee weep, rather then pure ingenuity ariſing from love to God whom thou haſt offended, this ſpeaks a ſad decay, and the more mixture there is of ſuch carnal arguments, either in the reſiſting of, or mourning for ſin, the greater the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace is. <hi>Davids</hi> natural heat ſure was much decayed, when he needed ſo many cloathes to be laid on him, and he yet feel ſo little heat, the time was he would have ſweat with fewer. I am afraid, many their love to Chriſt will be found (in theſe declining times) to have loſt ſo much of its youthful vigour, that what would formerly have put them into a holy fury, and burning zeal againſt ſome ſins, (ſuch as Sabbath-breaking, pride of apparel, neglect of family-duties, &amp;c.) hath now much ado to keep any heat at all in them againſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in point of duties of worſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if thy heart doth not prompt thee with that forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and readineſſe as formerly, to hold communion with God
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119001:182"/>
in any duty; poſſibly thou knoweſt the time when thy heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed back to the motions of Gods Spirit, bidding thee, <hi>Seek his face; Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek</hi>; yea, thou didſt long as much till a Sabbath or Sermon-ſeaſon came, as the carnal wretch doth till it be gone; but now thy pulſe doth not beat ſo quick a march to the Ordinances publick or ſecret; nature cannot but decay, if appetite to food go away; a craving ſoule is the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoule, ſuch a childe that will not let his mother reſt, but is frequently crying for the breaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when thou declineſt in thy care to performe duties  in a ſpiritual ſort, and to preſerve the ſenſe of thoſe more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward failings, which in duty none but thy ſelf can check thee of. It is not frequency of duty, but ſpirituality in duty cauſeth thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and therefore neglect in this point ſoon brings grace into a conſumptive poſture. Poſſibly, ſoul, the time was thou wert not ſatisfied with praying, but thou didſt watch thy heart ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as a man would every piece in a ſumme of money he payes, leſt he ſhould wrong his friend with any braſſe or uncurrant coin) thou wouldeſt have God not only have duty, but duty ſtamp't with that faith which makes it currant, have that zeal and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which makes it Goſpel-weight; but now thou art more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and formal, O look to it (poor ſoul) thou wilt, if thou continue thus careleſſe, melt in thy ſpiritual eſtate apace. Such dealings will ſpoil thy trade with heaven. God will not take off theſe ſlighty duties at thy hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, when a Chriſtian gets little ſpiritual nouriſhment  from communion with God, to what it hath done. The time hath been (may be) thou couldeſt ſhew what came of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing and faſting; but now the caſe is altered. There is a double ſtrength communion with God imparts to a ſoule in a healthful diſpoſition, ſtrength to faith, and ſtrength for our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential walking; doeſt thou hear and pray, and get no more ſtrength to hold by a promiſe, no more power over, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe of heart under thy uſual corruptions? what? come down the Mount and break the Tables of Gods Law, aſſoon as thou art off the place? as deep in thy paſſion, as uneven in thy courſe as before? there is a ſure decay of that inward heat which ſhould and would (if in its right temper) ſuck ſome nouriſhment from theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:119001:183"/>Thirdly, by thy behaviour in thy worldly employments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when thy worldly occaſions do not leave thee in ſo free and ſpiritual a diſpoſition, to return into the preſence of God as formerly; may be thou couldeſt have come from thy ſhop and family-employments to thy cloſet, and finde that they have kept thee in frame, yea, may be delivered thee up in a better frame for thoſe duties, but now 'tis otherwiſe, thou canſt not ſo ſhake them off, but they cleave to thy ſpirit, and give an earthly ſavour to thy praying and hearing; thou haſt reaſon to bewail it; when nature decayes men, go more ſtooping, and 'tis a ſigne ſome ſuch decay is in thee, that thou canſt not as thou uſeſt, lift up thy heart from earthly to ſpiritual duties. They were intended as helps againſt temptation, and therefore when they prove ſnares to us there is a diſtemper on us. If we waxe worſe after ſleep, the body is not right, becauſe the nature of ſleep is to refreſh; if exerciſe indiſpoſeth for work, the reaſon is in our bodies: So here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when thy diligence in thy particular calling is more ſelfiſh; poſſibly thou haſt wrought in thy ſhop, and ſet cloſe at thy ſtudy, in obedience to the command chiefly; thy carnal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts have ſwayed but little with thee, but now thou tradeſt more for thy ſelf, and leſſe for God. O have a care of this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when thou canſt not bear the diſappointment of thy carnal ends in thy particular calling, as thou haſt done; thou workeſt and getteſt little of the world, thou preacheſt and art not much eſteemed, and thou knoweſt not well how to brook theſe. The time was thou couldeſt retire thy ſelf into God, and make up all thou didſt want elſewhere in him; but now thou art not ſo well ſatisfied with thy eſtate, rank and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thy heart is fingering for more of theſe then God allowes thee; this ſhews declining; children are harder to be pleaſed, and old men, (whoſe decay of nature makes them more froward, and in a manner children the ſecond time) then others; labour therefore to recover thy decaying grace, and as this lock grows, ſo thy ſtrength with it will, to acquieſce in the diſpoſure of Gods Providence.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> A word of counſel for the recovery of declining grace.</head>
                  <p>WE come now to give a few directions to the Chriſtian, how to recover decaying grace.</p>
                  <p>Enquire faithfully into the cauſe of thy declining. The Chriſtians armour decays two wayes; either by violent bartery, when the Chriſtian is overcome by temptations to ſin; or elſe by neglecting to forbiſh and ſcoure it with the uſe of thoſe means which are as oile, to keep it clean and bright. Now enquire, which of theſe have been the cauſe of thy decay. It is like both concurre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, if thy grace be weakened by any blow, given it by any  ſin committed by thee; there then lies a threefold duty upon thee towards the recovery of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thou art to renew thy repentance. It is Chriſts coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. to <hi>Epheſus, Repent, and do thy firſt works</hi>; where it is not only commanded as a duty, but preſcribed as a means for her recovery; as if he had ſaid, Repent, that thou mayeſt do thy firſt works. So, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2. The Lord ſets back-ſliding <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> about this work, bidding her <hi>take words and turn to the Lord</hi>; and, v. 4. he then tells her he'll take her in hand to recover her of her ſins, <hi>I will heale their back-ſlidings</hi>: a repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule is under promiſe of healing; and therefore (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) go and ſearch thy heart, as thou wouldeſt do thy houſe, if ſome thief or murderer lay hid in it, to cut thy throat in the night; and when thou haſt found the ſin that has done thee the miſchief, then labour to fill thy heart with ſhame for it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt it, and ſo go big with ſorrow, and caſt it forth before the Lord in a heart-breaking confeſſion; better thou do
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119001:184"/>
this, then Satan do thy errand to God for thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when thou haſt renewed thy repentance, forget not, delay not then to renew thy faith on the promiſe for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Repentance that is like purging phyſick to evacuate the peccant humour; but if faith come not preſently with its reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, the poor creature will never get heart, or recover his ſtrength. A ſoule may die of a fluxe of ſorrow as well as of ſin; faith hath an incarnating vertue, as they ſay of ſome ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening meats, it feeds upon the promiſe, and <hi>that is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> (or rather reſtoring) <hi>the ſoule,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. Though thou wert pined to skin and bones, all thy ſtrength waſted, yet faith would ſoon recruit thee, and enable every grace to perform its office chearfully. Faith ſucks peace from the promiſe, call'd <hi>peace in beleeving</hi>; from peace flowes joyes, <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. and, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>We rejoyce in the hope of glory</hi>; and joy affords ſtrength: <hi>The joy of the Lord is our ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, back both theſe with a daily endeavour to mortifie thoſe luſts which moſt pevail over thy grace. Weeds cannot thrive, and the flowers alſo; when grace doth not act vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely, conclude it is oppreſt with ſome contrary luſt, which weighs down its ſpirits, and makes them lumpiſh; even as ſuperfluous humours do load the natural ſpirits in our bodies, that we have little joy to ſtir or go about any buſineſſe till they be evacuated; and therefore ply this work cloſe, it is not a dayes work or two in the yeare, (like Phyſick at ſpring and fall) nothing more vain, then to make a buſle, as the Papiſts do at their <hi>Lent</hi>; or as ſome unſound Profeſſours among our ſelves, who ſeem to beſtir themſelves before a Sacrament or day of Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a great noiſe of zeal, and then let thoſe very luſts live peaceably in them all the yeare after. No, this is child-play to do and undo; thou muſt <hi>mortifie daily thy luſts by the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.13. Follow but this work conſcionably in thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe, making it thy endeavour, (as conſtantly as the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man goes out every day to work in the field where his calling lies) to watch thy heart, and uſe all means for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſin, and as it breaks forth to be humbled for it, and be chopping at the root of it with this axe of mortification; and thou ſhalt ſee by the bleſſing of God what a change for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119001:184"/>
there will be in the conſtitution of thy grace; thou who art now ſo poor, ſo pale, that thou art afraid to ſee thy own face long in the glaſſe of thy own conſcience, ſhall then reflect with joy upon thy owne conſcience, and dare to converſe with thy ſelf without thoſe ſurprizals of horrour and feare, which before did appale thee; thy grace, though it ſhall not be thy rejoycing, yet it will be thy evidence for Chriſt, in whom it is: and lead thee in with boldneſſe to lay claim to him, while the looſe Chriſtian, whoſe grace is over-grown with luſts (for want of this weeding hook) ſhall ſtand trembling at the door, queſtioning whether his grace be true or no; and from that doubt of his welcome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if upon enquiry thou findeſt that thy Armour decays, rather for want of ſcouring, then by any blow from ſin preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly committed, (as that is moſt common and ordinary, ruſt will ſoon ſpoil the beſt armour, and negligence give grace its bane, as well as groſſe ſins,) then apply thy ſelf to the uſe of thoſe means which God hath appointed for the ſtrengthening grace; if the fire goes out by taking off the wood, what way to preſerve it but by laying it on again?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I ſhall ſend thee to the Word of God, be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently  converſant with it. <hi>David</hi> tells us, where he renewed his ſpiritual life, and got his ſoul ſo oft into a heavenly heate, when grace in him began to chill. <hi>The Word</hi> (he tells us) <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened him.</hi> This was the Sunny bank he fate under. The Word draws forth the Chriſtians grace, by preſenting every one with an object ſuitable to act upon, this is of great power to rouſe them up; as the coming in of a friend, makes us (though ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py before) ſhake off all drowſineſſe to enjoy his company. Affections they are actuated when their object is before them; if we love a perſon, this is excited by ſight of him, or anything that mindes us of him; if we hate one our blood riſeth much more againſt him when before us. Now the Word bring the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an graces and their object together. Here love may delight her ſelf with the beholding Chriſt, who is ſet out to life there in all his love and lovelineſſe; here the Chriſtian may ſee his ſins in a glaſſe that will not flatter him; and can there any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow be in the heart, any hatred of ſin, and not come forth, while the man is reading what they coſt Chriſt for him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:119001:185"/>Secondly, from the Word go to meditation; this is as bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to the fire; that grace which lies chosk't and eaten up for want of exerciſe, will by this be cleared and break forth; while thou art muſing this fire will burne, and thy heart grow hot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, according to the nature of the ſubject thy thoughts dwell upon: reſolve therefore (Chriſtian) to encloſe ſome time from all worldly Suitours, wherein thou mayeſt every day (if poſſible) at leaſt take a view of the moſt remarkable occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have paſt between God and thee; Firſt, ask thy ſoul what takings it hath had that day, what mercies heaven hath ſent into thee, and do not when thou haſt askt the queſtion, (like <hi>Pilate</hi>) go out; but ſtay till thy ſoul has made report of Gods gracious dealings to thee: and (if thou beeſt wiſe to obſerve, and faithful to relate them) thy conſcience muſt tell thee, that the cock was never turn'd, the breaſt of mercy never put up all the day, yea, while thou art viewing theſe freſh mercies, telling over this new coine, hot out of the mint of Gods bounty, ancient mercies they will come crowding in upon thee, and call for a place in thy thoughts, and tell thee what God hath done for thee moneths and years ago, (and indeed old debts ſhould not be paid laſt) give them (Chriſtian) all a hearing one time or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and thou ſhalt ſee how they will work upon thy inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſpirit. It is with the Chriſtian in this caſe, as with ſome Merchants ſervant that keeps his Maſters caſh, he tells his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he hath a great ſumme of his by him, and deſires he would diſcharge him of it, and ſee how his accounts ſtand, but he can never finde him at leiſure. There is a great treaſure of mercy alwayes in the Chriſtians hands, and conſcience is oft calling the Chriſtian to take the account, and ſee what God has done for him, but ſeldom it is, he can finde time to tell his mercies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and is it any wonder that ſuch ſhould go behinde-hand in their ſpiritual eſtate, who take no more notice what the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings of God are with them? how can he be thankful that ſeldome thinks what he receives? or patient when God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, that wants one of the moſt powerful arguments to pacifie a mutinous ſpirit in trouble, and that is taken from the abundant good we receive at the hands of the Lord as well as a little evil? how can ſuch a ſoules love flame to God, that is kept at ſuch a diſtance from the mercies of God, which are fuel to it? and the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119001:185"/>
like might be ſaid of all the other graces. Secondly, reflect upon thy ſelf, and beſtow a few ſerious thoughts upon thy own behaviour, what it hath been towards God and man all along the day. Ask thy ſoul, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> his ſervant, Whence comeſt thou, O my ſoul? where haſt thou been? what haſt thou done for God this day, and how? and when thou goeſt about this, look that thou neither beeſt taken off from a through ſearch, (as <hi>Jacob</hi> was by <hi>Rachels</hi> ſpecious excuſe) nor be found to cocker thy ſelf, (as <hi>Eli</hi> his ſons) when thou ſhalt upon enquiry take thy heart tardy in any part of thy duty; take heed what thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, for thou judgeſt for God, who receives the wrong by thy ſin, and therefore will do himſelf juſtice if thou wilt not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from meditation go to prayer; indeed a ſoul in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is on his way to prayer; that duty leads the Chriſtian has to this, and this brings help to that; when the Chriſtian has done his utmoſt by meditation to excite his graces, and chaſe his ſpirit into ſome divine heat, he knows all this is but to lay the wood in order. The fire muſt come from above to kindle, and this muſt be fetch't by prayer. They ſay, ſtars have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt influences when they are in conjunction with the Sunne; then ſure the graces of a Saint ſhould never work more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then in prayer, for then he is in the neareſt conjunction and communion with God. That Ordinance which hath ſuch power with God, muſt needs have a mighty influence on our ſelves. It will not let God reſt, but raiſeth him up to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſuccour, and is it any wonder if it be a means to rouſe up and excite the Chriſtians grace? how oft do we ſee a dark cloud upon <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit at the beginning of his prayer, which by that time he is a little warme in his work, begins to clear up, and before he ends breaks forth into high actings of faith and acclamations of praiſe? Only here (Chriſtian) take heed of formal praying, this is as baneful to grace as not praying. A plaiſter, though proper and of ſoveraign vertue, yet if it be laid on cold may do more hurt then good.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to all the former joyne fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Saints thou lived amongſt. No wonder to hear a houſe is robb'd that ſtands far from neighbours; he that walks in communion of Saints, he travels in company, he dwells in a City where one houſe keeps up another, to which
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119001:186"/>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is compared. 'Tis obſervable concerning the houſe in whoſe ruines <hi>Jobs</hi> children were entombed, that a winde came from the wilderneſſe and ſmote the foure corners of it; it ſeems it ſtood alone; the devil knowes what he does in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this great Ordinance of communion of Saints; in doing this he hinders the progreſſe of grace, yea, brings that which Chriſtians have, into a declining waſting ſtate. The Apoſtle couples thoſe two duties cloſe together, <hi>to hold faſt our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to conſider one another, and provoke unto love and to good works, Heb.</hi> 10.23, 24. Indeed it is a dangerous ſtep to Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, to forſake the communion of Saints; hence 'tis ſaid of <hi>Demas, he hath left us, and embraced the preſent world.</hi> O what miſchief has Satan done us in theſe few late years, in this one particular? what is become of this communion of Saints? where are there two or three to be found that can agree to walk together? thoſe that could formerly ſuffer together, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſit together at their Fathers table, can hardly pray one with or one for another; the breath of one Chriſtian is ſtrange to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that once lay in his, boſome; —<hi>This is a lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhall be for a lamentation.</hi>

                  <p>WE come to the argument with which the Apoſtle urgeth the exhortation, and that is double.</p>
                  <p>The firſt hath reſpect to the houre of battel, <hi>that ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond to the happy iſſue of the war, which will crown the Chriſtian thus arm'd, and that is certain victory, <hi>and having done all ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt of the firſt, <hi>That ye may be able to withſtand in the evil day</hi>; But what is this evil day? Some take this evil day to comprehend the whole life of a Chriſtian here below in this vale of tears; and then the argument runs thus: Take to your ſelves the whole Armour of God, that you may be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to the end of your life, which you will finde, as it were, one continued day of trouble and trial, Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> drawes a black line over his whole life, <hi>Few and evil have the days of my life been,</hi> Gen. 47. What day ſhines ſo faire that over caſts not before night, yea, in which the Chriſtian meets not with ſome ſhower or other, enough to deſerve the name of an evil day? Every day hath its portion, yea, proportion; <hi>Sufficient is the evil of the day.</hi> We need not borrow and take up ſorrows upon uſe of the morrow, to make up our preſent load; as we read of daily bread, ſo of a daily croſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. which we are bid to take, not to make, (we need not make croſſes for our ſelves, as we are prone to do) God in his Providence will provide one for us; and we are bid to take it up, but we hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of laying it down, till croſſe and we lie down together; our troubles and our lives are coetaneous, live and die together;
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119001:187"/>
here when joy comes ſorrow is at its heel, ſtaffe and rod go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Job</hi> himſelf, (whoſe proſperity the devil ſo grudg'd, and ſet forth in all his bravery and pomp, <hi>Job</hi> 1.10. as if his Sun had no ſhadow,) heare what account this good man gives of this his moſt flouriſhing time, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 26. <hi>I was not in ſafety, neither had I reſt, neither was I quiet.</hi> There were ſome troubles that broke his reſt, when his bed was (to thinking) as ſort as heart could wiſh, even now this good man toſſes and tumbles from one ſide to the other, and is not quiet. If one ſhould have come to <hi>Job</hi> and bleſſed him with his happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſaid Surely, <hi>Job,</hi> thou couldeſt be content with what thou haſt for thy portion, if thou mighteſt have all this ſetled on thee and thy heires after thee, he would have ſaid, as once <hi>Luther,</hi> that God ſhould not put him off with theſe. Such is the Saints ſtate in this bottome, that their very life here, and all the pompous entertainments of it, they are their croſſe, becauſe they detain them from their crown. We need nothing to make our life an evil day more then our abſence from our chief good; which cannot be recompenced by the world, nor enjoyed with it. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this goodneſſe there is in this evil, that it is ſhort, our life is but an evil day, it will not laſt long; and ſure it was mercy that God hath abridged ſo much of the terme of mans life in theſe laſt dayes, wherein ſo much of Chriſt and Heaven are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it would have put the Saints patience hard to it, to have known ſo much of the upper worlds glory, and then be kept ſo long from it, as the Fathers in the firſt age were. O comfort one another (Chriſtians) with this; though your life be evil with troubles, yet 'tis ſhort; a few ſteps, and you are out of the raine. There is great difference between a Saint in regard of the evils he meets with, and the wicked; as two travellers riding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wayes, (both taken in the rain and wet) but one rides from the raine, and ſo is ſoon out of the ſhowre; but the other rides into the rainy corner, the further he goes, the worſe he is. The Saint he meets with troubles as well as the wicked, but he is ſoon out of the ſhowre; when death comes he has faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the wicked the further he goes the worſe; what he meets with here, is but a few drops, the great ſtorme is the laſt. The pouring out of Gods wrath ſhall be in hell, where all the deeps of horrour are opened, both from above of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:119001:187"/>
fury, and from beneath of their own accuſing and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, others take the phraſe in a more reſtrained ſenſe, to denote thoſe particular ſeaſons of our life, wherein more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we meet with afflictions and ſufferings. <hi>Beza</hi> reads it <hi>tempore adverſo,</hi> in the time of our adverſity. Though our whole life be evil, if compared with Heavens bliſſeful ſtate, our clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt day, night to that glorious morning; yet one part of our life compared with another may be called good, and the other evil, we have our viciſſitudes here. The Providences of God to his Saints here, while on this low bottome of earth are mixt and particoloured,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> as was ſignified by the <hi>ſpeckled horſes</hi> in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariahs</hi> viſion; Red and white, peace and war, joy and ſorrow checker our days. Earth is a middle place betwixt heaven and hell, and ſo is our ſtate here; it partakes of both: we go up hill and down till we get to our journeys end, yea, we finde the deepeſt ſlough neareſt our fathers houſe. Death, I mean, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which all the other troubles of out life fall, as ſtreames into ſome great river, and with which they all end, and are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up. This being the comprehenſive evil, I conceive to be meant here, being made remarkable by a double article <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note>IT behoves everyone to arme and prepare himſelf for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil day of affliction and death, which unavoidably he muſt conflict with. The point hath three branches.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the day of affliction and death is an evil day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this evil day is unavoidable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it behoves every one to provide for this evil day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt of the firſt branch, the day of affliction, eſpecially death is an evil day. Here we muſt ſhew how affliction is evil, and how not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is not morally or intrinſecally evil, if it were evil in this ſenſe; Firſt, God could not be the author of it; his nature is ſo pure, that no ſuch evil can come from him, any more then the Sunnes light can make night. But this evil of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he voucheth for his own act, <hi>Againſt this family do I deviſe an evil,</hi> Mic. 3.2. yea more, he impropriates it ſo to himſelf, as that he will not have us think any can do us evil beſide himſelf. 'Tis the Prerogative he glories in, that there is no evil in the City, but it is of his doing, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. And well it is for the Saints that their croſſes are all made in heaven, they would not elſe be ſo fitted to their backs as they are. But for the evil of ſin, he diſownes it with a ſtrict charge, that we lay not this brat, which is begotten by Satan upon our impure hearts, at his
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:119001:188"/>
door. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man,</hi> James 1.13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if affliction were thus intrinſecally evil, it could in no reſpect be the object of our deſire, which ſometimes it is and may be. We are to chooſe affliction rather then ſin, yea, the greateſt affliction before the leaſt ſin. <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the people of God, rather then the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon. We are bid rejoyce when we fall into divers temptations, that is, afflictions.</p>
                  <p>But in what reſpects then may the day of affliction be called evil?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, as it is grievous to ſenſe in Scriprure, evil is oft put as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct 
to joy and comfort: <hi>We looked for peace, and behold no good.</hi> A merry heart is called a good heart, a ſad ſpirit an evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſpirit, becauſe nature hath an abhorrency to all that oppoſeth its joy, and this every affliction doth more or leſſe. No affliction,<note place="margin">Heb.12.11</note> while preſent is joyous, but grievous; it hath like Phyſick, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing farewel to the ſenſe. Therefore <hi>Salomon,</hi> ſpeaking of the evil dayes of ſickneſſe, expreſſeth them to be ſo diſtaſteful to nature, that we ſhall ſay, <hi>We have no pleaſure in them.</hi> They take away the joy of our life. Natural joy is a true flower of the Sun of proſperity, it opens and ſhuts with it. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Saints never have more joy then in their affliction, but this comes in upon another ſcore; they have a good God that ſends it in, or elſe they would be as ſadly on it as others. 'Tis no more natural for comfort to ſpring from afflictions, then for grapes to grow on thornes, or Manna in the wilderneſſe. The Iſraelites might have look't long enough for ſuch bread, if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had not miraculouſly rained it down. God chooſeth this ſeaſon to make the Omnipotency of his love the more conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As <hi>Elijah</hi> to adde to the miracle, firſt cauſeth water in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance to be poured upon the wood and ſacrifice, ſo much as to fill the trench, and then brings fire from heaven by his prayer, to lick it up: Thus God poures out the flood of affliction upon his children, and then kindles that inward joy in their boſomes which licks up all their ſorrow, yea, he makes the very waters of affliction they float on, adde a further ſweetneſſe to the muſick of their ſpiritual joy, but ſtill it is God that is good, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that is evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:119001:189"/> Secondly, the day of affliction is an evil day, as it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome remembrancer of what ſinful evils have paſſed in our lives. It revives the memory of old ſins, which it may be, were buried many years ago in the grave of forgetfulneſſe. The night of affliction is the time when ſuch ghoſts uſe to walk in mens conſciences; and as the darkneſſe of the night addes to the horrour of any ſcareful object, ſo doth the ſtate of affliction (which is it ſelf uncomfortable) adde to the terrour of our ſinnes then remembred. Never did the Patriarchs ſin look ſo ghaſtly on them, as when it recoil'd upon them in their diſtreſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. The ſinner then hath more real apprehenſions of wrath then at another time; affliction approximates judgement, yea, it is interpreted by him, as a Purſevant ſent to call him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before God, and therefore muſt needs beget a woful confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and conſternation in his ſpirit. O that men would think, of this, how they could bear the ſight of their ſins, and a Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Sermon of all their wayes in that day! That is the bleſſed man indeed, who can with the Prophet then look on them, and triumph over them. This indeed is a dark parable, as he calls it, few can skill of it, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 94.3, 4. <hi>I will open my dark ſaying upon the harp; wherefore ſhould I feare in the day of evil, when the iniquity of my heels compaſſeth me about?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Thirdly, the day of affliction makes diſcovery of much evil to be in the heart, which was not ſeen before. Affliction ſhakes and royles the creature, if any ſediment be at the bottome it will appear then. Sometimes it diſcovers the heart to be quite naught, that before had ſome ſeeming good, theſe ſuds waſh off the hypocrites paint, <hi>Natura vexata prodit ſeipſam.</hi> When cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature is vext it ſhews it ſelf, and ſome afflictions do that to purpoſe. We reade of ſuch as are offended when perſecution comes, they fall quite out with their Profeſſion, becauſe it puts them to ſuch coſt and trouble; others in their diſtreſſe that curſe their God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21. It is impoſſible for a naughty heart to think well of an afflicting God. The hireling, if his Maſter takes up a ſtaffe to beat him, throws down his work and runs away; and ſo doth a falſe heart ſerve God. Yea, even where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is gracious, corruption is oft found to be ſtronger, and grace weaker then they were thought to be. <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſet out ſo valiantly at firſt to walk on the ſea, the winde doth but riſe and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:119001:189"/>
he begins to ſink; now he ſees there was more unbelief in his heart then he before ſuſpected. Sharp afflictions are to the ſoule as a driving raine to the houſe; we know not that there are ſuch crannies and holes in the houſe, till we ſee it drop down here and there. Thus we perceive not how unmortified this corruption, nor how weak that grace is, till we are thus ſearch't, and made more fully to know what is in our hearts by ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. This is the reaſon why none have ſuch humble thoughts of themſelves, and ſuch pitiful and forbearing thoughts towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their infirmities; as thoſe who are moſt acquainted with afflictions, they meet with ſo many foiles in their conflicts, as make them carry a low ſaile in reſpect of their own grace, and a tender reſpect to their brethren, more ready to pity then cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them in their weakneſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, this is the ſeaſon when the evil one Satan comes to  tempt. What we finde call'd the time of tribulation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. we finde in the ſame parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. call'd the time of temptation. Indeed they both meet; ſeldome doth God afflict us, but Satan addeth temptation to our wilderneſſe; <hi>This is your houre</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and the power of darkneſſe,</hi> Luke 22.53. Chriſts ſufferings from man, and temptation from the devil came together. <hi>Eſau,</hi> who hated his brother for the bleſſing, ſaid in his heart, <hi>The dayes of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I kill my brother,</hi> Gen. 27.41. Times of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are the dayes of mourning, thoſe Satan waits for to do us amiſchief in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly and laſtly, the day of affliction hath oft an evil event  and iſſue, and in this reſpect proves an evil day indeed. All is well (we ſay) that ends well; the product of afflictions on the Chriſtian is good, the rod with which they are corrected, yields the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſſe, and therefore they can call their afflictions good, that is a good inſtrument that lets out only the bad blood. <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> I have read of a holy woman, who uſed to compare her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her children, they both put her to great pain in the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but as ſhe knew not which of her children to have been without (for all the trouble in the bringing forth) ſo neither which of her afflictions ſhe could have miſſed, notwithſtanding the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row they put her to in the enduring. But to the wicked the iſſue is
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:119001:190"/>
ſad, firſt in regard of ſin, they leave them worſe, more impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hardened in ſin, and outragious in their wicked practices. Every plague on <hi>Egypt</hi> added to the plague of hardneſſe on <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart: he that for ſome while could beg prayers of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> for himſelf, at laſt comes to that paſſe, that he threatens to kill him if he come at him any more. O what a prodigious height do we ſee many come to in ſin after ſome great ſickneſſe or other judgement? Children do not more ſhoot up in their bodily ſtature after an ague, then they in their luſts after affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. O how greedy and ravenous are they after their prey, when they once get off their clog and chain from their heeles! when Phyſick works not kindly, it doth not only leave the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe uncured, but the poiſon of the Phyſick ſtays in the body alſo. Many appear thus poiſoned by their afflictions, by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their luſts afterward. Secondly, in regard of ſorrow, every affliction on a wicked perſon produceth another, and that a greater then it ſelf. The laſt wedge comes the laſt, which ſhall rive him fit for the fire, the ſinner is whip't from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to affliction, as the vagrant from Conſtable to Conſtable till at laſt he comes to hell, his proper place and ſetled abode, where all ſorrrows will meet in one that is endleſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond branch of the point follows. This evil day is unavoidable. We may as well ſtop the chariot of the Sun, when poſting to night, and chaſe away the ſhades of the evening, as eſcape this houre of darkneſſe that is coming upon us all. <hi>None hath power over the Spirit to retain it, neither hath he power in the day of death, and there is no diſcharge in that war,</hi> Eccl. 8.8. Among men 'tis poſſible to get off when preſt for the wars, by pleading priviledge of yeares, eſtate, weakneſſe of body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the Prince, and the like, or if all theſe fail, poſſibly the ſending another in our room, or a bribe given in the hand may ſerve the turn. But in this war the preſſe is ſo ſtrict, that there is no diſpenſation; <hi>David</hi> could willingly have gone for his ſon, we hear him crying, <hi>Would God I had died for thee, O Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon</hi>: but he will not be taken, that young Gallant muſt go himſelf. We muſt in our own perſon come into the field, and look death in the face. Some indeed we finde ſo fond as to promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves immunity from this day, as if they had an enſuring office in their breaſt. They ſay they have made a Covenant with
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119001:190"/>
death, and with hell they are at an agreement, when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through it ſhall not come unto them. And now (like debtors that have feed the Serjeant) they walk abroad boldly and feare no arreſt. But God tells them as faſt as they binde he will looſe: <hi>Your Covenant with death ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not stand</hi>; and how ſhould it if God will not ſet his ſeal to it? There is a divine Law for this evil day, which came in force upon <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſin, that laid the fatal knife to the throat of mankinde, which hath opened a ſluce to let out his heart-blood ever ſince. God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all eſcape hath ſowen the ſeeds of death in our very conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and nature, ſo that we can aſſoon run from our ſelves, as run from death. We need no feller to come with a hand of violence, and hew us down; there is in the tree a worme which grows out of its own ſubſtance that will deſtroy it, ſo in us, thoſe infirmities of nature that will bring us down to the duſt. Our death was bred when our life was firſt conceived; and as a breeding woman cannot hinder the houre of her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, (that follows in nature upon the other) ſo neither can man hinder the bringing forth of death with which his life is big. All the pains and aches man feels in his life are but ſo many <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gultus morientis naturae,</hi> groans of dying nature; they tell him his diſſolution is at hand. Beeſt thou a Prince ſitting in all thy ſtate and pomp, death dare enter thy Palace, and come through all thy guards, to deliver the fatal meſſage it hath from God to thee, yea, runs its dagger to thy heart; wert thou compaſſed with a Colledge of Doctors conſulting thy health, Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both muſt deliver thee up when that comes. Even when thy ſtrength is firmeſt, and thou eateſt thy bread with a merry heart, that very food which nouriſheth thy life, gives thee withal an earneſt of death, as it leaves thoſe dregs in thee which will in time procure the ſame. O how unavoidable muſt this evil day of death be, when that very ſtaffe knocks us down to the: grave at laſt, which our life leans on, and is preſerved by! God owes a debt both to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and ſecond; to the firſt he owes the wages of his ſin: to the ſecond, the reward of his ſufferings. The place for full payment of both is the other world, ſo that except death comes to convey man thither, the wicked who are the poſterity of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> will miſſe of that
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:119001:191"/>
full pay for their ſins, which the threatening makes due debt, and engageth God to perform; The godly alſo who are the ſeed of Chriſt, theſe ſhould not receive the whole purchaſe of his blood, which he would never have ſhed but upon the credit of thar promiſe of eternal life, which God gave him for them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began; This is the reaſon why God hath made this day ſo ſure, in it he diſchargeth both bonds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third branch of the point follows, That it behoves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to prepare, and effectually to provide for this evil day, which ſo unavoidably impends us: And that upon a twofold account; Firſt, in point of duty. Secondly, in point of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, in point of duty. Firſt, it is upon our allegiance to the great God, that we provide and arme our ſelves againſt this day. Suppoſe a ſubject were truſted with one of his Princes caſtles, and this man ſhould hear that a puiſſant enemy was coming to lay ſiege to this caſtle, yet takes no care to lay in armes and proviſion for his defence, and ſo 'tis loſt, how could ſuch a one be clear'd of treaſon? doth he not baſely betray the place, and with it his Princes honour into the enemies hand? Our ſouls are this caſtle which we are every one to keep for God. We have certain intelligence that Satan hath a deſign upon them, and the time when he intends to come with all his powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to be that evil day. Now as we would be found true to our truſt, we are obliged to ſtand upon our defence, and ſtore our ſelves with what may enable us to make a vigorous reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we are obliged to provide for that day, as a ſuitable return for, and improvement of the opportunities and meanes, which God affords us for this very end. We cannot without ſhameful ingratitude to God, make waſte of thoſe helps God gives us in order to this great work. Every one would cry out upon him that ſhould baſely ſpend that money upon riot in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which was ſent him to procure his deliverance out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; And do we not bluſh to beſtow thoſe talents upon our luſts and Satan? which God graciouſly indulgeth to deliver us from them, and his rage in a dying houre? what have we Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for, Miniſters and preaching for? if we mean not to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſelves by them with armour for the evil day? In a word,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119001:191"/>
what is the intent of God in lengthening out our dayes, and continuing us ſome while here in the land of the living? was it that we might have time to revel or rather ravel out upon the pleaſure of this vaine world? Doth he give us our precious time to be employed in catching ſuch butterflies as theſe earthly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and riches are? It cannot be. Maſters do not uſe (if wiſe) to ſet their ſervants about ſuch work, as will not pay for the candle they borne in doing it. And truly nothing leſſe then the glorifying of God, and ſaving our ſoules at laſt can be worth the precious time we ſpend here. The great God hath a greater. end then moſt think in this diſpenſation: If we would judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, we ſhould take his own interpreration of his actions; and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> bids us, <hi>count that the long-ſuffering of the Lord is ſalvation,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.15. which plate he quotes out of <hi>Paul,</hi> (as to the ſenſe, though not in the ſame forme of words) which in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. are theſe, <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance</hi>? From both places we are taught what is the minde of God, and the language he ſpeaks to us in by every moments patience, and inch of time that is granted to us. It is a ſpace given for repentance. God ſees (as we are) death and judgement could bring no good news to us, we are in no caſe to welcome the evil day, and therefore mercy ſtands up to plead for the poor creature in Gods boſome, and begs a little time more may be added to its life, that by this iudulgence it may be provoked to repent before he be called to the bar, Thus we come by every day that is continually ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to our time on earth. And doth not this lay a ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on us to lay out every point of this time, unto the ſame end 'tis begged for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in point of wiſdome. The wiſdom of a man appears  moſt eminently in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the matter of his choice and chief care.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in a due timing of this his choice and care.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a wife man makes choice of that for the ſubject of his  chief care and endeavour, which is of greateſt importance and conſequence to him; fools and children only are intent about toys and trifles. They are as buſie and earneſt in making of a houſe of dirt or cards, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was in making of his Temple. Thoſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119001:192"/>
poor bables are as adequate to their fooliſh apprehenſions, as great enterpriſes are to wiſe men. Now ſuch is the importance of the evil day, eſpecially that of death, that it proves a man a fool, or wiſe, as he comports himſelf to it. The end ſpecifies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very action, and gives it the name of good or evil, of wiſe or fooliſh. The evil day of death is as the end of our dayes, ſo to be the end of all the actions of our life. Such will our life be found at laſt, as it hath been in order to this one day. If the ſeveral items of our life (counſels and projects that we have purſued) when they ſhall then be caſt up, will amount to a bleſſed death, then we ſhall appear to be wiſe men indeed, but if after all our goodly plots and policies for other things, we be unprovided for that houre, we muſt be content to die fooles at laſt; And no ſuch fool as the dying fool. The Chriſtian goes for the fool (in the worlds account) while he lives; but when death comes, the wiſe world will then confeſſe they miſ-call'd him, and ſhall take it to themſelves; <hi>We fooles counted his life to be madneſſe, and his end to be without honour. But how is he now numbred among the children of God, and his lot is among the Saints? therefore have we erred from the way of truth,</hi> Wiſd. 5.4, 5. The place is Apocryphal, but ſinners will finde the matter of it Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. 'Tis true indeed, Saints are out-witted by the world in the things of the world, and no marvel, neither doth it impeach their wiſdome any more, then it doth a Scholars, to be excell'd by the Cobler in his mean trade, Nature, where it intends higher excellencies, is more careleſſe in thoſe things that are inferiour, as we ſee in man, who (being made to excel the beaſts in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſoul) is himſelf excelled by ſome beaſt or other in all his ſenſes. Thus the Chriſtian may well be ſurpaſt in matters of worldly commerce, becauſe he hath a nobler object in his eye, that makes him converſe with the things of the world in a kinde of non-attendance; he is not much careful in theſe matters if he can die well at laſt, and be juſtified for a wiſe man at the day of the reſurrection, all is well; he thinks it is not, manners, to be unwilling to ſtay ſo long for the clearing of his wiſdom, as God can wait for the, vindicating of his own glorious Nature, which will not appear in its glory till that day, when he will convince the ungodly of their hard thoughts and ſpeeches of him.<note place="margin">Jud. 2.15.</note> Then they ſhall, till then they will not be convinced.</p>

                     <pb n="361" facs="tcp:119001:192"/>Secondly, a wiſe man labours duly to time his care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour  for the attaining of what he propoſeth. 'Tis the fool that comes when the market is done; as the evil day is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in reſpect of its event, ſo the placing of our care for it in the right ſeaſon is of chief importance, and that ſure muſt be before it comes. There are more doors then one, at which the meſſenger may enter that brings evil tydings to us, and at which he will knock we know not; we know not where we ſhall be arreſted, whether at bed or board, whether at home or in the field, whether among our friends that will counſel and comfort us, or among our enemies that will adde weight to our ſorrow by their cruelty. We know not when, whether by day or night, (many of us) not, whether in the morning, noon, or evening of our age. As he calls to work at all times of the day, ſo he doth to bed; may be while thou art praying or preaching, and it would be ſad to go away profaning them and the Name of God in them; poſſibly when thou art about worſe work, death may ſtrike thy quaffing cup out of thy hand, while thou art ſitting in the Alehouſe with thy jovial mates, or meet thee as thou art reeling home, and make ſome ditch thy grave, that as thou livedſt like a beaſt, ſo thou ſhouldeſt die like a beaſt. In a word, we know not the kinde of evil God will uſe as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſtab us; whether ſome bloody hand of violence ſhall do it, or a diſeaſe out of our bowels and bodies; whether ſome acute diſeaſe, or ſome lingring ſickneſſe; whether ſuch a ſickneſſe as ſhall ſlay the man while the body is alive, (I meane take the head and deprive us of our reaſon) or not; whether ſuch noiſome troubles as ſhall make our friends afraid to let us breath on them, or themſelves look on us; whether they ſhall be afflictions aggravated with Satans temptations, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of our own affrighted conſciences or not; who knowes where, when, or what the evil day ſhall be? therefore doth God conceal theſe, that we ſhould provide for all. <hi>Ceſar</hi> would never let his ſouldiers know, when or whither he meant to march. The knowing of theſe would torment us with diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fear, the not knowing them ſhould awaken us to a providing care. It is an ill time to calk the ſhip, when at ſea, tumbling up and down in a ſtorme, This ſhould have been look't to, when on her ſeat in the harbour. And as bad it is to begin to trim a
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119001:193"/>
ſoul for heaven, when toſſing upon a ſick bed. Things that are done in a hurry are ſeldome done well; A man call'd out of his bed at midnight with a diſmal fire on his houſe-top, cannot ſtand to dreſſe himſelf in order as at another time; but runs down with one ſtocking half on may be, and the other not on at all. Thoſe poor creatures I am afraid go in as ill a dreſſe into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, who begin to provide for it, when on a dying bed conſcience calls them up with a cry of hell-fire in their boſomes: But (alas!) they muſt go, though they have not time to put their armour on. And ſo they are put to repent at leiſure in hell, of their ſhuffling up a repentance in haſte here. We come to the Application of the Point.</p>

Thou art like a Paſſenger in a ſhip ſleep or wake, thou are going thy voyage.

That cannon, which if we ſtood at the mouth of it would ſhatter limb from limb, will not ſo much as ſcare them that get out of its reach. The further we put the evil day, the weaker impreſſion it makes on us. 'Tis true (ſay ſinners) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be help't, we owe a debt to nature, it muſt be paid; ſickneſs will come, and death follow on that, and judgement brings up the reare of both.

The clearer thou ſtandeſt in thy own thoughts concerning the uprightneſſe of thy heart in the tenure of thy Chriſtian courſe, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure thou wilt have when the evil day comes. <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> at the point of death as he thought) <hi>remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> This cannot be our confidence, but it will be a better companion then a ſcoulding conſcience; if the blood be bad, the ſpirits will be tainted alſo; the more our life has been corrupted with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and unfaithfulneſſe, the weaker our faith will be in a dying houre. There is great difference between two children that come home at night, one from the field, where he hath been diligent and faithful about his fathers work, and another that hath played the Truant a great part of the day; the former comes inconfidently to ſtand before his father, the other ſneaks to bed, &amp; is afraid his father ſhould ſee him, or ask where he hath been. O Sirs, look to your walking. Theſe have been trying times as ever came to <hi>England.</hi> It has required more care and courage to keep ſincerity then formerly. And that is the reaſon why it is ſo rare to finde Chriſtians (eſpecially thoſe whoſe place and calling hath been more in the winde of temptation,) go off the ſtage at death with ſuch a <hi>Plaudite</hi> of inward peace in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, familiarize the thoughts of the evil day to thy ſoul; Handle this ſerpent, often walk daily in the ſerious meditations of if, do not run from them becauſe they are unpleaſing to fleſh; that is the way to increaſe the terrour of it. Do with your ſouls, when ſhy of, and ſcared with the thoughts of affliction or death, as you uſe to do with your beaſt, that is given to bogle and ſtart as you ride on him. When he flies back and ſtarts at a thing, you do not yield to his fear and go back, that will make him worſe another time, but you ride him up cloſe to that which he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of, and in time you break him of that quality. The evil day is not ſuch a ſcareful thing to thee that art a Chriſtian, as thou ſhouldeſt ſtart for it. Bring up thy heart cloſe to it. Shew

Such rob God of that which he makes moſt account of. A great Captain once ſmote one of his ſouldiers for railing at his enemy, ſaying, that he called him not to raile on him, but to fight againſt him and kill him. 'Tis not crying out upon the devil, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt ſin in prayer or diſcourſe, but fighting and mortifying it that God looks chiefly upon; ſuch a one elſe doth but beat the aire; there are no marks to be ſeen on his fleſh and unmortified luſts that he hath fought. <hi>Paul</hi> was in earneſt, he left a witneſſe upon his body, made black and blew with ſtroaks of mortification. It was not a little vapouring in ſight of the Philiſtines that got <hi>David</hi> his wife, but ſhedding their blood: And is it ſo ſmall a matter to be ſon to the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that thou thinkeſt to obtain it, without giving a real proof of thy zeal for God, and hatred to ſin? <hi>Not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall be bleſſed in his deed,</hi> James 1.25.

ſouldiers uſed to take an oath not to flinch from their colours, but faithfully to cleave to their Leaders, this they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sacramentum militare,</hi> a military oath. Such an oath lies upon every Chriſtian. It is ſo eſſential to the being of a Saint, that they are deſcribed by this, <hi>Pſal</hi>: 50.5. <hi>Gather my Saints together, thoſe that have made a Covenant with me.</hi> We are nor Chriſtians, till we have ſubſcribed this Covenant, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſervation.

If a Captain had not ſuch a tie on his ſouldiers, he might have them to ſeek when the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel comes: therefore Chriſt tells us upon what termes he will enroll us among his diſciples: <hi>If any man will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſſe, and follow me.</hi> He will not entertain us, till we reſign up our ſelves freely to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there may be no diſputing with his commands after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but as one under his authority, go and come at his word.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, perſeverance is neceſſary, becauſe our enemy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres  to oppoſe us. There is no truce in the devils heart, no ceſſation of armes in our enemies camp. If an enemy continue to aſſault a City, and they within ceaſe to reſiſt, it is eaſie to tell what will follow: The Prophet that was ſent to <hi>Bethel</hi> did his errand well, withſtood <hi>Jeroboams</hi> temptation, but in his way home was drawn aſide by the old Prophet, and at laſt ſlain by a Lion. Thus many flie from one temptation, but not perſevering are vanquiſh't by another, thoſe that at one time eſcape his ſword, at another time are ſlain by it. <hi>Joaſh</hi> was hopeful when young, but it laſted not long. Yea, many precious ſervants of God, not making ſuch vigorous reſiſtance in their laſt dayes as in their firſt, have fallen foully, as we ſee in <hi>Solomon, Aſa,</hi> and others. Indeed it is hard when a line is drawn to a great length, to keep it ſo ſtreight that it ſlacken not, and to hold a thing long in our hand, and not to have a numbneſſe grow in
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:119001:200"/>
our fingers ſo as to remit of our ſtrength; therefore we are bid ſo often to hold faſt the Profeſſion of our faith; but when we ſee an enemy gaping to catch us when we fall, me thinks this ſhould quicken us the more to it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the promiſe of life and glory is ſetled upon the perſevering ſoule, the crown ſtands at the Goal, he hath it that comes to the end of the race. <hi>To him that overcomes will I give,</hi> not in <hi>praelio,</hi> but in <hi>bello,</hi> not in a particular skirmiſh, but in the whole war. <hi>Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the whole Will of God, ye might receive the promiſe,</hi> Heb. 10.36.

Indeed in this ſenſe it is, that a gracious ſoul is nearer its ſalvation after every victory then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.10.</note> becauſe he approacheth nearer to the end of his race, which is the time promiſed for the receiving of the promiſed ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

A carnal perſon, when he hath his table moſt ſumptuouſly ſpread, cannot ſhew any word of promiſe under Gods hand that he ſhall be provided for the next meal. God gives theſe things to the wicked, as we a cruſt or a nights lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a beggar in our barne; 'tis our bounty, ſuch a one could not ſue us for denying the ſame: ſo in the common gifts of the Spirit, God was not bound to give them, nor is he to continue them.

The Apoſtate doth not loſe the grace he had, but diſcovers he never had any; and 'tis no wonder to hear that he proves bankrupt, that was worſe then nought when he firſt ſet up. Many take up their Saintſhip upon truſt, and trade in the duties of Religion with the credit they have gain'd from others opinion of them. They believe themſelves to be Chriſtians, becauſe others hope them to be ſuch, and ſo their great buſineſſe is by a zeal in thoſe exerciſes of Religion that lie outmoſt, to keep up the credit which they have abroad, but do not look to get a ſtock of ſolid grace within, which ſhould maintain them in their Profeſſion, and this proves their undoing at laſt. Let it therefore make us in the feare of God, to conſider upon what ſcore we take up our Profeſſion. Is there that within which bears proportion to our outward zeal? Have we laid a good bottome? Is not the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive top heavy jetting too far beyond the weak foundation? They ſay trees ſhoot as much in the root under ground, as in the branches above, and ſo doth true grace. O remember what was the periſhing of the ſeed in the ſtony ground; it lacked root, and why ſo? but becauſe it was ſtony. Be willing the plough ſhould go deep enough to humble thee for ſin, and rend thy heart from ſinne. The ſoul effectually brought out of the love of ſin as ſin, will never be through friends with it again. In a word, be ſerious to finde out the great ſpring that ſets all thy wheels on motion in thy religious trade. Do as men that would know how much they are worth, who ſet what they owe on one ſide, and what ſtock they have on the other; and then when they have laid out enough to diſcharge all debts and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what remaines to themſelves they may call their own: Thus do thou conſider what thou ſtandeſt engaged to, thy worldly credit, profit, ſlaviſh feare of God, and ſelfiſh deſire of happineſſe, and when thou haſt allowed for all theſe, ſee

If a Saint could any way miſcarry, and fall ſhort of this eternal life, it muſt be from one of theſe three cauſes, 1. Becauſe God may forſake the Chriſtian, and withdraw his grace and help from him; Or, 2.

                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, God can never forſake the Chriſtian. Some unadviſed  ſpeeches have drop't from tempted ſoules, diſcovering ſome fears of Gods caſting them off; but they have been confuted, and have eaten their words with ſhame, as we ſee in <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> O what admirable ſecurity hath the great God given his children in this particular!</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>in Promiſes. He hath ſaid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> 
                        <hi>I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:119001:203"/>
thee.</hi> Five negatives in that promiſe as ſo many ſeals to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it to our faith, he aſſures us there never did or can ſo much as ariſe a repenting thought in his heart concerning the purpoſes of his love and ſpecial grace towards his children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance,</hi> even the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſin againſt him, their froward carriage ſtirs not up thoughts of caſting them off, but of reducing them; <hi>For the iniquity of this covetouſneſſe I was wroth and ſmote him; I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart; I have ſeen his wayes and will heal them,</hi> Iſa. 57.27, 28. The water of the Saints failings, caſt on the fire of Gods love cannot quench it; Whom he loves he loves to the end.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God to give further weight and credit to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and miſ-giving hearts, ſeals his promiſe with an oath. See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9, 10. <hi>With everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer; this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn over the earth, ſo have I ſworn that I will not be wroth with thee.</hi> Yea, he goes on and tells them, <hi>The monntaines ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> (meaning at the end of the world, when the whole frame of the heavens and earth ſhall be diſſolv'd) <hi>but his kindneſſe ſhall not depart, neither ſhall his Covenant of peace be removed.</hi> Now leſt any ſhould think this was ſome charter belonging to the Jewes alone, we finde it, <hi>v.</hi> 17. ſetled on every ſervant of God as his portion: <hi>This is the heritage of the ſervants of the Lord, and their righteouſneſſe is of me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And ſurely God that is ſo careful to make his childrens inheritance ſure to them, will con them little thanks, who buſie their wits to invalid and weaken his conveyances, yea, diſprove his will; if they had taken a bribe, they could not plead Satans cauſe better.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the actual fulfilling theſe promiſes, (which he hath made to beleevers) to Chriſt their Attourney. As God before the world began, gave a promiſe of eternal life to Chriſt for them, ſo now hath he given actual poſſeſſion of that glorious place to Chriſt (as their Advocate and Attourney) where that eternal life ſhall be enjoyed by them; for as he came upon our errand from heaven, ſo thither he returned again to take and hold poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that inheritance, which God had of old promiſed, and he in one ſumme at his death had paid for. And now what
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:119001:203"/>
ground of feare can there be in the believers heart, concerning. Gods love ſtandiog firme to him; when he ſees the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant performed already to Chriſt for him, whom God hath not only called to, ſanctified for, and upheld in the great work he was to finiſh for us, but alſo juſtified in his Reſurrection and Jayle-delivery, and received him into heaven, there to ſit on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, by which he hath not only poſſeſſion for us, but full power to give it unto all believers?</p>
                     <p>A ſecond occaſion of feare to the believer that he ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, may be taken from himſelf. He has many ſad feares and tremblings of heart, that he ſhall at laſt forſake God: The journey is long to heaven, and his grace weak, O, ſaith he, is it not poſſible that this little grace ſhould faile, and I fall ſhort at laſt of glory? Now here there is ſuch proviſion made in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as ſcatters this cloud alſo.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Spirit of God is given on purpoſe to prevent this; Chriſt left his mother with <hi>John,</hi> but his Saints with his Spirit, to tutour and keep them that they ſhould not loſe themſelves in their journey to heaven. O how ſweet is that place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and ye ſhall keep my judgements and do them.</hi> He doth not ſay they ſhall have his Spirit, if they will walk in his ſtatutes: no, his Spirit ſhall cauſe them to do it. But may be thou art afraid thou mayeſt grieve him, and ſo he in anger leave thee, and thou pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of his help and counſel. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Spirit of God is indeed ſenſible of unkindneſſe, and upon a Saints ſin, may withdraw in regard of preſent aſſiſtance, but never in regard of his care; as a mother may let her froward childe go alone, till it get a knock, that may make it cry to be taken up again into her armes, but ſtill her eye is on it that it ſhall not fall into miſchief. The Spirit withdrew from <hi>Samſon,</hi> and he fell into the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines hands, and this makes him cry to God, and the Spirit puts forth his ſtrength in him again. Thus here, indeed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Spirit is to abide for ever with the Saints, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. He ſhall ſend you another Comforter, that he may abide for ever with you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is one main buſineſſe of Chriſte interceſſion, to obtain of God perſeverance for our weak graces. <hi>I have prayed,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>that thy faith faile not.</hi> But was not that a
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:119001:204"/>
particular priviledge granted to him, which may be denied to another? O Sirs, do we think that Chriſts love looks a ſquint? doth he pray for one childe more then another? ſuch feares and jealouſies fooliſh children are ready to take up, and therefore Chriſt prevents them, by bidding <hi>Peter</hi> in the very next words. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren,</hi> Luke 22.31. that is, when thou feeleſt the efficacy and force of my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for thy faith, carry this good newes to them, that their hearts may be ſtrengthened alſo; and what ſtrengthening had it been to them, if Chriſt prayed not for them as well as <hi>Peter</hi>? does Chriſt pray for us? yea, doth he not live to pray for us? O how can children of ſo many prayers, of ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers periſh? The Saints prayers have a mighty power. <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled and had power with God, this was his ſword and bowe (to allude to what he ſaid of the parcel of ground he took, from the Amorite,) by which he got the victory and had power with God. This was the Key with which <hi>Elijah</hi> opened and ſhut heaven. And if the weak prayers of Saints (coming in his Name) have ſuch credit in heaven, that with them they can go to Gods treaſure, and carry away as much as their armes of faith can hold; O then, what prevalency has Chriſts interceſſion, who is a Son, an obedient Son, that is come from finiſhing his great work on earth, and now prayes his Father for nothing, but what he hath bid him ask, yea, for nothing but what he is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with him for, and all this to a Father that loves thoſe he prays for as well as himſelfe? Bid Satan avaunt, Say not thy weak faith ſhall periſh, till thou heareſt that Chriſt hath left praying, or meets with a repulſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, let us ſee whether Satan be able to pluck the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an away, and ſtep betwixt him and home. I have had occaſion to ſpeak of this ſubject in another place, the leſſe here ſhall ſerve. Abundant proviſion is made againſt his aſſaults. The Saint is wrap't up in the everlaſting armes of Almighty power, and what can a curſed devil do againſt God, who laid thoſe chaines on him which he cannot ſhake off? when he is able to pluck that dart of divine fury out of his own conſcicnce which God hath faſtened there, then let him think of ſuch an enterpriſe as this. How can he overcome thee that cannot tempt thee but in Gods appointed time? And if God ſet Satan his time to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:119001:204"/>
the Chriſtian whom he loves ſo dearly, ſurely it ſhall be when he ſhall be repulſed with greateſt ſhame.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is derogatory to Gods deſign in the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which we finde plainly to be this, that his children might be put into a ſtate ſure and ſafe from miſcarrying at laſt, which by the firſt Covenant man was not. See, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of faith, that it might be of grace; to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> God on purpoſe becauſe of the weakneſſe of the firſt Covenant through the mutable nature of man, makes a new Covenant of a far different conſtitution and frame, not of works as that was, but of faith, and why? the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, that it might be ſure <hi>to all the ſeed,</hi> that not one ſoule, who by faith ſhould be adopted into <hi>Abrahams</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo become a childe of the promiſe, ſhould faile of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting the bleſſing of the promiſe, which is eternal life; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. and all this becauſe the promiſe is founded upon grace, that is, Gods immutable good pleaſure in Chriſt, and not upon the variable and inconſtant obedience of man as the firſt Covenant was. But if a Saint may finally fall, then is the promiſe no more ſure in this Covenant then it was in that, and ſo God ſhould not have his end he propounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, it reflects ſadly on Chriſts honour, both as he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted  with the Saints ſalvation, and alſo as he is intereſſed in it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> as he is intruſted with the Saints ſalvation. He tells us they are given him of his Father for this very end, that he ſhould give them eternal life, yea, that power which he hath over all fleſh; was given him to render him every way able to effect this one buſineſſe, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. He accepts the charge, ownes them as his ſheep, knowes them every one, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>he will give them eternal life, they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of his hand,</hi> John 10.27, 28. Now how well do they conſult with Chriſts honour, that ſay his ſheepe may die in a ditch of final apoſtaſy notwithſtanding all this?
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:119001:205"/>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> as he is intereſſed in the ſalvation of every Saint. The life of his own glory is bound up in the eternal life of his Saints. Its true, when <hi>Adam</hi> fell God did ſave his ſtake, but how can Chriſt who is ſo nearly united to every believing ſoul? There was a league of friendſhip betwixt God and <hi>Adam</hi>; but no ſuch union as here where Chriſt and his Saints make but one Chriſt, for which his Church is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>As the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, ſo is Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt and his members make one Chriſt: now is it poſſible a piece of Chriſt can be found at laſt-burning in hell? can Chriſt be a cripple Chriſt? can this member drop off and that? 'Tis as poſſible that all, as any ſhould; and how can Chriſt part with his myſtical members and not with his glory? doth not every member adde an ornament to the body, yea, an honour? The Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the fulneſſe of him, Eph.</hi> 1.23. O how diſhonourable is it to Chriſt that we ſhould think he ſhall want any of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? and how can the man be full and compleat that wants a member?</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it wounds the Saints comfort to the heart, and layes their joy a bleeding.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.17</note>

Hence called <hi>the ſure mercies of David,</hi> Acts 13.34. mercies that ſhall never faile: This, this indeed is wine that makes glad the heart of a Saint; though he may be whipt in the houſe when he ſins, yet he ſhall not be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of doores.

Though  there is no feare of a Saints ſalling from grace, yet there is great danger of others falling from the top of this comfortable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine into a careleſſe ſecurity, and preſumptuous boldneſſe; and therefore a battlement is very neceſſary, that from it we may
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:119001:206"/>
with ſafety to our ſoules, ſtand and view the pleaſant proſpect this truth preſents to our eye. That flower from which the Bee ſucks honey, the ſpider draws poiſon. That which is a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to the Saints grace, proves an incentive to the luſt of a wicked man. What <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Law, we may truly of the Goſpel: Sin taking occaſion from the grace of the Goſpel, and the ſweet promiſes thereof, deceives the carnal heart, and works in him all manner of wickedneſſe. Indeed ſin ſeldome grows ſo rank any where, as in thoſe who water its roots with the grace of the Goſpel. Two wayes this doctrine may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, into a neglect of duty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, into a liberty to ſin. Take heed of both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, beware of falling into a neglect of duty upon this ſcore; if a Chriſtian, thou canſt not fall away from grace. Take for an antidote againſt this three particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, there are other arguments to invite, yea, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain thee to a conſtant vigourous performing of duty, though the feare of falling away ſhould not come in, or elſe thou art not a Chriſtian; what? nothing make the childe diligent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his fathers buſineſſe, but feare of being diſinherited and turned out of doors? There is ſure ſome better motive to duty in a Saints heart, or elſe Religion is a melancholy work. Speak for your ſelves, O ye Saints, is ſelf-preſervation all you pray for, and heare for? ſhould a meſſenger come from Heaven, and tell you Heaven were yours, would this make you give over your ſpiritual trade and not care whether you had any more acquaintance with God till you came thither? O how harſh doth this ſound in your eares! There are ſuch principles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven in the Chriſtians boſome, that will not ſuffer a ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe long to grow betwixt God and him. He is under the Law of a new life, which carries him naturally to deſire communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, as the childe doth to ſee the face of his deare father, and every duty is a Mount wherein God preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſeen and enjoyed by the Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to neglect duty upon ſuch a perſwaſion, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſts practice and counſel. <hi>Firſt,</hi> his practice. Though Chriſt never doubted of his Fathers love, nor queſtioned the happy iſſue of all his temptations, agonies and ſufferings; yet
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:119001:206"/>
he prayes, and prayes again more earneſtly, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>Secondly,</hi> his counſel and command. He told <hi>Peter,</hi> that Satan had begg'd leave to have them to ſift them. But withal he comforts him (who was to be hardeſt put to it) with this, <hi>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not.</hi> Sure our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by this proviſion made for him and the reſt, means to ſave them a labour that they need not watch or pray. No ſuch matter: after this, as you may ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 40. He calls them up to duty, <hi>Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> Chriſts praying for them was to ſtrengthen their faith, when they ſhould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pray for the ſame mercy; not to nouriſh their ſloth that they needed not to pray. Chriſts prayers in Heaven for his Saints are all heard already: but the returne of them is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be encloſed in the anſwer God ſends to their own pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers The Chriſtian cannot in faith expect to receive the mercies Chriſt prayes for in Heaven, ſo long as he lives in the neglect of his duty on earth. They ſtand ready againſt he ſhall call for them by the prayer of faith, and if they be not worth ſending this meſſenger to Heaven, truly they are worth little.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> conſider that although the Chriſtian be ſecured from a total and final apoſtaſy, yet he may fall ſadly to the bruiſing of his conſcience, enfeebling his grace, and reproach of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which ſure are enough to keep the Chriſtian upon his watch; and the more, becauſe ordinarily the Saints back-ſlidings, begin in their duties. As it is with tradeſmen in the world, they firſt grow careleſſe of their buſineſſe, often out of their ſhop, and then they go behinde-hand in their eſtates: So here, firſt remiſſe in a duty, and then fall into a decay of their graces and comforts, yea, ſometimes into wayes that are ſcandalous. A ſtuffe loſeth its gloſſe before it weares: The Chriſtian, the luſtre of his grace in the lively exerciſe of duty, and then the ſtrength of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, take heed of abuſing this doctrine unto a liberty to ſin; ſhall we ſin becauſe grace abounds? grow looſe, becauſe we have God faſt bound in his promiſe? God forbid, none but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would teach us this Logick. It was a great height of ſin thoſe wretched Jewes came to, who could quaffe and carouſe it while death look't in upon them at the windows; <hi>Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we ſhall die.</hi> They diſcovered their Atheiſme
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:119001:207"/>
therein. But what a prodigious ſtature in ſin muſt that man be grown to, that can ſin under the protection of the promiſe, and draw his encouragement to ſin from the everlaſting love of God? Let us eat and drink, for we are ſure to live and be ſaved. Grace cannot dwell in that heart, which drawes ſuch a curſed conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the premiſſes of Gods grace. The Saints have not ſo learn't Chriſt. The inference the Apoſtle makes from the ſweet priviledges we enjoy in the Covenant of grace, is not to wallow in ſin; but having theſe promiſes, to cleanſe our ſelves from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 'Tis the nature of faith, (the grace that trades with Promiſes) to purifie the heart. Now the more certain report faith brings of Gods love from the promiſe to the ſoule, the mote it purifies the heart, becauſe love by which faith works, is thereby more inflamed to God; and if once this affection takes fire, the room becomes too hot for ſin to ſtay there.</p>

                     <head>SECT. VI.</head>
                     <p>The fourth note and laſt is, That it will abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all the hardſhip and trouble the Chriſtian endures in this war againſt ſin and Satan, that he ſhall be able when the war is ended to ſtand. In mans wars all do not get by them that fight in them; the gaines of theſe are commonly put into a few pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. The common ſouldiers endure moſt of the hardſhip, but go away with little of the profit; they fight to make a few that are great yet greater, and are many times themſelves turn'd off at laſt, with what will hardly pay for the cure of their wounds, or keep them from ſtarving in a poor Hoſpital. But in this war there is none loſeth, but he that runs away. A glorious reward there is for every faithful ſouldier in Chriſts Camp, and that is wrapt up in this phraſe, <hi>Having done all to ſtand.</hi> Now in this place, <hi>to ſtand</hi> imports three things, which laid together will clear the point.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>to ſtand</hi> in this place, is to ſtand Conquerours. An Army when conquered,<note place="margin">Lev. 26. Dan. 11.25</note> is ſaid to fall before their enemy, and the Conquerour to ſtand. Every Chriſtian ſhall at the end of the war ſtand a Conquerour over his vanquiſh't luſts, and Satan
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:119001:207"/>
that headed them. Many a ſweet victory the Chriſtian hath here over Satan; But (alas!) the joy of theſe Conqueſts is again inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with freſh alarms from his rallied enemy. One day he hath the better, and may be the next he is put to the hazard of another battel, much ado he hath to keep what he hath got: yea, his very victories are ſuch as ſend him bleeding out of the field: Though he repulſes the temptation at laſt, yet the wounds his conſcience gets in the fight, do overcaſt the glory of the victory. 'Tis ſeldome the Chriſtian comes off without ſome ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the treachery of his own heart, which had like to have loſt the day, and betrayed him into his enemies hand: But for thy eternal comfort. Know (poor Chriſtian) there is a bleſſed day coming, which ſhall make a full and final deciſion of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel betwixt thee and Satan: Thou ſhalt ſee this enemies Camp quite broke up, not a weapon left in his hand to lift up againſt thee. Thou ſhalt tread upon his high places, from which he hath made ſo many ſhots at thee. Thou ſhalt ſee them all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled and demoliſhed, till there be not left ſtanding any one corruption in thy boſome, for a devil to hide and harbour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in. Satan, at whoſe approach thou haſt ſo trembled, ſhall then be ſubdued under thy feet: he that hath ſo oft bid thee bow down, that he might go over thy ſoule and trample upon all thy glory, ſhall now have his neck laid to be trodden on by thee. Were there nothing elſe to be expected as the fruits of our watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying, weeping &amp; mourning, ſevere duties of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſelf-denial, with whatever elſe our Chriſtian warfare puts us upon but this; our labour ſure would not be in vain in the Lord. Yea, bleſſed watching and praying, happy tears and wounds we meet with in this war; may they out at laſt end in a full and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal victory over ſin and Satan. Bondage is one of the worſt of evils. The baſer an enemy is, the more abhorred by noble ſpirits. <hi>Saul</hi> feared to fail into the hands of the uncircumciſed Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, and to be abuſed by their ſcornes and reproaches more then a bloody death. Who baſer then Satan? what viler tyrant then ſin? Glorious then will the day be, wherein we ſhall praiſe God for delivering us out of the hands of all our ſins, and from the hand of Satan. But diſmal to you (ſinners) who at the ſame time wherein you ſhall ſee the Saints ſtand with crowns of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory on their heads, muſt like fettered captives be dragg'd to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119001:208"/>
hells dungeon, there to have your eare bored unto an eternal bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age under your luſts. And what more miſerable ſentence can God himſelf paſſe upon you? Here ſin is pleaſure, there it will be your torment. Here a ſweet bit and goes down glib, but there it will ſtick in your throats. Here you have ſuitable proviſion to entertain your luſts withal: Palaces for pride to dwell and ſtrut her ſelf in: Delicious fare for your wanton palates: houſes, and lands, with coffers of ſilver and gold for your covetous hearts, by their ſelf-pleaſing thoughts to ſit brooding upon: but you will finde none of theſe there; hell is a barren place, nothing grows in that land of darkneſſe to ſolace and recreate the ſinners minds. You ſhal have your luſts, but want the food they long for. O what a torment muſt that needs be, to have a ſoul ſharp ſet, even to a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous hunger after ſin; but chain'd up where it can come at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it would have to ſatisfie its loſt: for a proud wretch, that could wiſh he might dominere over all the world, yea, over God himſelf if he would let him, to be kept down in ſuch a dungeon, as hell is, O how it will cut! for the malicious ſinner, whoſe heart ſwells with rancour againſt God and his Saints, that he could pluck them out of Gods boſome, yea, God out of his throne if he had power, to finde his hands ſo manacled, that he can do nothing againſt them he ſo hates: O how this will torment! Speak, O you Saints, whoſe partial victory over ſin at preſent is ſo ſweet to you, that you would chooſe a thouſand deaths, ſooner then return to your old bondage under your luſts: how glorious then is that day in your eye, when this ſhall be compleated in a full and eternal Conqueſt, never to have any thing to do more with ſin or Satan.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>to ſtand,</hi> is here to ſtand juſtified and acquitted at the great day of judgement. The phraſe is frequent in Scripture, which ſets out the ſolemn diſcharge they ſhall have then, by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The wicked ſhall not ſtand in the judgement</hi>; that is, they ſhall not be juſtified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldeſt mark iniquity, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> that is, who ſhall be diſcharged? The great God, upon whoſe errand we come into the world, hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world by Jeſus Chriſt; a ſolemn day it will be, when all that ever, lived on earth, high and low, good and bad, ſhall meet in one Aſſembly to make their perſonal appearance before Chriſt, and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:119001:208"/>
from his mouth to receive their eternal doom, who ſhall in his Majeſtick robes of glory aſcend the awful ſeat of Judicature, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with his illuſtrious traine and guard of Angels about him, as ſo many officers ready to execute and perform his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure according to the definitive ſentence that he ſhall pronounce; either to conduct thoſe bleſſed ones whom he ſhall juſtifie into his glorious Kingdome, or binde them hand and foot to be caſt into hells unquenchable flames whom he ſhall condemn. I do not wonder that <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon on this ſubject, did make an earth-quake in <hi>Felix</hi> his conſcience: but rather that any ſhould be ſo far gone in a lethargy, and dedolent numbneſſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the thought of this day cannot recover them to their ſenſe and feeling. O Sirs, do you not vote them happy men and women that ſhall ſpeed well on this day? are not your thoughts enquiring who thoſe bleſſed ſoules are, which ſhall be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the lively voice of Chriſt the Judge? You need not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to ſearch the rolls of election in heaven, here you may know they are ſuch as fight the Lords battels on earth againſt Satan, in the Lords Armour, and that to the end of their lives. Theſe having done all ſhall ſtand in judgement. And were it but at a mans bar, ſome Court-Martial, where a ſouldier ſtood upon trial for his life, either to be condemned as a Traitour to his Prince, or clear'd as faithful in his truſt. O how ſuch a one would liſten to heare how it would go with him, and be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed when the Judge pronounces him innocent! Well may ſuch be bid to fall down on their knees, thank God and the Judge that have ſaved their lives; how much more raviſhing will the ſweet voice of Chriſt be in the Saints eares, when he ſhall in the face of men and Angels make publike declaration of their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe? O how confounded will Satan then be, who was their accuſer to God and their own conſciences alſo, ever threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them with the terrour of that day! How blank will the wicked world be, to ſee the dirt that they had throwen by their calumnies and lying reports on the Saints faces, wiped off with Chriſts own hand; they from Chriſts mouth to be juſtified as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, whom they had call'd hypocrites! will not this, O ye Saints, be enough for all the ſcorne you were laden with from the world, and conflict you endured with the Prince of the world? But this is not all. Therefore</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="394" facs="tcp:119001:209"/>Thirdly, to ſtand, doth here alſo (as the complement of their reward) denote the Saints ſtanding in heavens glory. Princes when they would reward any of their ſubjects, that in their wars have done eminent ſervice to the crown, (as the utmoſt they can do for them) do prefer them to Court, there to enjoy their Princely favour, and ſtand in ſome place of honourable ſervice before them continually. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſets it out as the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of faithful ſubjects <hi>to ſtand before Kings.</hi> Heaven is the royal city where the great God keeps his Court. The happineſs of glorious Angels is to ſtand there before God. <hi>I am Gabriel that ſtand in the preſence of God,</hi> Luke 1.19. That is, I am one of thoſe heavenly ſpirits who wait on the great God, and ſtand before his face, as Courtiers do about their Prince. Now ſuch honour ſhall every faithful ſoul have. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, If thou wilt walk in my wayes, and if thou wilt keep my charge, I will give thee places to walk, among theſe that ſtand by,</hi> Zech. 3.7. He alludes to the Temple, which had rooms joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it for the Prieſts that waited on the Lord in his holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there. Or to Courtiers, that have ſtately galleries and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings becoming their place at Court allowed them in the Kings Palace they wait upon. Thus all the Saints, (whoſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Joſhua</hi> was) ſhall after they have kept the Lords charge in a ſhort lifes ſervice on earth, be called up to ſtand before God in heaven, where with Angels they ſhall have their galleries, and manſions of glory alſo. O happy they who ſhall ſtand before the Lord in glory! The greateſt Peeres of a Realme (ſuch as Earles, Marqueſſes and Dukes are) count it greater honour to ſtand before their King, though bare-headed and oft upon the knee, then to live in the countrey, where all bow and ſtand bare to them; yea, let but their Prince forbid them coming to Court, and 'tis not their great eſtates or reſpect they have where they live will content them. 'Tis better to wait in heaven then to reign on earth. 'Tis ſweet ſtanding before the Lord here in an Ordinance, one day in the worſhip of God is better then many elſewhere; O what then is it to ſtand before God in glory! If the Saints ſpikenard ſendeth forth ſo ſweet a ſmell,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.12</note> while the King ſits at his table here in a Sermon or Sacrament: O then what joy muſt needs flow from their near attendance on him, as he ſits at his table in heaven, which when God firſt made, it was
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:119001:209"/>
intended by him to be that Chamber of preſence, in which he would preſent himſelf to be ſeen of, and enjoyed by his Saints in all his glory. I know nothing would have a more powerful, yea, univerſal operation upon a Saints ſpirit, then the frequent and ſpiritual conſideration of that bliſſeful ſtate in heaven, which ſhall at laſt crown all their ſad conflicts here on earth. None like this ſword to cut the very ſinews of temptation, and behead thoſe luſts, which defie and out-brave whole troops of other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. It is almoſt impoſſible to ſin with lively thoughts and hopes of that glory. 'Tis when the thoughts of heaven are long out of the Chriſtians ſight, and he knows not what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his hopes to that glorious place, that he begins to ſet up ſome idol, (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Calfe in <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence) which he may dance before. But let heaven come in ſight, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians heart will be well-warm'd with the thoughts of it, and you may as ſoon perſwade a King to throw his royal Diademe into a ſink, and wallow with his robes in a kennel, as a Saint to ſin with the expectation of heavens glory. Sin is a devils work, not a Saints, who is a Peer of heaven, and waits every houre for the Writ, that ſhall call him to ſtand with Angels and glorified Saints before the throne of God. This would cheer the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heart, and confirme him when the fight is hotteſt, and the bullets flie thickeſt from men and devils, to think, 'tis heaven all this is for, where it's worth having a place, though we go through fire and water to it. <hi>'Tis before the Lord,</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi> to ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing <hi>Michal) that choſe me, before thy father and all his houſe, therefore I will play before the Lord, and I will yet be more vile then thus.</hi> 2 Sam. 6.21. Thus, Chriſtian, wouldeſt thou throw off the vipers of reproaches, which from the fire of the wickeds ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice flie upon thee; 'Tis for God that I pray, hear, mortifie my luſt, deny my ſelf of my carnal ſports, profits and pleaſures, that God who hath paſſed by Kings and Princes, to chooſe me a poor wretch to ſtand before him in glory; therefore I will be yet more vile then thus. O Sirs, were there not another world to enjoy God in, yet ſhould we not while we have our being ſerve our Maker? The heavens and the earth obey his Law, that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no reward for doing his Will. <hi>Quench hell, burn hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> (ſaid a holy man) <hi>yet I will love and feare my God</hi>; How much more when everlaſting armes of mercy ſtand ready ſtretch't to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:119001:210"/>
carry you aſſoon as the fight is over into the bliſſeful preſence of God. You have ſervants of your own ſo ingenuous and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that can follow your work hard abroad in all weathers; and may they but when they come home, weary and hungry at night, obtain a kinde look from you, and ſome tender care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, they are very thankful. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith one, (to ſhame the ſluggiſh Chriſtian) <hi>how many hundred miles will the poor Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel run after his Maſter in a journey, who gets nothing but a few crumbs, or a bone from his Maſters trencher?</hi> In a word, which is more, the devils ſlaves, what will they not do and venture at his command, who hath not ſo much to give them, as you to your dog, not a cruſt, not a drop of water to cool their tongue? and ſhall not the joy of heaven which is ſet before the Chriſtian, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he ſhall aſſuredly enter, make him run his race, endure a ſhort ſcuffle of temptation and affliction? yea ſure, and make him reckon alſo that <hi>theſe are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in him.</hi>
