            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST EXCELLENT AND ILLVSTRIOVS PRINCE, CHARLES, PRINCE of Wales.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Highnesse may please to remember how great an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest your Princely Mother, our late Gracious Queene, vouchsafed to challenge in my deceased Father: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting Him as one of Hers, as most truly (next the professed band of dutie to his dread Soueraigne, whose first-sworne Chaplaine he was, after his Maiesties happie arriuall in
<pb facs="tcp:8466:3"/>
these parts) by all the tyes a Royall Mistris might engage a Seruant, he was. Since that Starre was taken from our sight, I know not whether else ought Shee could call Hers might so immediately refer as to your selfe. I am sure it was His study, while he liued, to consecrate his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to the Branches of that Royall stocke, and by that line of duty, drawn from Her merits, to measure out His bounden seruices to Her Line, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your Highnesse; Who, I haue cause to thinke, doe yet beleeue you had a faithfull Orator and Seruant of Him. Since then by double right he was deuoted to your Highnesse, by his owne acknowledgement, and by the purchase of your especiall fauours towards Him; I durst not entitle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

other Patrone to the remainder of what he was, his <hi>Memory,</hi> without leaue from your Highnesse. But as it was my filiall duety to vindicate a wronged Father, so I held it the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of my ciuill duty to tender it first to your Hands, that it might take sanctuary vnder your Princely wing. Thus borne vp, the <hi>Truth</hi> I write shall boldly flie into the bosome of those climes where it was first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured; and, if their foreheads be not meretriciously steeled with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or growne flint, fetcht backe it's owne proper hiew, or their shame.</p>
            <p>It is not a forward presumption in me, but the cause which makes your Highnesse patronage my chiefe scope; vpon which tearmes it will not be inglorious for you to vndertake it.
<pb facs="tcp:8466:4"/>
For whilest you shall protect abused Innocence, your Goodnesse will stand pitched at the iust height your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse now doth, one degree from a <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> Long may you flourish, to make all Good men happy in your protection; and may that heart want the prayers of good men to relieue it, which doth not as faithfully sue to Almighty God for all addition to your Happinesse, as he who is</p>

               <hi>exordium</hi> a Preacher can make, or from what foundation the frame of his speech can more happily arise then from this, which is the first stone in this pile, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</hi> It is the best charge the Priest can giue, and the first lesson the People should learne; else, like children, that read only by rote, they shall spend much time and vnderstand nothing. It is a taske can neuer be vrged too often, <hi>Manda re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda:</hi> nor can it euer be learned too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; <hi>Nunquam satis dici, quia nunquam satis disci potest.</hi> An age is not enough for this precept, but when seuen yeeres are run out, they may begin againe, and finish an apprentiship long as life, yet misse that freedome and perfection they seeke; <hi>Ars longa vitabreuis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:8466:5"/>
Since therefore much is to be learned, and either we want time, or capacity, or memory to comprehend it, the right way to profit an Auditory, &amp; not cloy, is to let them digest what they haue bin taught, and not heare new lessons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old are remembred. For as eating much meate, and not keeping it, argues a better appetite then concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so hearing much, and retaining none, shewes a quicke eare, but a dull deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>There are many now adaies who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinke they haue preaching enough: but as exquisite gluttons lay all markets for fare, so doe they lay all Churches where there is any suspicion of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and all is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to glut their <note place="margin">Gregor. Nazian. Epitaph. Caesar.</note> eares; nay, the same Father speaks them more fully, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they goe <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> not so much to feed, as delight their eares, and to satisfie that wanton itch of hearing, which like a Tetter, the more it is rubbed, the more it spreads. I wish there were more practising, on conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:8466:6"/>
there were lesse preaching. A man may heare so much that hee may ston the sense, and bee like the <hi>Catadupes,</hi> whom the continuall fall of <hi>Nile</hi> makes deafe. Cisternes that haue more powred into them then they can hold, must needs run to wast; and men that affect to learne more then they haue braine to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, waste their Pastors labour, and their owne patience. It is good counsell for one to eate no more then his stomacke can beare, for too full feeding engenders nothing but surfets; and I thinke as good counsell will it be, to heare no more then hee can carry away. For were the retention good, the nourishment would be more solid, and Christianitie acquire that full growth, for want of which wee are but Impes and Zanies, in respect of those that liued in the Primitiue Church.</p>
            <p>No wonder then, if Preaching may breed surfets, that so many Crudities lie in the stomacke of this Citty; that so many Fumes and giddy vapours flie vp into the head, to the no small disturbance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8466:6"/>
of the Churches quiet; that so many hot spirits, like Canons ouercharged, recoyle against all Discipline, breake into diuers factions, and with the splints of those crackt opinions doe more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe then deliberation or Iustice can suddenly salue. I speake no new vnheard language. This communitie of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath brought it into such cheape contempt, with many, that, as if the gift of tongues were prostitute to Idiots and Trades, you shall haue a sort of Lay Mechanicke Presbiters of both sexes <hi>(Praedicatores,</hi> and <hi>Praedicantissae)</hi> presume so far vpon their acquaintance with the Pulpit, that they will venter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Exposition, or vndertake to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a long vnweildy prayer conceiued on the sudden, though not so suddenly vttered; nay, they are so desperate, they will torment a Text, and in their resty Conuenticles teach as boldly, as if they were as well able to become Iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Pulpit, as to their owne Trades. I cannot but thinke of the story
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8466:7"/>
of the poore Asse that carryed the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse <hi>Isis</hi> so long to and from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that at last hee began to take state vpon him, and would needs play the goddesse. So these creatures haue so long trauelled betwixt the Temple, <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes mysteria,</hi> and conuersed with the sacred <hi>mysteries</hi> of Religion, that they begin to flatter themselues in an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of worth, which none would suspect; and forgetting their former condition, will needs turne Teachers. If this be the fruit of so much preaching, it is high time that command bee now reuersed, Son of man, <hi>Lift vp thy voyce like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 1.</note> rather, Son of man, sound a retreit, and be dumb, in admiration, to see Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers &amp; Artizans vsurpe that holy Office.</p>

            <p>Wisedome is its own Herald, and the words of worthy persons need no way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers to prepare attention, saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

            <p>In both these respects doth Christ plead for regard. First, in respect of his own person, <hi>[J said.]</hi> That <hi>Ego sum,</hi> vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">1</note> by him in the Garden, strucke such <note place="margin">{I said.}</note> awe &amp; terror into his enemies, that they <note place="margin">Iohn 18. 6.</note> did homage to the sound of his voyce, by falling flat to the ground.

might both warne them of what should befal, and comfort them in their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>The words of dying men are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous euen to strangers; but when the voyce of one we loue, cals to vs from the death-bed, O what a conflict doe his words raise! how strongly doth griefe and affection striue to inclose them! knowing that in a short space that tongue, the organs whereof yet speake, was to be eternally tyed vp in silence; nor should the sound of his words sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute our eares any more.

            <p>If then such riches lie here in banke, no maruell if our Sauiour wish his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to locke it vp sure, <hi>[Remember the word I told you:]</hi> knowing that the place is not built of brasse, but fraile and brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and that there is a thiefe still lurking about the doore, euen that great <hi>Thiefe</hi> who at first robbed man of his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and vpon the least aduantage would spoyle vs of those comforts, and carry the words away, as in the Parable.

            <p>I know your City-feasts keepe their annuall circuit; the inauguration of Officers, and choice of Wardens to each Company want no ceremonious forme to set them forth: for the better solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing wherof, <hi>Samson</hi> is brought vnto the feast, and the first dish must be a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> An Italian Atheist scoffingly said, he was wont to goe to Church, that hee might returne with better deuotion to his dinner: be the thought of my apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to you far from me, as I know the intent is from you. The piety of many graue and good men in those societies, fully resolues me that it is deuotion, not forme, which makes them desirous of that act: Yet none can deny, but some
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8466:11"/>
there be, and those not a few, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Sermons at such times are rather for conuenience then otherwise: that as <hi>Moses siluer Trumpets</hi> serued to call the people together, so they to assemble the ghests; as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Sermon, and a Wake; or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were become as necessary a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to a Feast, as wine or musicke. But those times, whose memory should be precious, passe by without Sermon, or so much as the courtesie of the day; no Annals or yeerely feasts to keepe them vp, but in stead of a mention, there is a blanke, and solemne silence, in stead of an Anniuerse.</p>

            <p>I will not seeke an instance beyond this, though I could many: and I would to God our vnthankfulnesse were boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here, that though we are vnmindfull of deliuerances, which are without vs, and concerne our bodies peace, yet we might be more apprehensiue of such as

But not the greatest blessings that euer befell mankinde, are free from this canker of obliuion, the Death and Passion of our Sauiour, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which by that act was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased. For how is it possible, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Christ already dyed for vs, we should still crucifie him afresh, and by our sinnes (each whereof is a new crosse and burthen to him) adde afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his former sorrowes? that wee should wound him daily with our blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies; and with serpentine tongues, sharpened with othes and swearings, fetch new streames of blood from him?

blood in fetching back that thing which wise men neuer lost, <hi>Reputation?</hi> O yee sonnes of men, when will ye be wise? or when desist from being authors of your owne wretchednesse? You haue bin long put in mind of these faults, it is now time you should <hi>remember</hi> to amend them. Be but you willing, and you need not to despaire of remedy: the cure is easie, and the balme familiar, if applyed, <hi>Tantùm recordare,</hi> onely <hi>[Remember.]</hi> Remember what Christ hath said, and you will the better remember what he hath done for you. This is the right method, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation which Christ requires from his; <hi>If ye loue me, keepe my sayings;</hi> and if you <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 13.</note> will perfectly remember me, first <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what I told you.</hi>
            </p>

keepe the Commandements in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to breake them in thy course of life; to remember Christ in thy words, and forget him in thy deeds, is to mocke God, and foole away thy saluation.</p>
            <p>Briefly thus: Let the people know it is no speculatiue, but a practick memory Christ lookes for; and to remember his words is to practise them. What shall it auaile if thou haue memory beyond <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who could call euery souldier in his armie by name? What good, though the euidence of Time were recorded in thy braine? though thou keepe a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of all occurences since <hi>Adam,</hi> and couldest remember more history then <hi>Baronius</hi> wrote? surely if thou retaine all, yet practise none, if it be for theory and not vse, thou art but like a Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry locked vp in the time of dearth, or a sword sleeping in the scabbard when it should bee drawne. Such knowledge doth but <hi>Animam praegrauare,</hi> comber the soule, as <hi>Sauls</hi> armour did <hi>Dauid;</hi> and is only like the <hi>Persians</hi> glittering muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

So this knowledge doth spoyle the owners, and make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation the greater, when they shall know the right way, yet hold the wrong; heare so much, yet doe so little. Let no man thinke it enough to spend the day in hearing, or by frequenting a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sermons to aduantage himselfe; for though he count his Lectures as the Papists their Pater-nosters, by the beads, yet if he be <hi>An hearer of the Law, and not</hi>

And I cleerely professe, if a true relation of his end may doe him right, I haue faithfully performed it, and haue giuen the world so iust an account of Him,</hi> tanquàm Ephemeridem Deo traditurus, <hi>as if I should haue made my conscience last shrift to God. Whether I haue vprightly stewarded his honour, and my owne faith, I leaue to the strict iudgement of any, who are able to distinguish colours, and discerne</hi> Truth <hi>from</hi> Imposture: <hi>being confident, as innocence can make a man, that none are able to disallow the reckoning.</hi> Si veredicam, Deus testis; si mentiar, Deus Vindex. <hi>As therefore the acquitting of His integrity was the prime mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue which entred me into this Quarrell, so now the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my owne fidelity was a secondary motiue for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it. First, that they might not thinke by false al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms and the confused outcries of</hi> Report, <hi>to beare downe a good cause, or so easily to triumph in their supposed victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as if none durst affront them; I thought good, in the meane time, thus on the sudden to checke the rumour, till haply some more deliberate pen (which they shall not long, or vainely expect) may quite race it out. And though this byrth of mine were more hastily formed, I hope it will not be vntimely, for</hi> Truth neuer knew abortion; <hi>but, like a starre newly risen to discouery, hath its being of old, though the obseruation was but late and moderne. Secondly, to let
<pb facs="tcp:8466:43"/>
those calumnious tongues, who gaue out my Reuolt also as well as my Fathers (both true alike) know, I haue not yet so doted on their part, or dis-affected my owne, as to leaue my</hi> Countrey, <hi>or</hi> Religion; <hi>nor, I thinke, euer shall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my vnderstanding, wits, and aboue all, the Grace of God leaue me: or their perswasions haue the same power ouer me, as</hi> Mercuries <hi>had ouer</hi> Sosias, <hi>that they can make me beleeue</hi> Ego non sum Ego, <hi>I am not the</hi> Son <hi>of such a</hi> Father. <hi>And what in this case, on my owne behalfe, I write, is likewise auowed on behalfe of my second brother,</hi> IOHN KING, <hi>entred into the same orders as my selfe; who also had his share in this lewd imputation, as well as my selfe: for we are not more brothers in nature, then (by Gods mercy) in this resolution. Thirdly, to take the liberty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and explicating some remarkeable</hi> circumstances, <hi>which better become a Margin then a speech. Lastly, that though the</hi> slander <hi>hath hitherto got the start, the</hi> Detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>might, at last be set in a course to ouertake it. Which taske,</hi> Sermo transiens, <hi>a Sermon pronounced, could not so thorowly effect, except it were also</hi> Sermo in scriptis, <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

            <p>
               <hi>And now hauing committed it to the view of all men, I will not preiudicate, or doubtfully forestall the beliefe of any.

            <p>And being further asked, Whether he hath not heard of a Book not long since published, which is intituled, <hi>Protestants
<pb facs="tcp:8466:45"/>
Plea, and Petition for Priests and Papists,</hi> and that in the same Booke it is said, that the fore-named Bishop did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at the feet of a <hi>Priest</hi> confesse his sinnes, receiue <hi>Sacramentall absolution</hi> at his hands, and was reconciled to <hi>the Catholike Roman Church;</hi> And being hereupon charged vpon his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and his Priesthood, to speake the truth, whether hee were the person spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by report, or designed by the said booke to performe such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>Hee answereth, That it is true, that hee hath often heard, that such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was spredde abroad concerning him, and many both <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Catholikes</hi> haue come vnto him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether that report and bruit were true or no.</p>
            <p>And that hee hath heard, that in the booke before named, some such thing is deliuered, and vpon the day of this his examination hee was shewed the booke by the Lord Archbishop of
<pb facs="tcp:8466:45"/>
Canterbury, wherein hee found those things afore mentioned to bee contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>For the declaring of truth in all which, he protesteth before God, and vpon his conscience, as he shall answere at the dreadfull Day of Iudgement, that the said Bishop of <hi>London</hi> did neuer <hi>confesse</hi> himselfe vnto this Examinate, nor euer receiued <hi>Sacramentall absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> at his hands, nor was euer by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither did renounce before him the Religion professed and established in the Church of England, nor did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any other circumstance tending that way, as is in the said booke of the <hi>Protestants Plea</hi> deliuered.</p>
            <p>Yea he addeth further, that as he hath hope to be saued by <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> he this Examinate, to his knowledge, was neuer in company where the said <hi>Doctor King</hi> late Lord Bishop of London was, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he euer receiue letter from him, nor did write letter vnto him; neither
<pb facs="tcp:8466:46"/>
did he euer (to his knowledge) see the said Bishop in any place whatsoeuer, nor could haue knowne him from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, and therefore affirmeth, that this bruit and report is raised concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Examinate, and the said late Bishop, without any true ground and foundation.</p>
            <p>Being asked what hee should thinke to bee the cause wherefore any person should raise this fame or report, hee saith, that from the beginning hee did conceiue it to be nothing else, but that some, who did maligne him, were willing to disgrace him, or vndoe him, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in obloquy with the King or State, where he remaines a prisoner.</p>
            <p>Being demanded, whether euer hee hath probably or credibly heard that any other Priest did repaire to the said late Bishop, did take his Confession, gaue him absolution, or reconciled him to the Roman Church, hee protesteth, that he did neuer credibly or probably heare of any such thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8466:46"/>
Being asked whether he hath heard, that <hi>Masse</hi> hath been said for the said Bishop, in any part beyond the seas: hee answereth, that he hath heard such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but doth not know any thing of certainty concerning the same.</p>
