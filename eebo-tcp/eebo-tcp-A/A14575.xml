         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

graue and prudent, the Maior and Senators of the moste an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and honorable Cittie of Excester, Iohn Vowel
alias Hooker gentleman and Chamberlain of
the same, wisheth a happy successe in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
with the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
therof to the benefit of
the publique welth and
increace of vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I DO THINK
and consider (right worshipful) of
the noble state and great maiestie of
the high Courts of Parlements of
this Realme which for the exelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie and worthi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
therof, is of all true English men to be hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
and imbraced: I doo foorthwith fall in great
dislike as wel with my self as with others, which
beeing in learning ignoraunt, in wisdome weke,
in experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnskilful, and in euery respect very
vnfit for such an honorable assembly, should be
chosen and admitted to the same.</p>
            <p>For by the ancient orders and prescribed lawes
of this land: onely such are tobe elected and to
haue place there as for grauitie, wisdome, know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
and experience, are reputed and knowen
to be the moste chosen and principall persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:19933:3"/>
of the whole land and Realme. And this
court beeing in authoritie highest, and in power
cheefest: none should to be thorderers, Iudges
and councellers therof, but such as in vertues and
good conditions are answerable to the same.</p>
            <p>The order (therfore) among the Romains
was that none should be receiued or allowed to be
of their Senate house: vnlesse he were graue in
yeeres, and wel experienced in common affaires
of the publique welth. The Lacedemonians ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
none to be an Ephorus amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them: but
that he were a tryed man for knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
The Athenians would be assured
that he should be wise and lerned, that should be
of their counsail.</p>
            <p>The like order also was and is within this
Realm, the same being deriued and taken cheef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
from emong the Romains, emong and vnder
whome: diuers of tholde and ancient Kings of
this Realm, haue ben bred and brought vp.</p>
            <p>And by meanes of the wisdome, learning
and knowledge, learned emong them, haue not
onely attained to the Septer of this realme: but
also some of them haue been the monarches and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19933:3"/>
Emperours of the whole world.</p>
            <p>These good Kings and Princes (I say)
finding this land by disordered life, lawles liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
and lose behauior to be brought to an vtter
ruin, decay and desolation, no reason longer ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
nor good order allowed, then as priuat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffections
and selfwil would allow and like of:
after many deuises, consultations and attempts
for redresse, no way could be found so good, no
remedie so present, nor help so speedy: as to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and establish a Senate of the most graue,
wise and expert personages of the whole Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lme,
called by the name of a Parlement. For as
Patricius in his third Book, <hi>De institutione Reipub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
saith. The best order of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
welth: procedeth alwais fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tholde and anci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent
Senators, which are reputed and taken to be
the fathers of the common welth. For as fathers
for their Children: so these for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth
are moste careful and tender.</p>
            <p>And albeit the King or prince be neuer so
wise, learned and expert: yet is it impossible for
any one to be exact and perfit in all things, but
a Senate of wise, graue, learned and expert
<pb facs="tcp:19933:4"/>
men, beeing assembled in councel togither: they
are as it were one body, hauing many eyes to se,
many feet to go, and many hands to labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and so sircum spect they are for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>welth: that they se all thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs,
nothing is hid or secret, nothing is straunge or
new, nothing is to great or weightie to them,
but whether it be in causes of war, or of peace:
they wilbe wel aduised, and measure all things,
with good reason, circumspection and policie.</p>
            <p>Moyses therfore, although (hauing talked
with God face to face, he were aboue all others
most wise, discreet and learned, yet not trusting
all togither to his owne wittes: made choice of
all thelders of Israel, and by their councel did or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
and direct the publque state &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth
of his people, and likewise beeing councelled by
his father in law Iethro, to prouide emong all
his people, strong, couragiouse and valea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men,
(and such as feared God, dealed truely, and
hated couetousnes) to be rulers ouer the people,
to gouern and iudge them, he did so, onely the
greatest and weightiest matters whiche tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
God: were brought before him alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19933:4"/>
Wherfore according to the good profitable
and ancient orders of the Romai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Israelits:
these good Kings doo erect a Senate or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Lawes are prescribed how the same shuld
be kept, orders made what manner of persons
shalbe elected and chosen for the same, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
setfoorth how and in what sort lawes
and ordinaunces shalbe made for the benefit of
the common welth. And surely these good and
wholsome orders being put in vre and execution:
the benefit therof grew so much in short time,
that there was as it were a Metamorphoses of
the state of the publique weale in those daies, for
what Sedition and contention had disordred:
good order and concord recouered. What loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and dissolutnes of life had marred: honest be
hauiour restored. What disobedience had decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
loiable obedience ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. And finally what
soeuer by any disorder was amisse: was by these
meanes reformed and redressed: and the euils
which were crept and brought in by ambition,
couetousnes, debate, malice or enuy: were so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as that the people beeing better gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and instructed: would not be caryed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="tcp:19933:5"/>
affection, neither yet prefer priuate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and wilful lusts, before the common and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
welth.</p>
            <p>Lo, suche are the frutes which grew of the
Parlements, and thus doth it fare in all estates
where good men doo rule, wholsome lawes are
made, and good order kept and obserued, and so
long doo common welths florish: as when pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
do rule and gouerne by law, and people loyally
obeying doo liue vnder law.</p>
            <p>Erasmus in his Book <hi>De institutione principis
Christiani<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> saith, that good lawes vnder a good
Prince: doo make a happy Realme and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>Cuius tum felicissimus est status, cum
principi paretur ab omnibus, atque ipse Princeps paret le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus
leges autem, ad architypum aequi et honesti responde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
nec alio spectant, quam ad Rem commune<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in melius pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uehendam.</hi>
Whose state is then moste fortunate
when the people doo obey the Prince, and the
Prince obeyeth the lawes, and when lawes bee
made iust and right, and for the better aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of the common welth. And surely these
are so in seperable that in a good commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth
they cannot be disseuered, but a good Prince
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19933:5"/>
and good lawes must be concurrant, for although
it be a rule that <hi>Quod principi placet legis habet vigore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
&amp; that Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces heasts ar lawes: yet the Ethnicks
them selues doo holde thoppinion and affirme,
that vnlesse the lawes be iust and made according
to the rule of wisdome, and for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth:
it is no law, for that is a law, <hi>Quod sapienti bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
principi placet cui nil placet, nisi quod honestu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ac quod
senioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, iuditio atque se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentia probatum est fore Republica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely in my oppinion, if it behoueth
Princes to be valeant in armes, and expert in
martiall affaires, wherby to with stand the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye,
and to represse the rebel: much more ought
he to be wise and learned, that he knowing the
lawes and keeping the same, may the better go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerne
his people in peace and keep them in duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
obedience.</p>
            <p>Wherfore Iustinian the Emperour in the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heme
to the instituts, hath this sentence. <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriam
maiestatem, non solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armis decoratam sed et legibus
armatam esse oportet, vt vtrumque tempus, et bellorum, et
pacis, recte possit gubernari.</hi> an Emperour or a king
ought not onely to be skilful in feates of armes:
but also to be wel learned and instructed in the
<pb facs="tcp:19933:6"/>
lawes: that he may preuail against his enemye,
as also peaceably gouerne his Subiects. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an olde sentence, and for the worthines therof
grauen in Golde among the professors of the
common lawes of this Realme, <hi>Arma Regum Lex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therfore the Egiptians did think it
more honorable and commendable that Kings
should be rather learned in good studyes, then ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicted
to martiall feates, and therfore their
kings did with great diligence apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues
to the studyes of wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and knowledge, neither
did any King emong them think that he did or
could gouerne wel: vnlesse (as in authoritie, so al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
in wisdome, vertue and learning) he did excell
all the rest of his Subiects and people. Then if it
be so necessary and expedient for the common
welth that the same be gouerned by learned and
wise rulers, and guyded by iust and good lawes:
how happy, blessed &amp; fortunate is this realme of
Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both thone &amp; thother?</p>
            <p>For neither Athens with their Solon, and

Italians with their Pithagoras and his lawes,
and finally a number of other famose contries
and worthy gouernors, of whome great aduaunt
is made: are not to be compared to this little ile
and Realm, which in bothe respects hath passed
and excelled them all. For the Kings and rulers
therof (not for a short time: but in the course of
many hundrethes of yeeres) haue not been so vale<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ant
as wise, not so couragious as prudent, not so
puissant as learned, and not so politique in the
feeldes: as graue in the Senates. Likewise the
lawes, in equitie most vpright, in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts most
true, and in conscience moste resonable. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
and keeping of which lawes: hath heer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore
preserued this Realme from forain ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes,
defended it from ciuil seditions, and kept
the people in safetie, so that is vrified whiche
Melanchton writeth of Solon. <hi>Denique vita ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,
tranquilla et honesta manebit: seruandi leges, dum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pia
cura manet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It resteth now that if we doo minde to be the
naturall Children of so wise fore Fathers, the
obedient Subiects of moste worthy Rulers, the
obseruers of moste godly and wholsome lawes:
<pb facs="tcp:19933:7"/>
that like to our ancestors we doo carefully and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedyently
in all dutifulnes liue after their race
and dispose our selues after their examples: for
if we doo once yeeld to the breach therof, then be
assured, the destruction of our selues, the decay
of our posteritie, and vtter ruin of our common
welth wil shortly and immediatly folow.</p>
            <p>For no longer shall our life be in safetie: then
we doo dutifully obey the Prince and obediently
obserue the lawes.</p>
            <p>The olde and ancient Fathers in the former
ages, were so straight in this poynt, that they
would in no wise commit the least breach of any
law. For Chilo the Lacedemonian, was of the
oppinion, that the common welth could no longer
endure then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lawes were firmely obserued.</p>
            <p>Heraclitus of Ephesus saith, that Citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
are more bounden to fight for defence of their
lawes: then for keeping of their walles, for with
out walles the Cittie might stand, but without
lawes it could not continew, and yet bothe are to
be defended.</p>
            <p>Archidamus saith, that in all wel gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welths: all degrees and estates of peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19933:7"/>
are like obedient to the order of the lawes as
wel the magistrat: as the inferior, &amp; the King:
as the Subiect. Saint Paule saith, that he is not
the iust man, which onely knoweth the lawes: <hi>Sed
qui factis legem exprimit</hi> which liuing vnder the law
dooth obey and keep the same. And surely if
we English men would doo the like, and folow
the steps of such common welths, as whose states
continued so long as they kept their lawes, and
also consider how this Realme hetherto, by that
meanes hath been and is preserued: we shall not
need to feare of our estate, dout of our fall, or
mistrust of our decay. No forain inuations shall
preuail against vs, nor yet intestine seditions be
able to anoy vs, for such is the nature of the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lements,
that all mischeefs, inconueniences and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
are foreseen: and all good orders deuised as
befor the common and publique weale, no man of
what estate so euer he be: can go awry or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
his commission, but is vnder the order of
that assembly, and of such ordinaunces as by the
same are to be deuised. For the King him self
although he be the cheefest ruler, yet by the laws
of this realme, he cannot establish order or make
<pb facs="tcp:19933:8"/>
any law: but onely in Parlement, and with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
and conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all the estates and sages of the
same, which law being kept, how can he with ti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranny
oppresse his people, or with exactions ran
sack and spoile his commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? If the noble man can
be no farther allowed, then to do and speak that
which shalbe liking to the King and his whole
Parlement: what wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs or iniuries can he offer
or minister? If no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be a knight of the
Parlement, vnlesse he be <hi>Cinctus gladio:</hi> that is to
say, wise, prudent, expert and politick in marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
affaires: what warres can aduisedly or rashly
be taken in hand? if no man can be a Citizen or a
Burgesse ther, vnlesse he be ancient, wise, graue
and resiant in the place for whiche he is chosen:
what euil lawes can passe and be concluded? yea
what things amisse in any parte of the Realme,
shall not vpon diclosing, foorthwith and spedely
be redressed?</p>
            <p>If Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wise and ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t senators ought to
haue place in Parlement: what shall the rash and
yung cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellers of Rohoboha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do ther? If Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by the aduise of such ancient elders of Israel
as were wise, valea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, dealed truely, feared God,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19933:8"/>
and hated couetousnes, did direct the people in
iudgement and gouern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in iustice: what shall
children, yungmen, and such as neither fear god
nor hate iniquitie, which are of no experience or
knowledge: sit in Senate of the wise, and giue
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t emong the graue and learned? Finally
if the olde Senators and wise Fathers, ought
there to sit in ancient order and in graue maner:
what place is there for punies, rash heddes and
yung men, who hauing no learning, and lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
are caried away (as a fether with the
winde) with euery light toy, making no account
nor hauing any regarde at all to the publique
weale?</p>
            <p>And surely that our Parlements should be
kept in such order: the good ancient Kings of
this realme with great aduise did so ordain, and
great penalties are prescribed, and punishments
appointed against such as shalbe remisse in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing,
or guiltie in the breach therof. If we
therfore, for whose safetie and preseruation so
good and wholsome lawes, which haue been made
and heertofore obserued, should degenerate
from our forefathers, and be remisse or carelesse
<pb facs="tcp:19933:9"/>
in the keeping of the same: let vs be assured that
as we shall right worthely, so shall we assuredly
feel the smart therof to the vtter destruction of
our selues, the subuertion of the common welth,
and decay of our posteritie, for so hath it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and be fallen to all the estates, kingdomes
Realmes, Citties and common welths, of all
the world, whose destruction and decay began
with the contempt and decay of their lawes and
orders.</p>
            <p>Where is the wel gouerned estate of the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theniences?
What is become of the noble estate of
the Romains? What is become of the prudent go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernment
of the Ephoros in Sparta? Nay what
is become of the Israelits the chosen people of
God? are not they driuen out of their owne land,
and become vagabo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds through the whole world?
are not they so lothesome that all sorts of people
doo in a manner shun and abhorre them? It is an
olde saying: <hi>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum,</hi>
happy is he that can beware by an other mannes
harme. Wel, if their be any feare of God in vs,
if any zeale to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, any care of our
posteritie, or account of our owne safetie: let vs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19933:9"/>
haue an ernest regarde to the preseruation of
that which is the preseruation of vs, Let vs keep
that which keepeth vs, maintain that which main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taineth
vs, and defend that whiche defendeth vs.
Let vs preuent and beware that in choice of the
Knights, Citizens and Burgesses: none be cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen
which are straungers to the common welth,
yung of yeeres, weke of discretion, and timerose
to speak: but such as are graue, wise, ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and
expert, fearing God, dealing truely, according
to the ancient orders, lawdable customes and
prescribed lawes of this Realme.</p>
            <p>And for asmuch as the orders, vsages and
customs of the Parlements of this Realme, are
for the most part, and to most men hidden and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
and yet moste expedient and necessary,
that none should be ignoraunt of them: I haue
thought good vpon considerations to make a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of them, and finding some alteration
and varietie of the Parlements in these dayes,
from them which were vsed in the elder dayes:
I haue made the discription bothe of the one and
of thother.</p>
            <p>The first and ancientest orders I haue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
<pb facs="tcp:19933:10"/>
out of an olde, and an ancient Lattin Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
which I haue of the Parleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts kept in the
time of King Edward the Sonne of King E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theldred,
named Edward the confessor, about the
yeer of our Lord. 1046, which were duely for
many yeeres before and after his dayes kept
and obserued.</p>
            <p>The others are of mine owne deuise and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
according to that which I saw and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at the Parlement holden at Westminster, in
the xiij. yeer of the reign of Queene Elizabeth,
Anno. 1571. at which I was present, being one
(though vnworthy) of the said house and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
I haue bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the more willing to set the same
foorth: because I knowe it moste necessary and
needful to be knowen, and that it toucheth the
whole estate and common wealth of this Realme
very neer. For if the Rulers and gouernours of
Citties and townes, doo not more carefully look
to the choice of their Citizens and Burgesses:
their states may paraduenture be in daunger to
be shaken, and their gouernments be in peril to
perish.</p>
            <p>And as for zeale and good wil to the whole
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19933:10"/>
common welth, and my natiue Contrey, I haue
taken this little trauail: so of bounden deutie, I
haue thought good to offer and prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the same
vnto you, partely that a Legiar &amp; memoriall of
so worthy and necessary a matter: might remain
and be emong your Records, for the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of your selues, and all others which shal
repair vnto you for the same. But cheefly to
yeeld my self vnto you moste humble and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for your good wil and tender affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, for albeit you had the choice of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
wise men, which (for their grauitie, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and knowledge farre exceeding me) were
more fit to haue supplyed a place in that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
assembly: yet you of a good wil conceiuing
the best, made choice of me preferring me before
the wise, and ioyning me with the discreet, and
although by meanes of sicknes, the vse of my
speech not seruing, I could not speak my minde
in that pluce, as of duety and conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I ought
and would haue doon: yet in such credit of that
assembly I was, that by a whole and a generall
concent of the Parleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: I was eftsoones chosen
to be a Comitte in sundry matters of charge and
<pb facs="tcp:19933:11"/>
importaunce, and they with whome I was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
although they were personages of much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and great experience: yet such credit they
gaue to my words and so allowed of my sayings:
that with good allowance they relyed vnto the
same. Whatsoeuer credit or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to me heerby, I doo, must and wil, wholly im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute
it vnto you. And therfore as one bounden
vnto you, and altogither dedicated to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and commaundement: I doo offer this my
simple and rude collection vnto your worships,
praying and beseeching you not to haue respect
to the simplicitie, rudenes and sclendernes of the
matter offred: but to the good wil of the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
            <p>I haue before this attempted and begun to
to draw and make a discourse, of the antiquitie,
estate and gouernment of this Cittie, thinking
when I began: I should long ere this haue absol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
the same, and haue offred it vnto you. But in
the middle of my trauails, beeing by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
called to folow the weightie affaires of the
right worshipful, Sir Peeter Carew knight, in
Ireland: I was cut of and dissapointed, sithens
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19933:11"/>
beeing returned, I haue for the moste part been
so ouer charged with sicknes, and mine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
haue been and are so distempered: as that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
and power haue not yet serued to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the absoluing of that, whiche my good wil
and ernest desire wissheth.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, hauing perused the discrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Cittie, which was of mine owne col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection:
I haue vpon the sight of more matter en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>larged,
augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and brought the same to such
a perfection, as for the time and matter suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
The imperfections (if any be) I wil heer
after as occasion shall serue: supply and amend,
in the meane time, hauing ioyned the same vnto
this, and thinking it moste meet to be offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you: I doo moste humbly pray you, accept the
same in good parte.</p>
            <p>The Lord God from whome commeth what
so euer is good, and who directeth the councels
of the Iust, and prospereth the diuices of the
godly: send his holy spirit vpon you, that you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

iust Iudgements, and in all trueth, equitie and

wunt and ought to be, and the Kings good aduise yet not to be

                     <p>Also the king ought to graunt, permit, and allow to all and

                     <p>Also the King in person ought to be present in the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

that is to say, the first day when the whole estates according to

day of the Parlement. On the second day when the Speaker
of the common house is presented, which is counted the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Parlement. And the third day which is the last day
when the Parlement is proroged or dissolued, for vpon these
dayes: he must be present, vnlesse in cace of sicknes, or absence
out of the Realme, for in these caces: the King may summon his

                     <p>But in the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses: are represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted

the Parlement: without speciall leaue obteyned of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the house, and the same his licence be also recorded.</p>
                     <p>Also no person béeing not of the Parlement house: ought to
come into the same, during the time of the sitting, so euery one
comming into the same: oweth a dutie and a reuerence to be
giuen when he entreth and commeth in.</p>
                     <p>If a Baron or a Lord come and enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higher house:
he ought to doo his obeysaunce before the cloth of estate, and so
to take his place.</p>
                     <p>Also when he speaketh: he must stand bare headed, and
speake his minde plainly, sensibly, and in decent order.</p>
                     <p>If any come in message or be sent for to the higher house: they
must stay at the inner door vntil they be called in, &amp; then béeing
entred: must first make their obeysau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which doon: to go to the
lower end of the house &amp; their to stay vntil they be called, and
béeing called: they must first make one lowe courtesie and obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and gooing forwards must in the middle way make one
other lowe curtesie, and then béeing come foorth to the Barre:
must make the third curtesie, the like must be doon at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
                     <p>Also when any Knight, Citizen, or Burgesse dooth enter and
come into the lower house, he must make his dutiful and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obeysaunce at his entry in: and then take his place. And
you shal vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that as euery such person ought to be graue,
wise and expert: so ought he to show him self in his Apparail,
for in times past: none of the councellers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Parlement came
otherwise then in his gown, and not armed nor girded with
weapon, for the Parlement house is a place for wise, graue and
good men, to consult, debate, and aduise how to make Lawes,
and orders for the common welth, and not to be armed as men
redy to fight, or to trye matters by the Swoord: and albe it the
writ for the election of the Knights, haue expresse woords to
<pb facs="tcp:19933:35"/>
choose such for Knights as be girded with the Swoord, yet it is
not ment therby that they should come and sit armed: but bee
such as be skilful in feates of Armes, and besides their good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises:
can wel serue in martiall affaires. And thus the Romain
Senators vsed, who béeing men of great knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rience
as wel in martiall affaires, as in politique causes, sat
allwaies in the Senate house, and places of councel in their
Gownes and long Robes. The like also was alwaies and hath
been the order in the Parlements of this Realme, as long as
the auncient Lawes, the olde customes, and good orders therof
were kept and obserued.</p>
                     <p>Also if any other person or persons either in message or béeing
sent for, doo come: he ought to be brought in by the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
&amp; at the first entring: must (folowing the Sergeant) make
one lowe obeysaunce, and beeing past in the middle way: must
make one other, and when he is come before the Speaker: he
must make the third, and then doo his message, the like order
he must kéep in his return. But if he doo come alone or with his
learned councel, to pleade any matter, or to answere to any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection:
he shall enter and go no farther then to the Bar within
the door, aud there to doo his thrée obeysaunces.</p>
                     <p>Also when any Bil is committed, the Committes haue not
authoritie to conclude: but onely to order, reforme, examin, and
amend the thing committed vnto them, and of their dooings
they must giue reporte to the house again, by whome the Bill
is to be considered.</p>
                     <p>Also euery Bil whiche is brought into the house: must bée
red thrée seuerall times, and vpon thrée seuerall dayes.</p>
                     <p>Also euery Bil which vpon any reading is committed and
returned again: ought to haue his thrée readings vnlesse the
Committes haue not altred the bil in any substaunce or forme,
but onely in certain woords.</p>
                     <p>Also when any Bil vpon any reading is altogither by one
concent reiected, or by voices after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third reading ouerthrown:
it ought not to be brought any more to be red during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Parlement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:19933:35"/>
Also if any man doo speak vnto a Bill and be out of his
matter: he ought to be put in remembraunce of the matter by
the Speaker onely and by none other, and be willed to come to
the matter.</p>
                     <p>Also whensoeuer any person dooth speak to any Bill: hée
ought to stand vp, and to be bare headed, and then with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
grauitte, and séemly spéech, to declare his minde. But
when so euer any Bil shalbe tryed either for allowances, or to
be reiected: then euery one ought to sit, because he is then
as a Iudge.</p>
                     <p>Also euery Knight, Citizen, and Burgesse before he doo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Parlement and take his place there: ought to bée
sworne and to take his othe, acknowledging the King to be the
supreme and onely gouernour of all the estates within his
Realme as also to renounce all forrain Potentates.</p>

moste certain, that the names which the Britons gaue were
of longest continuance, and this Cittie called by their domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by the space of xv. hundred yéeres vntil the comming of
the Saxons, the Pictes, and Scots into this Realme, whiche
was about the yéer of our Lord 450, for they as they preuailed
and conquered: did alwaies alter and chaunge the names
of all places and Townes, accounting it a great parte of their
glory and renown to giue new names of their owne deuice, or
of their owne natiue Contries, for so write y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Citties and Townes (few excepted) so of this also they chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

the Rebellion of the Cornish people, because they refused and
denyed to acknowledge him for their lawful King: did bend his

perpetuall memory to this common welth, whiles he soiorned
him self therin: repaired and new builded the Cittie and the
walles therof, whiche before with force and fire were vtterly
destroyed. And then altred and chaunged the name therof cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it after the name of the Riuer <hi>Esseterra</hi> or <hi>Exeterra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exeterra.</note> that

                     <pb facs="tcp:19933:44"/>
I finde it also in an olde written Cronicle that it is named
<hi>Exancestria</hi> or <hi>Exancestre,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre.</note> which name should séem to be so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
by the Sarons at their abode and béeing in this land, for
commonly the names which they gaue to such Townes, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Fortes as they either builded or reedified, did end in
<hi>Cestre</hi> as Chestre, as Glocestre, Lecestre, Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chester, winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,
worcestre, Oscestre, Colchestre, Cicestre, Ilcestre, Bicestre
and this Cittie of <hi>Exancestre</hi> with others, for <hi>Cair</hi> in British,
and <hi>Cestre</hi> in Saxony, is in English a Fort, Town or Castle.</p>
                  <p>This Cittie is walled round about, and so is thought was
from the begininig. It is all togither foure square, but decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
towards a roundnes, and containeth in circuite or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
xvj. hundred whole paces, after fiue foot to the pace, which
accounting one thousand paces to a Mile: is a mile and halfe
and some what more.</p>
                  <p>The scituation of it is very plesaunt and amenous, béeing
set vpon a little hil emong many hilles, the Contrie round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
béeing Mountanose and ful of hilles. It is pende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t towards
the Sowth and West partes after and in such sort, that be the
Stréets neuer so foule or filthy: yet with a shower of rain they
are clensed aad made swéet. And albeit commonly hilles are
dry: yet nature is so beneficial to this hil that it is ful of springꝭ,
and by that menes euery parte of the Cittie is furnished with
welles and Tyepittes, the commoditie wherof hath wel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péered
in sundry times of necessitie, but especially in the late
Commotion whiche was in the yéer of our Lord. 1549. for
though then the enemy by spoiling of the Pipes, wherby wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was conuayed to the fountains of the Cittie from certaine
Springs distant not a Mile from the same, did abridge them of
that water: yet moste comfortably did they inioy the welles
and Tyepittes within the walles, whiche abundantly fléeted
with waters to the satisfying of all the people therin.</p>
                  <p>There are also within this Cittie certain Fountains cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Conduits, vnto which through certain canalis or Pipes of
Lead, waters are conueyed from Springs rising out of certain
places and féelds without this Cittie, and these waters are of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19933:44"/>
moste price, the same by reason of the cariage béeing purified
and made lighter then the waters springing within the Cittie,
and by that menes more fit for the dressing of meates. Of these
Fountains one béeing of great antiquitie, and of late réedifyed,
sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in the middle of the Cittie at the méeting of foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Stréets therof, and wherof it taketh his name, beeing
called the Conduit at <hi>Quarterfoies</hi> of <hi>Carsoxe,</hi> and this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
eche parte of the Cittie a like.</p>
                  <p>At the higher parte of this Cittie, is a very olde and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Castle called by the name of <hi>Rugemont,</hi> that is to say the
red hil, taking that name of the red Earth whervpon it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
The Cite of it is eminent, and aboue bothe the Cittie
and countrie adioyning, for they doo all lye as vnder the lée ther
of. It hath a goodly prospect towards the Seas, for betwéen that
and it is no hil at all, it is strongly diched round about, and
was so builded (as is thought) by <hi>Iulius Caesar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or rather by the
Romains after him,<note place="margin">Caesar.</note> for they had their recourse to it for their
defence and refuge many yéeres.</p>
                  <p>The same also was sometimes the Palaice of such Kings,
as to whome the Kingdome of west Sex or west Saxons was
alloted vnto. After that: it was the habitation of the Earles of
Cornwall, and last of all to the Dukes of <hi>Exon,</hi> and of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,
for to those estates: the signiory of this Cittie did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
the same béeing parcel sometimes of the Earledome, but
now of the Duchie of Cornewall It. is now in meruelous ruin
and decay, not easely by force to be gotten, were it réedified and
inuironed.</p>
                  <p>At the lower end and parte of this Cittie, without the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:
fléeteth a goodly Riuer called in British <hi>Iske. Ptholomeus</hi>
by misinformation calleth it <hi>Isaca,</hi> but the olde writers name
it <hi>Esse, Exe, Exa</hi> or <hi>Excestrum,</hi> which names be yet retained.</p>
                  <p>It hath his spring or hed in a certain Moer or desert, distant
from this Cittie néer about xxiiij. miles called <hi>Exemore:</hi> it flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
into the main Seas, but by the way is increced with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Riuers, Brookes and Lakes, namely: <hi>Creedy, Collome,</hi>
and others, in it is great plenty of Salmon, Trout, Peal, dace,
<pb facs="tcp:19933:45"/>
Pike, and other fresh water Fish, whiche are had in the lesse
price for that the Seas béeing so néer: doo furnish the Cittie and
the cuntrey abundantly with sundry kindes of Sea Fish moste
delicate. The main Sea it self is not distant from the Cittie
abooue eight miles out wherof commeth an Arme seruing for
the Port of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, which sometimes as appéereth by olde and
auncient records: did flow vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles of the Cittie, where
bothe Shippes were wunt to be laden and vnladen, of all kinde
of Merchandise at a proper place appointed for the same, which
at this presents kéepeth his olde and ancient name, béeing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
the <hi>VVatergate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The decay therof happened in the yéer of our Lord. 1312.<note place="margin">Courtney</note>
by one <hi>Hugh Courtney</hi> the third of that name, and Earle of
<hi>Deuon</hi> who béeing offended and incenced against this Cittie,
his wrathful humour could not be satisfied vnlesse he might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the state of that common welth, and therfore séeing and
vnderstanding emong other commodities, the vse of the Hauen
to be one of the chéefest: did neuer quiet him self vntil he had
destroyed the same. Wherfore in the yéer of our Lord. 1313.
béeing the fifth yéer of the reign of King Edward the second, he
enterprised his pretenced deuise and mischéef.</p>
                  <p>For where as the Lady <hi>Awmerle</hi> Countesse of <hi>Deuon</hi> his
Ancestrix, had builded certain Weares vpon the Riuer of <hi>Exe,</hi>
th'one within the mannor of <hi>Exminster,</hi> béeing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> west side
of the Riuer and th'other within her manor of <hi>Topsham,</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the East side of the Riuer: leuing between the said twoo
weres, a certain aparture or open roume of thirtye foot, through
which all Botes, Shippes and Vessails without let might haue
their vsuall passage and repassage, towards and from this Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
The said Earle to abridge &amp; destroy this commoditie: did le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uye
&amp; build a new Weare in the said open place, stopping, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and quirting the same with trées, timber and Stones, in
such sort that no vessail could passe or repasse.</p>
                  <p>After him <hi>Edward Courtney</hi> Earle of <hi>Deuon</hi> and Nephew
to the said <hi>Hugh</hi> did not onely maintaine and continew the
fact of his ancester and grandfather, by dayly repairing and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19933:45"/>
defending the same: but also woorking an vtter destruction for
any passage for Shippes thencefoorth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cittie, vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to buyld certain Milles, did erect and make two other weares,
the one Sainct <hi>Iames</hi> ouerthwart the Riuer, and the other at
<hi>Lamperford,</hi> by meanes wherof, not onely the Cittie susteined
the whole losse of their haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but the whole Contrey adioyning,
for which iniuryes vpon complaints made, writs and commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions
of inquiry were sent out, &amp; the said Earles for the same
by verdict and presentment, at seuerall times found guilty, but
such was his authoritie and power: that it auailed nothing.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse the said Earle <hi>Hugh</hi> (the water course vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

within that port, at a Town of his owne called <hi>Topsham,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Cittie about thrée miles, from whence euer si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
all wares and Merchandises haue béen caryed and reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed

                  <p>And albeit the water course thus destroyed, can hardely be
restored to his olde pristinate &amp; naturall estate, for that through
long continuaunce the olde course cannot be discerned: yet now

but when that <hi>Innocencius tertius,</hi> in the yéere of our
<pb facs="tcp:19933:46"/>
Lord. 1198. had established the Article of <hi>Transubstanciation</hi>
adding the same to the <hi>Simbole,</hi> as appéereth in the <hi>Decretal,

<hi>Honorius, Anno. 1218.</hi> did not onely confirme the same: but
also decreed <hi>Reseruation,</hi> Candlelight and praying for the dead
as appéereth <hi>Decret. titulo de celebratione missarum, canon,
sane cum et sane cum creatura,</hi> by which meanes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of
Préests did not onely increace: but Churches also in all places
bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dayly to be buylded. And therfore in this Cittie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yéer of
our Lord, 1222. béeing the .vj. yéere of Henry the third, the
parish Churches therin were limitted out and augmented to
the number of xix. Churches within the Cittie and suburbes of
the same. And moste certain it is, that in times past they were
liuings competent and sufficient to maintain an Incumbent,
but that kinde of Religion now auoyded &amp; the Gospel preched:
the liuelihods are so small as not sufficient to maintain a poore
Clark or Scoller, which is the cause that so many of them dooly
vacant without Incumbents.</p>
                  <p>Besides these parish Churches,<note place="margin">Churche of Exon.</note> there was also a Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sometime of Monkes of <hi>Saint Benets</hi> order, but sithence a
Cathedrall Church béeing very fair and sumptuously buylded,
with free Stones, and the Pillers of grey Marble, standing and
scituated in the East parte of the Cittie,<note place="margin">Ethelvvol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phus.</note> which as some doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
that <hi>Etheldred</hi> the third Sonne of <hi>Echelwolphus</hi> should
first found and buyld. Some think that King <hi>Edgar</hi> did it,
trueth it is that bothe the said Kings buylded euery of them a
house of Religious persons within this Cittie,<note place="margin">Etheldred</note> but the first was
vtterly burnt and destroyed by the <hi>Danes:</hi> and th'other in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

the Sonne of King <hi>Edvvard</hi> the elder did bothe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
and buyld it, as it dooth plainly appéer in the history of the said

King besides his expences &amp; charges in building of this Church
(which at the first was but small) placed therin Munkes of <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:19933:47"/>
but also at the instance and sute of <hi>VVilliam vvareweste</hi>
then his Chaplain and after Bishop of the same Sea, did giue

giuing <hi>Plympton</hi> to the Channo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there, <hi>Brampton</hi> was
afterward annexed to the Deanry, but <hi>Saint Stephens</hi> with a
Court Baron to the same, was alwaies reserued to the Bishop
and his successors, wherby they are Barons and so Lords of the
Parlement. It was also enlarged from time to time, with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssessions,
reuenewes, buildings, riches &amp; priuileges, by Kings,
Princes, Prelates, Bishops, and sundry others, as héerafter I
shal particulerly touch &amp; declare by Gods grace at large in a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticuler
Book therof. And this one thing is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> albeit
there were néer iiij. hundred yéeres distant from the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation
to the absoluing therof: yet is so vniformely and decently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
as though it had béen buylded at one instant.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop is distinct from the Channons, bothe in house
and reuenew, his liuelihods béeing no parcel of that which doth
appertain to the Church and Channons. It was sometimes of
great large reuenewes, but the more parte therof prodigally
hath béen exhaunsed by a wastful Bishop.</p>
                  <p>The Bishop and Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons haue very fair houses which are
situated about the Church and Cemitory, and are inclosed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night, by shutting fast of certain gates, wherby they claime
them selues to be exempted from the iurisdiction of the Cittie.
In the middle therof: is a very fair Conduict or fountain, wher
into waters by certain pipes are conueyd from certain places
out of the Cittie, and the same from thence conueyed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and some of the Channons houses.</p>
                  <p>The Cittie it self is very populus, &amp; was sometimes chéef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inhabited with Clothyers or Clothworkers of brode clothes,
seruing much for the Spanish and South Countries, whiche
were of such goodnes and substaunce: as that the names of them
doo yet continew in these partyes, but now it is chéefly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Merchaunts, Kersey Clothyers &amp; of all sortes of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cers,
emong whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Merchants are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chéefest &amp; the welthiest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:19933:47"/>
The gouernment of this Cittie was sometimes by foure
Bayliffes called <hi>Prouostres,</hi> but shortly after the Conquest:
there was ordred a Senate of xxxvj, and in these latter dayes
of xxiiij. persons of the moste sober, graue and wisest Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moners
and franchised men of the same, of which number one was and
is yéerly chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be the chéefest gouernour for the yéer folowing
and is called by the name of a Maior.</p>
                  <p>This Mayor associated with the foresaid foure Bayliffes,
hath the discerning of and in all maner of actions betwixt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and partie, &amp; for which he kéepeth on euery Monday a Court
in the <hi>Guilde hall</hi> of the said Cittie, but the Bayliffes hauing
the like iurisdiction: doo according to their olde and ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
kéep the like Courts, beeing distinct from the Mayor at
all dayes and times when them best liketh, which their Court:
is called by the name of the <hi>Prouostres,</hi> Court, for <hi>Prouostres</hi>
was their first names. Thus the Maior and Bayliffes bothe
ioyntly and seuerally haue iurisdiction to discerne in causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen
partie and partie, but if the matter doo touch the Prince,
the Crown, the common peace, or the state of the Cittie and the
common welth of the same: then the same are decided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
either by the Maior and Iustices, or by the Mayor
and common Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, or by the Maior him self, or by some other
Officer or officers according to the nature or qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause
or matter. But because it requireth a large discourse to discribe
the gouernment of the common welth of this Cittie, the charge
of euery seuerall Officer, the diuersitie of officers, their seuerall
iurisdictions, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a number of other things incident to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
I doo minde héerafter by Gods grace, at large to set the
same foorth in such sort that all estates and degrées, and euery
perticuler Officer and other person within that Cittie shall
knowe his charge, Office and dutie, and what to euery of them
appertaineth.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time: let it suffise that partely through good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
and partely of a ciuil inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the people of this Cit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
as very obsequions and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Quéen and her lawes,
and haue in great reuerence and awe, their gouernours and
<pb facs="tcp:19933:48"/>
Magistrates for the time béeing. And this one thing is not so
straunge as notable, that euen from the beginning, they haue
from time to time béen careful for their common welth, &amp; moste
vigilant for the preseruation therof, which as in time of peace
they did wel rule &amp; gouerne: so also in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troublesome times and
vnquiet estates they haue moste valiantly defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded against the
incurtions and assaultes of their enemyes, as by the sundrye
Historyes it may appéer.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Aruiragus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aruiragus.</note> King of this land minding to stay the

the Emperour sent <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Duke of the Romain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye
into this Realme, either to recouer the tribute or to subdue

was so extreme, that it was feared either that the people must
