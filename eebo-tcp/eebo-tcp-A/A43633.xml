         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION</head>
            <p>WAS there ever more need than now <hi>(to prevent falſe Reports)</hi> when every Coffee-Houſe Table (inſtead of a better Carpet) is cover'd and peſter'd with falſe News?</p>
            <p>Falſe Rumours and News <hi>(the Epidemical Plague)</hi> that our Anceſtors were ſo careful to prevent, that (as the <hi>Laws Oracle, Cook.</hi> cap. 39. Inſtitut. 3. tells us, that) the Law before the Conqueſt was, That the Author and Spreader of falſe Rumours amongſt the People had his Tongue cut out, if he redeemed it not by the eſtimation of his Head. <hi>Int. Leg. Alveredi, cap.</hi> 28. If this Law had been reviv'd, <hi>Thompſon, Heraclitus</hi> and the <hi>Obſervator</hi> had much better be Tongue-ty'd.</p>
            <p>For tho Wiſe-Men and Good-Men (in a juſt ſcruple of Conſcience) ſcorn to read ſuch nauſeous Ribaldry, in Reverence to that of the Wiſe-man; (Prov. 17. 4.) <hi>A wicked Doer giveth heed to falſe Lips; and a Lyer giveth Ear to a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Tongue;</hi> knowing that the <hi>Reſettor</hi> is as bad as <hi>the Thief,</hi> and that the <hi>Ear that loves to hear</hi> (is as bad as the <hi>Tongue that loves to ſpeak)</hi> falſe News, and equally Guilty; and he that <hi>loveth,</hi> (as well) as he that <hi>maketh</hi> a Lye, is rank'd amongſt Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murtherers and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. <hi>(Rev.</hi> 22. 15.) Yet the depraved Nature of Man is <hi>(novitatis avida)</hi> greedy of hearing Tales from the very Cradle; and many Engliſhmen now, (like the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17. 21.) ſpend their time in nothing elſe, but either <hi>to tell or to hear ſome new-thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lydians</hi> puniſh'd theſe falſe News-Mongers with Death, as if a Man's Reputation was as dear to him as his Life, and the Aſſaſſinate of a Man's good Name, was accounted a Murderer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grecians and the French</hi> have but one Name or Word to ſignify the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and (his Son) the Slanderer; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Diable,</hi> or Devil; who was a Murtherer from the beginning; (that is) a Lyer, and the Father of Lyes: And to delight in <hi>hearing</hi> or <hi>reading</hi> falſe and ſcandalous News, is an <hi>Acceſſory,</hi> (which in Murder and all Aſſaſſinations) is equally <hi>puniſh'd</hi> and equally guilty with the <hi>Principal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prudent Men (tho') and Men of Courage (like a Lyon, or a right Engliſh Maſtiff) ſtalk and walk on, when little Currs bark at them, anſwering their yelping, only with Contempt: <hi>Convicia, ſi iraſcaris, tua divulgas, ſpreta ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oleſcunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus;</hi> If you ſeek to revenge Slanders, you proclaim them as your own; But if you deſpiſe them, they vaniſh of themſelves.</p>
            <p>There are but few Biſhops like Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> who was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd, that he might have made work enough for the Lawyers, if he would have ply'd their Courts with Actions, upon the Statute of <hi>Scandal. Magnat.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Preſſures that this Defendant has undergone ſince he writ the <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> (above a Year ago) are almoſt inſupportable, and enough to make his Back crack, at leaſt, enough <hi>to fright</hi> Men from writing or ſpeaking <hi>any more Naked-Truths:</hi> It was always ſo; the great Prophet of old made the ſame complaint, to ſmall purpoſe (God wot) amongſt ſome Men; (Iſa. 59. 14, 15.) <hi>Judgment is turned away backward, and Juſtice ſtandeth afar off; for Truth is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in the Street, and Equity cannot enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yea, Truth faileth,</hi> and he that departeth from Iniquity maketh himſelf a Prey; and the Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no Judgment.</p>
            <p>How has this Defendant been peſter'd within this Twelve Months? Four and twenty great Heads of Barretry preferr'd againſt him in the Crown-Office, about fifty Witneſſes ſubpoena'd to prove them, yet, ſcarce ten of them ſworn, and ſome of them that were ſubpoena'd, profeſt before they were ſubpoena'd that they knew nothing of the Matter, and yet ſubpoena'd. What? run Men down with a Noiſe? Is that ſuch Policy? or, is it Piety? And when the Defendant's Innocence appear'd, and a Verdict to that purpoſe by the Worthy Jury; yet, afterwards How was he <hi>viſited and vex'd</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical-Court of Arches, <hi>(Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London Promoter</hi> there againſt him) and for ſome of the ſame Barretry too, of which he had been honourably acquitted?</p>
            <p>And when the danger appear'd of proſecuting him in that Eccleſiaſtical-Court for Barretry (againſt the Statutes of <hi>Praemunire and Proviſors)</hi> though Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were ſworn to them, yet it was upon ſecond Thoughts adjudg'd unſafe to inſiſt upon them; and five of the Articles were laid aſide (wherewith they had <hi>long</hi> made a <hi>loud noiſe)</hi> and <hi>only five</hi> clandeſtine Marriages inſiſted upon, or Marriages without Banes (firſt publiſhed) in time of Divine-Service, (and how can that be where there is no Divine-Service) but the old Rule, <hi>Neceſſitas vincit Legem,</hi> would not paſs Currant againſt a Law of Man, though it prov'd a good Diſpenſation to Holy <hi>David</hi> againſt a Law of God: But, in all haſte ſuſpended and ſilenc'd he muſt be, <hi>(I do not know when!)</hi> whether the Eccleſiaſtical Court have <hi>Wit in their Anger,</hi> and will not do <hi>all the harm</hi> they can; or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they think there is more in <hi>Matrimony</hi> than a <hi>matter of Money;</hi> or, whether they <hi>think it hard</hi> to ſilence a Miniſter from Preaching the Goſpel, though the Regiſter's had not the nine or <hi>ten Shillings</hi> (as formerly) from the Defendant for a <hi>Blanck-Licence,</hi> whilſt ſcarce a Man in an Age is ſilenc'd for <hi>Drunkenneſs, Ignorance, Lazineſs, Fornication,</hi> or <hi>Debauchery;</hi> or, whether they reſolve to be merciful in Concluſion, or, (if that be <hi>not ſo probable)</hi> whether they ſuſpend the execution of the Suſpenſion, that the <hi>longer</hi> the blow is a <hi>heaving</hi> it may <hi>fall the heavier,</hi> I cannot tell; But they. have found the Defendant <hi>work enough</hi> this twelve-Month laſt paſt, if he had <hi>had</hi> no other work, but to fence and <hi>ward off</hi> the Blows made at him: <hi>Then</hi> ſix Proctors <hi>(they)</hi> ſwear againſt him <hi>Articles</hi> in the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> and procure the <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Supplicavit</hi> againſt him, a Writ ſeldom granted againſt any in theſe Days, (as we are told by the <hi>Compleat Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor,</hi> p. 73, 74.) He ſays, he remembers that about eight Years ago, (in the days of <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> for his Book <hi>was printed Anno. Dom.</hi> 1666.) a troubleſome malicious Prieſt ſued <hi>one</hi> (namely <hi>a Supplicavit)</hi> againſt ſome of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours, but he had not heard of any ſince; and the Parties craving it ſhould take their Corporal Oath that it is not deſired for any <hi>Malice, Hatred,</hi> or <hi>Envy</hi> to the Party (ſurely if the ſaid ſix Proctors ſwore it, they ſwore it <hi>freely, heartily</hi> and <hi>clearly!)</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94093:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beſides, tho 'tis <hi>a Writ rarely granted,</hi> yet, when it is granted it is (more) rarely granted againſt any but <hi>common Rogues,</hi> and <hi>Villains, common Barretors,</hi> and <hi>Man-Catchers;</hi> Is there greater Indignity than to be <hi>crucified</hi> amongſt <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Rogues?</hi> It has been the Lot of his Betters, (tho) the Defendant offered an <hi>Affidavit</hi> in his behalf, <hi>made</hi> before Judg <hi>Dolben,</hi> by <hi>three Worthy Citizens,</hi> and deſired (with all Humility) that as <hi>the Bench</hi> had heard <hi>of one ſide</hi> Affidavits againſt him, that they would pleaſe to leave <hi>one Ear open,</hi> to hear ſome <hi>Affidavits for him,</hi> and ſome Pleas in his <hi>Defence:</hi> intending to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute of 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 1. which if it be <hi>in force,</hi> then the Eccleſiaſtical Courts ſit not legally, nor can they be called by Names bad enough; and if that Statute be not in force, then why did the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> inſiſt upon it ſo lately at the King's-Bench Bar, and alſo Mr. <hi>Rotherham,</hi> for their Client Mr. <hi>Weald</hi> of <hi>Much-Waltham</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> about the time that the laſt Parliament ſate at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> telling the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> that he would not urge it warmly (or Words to the like Effect) becauſe he perceiv'd his Lordſhip was <hi>not prepar'd</hi> at <hi>that time</hi> to give an anſwer to that Statute; or Words to the like Effect: A <hi>moot-Caſe</hi> belike then, and a <hi>hard Caſe</hi> to bind a Man to the Good-Behaviour, or threaten him with a Jaile, when not wiſer in the conſtruction of the force of a Statute than the Lord Chief Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But <hi>nothing</hi> would be admitted to be pleaded in <hi>the Defendants Defence,</hi> but <hi>utrum horum (that is</hi> not falſe Latin, whatſoever <hi>quiſquis</hi> is.)

            <p>To prove the Declaration <hi>only one ſingle</hi> Witneſs was produced for the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, namely, one <hi>Samuel Harris,</hi> Clerk.</p>
            <p>Witneſſes ſworn on the behalf of the Defendant, were, The Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Mr. <hi>Benjamin Edgar,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ambroſe Flanner, Robert Potter, Henry Bull, Chriſtopher Hill,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Howlet;</hi> all <hi>(except that Noble Earl)</hi> Pariſhioners of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Buttolph's</hi> in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> and preſent when the Words were <hi>(pretended to be)</hi> ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Actions for Words ought to be <hi>preciſely and punctually</hi> prov'd, and <hi>all</hi> the Words <hi>together</hi> without addition or diminution; otherwiſe, as the Defendant <hi>(who pleaded his own Cauſe)</hi> told the Court, the Senſe muſt differ, except they be <hi>taken together,</hi> with the antecedent and ſubſequent Diſcourſe, in <hi>ſenſu conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> not <hi>diviſo;</hi> jointly and not ſeverally: adding, that he had a thouſand times ſaid, that, <hi>there is no God;</hi> and yet <hi>that ſaying</hi> (that looks ſo ſcandalouſly, Atheiſtically and Blaſphemouſly, taken disjointed and ſeverally from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Words) are really innocent and harmleſs, and have been ſpoken a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times by every Man, that has a thouſand times read or repeated <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his Heart, there is no God.</hi>

The ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> (Witneſs for the Plantiff) had got the Words pretty well by Heart, but yet did not ſwear them <hi>ſo roundly off,</hi> as was expected.</p>
            <p>For, (as to the firſt Words, namely, <hi>The Lord Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>is a bold daring impudent Man, for ſending ſome Heads of Divinity to all his Clergy in theſe parts:)</hi> he ſwore them thus,—namely, <hi>The Lord Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>is a bold daring impudent Man, for ſending a Printed Paper, wherein were ſome Heads of Divinity which were contrary to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Defendant again examining, and bidding him repeat the Words, He ſaid the Words were<hi>—The Lord Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>is a bold daring impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Man, for ſending ſome Heads of Divinity in a</hi> Printed Letter <hi>which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Defendant taking notice and advantage from the difference of the Expreſſions and Words, The Judg bid that ſame <hi>Harris</hi> to repeat the Words once more as he would bide by it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>Harris</hi> ſware that the Words were theſe<hi>—The Lord Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>is a bold daring impudent Man, for ſending ſome Heads of Divinity</hi> in a Paper <hi>contrary to Law.</hi>

            <p>The Words in the ſecond Count, He ſwore roundly off without any Haeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; But the Words in the third Count, he did not ſwear as they were laid in the Declaration, and yet without doubt the Declaration was made according to his ſingle Information; But it pleaſed God, he did not ſwear them off ſo roundly; for inſtead of theſe Words<hi>—I can prove his Lordſhip to be concerned in the Damnable Plot</hi> (meaning) the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> he ſwore theſe Words<hi>—I can prove his Lordſhip to be concerned in the Horrid Plot againſt my righteous Name and Perſon;</hi> and that the Words were ſpoken by the Defendant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intervenient Queſtion, all in one continued Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Yet the Counſel would gladly have inſinuated to the Gentlemen that were ſworn, That the Words ſhould not be taken <hi>together,</hi> but to <hi>make a Pauſe</hi> at Horrid Plot, as if the next Words, <hi>against my righteous Name,</hi> did not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently give the meaning, without any <hi>ſubintelligitur;</hi> for who can imagine <hi>in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſenſe</hi> that a Man means <hi>John a Stiles,</hi> when he expreſly ſays <hi>John a Nokes?</hi> or, who can imagine that a Man means a <hi>Popiſh-Plot,</hi> when he expreſly ſays, a <hi>Horrid Plot againſt my righteous Name?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And he and all the Defendants Witneſſes argeed in one thing, namely, That not any <hi>Colloquium,</hi> Diſcourſe or Mention was made of any Popiſh Plot, during the Defendants ſtay in the Company, that <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1681. being <hi>Eaſter-Monday,</hi> at the ſaid Pariſh-Meeting for the Election of Officers for the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of St. <hi>Buttolph</hi>'s in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> as their yearly cuſtom was, <hi>on every Easter-Monday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> his Teſtimony was confronted with ſix honeſt Witneſſes, ſubſtantial Men, who had no deſign upon the Defendant's Benefice of St. <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolphs,</hi> (an Appurtenance to his Rectory of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> time out of mind of Man to the contrary) But the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> could not deny, but he had a Pretenſion thereunto by a Sequeſtration granted to him by the Plantiff.</p>
            <p>And firſt Mr. <hi>Edgar</hi> told the Judg, and thoſe that were ſworn, that he was preſent all the time <hi>from first to laſt,</hi> from the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> his coming into the Room at the ſaid Pariſh-meeting where <hi>Harris</hi> found the Defendant; and gave good attention to all the Diſcourſe that paſt betwixt the Defendant and the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> all the while they were together, which was not long, the Defendant ſoon leaving the Room and departing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94093:6"/>
He was order'd to declare the whole Diſcourſe, which he did as followeth; namely, that when the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> came into the ſaid Pariſh-meeting, the fourth of <hi>April</hi> laſt, The Defendant ask'd the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> what Buſineſs he had there, or what he had to do there in his Pariſh? to whom <hi>Harris</hi> reply'd, that he had a Sequeſtration of the ſaid Benefice of St. <hi>Buttolphs</hi> from the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom the Defendant reply'd, ſaying, The Lord Biſhop is not infallible, (and that the Pope is not infallible;) for inſtance (continued the Defendant.) The Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſent a Printed Letter to every one of the Clergy in theſe parts, wherein he recommended to them the Obſervation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Forty, which Canons are diſanulled by Law; <hi>which Law</hi> if the Biſhop <hi>did not know,</hi> it was his <hi>Ignorance;</hi> but if he did know it, it was <hi>Inſolence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, The Defendant added theſe Words, <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>has a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt me, for I can prove that he was concerned in the Horrid Plot againſt my righteous Name and Reputation.</hi> In ſhort, all the Defendants Witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with Mr. <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Teſtimony, and all of them ſwore poſitively, that they were preſent during the whole Diſcourſe betwixt the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,</hi> that they all gave attention thereunto, and that they did hear and take good notice of the whole Diſcourſe that paſt at that time betwixt the <hi>Defendant</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Harris,</hi> and that the Defendant <hi>during the whole Diſcourſe, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd not theſe Words—</hi>The Lord Biſhop of <hi>London is a bold daring impudent Man;</hi> nor any mention made of any <hi>Heads of Divinity,</hi> nor theſe Words, <hi>His Lordſhip is very ignorant;</hi> nor the leaſt mention made of a Popiſh Plot by any in the Room, nor any <hi>Colloquium</hi> of the Popiſh Plot (laid) in the Declaration; but <hi>all agreed</hi> that the Defendant in a <hi>continued Diſcourſe,</hi> ſaid<hi>—I can prove his Lordſhip to be concern'd in the Horrid Plot againſt my righteous Name and Reputation;</hi> but <hi>Harris</hi> ſaid, againſt my <hi>righteous Name and Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the ſaid <hi>Harris</hi> confeſſed, that after the Defendant was gone out of the ſaid Room from the ſaid Meeting, he went alone by himſelf into another Room; and writ ſomething, and brought it ſo written to ſome of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Flanner</hi> in particular, and deſired him to ſubſcribe to the ſame; (this ſpake his Malice and Deſign:) preſently after the Defendant was gone away. But the ſaid Mr. <hi>Flanner</hi> and the reſt held up their Hands (as aſtoniſh'd) and bleſt themſelves from him, ſaying, There was no ſuch Words ſpoke by the Defendant; and thereupon Mr. <hi>Flanner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edgar</hi> writ down the Words (as aforeſaid) which were ſpoken, thinking the Man had ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt the Defendant to do him a Miſchief, as it appears ſince, too true; and therefore they could not but remember the whole Diſcourſe as well as he: at leaſt, all could tell there was no ſuch Words ſpoken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preacher</hi> was a <hi>Prophet</hi> when he preach'd of the <hi>Horrid Sin</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catching;</hi> It was <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s-way to get <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, and his Life to boot; 'tis often <hi>fatal to have a Vineyard</hi> that other Men <hi>covet,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 15. <hi>And it came to paſs, when</hi> Jezabel <hi>heard that</hi> Naboth <hi>was dead, that</hi> Jezabel <hi>ſaid to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, <hi>Ariſe, take poſſeſſion of the Vineyard of</hi> Naboth <hi>the</hi> Jezreelite, <hi>which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give thee for Money, for</hi> Naboth <hi>is not alive but dead.</hi> (Cunning Harlot!)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it came to paſs when</hi> Ahab <hi>heard that</hi> Naboth <hi>was dead, that</hi> Ahab <hi>roſe up to go down to the Vineyard of</hi> Naboth <hi>the</hi> Jezreellite, <hi>to take poſſeſſion of it.</hi> (But this is a Parentheſis.)</p>
            <p>It was good ſport to the By-ſtanders, to hear how the <hi>glib-toung'd Counſel</hi> did lay on Tongue againſt the Defendant, and to improve their <hi>little-Evidence-Man:</hi> They did earn their Guinies, to give them their due.</p>

            <p>But to go on with the famous Trial, ſome Men are bound to the Good-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, (as the Defendant told Sir <hi>George Jeffries,</hi> in the midſt of his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,) wiſhing that <hi>his Tongue alſo</hi> was as faſt ty'd and bound to the Good-Behaviour, as is the Defendants: And withal, told the Gentlemen that were ſworn, that the <hi>leſs heed</hi> was to be given to Sir <hi>George's Words,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>not a Man of his Word;</hi> for that Sir <hi>George</hi> had promis'd the laſt Aſſizes at <hi>Brentwood</hi> (a Year and half ago,) that he would never be retain'd <hi>(nor plead) againſt the Defendant,</hi> tho any Man ſhould give him an hundred Guinies; no, not againſt <hi>Curſe ye Meroz.—</hi>

But Good Sir <hi>George Jeffries</hi> (that never before had told a Lye at the Bar) if you'll believe him, or any Hackney Breath-ſellers, they come not for the ſake of the Guinies, but purely in Devotion to Juſtice, and love to their Clyent and his Cauſe, tho <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> who comes firſt to retain them <hi>(right or wrong,)</hi> Tongue waggs <hi>in the Cauſe,</hi> if it be retain'd, and if the <hi>Angel appear,</hi> then the <hi>A—opens his Mouth,</hi> (a very pretty World) nay, many of them do not read their Breviats 'till the Cauſe be call'd, and then with two Eyes, in all haſte, they are buſy to ſpy out Vantages; (poor Clients are well help'd up, and what with an ignorant Jury, or a <hi>Pick'd-Jury</hi> for that very purpoſe, (as this was by Order of the Court of King's-Bench, the laſt day of the laſt Term, upon the Motion of Sir <hi>Francis Withins,</hi> juſt ſuch another Man.) <hi>Poor Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> have a fine time on't, to go to Law as Tinkers mend Kettles, to remedy <hi>one hole</hi> in their Eſtate, they <hi>make two;</hi> is not this Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe?) What? <hi>do you think a Lawyer will tell a Lye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Good Knight, Sir <hi>George Jeffries,</hi> told a Whisker at this time, when the ſaid Black-Coats ſwore ſo heartily, in Vindication of <hi>Harris</hi> his Reputation; <note place="margin">☞</note> One Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſwore he had known <hi>Harris</hi> a Twelve-month and more, and <hi>He never knew any ill by him;</hi> ſo ſwore one Mr. <hi>Kiddier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> (I think his Name was) of <hi>London,</hi> and ſo ſwore alſo one <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and one <hi>Shelton,</hi> two <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Look you (my Lord) quoth Sir <hi>George,</hi> here are Clergy-Men ſwear to the Reputation of the Witneſs for the Biſhop, Clergy-Men that here come <hi>by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and ſpying them in Court, we make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Defendant ask'd the ſaid <hi>Colcheſter-Ministers, Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Shelton,</hi> whether Sir <hi>George</hi> was a Man to be believ'd herein, or a Man of his Word, when he ſaid theſe Clergy-Men came <hi>by accident, &amp;c.</hi> Speak (Sirs) you are upon your Oaths, <hi>Did you come by accident, or for ſet purpoſe ſubpoena'd</hi> to give this Teſtimony? They anſwered (for they durſt not do no other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly ſubpoena'd) That <hi>they came on purpoſe, being ſubpoena'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, (Good Sir <hi>George)</hi> retorted the Defendant, <hi>Where is your Veracity,</hi> your Truth good Sir <hi>George?</hi> But Sir <hi>George</hi> ſat down very angerly, his Mouth was <hi>ſtop'd for once,</hi> (Is it not a Wonder!) and the good Gentleman was <hi>ſilenc'd,</hi> his <hi>Welſh-Blood</hi> flying into his Face, and anſwering for him only with a <hi>Bluſh:</hi> Nay, <hi>'tis well he had the Grace to Bluſh,</hi> he is not much given to it; but this was put upon him from his own Witneſſes, the <hi>ſaid Black-Coats,</hi> who had <hi>all of them more cauſe</hi> to bluſh, than Sir <hi>George,</hi> but they bluſh'd no more than a Black-D—Nay, I'll truſt ſuch Black-Coats with an Oath, as ſoon as poorer Men, if there be a Biſhop in the caſe, and hopes of Favour and Preferment; what? Can any Man think they will not <hi>stretch it</hi> for a Biſhop, when (one ſays) they will ride down Sun and Moon for a Benefice, a Prebendary, or a Dignity.</p>
            <p>The Men were true Sons of the Church, and knew the virtue of the Oath of Canonical Obedience; but unhappily the Defendant ſnap'd them with one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Queſtion, and made them all <hi>ſwear</hi> (in effect) <hi>Tongue thou liest;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelves and one another, and all upon Oath too.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion put to every one of theſe Clergy-men (who ſwore <hi>ſo thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch</hi> to <hi>Harris his Reputation)</hi> was this; namely, <hi>Is it not an ill thing in a Clergy-Man, and a Vicar (who is ſworn to perpetual Reſidence in his Pariſh) to be Non-Reſident for three quarters of a Year, minding only the</hi> Fleece <hi>but not the Flock?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gravell'd them, for they knew the danger of Perjury, and knew not well how to avoid it.</p>

And therefore <hi>Powel</hi> being firſt ask'd the Queſtion (and the reſt of them after him, one after another) <hi>was at a ſtand,</hi> and knew not what to ſay.</p>

               <hi>Let's have no Pumping,</hi> no Pumping, I beſeech you good Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> anſwer directly, <hi>(ſaid the Defendant.)

But (ſays Mr. <hi>Powel)</hi> there has been ſome Differences and Contentions about the Pariſhes of St. <hi>Buttolphs</hi> and St. <hi>Leonard's</hi> in <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> which the Biſhop gave to Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> by Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But (replyed the Defendant.) <hi>What is that to</hi> Fingringhoe, to which Vicaridge <hi>Harris</hi> is Inſtituted, and <hi>Inducted to your knowledg,</hi> for you were preſent at his Induction, and ſo was <hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Shelton,</hi> the other Witneſſes; which all of them confeſt, (for they could not avoid it by any Evaſion or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation) only ſaid, there was no Vicarage-Houſe at <hi>Fingringhoe;</hi> to whom the Defendant retorted, That it might be a good excuſe for not reſiding upon his Vicarage, if he reſided in any other Houſe of the Pariſh; but what is that to his leaving his Flock <hi>at the diſtance of fourty Miles,</hi> namely, at <hi>London,</hi> and taking upon him another Cure and Charge, (as Curate under Mr. <hi>Grove?)</hi> and leaving none to ſupply the place for three quarters of a Year, nor four Sermons from <hi>Mid-ſummer</hi> to <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> and thoſe preach'd by a <hi>quondam Logg-river,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Sills,</hi> Rector of <hi>Dounyland</hi> (a good Rectory) but the Man tho a Rector, never yet could, nor ever was able ſo much as to read his Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yet he that knows not how to ſupply his own Cure as he ought, muſt <hi>(for cheapneſs)</hi> mumble (to boot) a little for <hi>this prime and ſingle Epiſcopal-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> (good doings the while!)

                           <p>For indeed <hi>William Compton</hi> (this Biſhop's Grand-Father) was the firſt of the <hi>Compton</hi>'s that ever was an <hi>Earl</hi> ſince <hi>Adam:</hi> And King <hi>James</hi> created him Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> (I could tell the Reader <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>for what too) Anno Dom.</hi> 1618. <note place="margin">☞</note> There are thouſands alive that remember the Buſineſs.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>In which Paper the Biſhop recommended to the Clergy the Obſervation of the 65. 66. and 3. Canons or Conſtitutions of Forty; (which the Defendant ſaid again in open Court were ſo far from being <hi>according to Law,</hi> that it was <hi>Non-ſence,</hi> foraſmuch as the Conſtitutions of Forty, have not 65 nor 66 Canons, nor above eleven, and therefore <hi>it was</hi> Inſolence or Impudence, to lay upon the Clergy Burdens not to be born, and Duties impoſſible to be obſerv'd; foraſmuch as it is Non-ſence to bid them obſerve the 65 and 66 Canons and <hi>3d</hi> of the Conſtitutions of Forty; there is not ſo many, and yet <hi>there is enow of thoſe Lambeth-Canons,</hi> which (the Defendant ſaid) do ſeem to have a mark of Non-allowance by the 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. 12. For if the Words of that Statute leave thoſe Canons of 1640, only juſt <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> then the mentioning the<hi>—not confirming them, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſaid Statute, ſignifies nothing at all; for <hi>ſo</hi> thoſe Canons would have been <hi>(in ſtatu quo)</hi> altho that Statute had never been made; which Law, the Defendant ſaid, if the Biſhop knew not, it was his Ignorance; if he did know it, it was Inſolence to oppoſe his Sence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that of the King and Parliament; and to impoſe impoſſibilities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Clergy.</p>
                           <p>And <hi>this Defendant</hi> confeſſed again, that thoſe Words he did ſay, and if the Biſhop be aggriev'd thereat, he is at Liberty <hi>(if he have not enough of this)</hi> to bring another Action of <hi>Scandal.

But this muſt be ſaid for Sir <hi>Thomas Exton,</hi> he did <hi>his good Will,</hi> and no doubt but he will reap the Thanks for the ſame, and perhaps be the better for the Defendants Money (when they can catch it) but no Juſuite could equivocate more than Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did, when he firſt gave his Evidence againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon Oath.</p>
                           <p>For he had the Words<hi>—Ignorance—</hi>and <hi>Impudence—</hi>ſpoken of the Biſhop; (which come <hi>pretty near</hi> to thoſe Words in the Declaration<hi>—Impudent Man—</hi>and <hi>Ignorant Man—</hi>but being <hi>not the ſame,</hi> could not affect, nor <hi>ought not</hi> to affect the <hi>Jury</hi> (as the <hi>Judge</hi> honeſtly told them, and leſs he could not ſay) as to the proof of the Declaration; for the all, the ſtreſs, and weight <hi>of that,</hi> lay <hi>ſolely and ſingly</hi> upon little <hi>Harris</hi> his Evidence.</p>
                           <p>And for that cauſe, The Defendant neglected Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Evidence, as <hi>impertinent</hi> to the matter in hand; but I thank you,<hi>—Latet Anguis in Herbâ.</hi>

his ſingle Reputation) and that tho <hi>Non-reſidence be an ill thing,</hi> and that is prov'd upon him, and cannot be denied; yet a Man may be a good Witneſs, tho he do tranſgreſs a Statute; none of us (ſaid he) but do tranſgreſs a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſome time or other.

            <p>This is certain, the Plot was to inveigle the Defendant into the belief of the Verdict, which the Defendant did ſo far believe, (for neither he, nor any unbiaſs'd Men could imagine any other Verdict than <hi>for the Defendant;</hi> the Declaration being but ſtammeringly, uncertainly, variouſly, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated by the <hi>Epiſcopal Implement,</hi> little <hi>Harris;</hi> himſelf prov'd infamous by a Noble Peer, (whoſe Oath not to credit, was the greater <hi>Scandal.

            <p>The Plot was to <hi>cajole the Defendant</hi> into a good Opinion of the Privy-Verdict, that ſo ſtaying in Town, the Adverſary might ſnap him with a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ready cut and dried, to hale him to Jail. And if they had ſucceeded in that <hi>After-Game,</hi> it had been to them worth <hi>ten ſuch</hi> Verdicts; for if they had got him into <hi>Lobs-pound</hi> for ſix Months, I do not know but the <hi>Stone Doublet might have laſted him his Life-time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they were not <hi>more cunning</hi> than he was crafty; and being inform'd by his faithful Friends (that could ſee as far into a Mill-ſtone as the beſt of them) and as <hi>privy</hi> as the <hi>naſty Verdict</hi> was, they <hi>ſcented</hi> it: And thereupon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, with five more of his Friends, took Horſe, and rid for <hi>London, where he now is,</hi> giving their Wiles the <hi>Go-by,</hi> to their great Grief, and will not appear till he liſt, in <hi>good Time,</hi> and when Time ſhall ſerve.

            <p>But, (bleſſed be God,) The <hi>Man-Catchers</hi> have laid nothing <hi>(as yet)</hi> to his Charge, but Words ſpoken againſt their <hi>pretty-Courts and Prelates,</hi> and theſe <hi>wreſted (too) from their true meaning,</hi> (as ſhall be proved hereafter in the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicavit-Buſineſs.)</hi> If worthy Men, and Men of great Reputation and Renown may be credited ſo much as <hi>Harris and the ſix Proctors.</hi>

            <p>FIrſt, we will <hi>obſerve the Obſervations</hi> that have been already made of this <hi>noiſy Trial</hi> by the <hi>Tory Pamphleteers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tory Obſervator</hi> is <hi>wiſer</hi> than to trouble himſelf with diſquieting Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> or to abuſe himſelf by nicknaming others, whether out of reſpect or ſenſe of Honour, or out of fear of Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi>'s ſmarter Pen, (that never ſcratches but when Defendant) we will not determine. But <hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How now? <hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus!</hi> Will any Man of Honour <hi>ſtoop ſo low</hi> to take notice of ſuch <hi>contemptible Wretches?</hi> Wretches below all ſcorn! Wretches that would have no Name but for the <hi>Ills</hi> they do.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And (without offence be it ſpoken) it is a <hi>Condeſcenſion (meritorious)</hi> for any Man to <hi>debaſe himſelf ſo much</hi> as to take notice of ſuch deſpicable and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn <hi>Bravo's,</hi> (the Objects of every honourable and honeſt Man's <hi>Contempt)</hi> any otherwiſe, or with any other deſign than (thoſe <hi>charitable Viſits</hi> made to the Jail, when common Robbers and Murtherers are <hi>condemn'd</hi> to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) to enquire <hi>(either)</hi> after <hi>Goods</hi> (by them) <hi>ſtollen;</hi> or, by ſhewing them the Evil of their Ways, bring the <hi>condemn'd Villains to Repentance,</hi> before they be hang'd.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> where every Man <hi>pleads his own Cauſe; of which</hi> the ſame Sun that views the firſt Proceſs, ſees the End and Determination before it ſleeps in the Ocean.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>we labour</hi> with our nice Pleadings, Quirks and Tricks, Writs of Errors, Pleas, Rejoynders and Demurrers <hi>eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man was Indicted<hi>—quia furatus eſt Equum,</hi> becauſe he ſtole a Horſe, (in <hi>Holland</hi> he had dy'd for it) but with us the Indictment was quaſh'd for lack of Form, there wanted <hi>(Forſooth</hi> the Word) <hi>Felonicè;</hi> and therefore ill. 29. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>A Man was Indicted that he was <hi>communis Latro,</hi> a common Thief, and the Indictment was held vicious, becauſe too general—never coming on to the particular Proof.</p>
            <p>A Man Murder'd another, but the Indictment (by the Clerks overſight, or worſe, was only <hi>Interfecit)</hi> and was quaſh'd for want of the Word <hi>Murdravit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thouſands of Inſtances might be given of pretty Quirks and Niceties (that are now made ſuch eſſential parts of the Law) that he is accounted <hi>the Man of Law,</hi> that is moſt nimble at them, to take a Cauſe with a<hi>—Why not;</hi> Tick-Tack; as if ſome deſign had been to make the <hi>Law</hi> (like <hi>Sives</hi> and <hi>Cullenders) full of Holes for the nonce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſome may ſay then—What ſhall become of the <hi>Vermine,</hi> the <hi>Locuſts and the Catterpillars,</hi> that (like thoſe Plagues of <hi>Egypt)</hi> eat up <hi>evary green thing in the Land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How now? <hi>Is this good Behaviour?</hi> Is <hi>Sampſon</hi> bound? or bound with Withs of ſmal Cords, made on <hi>purpoſe to be broken?</hi> Explain your ſelf, who do you mean by the Vermine, the Locuſts and the Caterpillars, that eat up every green thing in the Land, and is the great plague-ſore thereof? <hi>Who do you mean?</hi> Sir.</p>
            <p>You, that are ſo blunt and ſuch a <hi>plain Dealer,</hi> do you mean thoſe <hi>Throngs</hi> about <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> and <hi>Chancery-Lane?</hi> thoſe <hi>Crouds of Pen and Inkhorns?</hi> that a Man can ſcarce ſtir there without being <hi>juſtled or run down</hi> by them or their Coaches? Speak out, who do you mean by? the <hi>Vermine of the Land,</hi> the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, and the Caterpillars?</p>
            <p>Why then, really, truly, and plainly, <hi>I call thoſe Locuſts,</hi> and Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and Vermine, that <hi>live on the Sweat</hi> of other Men's Brows, and of the <hi>ſweet Labour and Induſtry</hi> of the <hi>painful Husbandman,</hi> and Country-man, who (if they were not <hi>Fools)</hi> would agree their Quarrels over a good Fire, and a Pot of Ale, by the <hi>Men of their Neighbourhood,</hi> (for it muſt come to that <hi>at laſt,</hi> and <hi>why not</hi> as well <hi>at firſt?)</hi> before the <hi>Eſtate be waſted,</hi> time conſum'd, with <hi>Danceing Attendance to Vermine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall the <hi>Locuſts and Caterpillars do?</hi> Ask Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> who tells you in his Deſcription of the new Plantation, called <hi>Carolina,</hi> that there is good Air, room enough for the <hi>Locuſts and Caterpillars,</hi> thoſe unprofitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects and Devourers. Room enough for the <hi>He's and She's,</hi> let them go there
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94093:22"/>
and <hi>work and Engender;</hi> why <hi>ſhould not Spiders ſpin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet (with <hi>Heraclitus his good leave)</hi> the Defendant did (if it were worth the mentioning) (in his pleading this Cauſe) <hi>this Tick-tack</hi> which might as well have been kept ſecret, but that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> will not be pleaſed without it:</p>
            <p>For the Declaration is only <hi>un'Prelat.</hi> not <hi>un'Magnat.</hi> and though the Plantiff does declare as <hi>Epiſcop-Lond. and un'Prelat,</hi> yet (ſaid the Defendant,) it does not appear <hi>(by the Declaration,)</hi> that the Plantiff is <hi>un'Magnat,</hi> and therefore not within the Statute.</p>
            <p>For the Defendant ſaid further, that he had conſulted <hi>the Records of thoſe times,</hi> whereby the meaning of the Words <hi>(Biſhop and Prelate)</hi> in thoſe days, is beſt cleared; and does not find that ever by Prelates or Biſhops is meant <hi>Magnates,</hi> or <hi>le Grantz,</hi> or <hi>le Seignieurs—</hi>and therefore <hi>Scandalum Praela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum,</hi> nor <hi>Scandalum Epiſcoporum,</hi> can poſſibly by that Statute be meant <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The Proceedings and Judgment of Death againſt Sir <hi>William de Thorp,</hi> (Chief Juſtice) for <hi>Bribery,</hi> and brought into Parliament, which the King cauſed to be read <hi>Overtment devent les grantz de Parlement</hi> &amp;c. openly before the Great Men<hi>—coram Magnatibus,</hi> that could not be the Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, nor Prelates—for they were (always withdrawn) in thoſe days, out of the Houſe of Lords—in Judgments or Inqueſt <hi>upon Life and Death,</hi> as this was,—For the <hi>Chief Juſtice was hang'd for his Bribery: (right and good reaſon,—</hi>Cave, cave.)</p>
            <p>42. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Sir <hi>John de Lee,</hi> Steward of the King's Houſe, was charged in Parliament for ſeveral Miſdemeanors<hi>—Et Apres manger vindrent les Prelats, Duc's, Counts, &amp;c.</hi> After Dinner came the Prelates, Dukes, Counts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here (being but a Miſdemeanor) the Prelates were preſent, it not being in a Queſtion of Life or Death.</p>
            <p>50. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Alice Perrers</hi> was accuſed for Breach of an Ordinance, (ſo is the Record, but it was really a Statute, which in thoſe Days was called an Ordinance) <hi>Fait venir devant' les Prelats, &amp; les Seignieurs du Parlement—</hi>Which alſo was not in a Queſtion of Blood, and therefore the <hi>Prelates</hi> are nam'd, as well as the <hi>Magnates;</hi> or <hi>les Seigneurs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Inſtances of this Nature may be given, wherein Prelates were never ſignified by the words, <hi>Magnates, le Grants,</hi> or <hi>le Seignieurs,</hi> or <hi>Peers:</hi> For they are tried (as all Men ought to be by <hi>Magna Charta) per Pares,</hi> by their Peers or Equals; and being tried by their Peers, (that is) <hi>Commoners,</hi> they therefore are <hi>Commoners,</hi> not Peers of the Realm, as the other <hi>Magnates, le Seignieurs,</hi> and <hi>le Grantz—</hi>are.</p>
            <p>And therefore tho the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> be <hi>Magnas,</hi> as he is a Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and a Great Officer of the Realm; yet the <hi>Declaration not mentioning any ſuch thing,</hi> the Defendant urg'd that it was deficient: but the Judg over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd him therein.</p>
            <p>Yet 28. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Wigmore,</hi> Couſin and Heir of <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> deſires that the Attainder made 4. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. againſt the ſaid <hi>Mortimer,</hi> might be examin'd: <hi>Et dont le dit Seignieur le Roy vous charge Counts, Barons, les Piers de ſon Royalme,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord the King charged the Counts, Barons, and Peers of his Realm, to examine the ſaid Attainder, and give righteous Judgment.</p>
            <p>But if the Prelates were meant <hi>by Counts, Barons</hi> and <hi>Peers,</hi> then they alſo were to examine the Attainder by that Command of the King: But they had nothing to do with Attainders, it being againſt their own <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94093:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience,</hi> as they afterwards declared in another Caſe, to be ſeen in the <hi>Rolls of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. In a Parliament called for <hi>Breach of the Peace</hi> of the Kingdom, <hi>away went</hi> the Prelates out of the Parliament, ſaying, What had they to do with ſuch Matters? <hi>Et les dits Counts, Borones, &amp; autres Grants, per eus meſmes—</hi>And the Counts, Barons, and other great Men, went by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to conſult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in the ſame Parliament, upon Judgment given againſt Sir <hi>John Grey,</hi> for laying his hand on his Sword in the King's Preſence, for which he was queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd for his Life, (no Biſhops nor Prelates being there therefore) yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſays,<hi>—Le Roy charge touts le Countes, Barons, &amp; autre Grantz—</hi>The King charges all the Counts, Barons, and other Great-Men, to conſult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then he muſt charge the Prelates too, if he charged all the Great Men, if the Prelates be <hi>Magnates,</hi> or <hi>les Grantz—</hi>which could not be in a Queſtion of Blood.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Biſhops are a <hi>kind of Barons,</hi> and ſo <hi>were the Abbots and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,</hi> by virtue of the Baronies beſtowed upon them by the <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>blind Devotion</hi> (or for what other reaſon) by <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who divided his Conqueſts all over <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Knights-Fees;</hi> and of ſeveral <hi>Knights-Fees</hi> (laid together) he made <hi>Baronies:</hi> And ſome of theſe <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> the Lay-men got, but the Clergy (in the Scuffle and Scramble put in <hi>(never fear it)</hi> for a Share) and got proportionably, and more; ſome <hi>Lord-Biſhops</hi> got, and ſome <hi>Lord-Abbots</hi> got, and ſome <hi>Priors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By virtue of which <hi>Baronies</hi> they had Votes and Places in the Houſe of Lords. But one Houſe being not able to hold ſo many Lords, the King di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides his <hi>Baronies</hi> into <hi>Majores &amp; Minores;</hi> the <hi>Minors</hi> he tript off, but the Biſhops, Abbots, and Priors held it faſt till <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and then the <hi>Lord-Abots</hi> and <hi>Priors</hi> tripp'd off, (this was a <hi>ſore Shock to the Prelacy)</hi> and only the Biſhops (of all the Prelates in 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2.) hold it to this Day. And who Parliaments (as at <hi>Bury St. Edmonds,</hi> and alſo as aforeſaid 2. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.) have been held without the Prelates; and tho it is declared (before the Diſſolution of the Monaſteries, the <hi>major Part</hi> of the Prelates) in 7. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in <hi>Keil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>'s Reports, p. 184. Dr. <hi>Standiſhes</hi> Caſe. <hi>Les Juſtices de ſoi ent que noſtre Seigneur le Roy poit aſſer bien tener ſon Parlement per luy, &amp; ſes temporal Seignieurs, &amp; per ſes Commons tout ſans les ſpirituals Seignieurs:</hi> That our Lord the King <hi>may well hold his Parliament</hi> by Himſelf, and his Temporal Lords, and by his Commons, <hi>without the Spiritual Lords,</hi> &amp;c. Yet (by virtue of their <hi>Baronies)</hi> they have Right to ſit in the Houſe of Peers, tho their <hi>Brethren-Prelates (Abbots and Priors)</hi> be outed, and the Privilege of Sitting in the Houſe of Lords does not now continue <hi>(de facto)</hi> to thoſe Gentlemen that now enjoy <hi>thoſe Baronies which the Abbots had,</hi> with all their Privileges and Immunities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which Privileges and <hi>Immunities,</hi> &amp;c. this was one, <hi>to ſit in the Houſe of Peers,</hi> and granted and regranted, in the ſame manner the Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> held <hi>theſe Baronies.</hi> But I do not know <hi>de Jure,</hi> how far this Immunity does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor is it my Province to argue it, tho I am poſſeſſed of the Barony of the Priory of <hi>Wickes</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to me and my Heirs, with all the Immunities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore one would think I might claim the Privilege of a Prelate, out of that old Statute, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. that hath cauſed all this Debate and Debait.</p>
            <p>Nay, all Clergy-men (that are Rectors) are Prelates; ſo <hi>Lyndwood,</hi> a <hi>Doctors-Commons Official,</hi> in his <hi>Provincials. Con.

tho <hi>little.—</hi>A hundred Inſtances I could give, that all Clergy-men that are Rectors are Prelates.</p>
            <p>Now if the ſpeaking againſt any Prelate who is not <hi>Magnas,</hi> (nor ſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Declaration, (as here it is not mentioned that the Plantiff is <hi>Magnas)</hi> and if in the Language and Dialect of thoſe Times, the Word <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> does not imply <hi>Magnates,</hi> or <hi>les Grants,)</hi> then ſurely <hi>all Prelates,</hi> and all that have the Fee-ſimple of thoſe Lands and <hi>Baronies,</hi> granted to the King, and his Heirs and Aſſigns, by Act of Parliament, and given and regranted to others, together with all the Immunities and Privileges that the <hi>Abbots had and enjoyed by virtue of thoſe Lands and Baronies,</hi> &amp;c. ought to have the Benefit of this Statute of <hi>Scandal.

            <p>For, if the Biſhops ſit not in the Houſe of Lords purely <hi>ex Gratia Regis,</hi> but <hi>quâ Barones,</hi> by reaſon of their Baronies, then <hi>è fortiori,</hi> much more may thoſe Gentlemen that have the Abbot's Baronies, and other Prelate's Baronies, claim the old Privileges belonging to their Baronies, and for which and other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities they have an Act of Parliament to them and their Heirs: Since Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have not <hi>ſo firm a Tenure</hi> of their Baronies, and the Privileges, Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, and Immunities thereunto belonging, becauſe they hold them ex <hi>Gratiâ Regis,</hi> and for Contempt may lawfully be forfeited, and ſeized into the King's Hands: But the Baronies of Us that hold them in <hi>Fee-ſimple,</hi> and by Act of Parliament, (with the Immunities and Privileges anciently belonging to the <hi>Abbot-Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Prior-Prelates)</hi> cannot for ſuch Contempt, <hi>ad libitum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> be ſo forfeited or ſeized.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſince many <hi>Rectors</hi> in <hi>England</hi> have <hi>Baronies</hi> annex'd to their Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and their <hi>Parſonage-Houſe</hi> is the <hi>Manor-Houſe,</hi> where Court Barons are kept to this day, and the Tenants <hi>do their Homage and Fealty,</hi> and they are really and truly <hi>Prelates,</hi> I ſee no Reaſon in Law or Equity, but they may have the Benefit of this Statute of 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. of <hi>Scandal.

            </p>
            <p>And none can give a Reaſon, why this Defendant ſhould not alſo have the Privilege of a Prelate, which his Predeceſſors had, (the Abbots of <hi>Wicks)</hi> when this Statute was made, whoſe Succeſſor is this Defendant in the Barony, and to him and his Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>Nay, really, <hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> I believe the Defendant is in earneſt, ſince ſo much Money as 2000<hi>l.</hi> may be <hi>ceined out of old Statutes;</hi> there are <hi>London</hi> Juries, and <hi>Middleſex</hi> Juries, as well as <hi>Eſſex</hi> Juries—Look to't.</p>

            <p>Not ſuch Barons as the Temporal Lords, who cannot forfeit them to the King, nor the King cannot ſeize them for Contempt, as aforeſaid; therefore there is a vaſt difference betwixt a Baron who is a <hi>Peer of the Realm,</hi> and a <hi>Spiritual Baron;</hi> the one is <hi>Magnas natus,</hi> born a Peer, and ſits in the Houſe of Lords, as his Birth-right and Inheritance; the other is <hi>Greatus,</hi> and ſits <hi>ex Gratiâ Regis,</hi> and may, upon the King's Diſpleaſure, or Contempt, loſe his Seat near the Wool-Packs, and his Baronies and Temporalities forfeited into the King's Hands.</p>

            <p>Nay, I am told, from a very good Hand, that the good Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in great piety and devotion, intends to dedicate (this 2000 <hi>l.)</hi> to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for a <hi>Deodand;</hi> and build up <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Ruins</hi> here in <hi>London</hi> with the Defendant's 2000 <hi>l.

            <p>But yet, the greateſt glory of this Atchievement, does belong to <hi>Inch-board Harris,</hi> that <hi>ſmall Heroe</hi> muſt come in to the <hi>Meeter</hi> and Merits, the one half of the 2000 <hi>l.</hi> he earn'd it dear, and ſwore hard for it, he has more right to it than any Man alive, except the <hi>Jury-Men;</hi> for the <hi>Judg</hi> (upon the whole Matter, with ſome grains of Allowance to humane Frailty and Temptation) was <hi>there</hi> or <hi>thereabouts,</hi> at leaſt, he was the beſt of them; a Judg ſwears to have no reſpect of Perſons in Judgment, (Oh hard! hard!)</p>

               <hi>Rob.

            </p>
            <p>This is a <hi>true, good,</hi> and <hi>honeſt Deſcription of Hereſy;</hi> and if ſo, for God's ſake tell me true: If <hi>Prelacy</hi> be <hi>contrary to Scripture,</hi> contrary to the holy Commands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in plain <hi>(not doubtful)</hi> Words; and if Men <hi>ſtifly</hi> maintain it, and <hi>openly</hi> defend it, (with Actions, Statutes, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions, Silencings, Curſes, Anathema's, Excommunications and Jails) for God's ſake who is the Heretick now?</p>
            <p>Tell not me of Statutes, they are void <hi>ipſo facto</hi> as ſoon as made, if they be contrary to the Statutes of God and Chriſt, ſaith the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> the Oracle of the Law, who (tho a <hi>Lawyer)</hi> was not aſham'd to be a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Away with Hypocriſy and Cheat! <hi>It ſhall,</hi> it ſhall tumble down, and fall on the Heads, and cruſh all that ſhoulder it up, and endeavour to ſupport it: <hi>It ſhall,</hi> I <hi>ſay;</hi> I cannot tell you when, but it ſhall <hi>in due Time;</hi> they on whom this Stone ſhall fall, it ſhall grind them to Pouder.

            </p>
            <p>It is an infallible Truth, That not only what is contrary to God, and the Sence and Meaning of his holy Goſpel, ſhall <hi>come to naught;</hi> but alſo what is contrary to the Sence and Meaning, and Deſires of the <hi>greatest Part of the Nation,</hi> muſt tumble down, eſpecially when it has no Foundation of Truth or Honeſty, but ſtands upon frail and rotten Crotches: the next Puff, or <hi>great Wind,—</hi>(ſtand clear) for <hi>down it goes;</hi> or the <hi>next Calm,</hi> when the Maſter-Builders have Time and Leiſure to view it, and find its Danger, and its Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, down it goes—</p>
            <p>The <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> repreſent themſelves, but the Houſe of Commons are the <hi>Repreſentatives of all the People</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> What therefore the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the People affect, that, I ſay, <hi>in time ſhall become a Law.</hi> The Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe of Commons have not only ſtruck at this Statute, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. which the Prelates make ſuch Work with; but the Repeal thereof paſt the Houſe with general Approbation, and was committed, and ſent up to the Lords for their Concurrence therein, it <hi>ſtopp'd there.—</hi>So much for this time.</p>
            <p>The Words—called <hi>Scandal. Magnat.—</hi>which muſt coſt this Defendant 2000 <hi>l.</hi> are not <hi>actionable,</hi> taken in <hi>ſenſu conjuncto,</hi> (as learned Lawyers ſay) nor can the <hi>Innuendo</hi> in the third Count lie, becauſe he that drew the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration forgot to mention the <hi>Colloquium;</hi> for if it had (but) been in, no doubt but <hi>Harris</hi> would have ſwore it through and through: what an Overſight was this? Therefore ſay ſome to the Defendant, Bring a <hi>Writ of Error</hi> next Term, and quaſh it, and there's an <hi>End of an outragious Verdict,</hi> of a deſperatee Jury. Or elſe motion for a new Trial, becauſe the Declaration is, That the Words were ſpoken before divers of the King's Subjects, and but one little Subject ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Writ of Error!</hi> Where to be argued? In the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> before all the Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:94093:30"/>
This is a <hi>cunning Way,</hi> more Griſt to the Mill; as good be in the Clutches of an <hi>unmerciful Prelate,</hi> as <hi>uninerciful Breath-ſellers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chamberlin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elliot,</hi> &amp;c. that were Jailed for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pay Cuſtoms and Ship-Money, in <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Time, becauſe <hi>there was no Law for the ſame,</hi> (a clear Caſe); they took this Courſe, and the Judges (ten of twelve) gave the Cauſe againſt them: they loſt their Fees, and their Cauſe, and this Defendant gets nothing but Wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exchequer Chamber!</hi> He knows a Way worth two on't; he'll keep himſelf <note place="margin">☞</note> and his Eſtate out of all their Clutches, keep in Harbor till the Storm blow over, let it bluſter. And to <hi>Jail the Defendant,</hi> looks like an <hi>Inhumanity</hi> like that of ſome <hi>Creditors,</hi> that in Cruelty <hi>arreſt the dead Corps,—</hi>a <hi>Barbartty</hi> of no great Credit to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> (that, if he do not <hi>propagate,</hi> at leaſt ſhould not by <hi>Jails</hi> and <hi>Shams hinder</hi> the Propagation of the <hi>Goſpel)</hi> eſpecially not <hi>(how bigg ſoever any Man is)</hi> at this time of Day.</p>
            <p>Money, a great deal of Money will <hi>Gadbury</hi> get, and more than ever the Biſhop will get by this Affair; for,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flectere qui nequeant Superos, Acheronta movebunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Horary Queſtions will be, Where the Defendant's Eſtate is? where his Lands? where his Goods? where his Moneys? (if any Body could tell; for I believe the Defendant himſelf can ſcarcely tell that) and laſtly, Where he himſelf is? whether within a <hi>Mile of an Oak,</hi> or juſt under the <hi>Biſhop's Noſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>all</hi> comes to <hi>all,</hi> the Inquiſitors will but throw <hi>good Money after bad;</hi> for the Devil will <hi>cheat them,</hi> as he did Madam <hi>Cellier,</hi> both of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and the Sham-plot. And after all—the <hi>Aſs-trologer</hi> knows no more (by all his Intelligence with <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Moon)</hi> where the Defendant is, than I do; perhaps not ſo well: nor ever ſhall, till the Time come when <hi>Truth</hi> is valued more than <hi>Hypocriſy;</hi> when Innocence is a ſufficient Guard againſt Power; when <hi>Goſpel</hi> is preferr'd before an obſolete worm-eaten <hi>Law,</hi> made in the Days of Popiſh Prelacy; then <hi>(and not till then)</hi> ſhall the Defendant appear to their Shame.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Interim,</hi> make them know how deep and ſmartly a ſingle Pen can wound, when whetted and made ſharp with Truth, and edg'd by Deſpair, through the inveterate Malice (but <hi>ſilly Policy)</hi> of unreaſonable and wicked Men: <hi>Chriſto commonſtratore non didicerunt,</hi> They never learnt this Policy of their Saviour.</p>
            <p>This Method is like the Policy of the <hi>late Suborners,</hi> that would have <hi>wheedled</hi> the Man into Perjury, by telling him of <hi>two Sorts of Advancement;</hi> if one would not, the other ſhould; if Preferment, and Money, and Gold would not make him ſwear Treaſon againſt—then he ſhould be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Gallows, and <hi>Boo—</hi>ſhould ſwear Treaſon againſt him.</p>
            <p>Wicked <hi>Haman,</hi> (that devilliſh <hi>Privy-Councellor</hi> to the King <hi>Ahaſuerus)</hi> had experience of both theſe Advancements; firſt, to be a Favourite; and ſecondly and laſtly, to the Gallows prepared for <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings to my mind a <hi>true Story,</hi> and commonly known: There was a <hi>great Man,</hi> but he was an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> but (in pretence) a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and being ſick on his Death-Bed, he called for two Pictures, that he had provided againſt ſuch a laſt Extremity, and hung <hi>one on the one ſide of his Bed,</hi> and the <hi>other on the other ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One was a Picture of <hi>God</hi> Almighty, (you may know he was a <hi>Papiſt</hi> by that) the other was the Picture of the Devil, (you may know he was an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> by that;) in the firſt Picture—this Motto,<hi>—Si tu non vis, (If thou wilt not);</hi> but in the Devil's Picture, on the other ſide his Bed, this Motto<hi>—Iſte rogitat, (Here's one will.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:94093:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Even ſo, Beloved, like theſe two Motto's, there is belike, as the Suborners ſay, <hi>two Sorts of Advancement;</hi> one by <hi>fair</hi> means, the other by <hi>foul:</hi> As if <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf, (whoſe Eloquence is meer <hi>Canting,</hi> and a <hi>ſet,</hi> little <hi>pedagogical</hi> way of <hi>chanting</hi> Words, (by the ſilly) admir'd for Oratory above <hi>Rhombus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) ſhould ſay, If <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>fair Words</hi> will not make you a perjur'd Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and a <hi>Teague O Divelly,</hi> then the <hi>Gallows take thee,</hi> and the <hi>foul Fiend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> of ſome Mens Religion! What have we to do with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel?</hi> the white Devil is the moſt devilliſh, the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Devil; no Man croſſes himſelf, nor bleſſes himſelf from him, nor from the foul Fiend; when the <hi>Suborner</hi> prays like a <hi>Saint,</hi> and when this <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> and <hi>Devil incarnate,</hi> appears to the World in the <hi>likeneſs of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and yet has <hi>no God but his Belly,</hi> no Lechery like Revenge, no <hi>Food</hi> like Man's Blood, no Recreation like Iſſuing out <hi>Excom. cap—</hi>and filling the Jails, the <hi>Royal Seat</hi> of his Soul being in his <hi>Belly</hi> and Midriff, the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Belly-God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let no Man envy the Gentleman his Employment; for if I had a Dog that was ſuch a <hi>biting, miſchievous Curr,</hi> and <hi>Worry-Sheep,</hi> I would <hi>hang him.</hi> Look him in the Mouth, do but ſee there, I told you <hi>his Chaps were bloody,</hi> he has not lick'd his Lips <hi>ſince he told a Lie;</hi> for his Religion is <hi>meer Cheat,</hi> as the King ſays; <hi>His Voice is</hi> Jacob's <hi>Voice,</hi> but his Hands, <hi>his Hands</hi> (the bloody Hands of this <hi>Nimrod)</hi> look you, Gentlemen, his <hi>Hands</hi> are the Hands of <hi>Eſau.</hi> Seal thoſe <hi>Cap—</hi>there; are you ſure they are all ſent to the Devil? Yes, <hi>Ecce Signum!</hi> Then paſs them—fill the Jails <hi>full</hi>
               <hi>—full—</hi>'tis done, one cries—the <hi>Devil take them—;</hi> the other cries—Take them Jailor!—A glorious Work! Sure the Fool ſays in his Heart, <hi>There is no God:</hi> No, the Devil of Hell is not ſo devilliſh an Atheiſt: 'Tis the old Fool, that wiſhes (and lives as if) there were no God.</p>
            <p>Naturaliſts tell us of Roots called the <hi>Mandrakes,</hi> in proportion and parts like a <hi>Man and Woman,</hi> (for like the Palm-Tree, there is difference of Sexes, <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> of them, and theſe Mandraks are never found in the Earth <hi>alone,</hi> but <hi>Male and Female together lie,</hi> (that's more than ſome Men do with their Wives) <hi>bedded together in the Ground,</hi> from whence it cannot be eradicated and <hi>pluck'd up</hi> by any <hi>living Creature,</hi> but it proves the <hi>Death</hi> of that Creature that does it: Therefore they provide a Dog, <hi>good for nothing elſe,</hi> as moſt ſit for that Office and Employment, firſt digging about the Mandrakes to facilitate the Feat, and up come the Mandrakes with a <hi>Groan,</hi> and down falls the Dog <hi>dead,</hi> dead, ſtark dead; nay, no matter, 'tis <hi>but a Dog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Compare we true Devotion (in the conſciencious diſcharge of the Duties of Chriſtianity) and Religion to be this <hi>Mandrake,</hi> at which the perſecuting <hi>Nero</hi>'s, <hi>Diocleſian's, Julian</hi>'s, &amp;c. the Popiſh Inquiſition, the Prelatical High-Commiſſion, with their <hi>Anathema's,</hi> and their <hi>Capias,</hi> and their Conſtables, and Jailors, and Executioners, have long been plucking, tugging, and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and enacting, to eradicate it, that <hi>Rome</hi> might be made inſtead thereof, to plant their own Inventions, conformable and uniformable; to ſecure their Lordly ſpiritual Pride, Tyranny, Covetouſneſs, and Oppreſſion, and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Policies and Subtilties, by <hi>Capias</hi>'s and Curſes, Acts and Writs againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive People: Let them alone with their Employment, their Bayliffs and Bum's, their Officers and Apparitors, their Commiſſioners and Executioners, Hangmen and Jailors, and the reſt of the Black Regiment; let them alone, it will be the <hi>Death of the Dogs:</hi> And—</p>

                     <p>I Have ſent you, in the next Page, ſome Gratulatory Lines upon the reading of your <hi>Naked-Truth,</hi> &amp;c. I find your Books, in theſe parts, to be like Univerſal Pills; they have various Operations, and work upon all Bodies Politick one way or other, by Sweating, Vomiting, Purging, Urin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but generally the People take them as Cordials, and digeſt them with a great deal of comfort; for we are true <hi>Britains</hi> in the Weſt, and are glad to hear there is one wiſe Man in the Eaſt; we hope there are more. We are ſo yoaked with Conſiſtory Collars, that our Necks are worn bare, and our Withers gauled; and if we offer to winch, or draw back, we are preſently pinch'd, and ſuch Goads run into our Sides, that we are forced to go as they pleaſe, for they muſt needs go that the Devil drives: And tho' we have but ſhort Paſture on our barren Mountains, and lean Livings in <hi>Wales,</hi> that we can but juſt keep Life and Soul together, yet our fat Task-maſter does ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, that we can ſcarce keep Skin and Bones together; we are ſo poor, we cannot creep; we are ſo drained in our Purſes, that we are no way able to wage War with the Beaſt. Our trembling Vicars, Levite-like, conform to all, and <hi>Iſſachar-</hi>like, bear any Burdens that are laid upon their Backs, and know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94093:31"/>
not how to help themſelves. And our poor Church-Wardens ſtand Cap in Hand to the Worſhipful Mr. Arch-Deacon, the Reverend Doctor and Commiſſary, and the Sir Reverence the Regiſter; and are glad they can get off, and be diſpatched, by paying of their Mony, (which is a Pariſh Charge, that grudg to give them allowance for their Time: And if the Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den offer to ſpeak, the Arch-Deacon nods, and the Commiſſary frowns, and the Regiſter mouths and rails, and calls them <hi>Saucy,</hi> threatning them to march from Court to Court, and wait attendance upon his Ar—that they are ſo tired in Body and Spirit, that they have no heart to their Drudgery; they had rather be of any Office, (Scavengers to empty Dung) than to be Church-Wardens; for they are forced to ſwear and forſwear themſelves, whether they will or no, for it is impoſſible for them to keep their Oaths; if they offer to ſpeak, their Mouths are ſtop'd with a Canon Bullet, a Book of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> is given them, to preſent their peaceable Neighbours by. The Margin doth quote ſeveral Canons which they cannot read, neither do they know when or where they were made: Nay, they tell them of unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of Cuſtoms, and Ancient Uſages; and frighten them with high Words, and ſnap them up, ſaying, <hi>Take the Book, here is the Guide you muſt go by, and Preſent, or elſe you are forſworn.</hi> And when they make Returns, which is writ by one or other of their Proctors, for which they give a <hi>Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and ſubſcribe, <hi>Omnia bene;</hi> they will not believe them, but tell them, <hi>The Court is informed otherwiſe;</hi> and put puſling Queſtions to entangle them, and will not take in their Preſentments, till they have put in the Names of ſome of their beſt Pariſhioners, (but they muſt not be <hi>Quakers);</hi> and thus the whole Pariſh is ſet in a flame by theſe Incendiaries; and poor ignorant Creatures, they cannot help it: If there be any droniſh or debauched Clergy-man that they complain of, they cannot be heard; and they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſome have been proved Prophane in Life, and common ſpeaking, and Heretical and Popiſh in their publick Preaching; that the High Arches do only check them, and continue them in their Livings; to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Debauchery, and the hazard of the precious Souls of their Hearers: But if there be but one pious and painful Preacher, the whole inquiry is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; What doth that Man do? is he conformable in every Point to the King's Eccleſiaſtical Laws? and if there be the leſt <hi>iota</hi> or Ceremony omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at any time, he is preſently ſuſpended, <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio;</hi> and thus the Shepherd is ſmitten, and the Flock ſcattered. Sir, I have held you too long, I have been in the Company of the Clergy, where your Books have been mentioned; and ſome modeſt Men have ſpoken, that <hi>there were many things too true:</hi> But the High Hectors have run them down, and railed againſt your Book and you, ſaying, <hi>They know not but you may be a Jeſuit,</hi> (which they never ſaid while you drudged for them): They ſay, <hi>That a Pillory is more fit for you than a Pulpit, and a Rope than a Cope:</hi> They ſay, <hi>E're long your Mouth will be ſtopped, they will cut your Gill, and then Hicker where you will. They have Silver and Gold Spurs, yours are but Natural, and they will ſlaſh you; they will pick out your Eyes, and crow over you; they will not leave a Feather on your Back, or a Quill to make you a Pen to ſcribble with; they will cut your Comb, and your Stones too, and make a Gelding of you, that you may only ſerve as a Door-keeper for their Nuns,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſhall detain you no longer, but ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

            <p>We are commanded to<hi>—love the Truth and Peace,</hi> well put <hi>together;</hi> for Truth ſeldom meets Peace without, tho it always makes Peace within. Truth ſeldom gets in this World external Peace, but never miſſes internal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Peace.</p>
            <p>The Word of Truth, Truth it ſelf, our bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles, never failed of inward Peace of Conſcience, and Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail'd neither of external Ruffles, and War from without; and therefore he ſaid, <hi>He came not to ſend</hi> Peace <hi>on Earth, but a Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It always was ſo from the beginning, is now, and ever ſhall be, that War ſhould be betwixt the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent.</p>
            <p>But there can be <hi>no Peace</hi> (ſaith my God) <hi>to the Wicked;</hi> neither Peace ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, internal, nor eternal.</p>
            <p>For Truth is the <hi>Eſſence of Peace,</hi> the Life and Soul of Peace; it ceaſes to be Peace, when Truth is abſent, and is <hi>meer War,</hi> Confuſion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</p>
            <p>How I have ſtudied the Way of Truth, let good Men judg; and how I have ſtudied the Way of Peace, this following Letter to <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> will evince.

If I had ſpoke the Words <hi>modo &amp; formâ,</hi> as they are laid in your Declaration, I know not whether upon any Submiſſion. your Lordſhip would find Mercy enough to remit them. But, my Lord, if you will vouchſafe me a Hearing, with (or without) your own Witneſs, or Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I doubt not, but he or they will evidence my Innocence, that I never
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94093:34"/>
ſpoke the Words <hi>as they are laid,</hi> but without any Interruption or Intermiſſion, in a continued Diſcourſe, I did explain, and explain, and expreſs what <hi>horrid Plot</hi> it was, which I ſaid your Lordſhip had a hand in, <hi>viz. againſt my righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Name and Reputation in the Barretry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that thoſe ungrateful Words of<hi>—Impudent,</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> (which are odious, if conſidered abſtractly), had reference only to a Diſcourſe we had of a printed Paper your Lordſhip recommended to the Clergy of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in your laſt Viſitation, (and amongſt other things) the Obſervation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of 40, by Name diſallowed by 13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>Which Statute if your Lordſhip knew not, I ſaid, you were <hi>ignorant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> or if you knew it, it was <hi>impudent</hi> to confront the ſaid Act of King and Parliament, oppoſing your Sence againſt theirs. All which, my Lord, are not <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> taken <hi>together,</hi> nor againſt the Statute, if true; but the <hi>laſt Words</hi> were very raſhly and irreverently ſpoken, and I am ſo far from juſtifying the <hi>Irreverence</hi> and <hi>Indecency</hi> of the Expreſſions, (what Provocation ſoever I might have) that I will give your Lordſhip what <hi>Satisfaction</hi> your Lordſhip ſhall <hi>reaſonably require,</hi> with all Humility and Contrition. And I am the rather hopeful of the good Succeſs of this my <hi>humble Submiſſion,</hi> becauſe (I hope) your Lordſhip intended nothing elſe in bringing the Action, but only to bring me to <hi>Acknowledgment of the Irreverence</hi> of the Expreſſions, and not with a <hi>deſign to enrich your ſelf</hi> by any Money of mine, or <hi>undoing me and my Family.</hi> Yet, my Lord, I doubt not but to make it appear (if you will admit me) to your Lordſhip) that the Action againſt me is <hi>ill laid,</hi> and that you wlil certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>non-ſuited,</hi> tho it be no Policy to tell your Lordſhip <hi>how</hi> and <hi>wherein</hi> at this time of Day: However, it will approve me <hi>ingenuous towards your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and that I do as induſtriouſly avoid a <hi>Conquest,</hi> as well as all <hi>Contest</hi> with your Lordſhip, and that this Submiſſion proceeds from nobler Principles than <hi>Fear</hi> can ſuggeſt. But I have had ſo ill Succeſs in all my former Applications to your Lordſhip, that I have but <hi>little Faith or Hope</hi> in the Succeſs of this; however nothing on <hi>my part</hi> ſhall be wanting to an <hi>Accommodation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince Almighty God <hi>(in Mercy)</hi> does not ſend a <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> for every <hi>raſh Oath,</hi> or <hi>every irreverent Word</hi> againſt his <hi>holy Name;</hi> your Lordſhip, I <hi>faintly hope,</hi> will, after his Example, find Mercy and Grace <hi>enough</hi> to remit,</p>

            <p>Now let the Reader judg, whether any <hi>ſoft Conceſſion</hi> or Submiſſions can <hi>mollify this ſort of</hi> Men: Flints will break upon a Feather-Bed; but the <hi>Biſhop and his Clerks</hi> (near the Iſle of <hi>Scilly)</hi> are <hi>harder than Flint,</hi> harder than the Adamant, or the nether Milſtone.</p>
            <p>What Advantage did Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice, take at the Defendant's ingenuous Conceſſions (which were more than needed) in the Caſe?</p>
            <p>For there are not any Words laid in the Declaration, (if never ſo true, and well-prov'd) that are actionable, or within that Statute, but are juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>as they were ſpoken.</hi> And upon a Writ of Error, it will appear, (for the Oath of the Judges is, to have <hi>no reſpect of Perſons</hi> in Judgment) That the

Words in all the three ſeveral Counts are not actionable, nor ſcandalous; and if ſo, then all this Noiſe is like the Shearing of Hogs, a <hi>great Cry, and a little Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſay, <hi>His Lordſhip is very ignorant;</hi> 'tis too true, and if he be <hi>wiſe,</hi> he will <hi>confeſs</hi> it, as (aforeſaid) St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, and ſo <hi>Socrates,</hi> and all the <hi>wiſe Men</hi> (before or ſince.) <hi>Agur</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> one of them, ſays, <hi>I am more brutiſh than any Man, I have not the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of a Man.</hi> That Danger is over; the other is eaſy.</p>
            <p>For to ſay <hi>in ſenſu conjuncto,</hi> nay, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> That his Lordſhip is a <hi>bold Man:</hi> A Souldier ſhould be ſo, much more when he is a <hi>Souldier of Christ,</hi> much more when he mounts ſo high <hi>as to be a Prelate,</hi> he had need be <hi>bold or daring,</hi> becauſe of the many Oppoſitions he muſt expect to encounter; The Apoſtle bids us—ſtand to our Arms—and <hi>put on the whole Armor of God,</hi> and <hi>ſtand,</hi> and when we have done all <hi>to ſtand.</hi>

               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and all the Philoſophers make <hi>Fortitude</hi> to be one of the four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Vertues; (I never heard it was ſcandalous before to ſay a Man is <hi>bold and daring;</hi> if it had on the contrary been ſaid) his <hi>Lordſhip is fearful,</hi> a <hi>Coward,</hi> and then; Then, <hi>then</hi> indeed the <hi>Scandal. magnat.</hi> would be <hi>greatly ſcandalous,</hi> and within the Statute; and the Action would well lie; but not to ſay, <hi>His Lordſhip is a bold daring Man;</hi> though you add a <hi>bold, daring, impudent Man, for ſending</hi> ſome Heads of Divinity in a printed Paper contrary to Law.</p>
            <p>Is it not Impudence to live in the Practice and Office Epiſcopal, acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe Methods, Rules, and Rubricks commanded in the Statutes by King and Parliament, and contrary to the Common-Prayer Book, and Act of Uniformity? <hi>Yes,</hi> you muſt ſay—for a Biſhop cannot plead <hi>Ignorance,</hi> nor Frailty, for then his Lordſhip would (indeed be <hi>very ignorant.</hi>

            <p>The Defendant is the Man that will prove, (if any Body have the Face to deny it, and when Time ſhall ſerve) that there is a Biſhop within a Mile of an Oak, that has liv'd in the Practice and <hi>Office Epiſcopal,</hi> acting contrary to thoſe Methods, Rules, and Rubricks, commanded in the Statute by King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Common-Prayer Book, and Act of Uniformity.</p>

            <p>No <hi>great</hi> Man (if he be a Subject) is <hi>too great</hi> for the Law, not <hi>too great</hi> to be corrected, reform'd, and better taught; not too great for King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and their Statutes: It is Treaſon to deny this Truth. <hi>What?</hi> ſhall <hi>Confirmation,</hi> (of which the Papiſts make a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and Proteſtants make an <hi>Ordinance</hi> and <hi>Statute-Law,)</hi> be ſlubber'd over againſt the very Deſign of it? be ſlubber'd over, by confirming ſuch as have neither <hi>Sureties</hi> there, nor any <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nor any God-Father or God-Mother, nor any Miniſter, to <hi>testify</hi> that ever they were baptized?

            <p>And why? and why?</p>
            <p>They are <hi>depopulated by the Inquiſition, the Severity and Perſecution</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law tho.

            <p>Yet ſome Politicians (the Scholars and Diſciples of <hi>Nat.

No wonder then the People grew <hi>ſtark mad</hi> (Cruelty and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> had made them <hi>ſo mad;</hi> and yet we do not read that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> nor <hi>Solomon</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt the People, but that <hi>they had a Law on their ſide to vouch</hi> the Whips and the Scorpions too; <hi>(Remember</hi> Emſon <hi>and</hi> Dudley!)</p>
            <p>No wonder (then) the People <hi>run into Rebellion to this day,</hi> V. 19. and run ſtark mad, and <hi>after a fooliſh Religion too,</hi> but they that were made <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by bad uſage and cruelty</hi> (it might be better with them, it could not be worſe, <hi>they could but loſe their Lives, or their Livings,</hi> Lands, Goods, and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (more dear than Life)</hi> and therefore they <hi>publickly beat up their Drums</hi> to a Point of War—and makes the Trumpets<hi>—ſound—</hi>To <hi>Horſe—</hi>To <hi>Horſe—</hi>Ver. 16.

            </p>
            <p>And what Miſchiefs have come to the Church, to the Nations, to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Chriſtendom, by theſe raſh ſanguinary ways? <hi>(for every thing is moſt certainly beſt preſerv'd, by the ſame Means and Methods by which it was made;</hi> nor was the Peace of Chriſtianity, nor its Propagation, <hi>by Might, nor by Power,</hi> but <hi>by my Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Lord of Hoſts).

            <p>Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> will alſo <hi>publickly make appear,</hi> (if God ſpare him Life, Health, and Liberty) particularly and at large, <hi>how baneful it has been to the Church,</hi> to make Church-men and <hi>Spiritual Perſons,</hi> vaſtly rich, and vaſtly <hi>powerful in Temporals,</hi> (ſo incongruous and <hi>incompatible with the Apoſtles,</hi> the Goſpel, nay, <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> whoſe Kingdom <hi>is not of this World)</hi> and who never encouraged <hi>(as ſome do)</hi> but diſcouraged a <hi>worldly, proud, pragmatical Tribe,</hi> overtopping <hi>Clergie</hi> and <hi>Lay,</hi> as much as their <hi>Cathedrals overtop</hi> our Houſes: Though they have <hi>endeavoured to ſhut him out</hi> of the Pulpit a while, by the help of an old Statute and a Jury, they have not power to ſhut the <hi>Doors of the Preſs,</hi> (God be thanked). <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Reformation of the Idolatries and Superſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> could never have ſpread <hi>(far and wide)</hi> if <hi>Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> had not been invented: A <hi>few Manuſcripts</hi> might have been handled about, to ſome few particular Perſons, and learned Men: But the Tyranny Prelatical, and Oppreſſions of <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. could never (without a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle) have been defeated.

Is not this too <hi>Scandalum Magnatum?</hi> Of which many Inſtances may be given; ſome for Example:</p>
            <p>Namely, Their Connivance, <hi>confident and bold permiſſion</hi> of all their under-Officers in their <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> (if not their <hi>incouragement, aſſiſtance,</hi> and by their Power and Intereſt, a <hi>bold countenance)</hi> of the daily, conſtant, <hi>publick, and impudent Extortions</hi> and Oppreſſions of the King's Subjects, againſt <hi>the Statutes</hi> of this Realm, (that limit the juſt Fees) in <hi>Citations, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of Wills,</hi> Adminiſtrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay, againſt their own <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> (Concil. <hi>London.</hi> 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1328.) and againſt their <hi>own Table of Fees:</hi> Wretched, univerſal, and abominable Impudence! no Name can be bad enough for this wilful and daring Attempt, and Contempt: What? in God's Name, are any Prelats <hi>greater than the Laws,</hi> or too <hi>big to be ſubject</hi> to the King's Laws, or <hi>too great</hi> to be <hi>good?</hi> God forbid. No wonder the whole Tribe unite their Power againſt the Man, who has <hi>courage to charge</hi> thoſe things <hi>home upon them,</hi> and whom they <hi>(therefore)</hi> hate, becauſe he is, <hi>(and few Men more)</hi> acquainted with their Myſteries of Iniquity, and knows how to charge them home: No wonder therefore they ſo much <hi>dread him,</hi> and do ſo <hi>unite their Common-Forces,</hi> and Joint-Intereſt, to ruin him, or <hi>Jayl him,</hi> and ſo <hi>tie up</hi> his <hi>Hands,</hi> as well as <hi>ſtop his Mouth,</hi> by their Eccleſiaſtical-Canon-Shot, of <hi>Suſpenſions, Silencings,</hi> Excommunications, <hi>Curſes,</hi> and the like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual<hi>-Artillery;</hi> they act <hi>for Life,</hi> (as Men that are <hi>drawing on).</hi> The Silver-Smiths cried out—Great is <hi>Diana of the Epheſians:</hi> And yet to tell you true, this chaſt <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe Image <hi>(as the Prieſts ſaid)</hi> came down from <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and the <hi>Fools and Bigots believed it,</hi> (Tooth and Nail); and the <hi>crafty Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Shrine-makers,</hi> and Silver-Smiths, <hi>(falſe Loons!)</hi> they knew that their great Wealth <hi>depended upon the belief on't:</hi> no wonder then that they cry, and <hi>whoop,</hi> and <hi>hallow,</hi> (and the Fools and <hi>Bigots eccho'd to the cry</hi> which the Shrine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers made)<hi>—Great is Diana of the Epheſians;</hi> and yet to tell you the <hi>Naked-Truth on't,</hi> this chaſt <hi>Diana</hi> was a <hi>Common-Huntreſs</hi> and <hi>Common-Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> and Baggage, and as <hi>arrand a Whore</hi> as any in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where is there a Clergy-man, now-a-days, that will ſay, as of old, <hi>Nolo Epiſcopari—</hi>I will not Biſhop it, (if I might) or would <hi>gueld himſelf</hi> (as ſome have done) to make themſelves <hi>uncapable of Lawn-ſleeves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, rather <hi>run and ride,</hi> with Friends and Relations, Mony and Flattery, <hi>Cringing and Foppery,</hi> to this Miſs, to that <hi>Miſs,</hi> Mony and Complyance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Conſciences, by <hi>hook and by crook,</hi> have at it; though good Men find how <hi>hard it is for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> much <hi>more difficult</hi> for a <hi>Rich Man</hi> to be a <hi>good Church-man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For they that <hi>will be Rich,</hi> (1 Tim. 6. 9.) <hi>fall into Temptation, and a Snare,</hi> and into <hi>many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts,</hi> which <hi>drown Men (yet they venture)</hi> into Deſtruction and Perdition; For the <hi>love of Mony is the Root of all Evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have been ſeduced from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. The <hi>Commons</hi> complain to the King, that the King kept ſo many Biſhops about him in his Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>advanced them and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</hi> (An old complaint).</p>
            <p>When the Devil tempted our Bleſſed Saviour, ſhewed him the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and the Glory of them; <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10. Then Jeſus ſaid unto him<hi>—Avoid—Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how many of our Apoſtolical Men, (that <hi>vaunt themſelves</hi> Succeſſors of the Apoſtles) do ſay, (as the Apoſtles did, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2, 4.) <hi>It is not meet,</hi>

               <hi>that we ſhould leave the Word of God and ſerve Tables? But we will give</hi> our ſelves <hi>continually to Prayer, and to the miniſtry of</hi> the Word.</p>
            <p>Ay, Ay, that's a <hi>good</hi> Work, the <hi>beſt</hi> Work, and <hi>work enough,</hi> and the <hi>moſt proper Work for</hi> Apoſtolical Men. We never read that any Apoſtle turn'd <hi>Action-Driver,</hi> or <hi>Promoter,</hi> ſurrounded with the black Regiment of Apari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Proctors, Hangmen, and Jaylors.</p>
            <p>Again, what <hi>bold daring impudence is it</hi> for them to keep Courts, and not in the Name and Style of the King, contrary to 2. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. if it be in force?</p>
            <p>A Statute thought ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> for the Reformation, and ſo agreeable to the <hi>King's Supremacy,</hi> in the wiſdom of our Anceſtors, that one would wonder any good Subject ſhould ſcruple at its obſervance, much leſs live in contempt of it.</p>
            <p>It is a Statute lawfully made, and never repealed.</p>
            <p>I know what <hi>Coke</hi> ſays of it, and wherefore he <hi>durſt ſay no more,</hi> during the Tyranny of the <hi>High-Commiſſion;</hi> which <hi>High-Commiſſion</hi> alone, <hi>kept off</hi> all puniſhment from the Tranſgreſſors thereof: an <hi>extrajudicial Judgment</hi> was <hi>(once)</hi> given againſt it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>where is the Judg</hi> will <hi>declare againſt its force,</hi> and ſay in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> that it is repealed?</p>
            <p>I grant, in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, all the Statutes againſt the Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy are repealed, and her Repeal, is repealed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Pope's Supremacy continues in <hi>France,</hi> and yet Proceſs Eccleſiaſtical might (if the French King pleas'd) run in his own Name, and yet the Pope and he continue very good Friends, and the Pope's Supremacy continue: therefore the repealing the Statutes made againſt the Pope's Supremacy, is no repeal of this Statute; there goes more than general words to repeal a Law, and ſuch a Law.</p>
            <p>If this Statute be repealed, <hi>Why does not the Judges ſo declare it?</hi> If it be in force, no Name is bad enough, nor any <hi>Puniſhment on this ſide Death,</hi> for the wilful and ſtubborn Tranſgreſſors thereof: and 'tis my wonder, that no Men in <hi>England</hi> will put it home, to have it argued, that it may not continue a Snare to the King's Subjects; for if that Statute had not promis'd fair, and moſt Learned Counſellors at Law of the ſame Opinion, the Conteſt with Eccleſiaſtical Courts had never been continued againſt them, for any thing, but only becauſe of their vile Extortions and Oppreſſions, in <hi>high contempt of the Law of God and Man,</hi> braving <hi>his Majeſty's Laws,</hi> his Statutes, <hi>their own Canon</hi> Laws, <hi>their own Table</hi> of Fees, againſt <hi>Juſtice,</hi> Conſcience, and <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> What is <hi>Impudence if this be not?</hi> The King may ſeize their Temporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Contempt—no wonder they <hi>frisk,</hi> being ſo <hi>netled; How they ſtrive for Life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the words in the laſt Count, more need not be ſaid, than that it <hi>is ridiculous to inſist upon them;</hi> and therefore Sir <hi>Fran. Withins</hi> ſaid, They would take a Verdict only for the <hi>words in the firſt Count:</hi> For inſtead of <hi>damnable Plot</hi> (meaning) the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot; their own little <hi>ſingle Witneſs, Harris,</hi> ſwore againſt them, namely, <hi>Horrid Plot againſt my Righteous Name and Perſon:</hi> though that word <hi>Perſon</hi> was <hi>falſe too,</hi> for inſtead of <hi>Perſon,</hi> it was <hi>Reputation,</hi> and ſo did all <hi>the Witneſſes agree;</hi> never was <hi>ſuch a Cauſe carried,</hi> on the Teſtimony of ſo <hi>infamous a Man,</hi> a Man of <hi>ſo bad Memory,</hi> that could not tell <hi>his Tale right twice together,</hi> nor twice <hi>the ſame way;</hi> and therefore though he had not been proved infamous, (by that Noble <hi>Earl)</hi> yet he <hi>ought</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, He ſwore <hi>for himſelf,</hi> and in revenge, and to get the <hi>Defendant's Benefice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the <hi>precious Jury</hi> would not only believe him againſt <hi>ſo many,</hi> but would not only find the words, that are <hi>not actionable in themſelves;</hi> as has been prov'd at large, and beyond all contradiction.</p>
            <p>For Men, thus to <hi>ruin a Man,</hi> and beggar him, to <hi>enrich a Rich Man</hi> that has <hi>enough</hi> already, <hi>(one would think)</hi> or, at leaſt, as <hi>much as he deſerves,</hi> is ſo <hi>like the Parable,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4. of the <hi>Ewe-Lamb,</hi> (the poor Man's <hi>whole Subſtance loſt</hi> at a clap) that the Jury may thank God that they eſcape King <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Threat:</hi> For <hi>David</hi>'s Anger, <hi>(Ver.</hi> 5.) was <hi>greatly kindled againſt the Man;</hi> and he ſaid to <hi>Nathan,</hi> As the Lord liveth, the <hi>Man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die.</hi> And he ſhall reſtore the <hi>Lamb four-fold, (Mark that, four times</hi> 2000 <hi>pounds;</hi> How much is that? 8000 <hi>l.) becauſe he did this thing; and becauſe he had no pitty.</hi>

            <p>And to defame a Prelat, <hi>(that</hi> in compariſon of God <hi>is but Worms-meat)</hi> ſhall the temporal Puniſhment be no leſs than Impriſonment, or 2000 <hi>l.</hi> in Mony? Oh monſtrous! <hi>The Mercies of the Wicked are Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But cruel Men ſhould remember (in time they may have <hi>cauſe</hi> to remember) the wretched End of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> thoſe grand Pick-pockets, that from the <hi>Breach</hi> of old Statutes, and Penalties, did ruine Families.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> p. 247. tells us, that their <hi>principal Working was upon Penal Statutes,</hi> (to uſe his Words,) they conſider'd not whether the Law was obſolete, or in uſe; and had ever a Rabble of <hi>Promoters,</hi> (a brave <hi>Employ for a Perſon of Honour)</hi> and <hi>leading Jurors,</hi> (mark that too) at their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> They liv'd, and they liv'd to be <hi>hang'd</hi> for their Pains, after three long Years, (for ſo long God ſuffered them to drink the Tears of Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, namely, from <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1406, till 1409.) And the <hi>Promoters,</hi> (mark that too) <hi>Canby, Page, Smith, Derby, Wight, Simſon,</hi> and <hi>Stockton,</hi> ('tis fit <hi>their loathed Names ſhould be chronicled to all Poſterity, and ſo ſhall others too that drive the ſame Trade)</hi> condemn'd to the <hi>Pillory,</hi> and then to ride through the City with <hi>Papers on their Heads,</hi> and their Faces <hi>towards the Horſes-tails.</hi> All ſeven died ſtrangely in ſeven Days after, (in <hi>Newgate)</hi> for very ſhame.</p>
            <p>There's an End, a <hi>wretched End</hi> of a Pack of Wretches, <hi>pack'd Jurors,</hi> and <hi>Promoters.</hi> The Righteous God will hear the Groans and Cries of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans, by unreaſonable and wicked Men ruin'd and undone, and will pay off the ſtony-hearted Caitiffs (that have loſt all Bowels of Humanity and Compaſſion) with a Vengeance.</p>
            <p>That Atheiſts may know that <hi>there is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</hi> and pays men in their own Coin. This <hi>Adonibezek</hi> (too late) acknowledg'd, when his Thumbs and great Toes were cut off, (the very ſame Cruelty which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon others.) And thus the Mercileſs, that (without remorſe) delight in the Ruin of a Man and his Houſe, palliating Revenge with an Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Deodand,</hi> to ruin a Man and his Heritage, when <hi>God has rewarded them in their own kind,</hi> each of them over their own Ruines, ſhall ſay, with <hi>Adonibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek,</hi> Judg. 1. 7. <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath requited me.</hi>

For Truth hath ſaid it, <hi>They ſhall find Judgment without Mercy, who have ſhewed no Mercy.</hi>

            <p>Tho this muſt be ſaid in the <hi>behalf</hi> of that Jury, (that tho it was reported in <hi>London</hi> (before the Trial) what the Iſſue has prov'd, yet it is alſo ſaid,) that the Jury in ſo great a Fine, (as 2000 <hi>l.)</hi> intended nothing therein of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Defendant, but to bring him to a Submiſſion, in vindication of the Biſhop's Credit, which (how true it is is) Time will diſcover.</p>
            <p>But in truth the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Reputation had been ſufficiently and <hi>better vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> if they had given credit to ſix ſubſtantial Witneſſes, who acquitted the Defendant, that the Words in the Declaration were not ſpoken as they are laid, rather than to that <hi>little Body,</hi> who was prov'd upon Oath to be <hi>ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Perſon,</hi> by that Noble Earl; and by his own Vouchers prov'd to have ſo little regard to his Duty, which he ows to God, to his own Soul, and to his Pariſhioners, and to his Oath of Reſidence in his ſaid <hi>Perpetual-Vicarage,</hi> as to leave them utterly, and forſake them, taking <hi>another Cure</hi> and Flock, and leaving his own to the Care of one that was lately a ſilly <hi>Log-river,</hi> and knows not well how to diſcharge his own Cure, nor to read his <hi>Accidence.</hi> And all this, when not only all the ſaid Witneſſes for the Defendant did ſwear nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that they did <hi>not hear</hi> ſuch Words, but poſitively ſwore that they heard the whole Diſcourſe, and writ down the Words immediatly upon <hi>Harris</hi> his falſe Recital of them, and his bringing them in Writing to the Witneſſes for them to ſubſcribe, which with abhorrence and aſtoniſhment they refuſed, (the Defendant being gone out of the Room before, and knowing nothing thereof, and alſo gone out of Town) and the Witneſſes of <hi>their own Accord</hi> writing down the true Words, which they ſwore to, (and ſeveral more of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany might have been brought to teſtify the ſame); for tho there wanted no Endeavour by all means (poſſible) to gain <hi>but one Witneſs</hi> to back <hi>Harris</hi> his Evidence,—yet <hi>found they none—</hi>At laſt came one ſingle <hi>falſe Witneſs,</hi> who will (as 'tis ſaid) be <hi>Indicted thereupon for Perjury</hi> for his Pains, and Witneſſes, ſubſtantial Witneſſes to prove it upon him, let him claw it off as well as he can, or his <hi>Friends to help him.</hi> No Man is too great for the Law; ſuch <hi>Fellows muſt be made Examples of,</hi> that ſwear <hi>thorow-ſtitch,</hi> and become falſe Witneſſes, to get <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard from him; when it can be done no other way, muſt it be done by a <hi>ſingle Son of Belial?

            </p>
            <p>And yet thoſe <hi>(mind what I ſay)</hi> Popiſh Prelates, with all their Suſpenſions, <hi>Curſes, Anathema's,</hi> and <hi>Excommunications,</hi> and ſuch kind of <hi>Thunder,</hi> were eſteemed by wiſe Men, even in theſe Days <hi>(ſaving your Preſence,—</hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence) a <hi>meer Crack-fart.</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third excommunicated our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, with ſuch a Pope's Bull, that (the Hiſtorian ſays) the <hi>like</hi> was <hi>never known</hi> before nor ſince. No wonder he bellow'd and roar'd ſo, (for take a <hi>greedy</hi> Eccleſiaſtick by the <hi>Pocket,</hi> and hinder his Cheat and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions, (as <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. did) and you make him roar and bellow like mad, as if you had got his <hi>Hearts-Blood,</hi> and all the Joy and Heaven ſome ſeem to aim at if we may judg the Trees by their Fruit) no wonder they drew their ſpiritual Weapons, and fling about <hi>Curſes, Anathema</hi>'s, Silencings, Suſpenſions, and <hi>grow blacker</hi> with <hi>haunting</hi> ſo many <hi>Jaylors, Jayles, Bum's, Promoters, Hang-men,</hi> as did Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all this thundering <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Blaſt, and <hi>foisty Grepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the French King, (two of the greateſt Chriſtian Princes then in the World, or that ever were in the World,) and many more Popiſh (nay, <hi>Italian)</hi> Princes and Republicks (whilſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ſtood excommunicated by the Pope) did confirm their Leagues, and entred upon new Treaties and Confederations with him.</p>
            <p>But I hear that <hi>ſome-body</hi> (I'le name <hi>no-body)</hi> is mightily concern'd, ſaying, that the Defendant's own Witneſſes proved the greateſt <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> againſt him, in Words that all of them unanimouſly ſwore, namely,—That the Defendant ſaid at the ſame Pariſh-Meeting, (only <hi>they are not, nor could not</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And if any ſhould be angry at theſe Words, the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>is not infallible,</hi> and the <hi>Pope is not infallible,</hi> and bring a new Action of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> or Scandal againſt Prelates, let them know,</p>

            <p>To <hi>omit many on this ſide the Water,</hi> and all the great Abominations of <hi>Rome,</hi> I'le inſtance in one Particular, wherein all the Papiſts ſhall take <hi>my part</hi> (here's a Wonder and a Miracle! a true one) againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, namely, Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi> (in his Epiſtles) aſſerting (as alſo did St. <hi>Auſtin)</hi> that the Lord's Supper was equally neceſſary for Children's Salvation, and to be received as much and as neceſſarily as Baptiſm it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Therefore Popes have <hi>erred,</hi> (in the opinion of the Pope and the Papiſts at this day) and St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath erred herein; or elſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and Church of <hi>England</hi> err in holding the contrary, jointly againſt St. <hi>Austin</hi> in the Point.</p>
            <p>And if it were not that this Trial gives me occaſion to obſerve to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe uſeful <hi>Hints,</hi> and lucky <hi>Hits,</hi> I ſhould (as the Reader well may) be by this time quite weary of it: And alſo it is reſolv'd they ſhall have their <hi>Belly-full</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hickeringill,</hi> till they be glutted, and confeſs, for all their <hi>gaping</hi> ſo greedily with open Mouth, and Teeth, and Fangs, to <hi>devour him, and ſwallow him up quick,</hi> in time they'le ſhut their Mouth, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that they have <hi>enough of him in all Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will he leave them, nor go (as he hears they deſign) beyond Sea, a little Governor in <hi>Carolina,</hi> &amp;c. No, he has more Work firſt to do in his Native Soil; they ſhall not be ſo rid of him, nor yet get one Farthing of the 2000 <hi>l,</hi> except they can catch it, and they muſt be very cunning if they can; perhaps they may (as they have hitherto) throw a great deal of <hi>Gare</hi> and Pains, <hi>Trouble and Vexation,</hi> and <hi>good Money</hi> after bad.</p>
            <p>Malice is like its <hi>Father,</hi> namely, Tho it go up and down, ſeeking whom it may devour, yet (like the <hi>Devil</hi> alſo) it is <hi>never weary of Miſchief,</hi> as long as there is any Glimpſe of <hi>Hopes to compaſs it,</hi> and <hi>accompliſh it:</hi> though a worſe Hell upon Earth, nor greater Torment can befall them, than to go on, (as they are willing and eager enough without bidding, and to) proceed<hi>—Halloo!</hi>

Thus have I done at preſent with this mighty <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> and the Defendant's Adverſaries have done too, and gone as far as they can; that is, to make him <hi>retire,</hi> and give him leiſure to <hi>obſerve their Motions,</hi> and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant upon them; that's the <hi>worſt,</hi> and they have <hi>done their worſt.</hi> But out of the <hi>Eater</hi> ſhall come forth <hi>Meat,</hi> and out of the <hi>Strong, ſweetneſs.</hi>

            <p>And really I do not think that Mr. <hi>Hickeringill</hi> has ſo much as a diſpleaſing Thought, or <hi>riſing of Heart,</hi> againſt this Providence of God: for it is God's doings, in the ſecret methods of his Divine Wiſdom; and he beſt knows, by the <hi>ſeeming-croſs-motions,</hi> (as in the Wheels of a Watch or Clock) how to carry on the Maker's Deſign, which puzzles none but the ignorant and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted. <hi>David—</hi>ſpeaks experimentally; I have been young, and now am old, yet have I not ſeen the Righteous forſaken, nor his Seed begging Bread.</p>

            <p>Nay, in a greater Tryal of his patience than this, (namely, the upbraiding and <hi>Curtain Lecture of his Scolding</hi> and diſcontented Wife) he <hi>kept his Ground,</hi>

            <p>No Man can blame the Defendant (notwithſtanding) that he did ſo luſtily and copiouſly defend himſelf, in ſhewing, to the utmoſt, the <hi>vanity of that futile Contrivance</hi> againſt him, from ſuch <hi>ſlender words,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſlenderly,</hi> all grounded upon an old Statute made upon Popiſh Prelacy, <hi>were rampant,</hi> and were willing to ſhelter themſelves by force of Statute-Law, (which they <hi>could</hi> and <hi>did make,</hi> when and as they liſt) to fence againſt the juſt reproof of all good Men, ready to open at them, if their Mouths had not thus been ſtop'd; yet the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> (notwithſtanding) <hi>were not afraid</hi> afterwards, 20. <hi>R.</hi> 2. to complain againſt them, in the <hi>Name of the Commons of England,</hi> and to perſwade the King not to diſoblige his People, for the ſake of a few Court-Prelats.

                  <p>SO <hi>little ſucceſs</hi> has attended <hi>all my former</hi> Addreſſes <hi>that</hi> I am <hi>almost hopeleſs</hi> of this; but underſtanding that your Lordſhip <hi>expected my application,</hi> no deficiency ſhould be on my part.</p>
                  <p>Though I muſt confeſs, that had it not been for this worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>Firman,</hi> (the Bearer hereof) I was not readily perſwaded to write to you.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe you carry my Letters to your Lawyers for them to <hi>pick 'vantages,</hi> and accordingly two of my Letters to your Lordſhip <hi>moſt diſingenuouſly</hi> were read againſt me at the <hi>Tryal,</hi> But the Judg told them they were no proof of your Declaration, yet Sir <hi>Francis Withins</hi> he made mimick and dumb ſigns to the Jury at every word—nay, my <hi>very Books</hi> were brought into Court, and Sir <hi>George Jefferyes juſt ſuch another man</hi> (as the woman ſaid (that <hi>other-hopeful</hi> Council) he pointed at my Books with his <hi>Index,</hi> as <hi>not</hi> knowing <hi>what to ſay</hi> againſt them <hi>without bluſhing,</hi> (of which (yet) he is not very guilty) and <hi>onely made dumb ſhows too,</hi> which were not capable of anſwer or vindication, yet were <hi>ſufficient hints to a willing</hi> Jury that knew <hi>their meaning by their mumping, and their gaping;</hi> and accordingly gave a Verdict <hi>(contrary to all mens expectations)</hi> againſt me, and damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges—2000 l.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I underſtand that this unreaſonable Verdict is ſo pleaſing to you, that in the <hi>jollity of devotion</hi> you have made it a <hi>Deodand;</hi> and intends to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the <hi>Trophee</hi> of your Victory towards the building of <hi>Pauls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ſo, I fear your <hi>Piety is not of the</hi> Cabal, or <hi>Cabinet-Councel</hi> with your <hi>charity;</hi> nor will you find that it is pleaſing to God to make a man an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender for a word,</hi> (and <hi>no ſuch mighty words neither)</hi> if <hi>Trump</hi> had ſwore true, for the <hi>wholly acquitted me</hi> of the words in the <hi>3d.

                  <p>Indeed, <hi>if you had prov'd your Declaration</hi> that the words (firſt) were ſpoken <hi>before divers</hi> the Kings Subjects (nay the words in the laſt Count

                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the other words of <hi>ignorance and impudence,</hi> you will the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remit the <hi>raſhneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeverity</hi> of the expreſſion, ſince <hi>your injustice</hi> in ſending that <hi>illegal Sequestration</hi> of the profits of the ſmall Tithes of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Buttolphs,</hi> (to which I was Inſtituted and Inducted as Rector of <hi>All-Saints</hi> long before you were <hi>quartered in Colcheſter</hi> with your Brother <hi>Compton's</hi> Troop.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, if you <hi>do me no good,</hi> you <hi>did ill cauſeleſly</hi> to provoke me, and <hi>in hopes</hi> to do me a <hi>miſchief;</hi> you did <hi>act illegally,</hi> and <hi>contrary to Law.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And do but think <hi>impartially</hi> with your ſelf what a diſparagement it is to <hi>your judgment and skill in men,</hi> not onely to <hi>prefer to your favour</hi> ſuch a Creature <hi>before me,</hi> but in <hi>favour of him,</hi> to endeavour by an <hi>illegal Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> to wrong me of my <hi>right,</hi> and ſo take what is <hi>mine and give it</hi> to him: you may do <hi>lawfully</hi> what you will with <hi>your own,</hi> but what have you to do (unlawfully) to <hi>take mine from me</hi> to give it <hi>to him?</hi> a Fellow that is not ſo good as a Chip in Broth.</p>

                  <p>This Loyal Long-Parliament plainly told the King in their Addreſs againſt Duke <hi>Lauderdale—Feb.</hi> 23.—75.

                  <p>And in their Addreſſes againſt the King's Declaration of Indulgence—they tell his Majeſty plainly, but with all Humility—That Penal Statutes in Matters Eccleſiaſtical (mark that) cannot be ſuſpended but by Act of Parliament—and yet ſome Judges have been of another Opinion, (I know who, and where, and when, when time ſhall ſerve.)</p>

                  <p>For a Concluſion, to give you the true <hi>Character</hi> of this man (Dr. <hi>Edward Manwaring)</hi> whom I never ſaw, I will ſhew it you by one whom I know to be contrary to him<hi>—Samuel—</hi>(we know all to be a true Prophet, now we read of <hi>Samuel—</hi>that he writ the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in a Book, and laid it up before the Lord.

                  </p>
                  <p>But, Mr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi> finding the <hi>Law</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> written in Books, tears it in pieces, and that in the preſence of the Lord <hi>(right Tantivee)</hi> in a Pulpit, that the King may not know what to <hi>command,</hi> nor <hi>the People what to obey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> being contrary to a true Prophet, muſt needs be a falſe One, and the Judgment of a falſe Prophet <hi>(mark that)</hi> belongs to him.</p>

            <p>Beſides, I doubt not but 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 2. is in force; for though it is repeal'd by 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. yet that 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. is repeal'd by 1 <hi>Jacob.</hi> 25. and <hi>Samſon</hi> is unbound again <hi>Remoto Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimento Reviveſcit;</hi> and herewith agreeth the Book-Caſe in 15. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> Petition Placit. 2. <hi>Coke</hi> mag. chart, 686.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that 4: Jacob two queſtions were moved, firſt whether any Biſhops made eſpecially ſince the firſt day of that firſt Seſſions of Parliament. 1 Jacob. <hi>were lawful or no.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Whether the Proceedings in the Eccleſiaſtical-Courts, being made <hi>under the name</hi> Stile <hi>and Seal of the Biſhop</hi> were warranted by Law?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtices</hi> agreed that 1 Edw. 6. 2. <hi>was in force—</hi>for though the Act 1. Eliz. 1. Revive the 25. Hen. 8. 20. Which Empowers Biſhops to Act as formerly, (and conſequently or obliquely the 1 Ed. 6. 2. is ſtruck at) yet can any man in his right wits imagine that it is either true or ſafe, that a Statute ſhould be repealed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and by conſequence without the leaſt thought thereof in the Legiſlators? <hi>this would be of moſt dangerous conſequence.</hi> But the Legiſlators could not think of repealing that which was <hi>actually</hi> and expreſly at <hi>that time repealed</hi> already by 1. Mar. 2. nor of repealing the Ed. 6. 2. by 1. and 2. Phil. and Mar. 8. which was repealed already by 1 Mar. and 1. 2. Phil. Mar. that does not <hi>repeal</hi> 1 Ed. 6. 2. <hi>by name</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents will not do, nor inferences, this is tricks and wiredrawing, to defeat a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Law by fineſs or nicety of Wit, or Lawyers-Criticiſms. And therefore there is <hi>no need of flying</hi> to 1 Eliz. 1. for the repeal af 1. 2. Phil. Mar. 8. yet the Judges ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally extrajudicially were of <hi>another opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe deſerves the Reſolution of the Judges in open-Court, or in a Parliament, or both; an <hi>extrajudicial Judgment then has been</hi> in Jan 4 and 1 July 1637 and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es gave their opinions as the Biſhops beſt liked, (Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> eſpecially) but the ſame Judges alſo to pleaſe him, were for the Legallity of Ship-money, and cuſtomes (unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Parliament) ſee Appendix of Dr. <hi>Godolphins</hi> Abridgment of Laws. and <hi>Coke Inſtit.</hi> C. 2. p. 685. 686. the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> was overawed by the High-Commiſſion Court, now <hi>the Law</hi> is not in awe, though the <hi>Gentleman</hi> that gives <hi>this Narrative</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Tryall</hi> did <hi>not take it in ſhort-hand</hi> (he that has ſo <hi>vaſt a memory ſhall not need)</hi> nor yet is willing to be known to be the Author of theſe obſervations; not that there is a a word or line in this book that he is not prompt, and at hand and <hi>(to chuſe)</hi> willing to
