            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I will onely for Countries confine my selfe to Niniueh, and for sinnes to <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Niniueh a heathen towne, built by a wicked brood, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by a wicked crew, yet repenting Niniueh is pardoned. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> a manifold sinner, a customary sinner, a most deadly sinner, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is forgiuen, The Iew brings me into two christian
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9004:26"/>
meditations about Niniueh, or into two wholesome Passions: Feare and Hope. God sees the sinnes of Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueh, then I know mine are not hid, this breeds in me feare of punishment: But God forgiues the sinnes of Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueh, then I hope mine are not vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: this breeds hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse. <hi>Col debhaurau she amar le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hareang libhne Adam</hi> (saith the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin) <hi>bithnai im lo jashubhu. All the euills that God threatens to men, are threatned with this condition, if they doe not repent.</hi> As before the Iew spake comfort and truth, so here hee linkes comfort and terrour. God threatens euill, there is terrour, but it is with condition, there is comfort. Niniueh finds both in the story, <hi>Fourty dayes and Niniueh shall be destroyed,</hi> there is a threatned terrour: <hi>But the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the euill that hee spake to doe vnto them, and did it not,</hi> there is a comforting condition. So that as <hi>Dauid</hi> does, so will I hopefully and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9004:26"/>
yet fearefully sing of mercy and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: First mercy, then iudgement: Mercy vpon my repentance, lest I bee cast downe: and Iudgement vpon my sinnes, lest I be lifted vp. Mercy in Iudgement, and Iudgement in mercy. Is there any one that desperatly reiects Niniuehs exhibited mercy? let him feare Niniuehs threatned iudgment, or is there any that trembles at Niniuehs threatned Iudgement? let him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himselfe by Niniuehs obtaining mercy. But in the mouth of two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, let the mercy bee confirmed. Let mee take <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> with Niniueh, and as I see in it the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a multitude of sinners, so I may see in her, of a multitude of sinnes. Those many sinners pardoned as one man, those many sinnes made as none at all. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaking of her washing of Christs feet, saies, shee came thither a sinner, but shee went thence a Saint: She came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Aethiope and a leopard, but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9004:27"/>
shee went thence with changed skin, and cancelled spots. But how was this done? She fell at the feet of Christ, and with sighs from her heart, she vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the sinnes from her soule, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternere &amp; tu anima mea,</hi> as saith the same <hi>Bernard.</hi> And cast thou thy selfe downe, oh my soule, before the feet of Christ, wipe them with thine haires, wash them with thy teares, which teares washing his feet may also purge thy soule. Wash his feet, and wash thy selfe with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> till hee say to thee as hee did to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Magdalen,</hi> thy sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.</p>

            <head>CAP. XVI. Of sacrifice.</head>
            <p>SAcrifice is within a little as old as sinne, and sinne not much younger then the world. <hi>Adam</hi> on the day of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9004:27"/>
his creation (as is most probable) sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and sacrificeth: and on the next day after meditates on that wherunto his sacrifice aimeth, euen Christ. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> imitate the matter of their fathers piety, sacrifice; but <hi>Cain</hi> comes farre short in the manner. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> hath fire from heauen to answer him, and <hi>Cain</hi> is as hot as fire because he hath not. <hi>Noah</hi> takes an odd cleane beast of euery kind into his Arke for this purpose, to sacrifice him, after his Deliuery. And so hee does: but for the Chaldee Paraphrasts fancie, that he <hi>sacrificed on the very same Altar, whereon Adam and Cain and Abel had sacrificed so long before.</hi> I referre it to the beliefe of a Iew, who by the Poet seemes to be of a large faith, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat Iudaeus apella.</hi> Decencie and order was obserued of the Fathers before the Law, for this holy peece of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. God makes <hi>Moses</hi> in his Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus to bring it into writing. While the Iewes Temple stood, or while
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9004:28"/>
they might stand in the Temple, they had their dayly sacrifice, till the great Sacrificer offering himselfe, caused sacrifice and oblation to cease. Now are the Iewes content, and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in their Common Prayer booke, they beseech God to be so too, with prayers without sacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not now accesse to their sacrificing place. Their distresse (as they thinke it) for this very thing, might teach them that <hi>Messias Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidh</hi> or <hi>Christ the Prince</hi> hath done what <hi>Daniel</hi> to them, and an Angell to <hi>Daniel</hi> had prophecyed of him.</p>
            <p>Whether the Heathens borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their custome of sacrificing from the Iewes or from nature, it is not materiall. Sure I am, that the Iewes borrowed some of their abhominable sacrifices from the Heathen: Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of men is Heathenish, in <hi>Moses</hi> his language: yet was this too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among the Iewes, vsed also in old time by the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:9004:28"/>
as witnesse <hi>Plutarch, Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius</hi> and others: and in these times by the <hi>Indians,</hi> as in <hi>Cortes,</hi> &amp;c. Of this bad vse (that the Heathen had got) I cannot tell what should be the reason, vnlesse they thought that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty was the best offering, or that their gods were more cruell then mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull. Or this reason may bee giuen. They had learned either from the Iewes, or from their Oracles, or from the Deuill himselfe (who cares not to giue men some light, thereby to leade them to the more darkenesse) that a man should once bee offered, who should appease the wrath of God (as Christ was) and therefore they in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this man, did sacrifice men, either to see whether they could light on this man, or els in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him till he should come.</p>
            <p>Some condemne <hi>Iephthae</hi> of this cruelty of sacrificing his owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; who yet in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his faith: <hi>Austen</hi> doubts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9004:29"/>
whether it is to bee counted Gods Commandement, that hee slew his owne child. But I thinke no such doubt is necessary, since there is no such strictnesse of the words in the text. A Heathen man in <hi>Plutarch</hi> when he was told that he must either sacrifice his owne child to such a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, or else his affaires and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses would not prosper, could answer, <hi>that he would offer with all his heart such sacrifice as the Goddesse would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but that she would desire or would be pleased with the bloud and murder of his child, he could not be perswaded.</hi> I am sure <hi>Iephta</hi> had reason to bee farre better instructed in such things as these, then any Heathen in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Varro</hi> holds that it was not fit that any sacrifice at all should be offered. His reason in <hi>Arnobius</hi> is: <hi>Quiae Dij ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri neque desiderantea, neque deposcunt; ex aere autem facti, testâ, gypso, vel marmore multò minus haec curant.</hi> For
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9004:29"/>
saith he, <hi>the true Gods desire not, nor exact any such matter, and those false gods that are made of brasse, mortar, marble &amp;c. care lesse for them.</hi> The Heathen man in his owne sense saith truly, for his meaning doubtlesse is, that the Gods that are true Gods are not delighted with this cruelty of slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beasts, nor do they for their owne sustentation or prouision desire men to be at this charge. And so the true God which is truth it selfe, though he commanded sacrifice, yet was it not meerely in respect of himselfe that he did it, any further then this, that men should by this manner of worship, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their submission and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and obedience to him. For what cares he for beast or bullocke, <hi>since the world is his and all that is in it, Psal.</hi> 50.12. And <hi>Lyranus</hi> does set downe the speciall ends wherefore God doth command <hi>Israel</hi> so many sacrifices.</p>
            <p>As first to weane them from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: for their seruice of the true God
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9004:30"/>
required so much, that they could haue hardly any time to thinke of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. And the very beasts they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, might teach them the vanitie of the Idols of Aegypt which they once serued: Slaying of a bullocke, a ramme, a goat, might tell them that the Aegyptians Apis and Hammon which they worshipped in these formes, were but vanity.</p>
            <p>Secondly: by their sacrifices, they acknowledged that they had nothing but what they had receiued from God, and therefore of their beasts, corne, wine, &amp;c. they offered him in thankfulnesse some of his owne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: these sacrifices were to beare Christ in their minds till hee should come and make a full attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them. And so saies <hi>Lyra,</hi> the very beasts sacrificed, represent Christ, an oxe for patience, a sheepe for innocence, and an ill smelling goat, for his likenesse to sinfull flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:9004:30"/>A fourth reason might be giuen: that the people standing and seeing these beasts slaine and fired, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their owne deseruings, and call to mind their sinnes for which this beast was thus vsed. Their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their hands (the right hand saith the Chaldee) vpon the head of the beast, seemes to import some such a matter as their acknowledgement, of their deseruing of that which the beast was ready to suffer, death and fire. Whosoeuer desires to be taken vp with Allegories about this piece of Gods seruice, <hi>Flauiacensis</hi> will furnish him: and if he will not do, the Fathers are copious enough, and it may be too much this way.</p>
            <p>The Heathen Mariners in shippe with <hi>Ionah,</hi> are said to sacrifice and vow vowes: which the Chaldee helpes out (as thinking the ship and a tempest vnfit time and place for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) thus, <hi>they promised they would sacrifice:</hi> viz. when they should
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9004:31"/>
come ashore, and vowed vowes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Proselytes, saith <hi>Iarchi,</hi> or to giue Almes to the poore, saith <hi>Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi.</hi> Endlesse it were to trace the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and to see how neere or how farre they be to or from the sacrifices of the Iewes.</p>

His heart and eyes are both cast downe, the one as farre as hell, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fact had sunke, and the other to the earth, whither the bloud. He is now wearie of his owne life, as ere-while he was of anothers.

At last hee is paid in his owne coine, and hires his owne murderer with that price wherewith he himselfe was hired. And so perish all such whose feet are swift to shed bloud, and he that strikes with an vnlawfull sword, be strucken with a lawfull againe. This mans case makes mee to thinke of <hi>Cain</hi> the old grandsire of all murderers. Of his heauy doome and misery, and burden and banishment. <hi>Dauid</hi> once groaned

            <p>The greatest authority of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation appeareth, in that the holy Greeke of the new Testament doth so much follow it. For as God vsed this translation for a Harbinger to the fetching in of the Gentiles, so when it was growen into Authority by the time of Christs comming, it seemed good to his infinite wisdome to adde to its Authority himselfe, the better to forward the building of the Church. And admirable it is to see with what sweetnesse and Harmony the New Testament doth follow this translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, sometime euen besides the letter of the old, to shew that he that gaue the old, may and can best expound it in the new.</p>

As that he should be the sonne of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta</hi> widow, whom <hi>Eliah</hi> raised to life: And because the mother of the child said, <hi>Now I know that the word of God in thy mouth is true,</hi> therefore he is called <hi>Ben Amittai, the sonne of my truth</hi>: whether the story may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ben Amittai,</hi> or a true storie, let the reader censure, by the two townes of <hi>Sarepta</hi> and <hi>Gath-hepher.</hi> Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Ionah</hi> was wondrous in his birth, I am sure he was wondrous in his life. A Prophet, and a runnagate, before his shipwracke, a man drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and yet aliue, in his shipwracke, and a Preacher of repentance, and yet a Repiner at Repentance, after. The
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9004:42"/>
least wonder in the booke is not the conuersion of Niniueh. It was <hi>a great wonder</hi> (as D. <hi>Kimchi</hi> saies) <hi>that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah was in the belly of the fish three daies and three nights and yet liued. And it was another wonder that he was not stupid but continued in his senses and intellectuals and prayed:</hi> And do but well consider it, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare almost as great a wonder, that Niniueh so great a town, so long wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in so short time should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. To say as <hi>Rabbi Ioshuah</hi> doth, <hi>that the men of the ship were got to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niueh, and had told all the occurrence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ionah, how they had throwen him ouer hatches, and yet he it was that was among them, and therefore they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the sooner,</hi> as it is without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so doth it lessen the wonder of the townes conuersion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> an vnknowne man, of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne people, to come into so great a City with a <hi>Fourty dayes and Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueh shall be destroyed,</hi> was strange. But
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9004:43"/>
for the King vpon so short a time, to send a cryer to proclaime repentance, is as strange if not stranger. <hi>Ionah</hi> proclaimes the towne shall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, the King (in a manner) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes, the towne shall not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, by proclaiming the meanes how to saue it, Repentance. To say as

               </note>
               <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> does, <hi>that because the City is called Gnir gedholah leelohim, a great citie of God, that therfore they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God in old time, but now in Ionahs time began to do euill,</hi> is still to lessen the wonder, about their conuersion: a stranger repentance then which the world neuer saw. The old world had a time of warning, of yeares, for Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuehs houres, and <hi>yet eat and drunke till the flood came, and then in the flouds of many waters, Repentance and Prayers would not come neere God, Psal.</hi> 32. Faire warning had Sodome by the preaching of <hi>Lot,</hi> whose righteous soule they vexed, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, till their Hell (as it were) began
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9004:43"/>
from heauen, and fire and brimstone brought them to the lake of fire and brimstone: and when the wicked seed of him that derided his fathers naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, perished for their naked beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and their flames of lust brought them to flames on earth and in hell. The men of Niniueh shall rise vp in iudgement against the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Iewes, and condemne them, because these at the preaching of <hi>Ionah</hi> repented, and they not for the preaching of a greater then <hi>Ionah,</hi> that was among them. When the Master of the vineyard sent his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, nay his owne sonne, they put him to death. In the conuersion and deliuerie of Niniueh I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a double mercy of God, who (to vse a fathers words) <hi>sic dedit peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus veniam, qui sic dedit peccantibus penitentiam</hi>: who was so ready vpon their repentance to grant them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who was so ready vpon his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to giue them repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:9004:44"/>Other kind of entertainment (then <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> had) had he, that came from <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> Bishop of Rome, to preach to our Realme of England. The passage of which story our countriman <hi>Bede</hi> hath fully related. That when <hi>Austen</hi> had preached the Gospell to the King, and dehorted him from his irreligious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: your words (saith the King) are good, but I haue beene trained vp so in the religion I now follow, that I cannot forsake it to change for a new. This argument too many superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous soules ground vpon in these dayes, choosing rather to erre with <hi>Plato,</hi> then to follow the truth with another. Desiring rather to be, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they desire, of a false religion, then to forsake the profession of their Parents and Predecessors. Not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (like good fellowes) to go to hell for company, rather then to heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Such a boon companion was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardus</hi> king of the <hi>Phrisons</hi>: of whom it is recorded, that whereas a Bishop
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9004:44"/>
had perswaded him so farre towards Christianity, as that he had got him into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water to baptize him: the king there questions, which way his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers went, which died vnbaptized, whether to heauen or hell? The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop answers, that most certainely they were gone to hell. Then will I go the same way with them (saith the wicked king) and pulls backe his foot out of the water, and would not bee baptized at all. <hi>Hoc animus meminisse horret luctu<expan>

            <head>CAP. XXVI. Of the Iewes Sacraments, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and Passeouer.</head>
            <p>BOth these Sacraments of the Iewes were with bloud: both in figure: the one to carrie the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Christ till he came, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the passion of him being come. <hi>Abraham receiued the signe of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9004:45"/>
the seale of the righteousnesse of faith which he had when he was vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised: Rom.</hi> 4. The Israelites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the institution of the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in Aegypt: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. I will not stand to allegorize these matters, of the time and manner of receiuing these two, but onely of the things themselues.</p>
            <p>Circumcision giuen in such a place is not for nothing: but in the place of generation, it is giuen <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a seale of his faith, that <hi>he should be the father of all those that beleeue, Rom.</hi> 4. And especially a seale to him of Christs comming from those loines neere to which his circumcision was. And appertaining to this I take to be the oath that <hi>Abraham</hi> giues his seruant, and that <hi>Iacob</hi> giues <hi>Ioseph,</hi> with their hands put vnder their thighes <note n="*" place="margin">As the Iewes think.</note> not to sweare by their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but by Christ that should come from those thighes. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was also vsed for distinction of an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9004:45"/>
Israelite, at the first: and hence were they distinguished; but in time, <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> had taught his race so much, and Aegyptians, Phaenicians, Arabians, and the countries about them grew circumcised. So was <hi>Pythagoras</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, that he might haue accesse to the recluse misteries of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians religion.</p>
            <p>Circumcision was also vsed with the Iewes as Baptisme with vs, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission into the Church of Israel. And it was Gods expresse command that the child on the eight day should be circumcised. <hi>And on that day more then any other</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten) to signifie Christs resurrection, who rested the weekes end in the graue, and rose on the eight day</hi>: And if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> say true, one may giue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why not before the eight day: <hi>because a child for the seuen dayes is most dangerous for weakenesse.</hi> A stranger was so admitted to their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.48. And of this does
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:9004:46"/>
               <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> fantastically expound that verse in <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.16. <hi>Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red sacrifice:</hi> whereupon the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Iew saith thus. <hi>As soone as the mariners saw (when they drew neere to Niniueh) all the wonders that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God did to Ionah, they stood and cast euery one his gods into the sea. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Ioppa, and went vp to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and circumcised the flesh of their fore-skin, as it is said. And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sacrifices: what sacrifice? but this bloud of the circumcision which is as the blood of a sacrifice: And they vowed to bring euery one his wife and children, and all that he had, to feare the Lord God of Ionah: and they vowed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was indeed the way to admit proselytes, by circumcision, but in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> time, when they became Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes by thousands, they admitted them by <hi>Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Whether the neglect of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision (as I may so tearme it) in the wildernesse, were meerely politicke, because of their more fitnesse, for any moments remoouall, and march, or whether some mysterie were in it I will not decide. Nor need I relate how the Iewes vse to circumcise their children, for the great <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> hath punctually done it: Nor can I relate how highly the Iewes prize their Circumcision, for one might gather volumes out of them vpon this subiect. For they consider not, <hi>that he is not a Iew, which is one outward: neither is that circumcision which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the flesh. But he is a Iew which is one within, and the circumcision is of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God.</hi>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9004:51"/>
would not be so vnderualued by one people. Therefore when Israel wanted strength to keepe this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, they do it by sleight. And so it is the thrice-learned Master <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> opinion, that the Septuagint when they were to translate the Bible, and were to speake of the seuenty soules of <hi>Iacobs</hi> house, they durst not put downe the iust number of seuenty, least tales should haue beene told out of their schooles (concerning their scornefull doctrine) and when the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and the number should both come to the King of Egypt, the meet number might maintaine the truth of the rumour, and by both they might incurre danger, therefore they added fiue more, to spoile the roundnesse of the summe,<note place="margin">So in Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 10. the Septuag. put in 2.

A whole dozen of them, <hi>Canaan</hi> and his eleuen sonnes sit down close together, in, or (at least) not farre out of the small compasse of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan: where they all differed not, (if any at all did) in language, being seated so nigh together.

                  <hi>Quaest.</hi> 60. on Gen.</note> 
               <hi>Theodorets</hi> opinion, but that all these, and Canaan differed in mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tongues, before Israel planted it, I cannot conceiue. Nay, that Canaan spake Hebrew before <hi>Ioshua</hi> came there, I could be perswaded to beleeue for three reasons.</p>
            <p>First: the old names of Canaan townes are significant in Hebrew: <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, troden downe,</hi> by Heathens then, as it is now by the Turkes, <hi>Kirjath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbang, the City of arbang</hi>: Iosh. 14.15. <hi>Iericho, he shall smell it,</hi> the City
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9004:53"/>
of Palme-trees. The sinfull City <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim</hi> hath in the text a faire Hebrew name, <hi>Zebhiim,</hi> that is, the <hi>Roes,</hi> a name too good for so bad a towne, therefore the margin giues it another name, <hi>Zebhojim.</hi> Infinite it is to trace all Hebrew-Canaanitish names, who will may trie at pleasure and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>condly: Sure I am, that one chief towne in <hi>Canaan</hi> (if not then also as afterward the chiefest) that is <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> was <hi>Hebrew</hi> when it was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Melchizedek</hi> or <hi>Sem:</hi> who were all one, as the <note n="*" place="margin">See the Targums on Gen. 10.</note> Chaldees, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly. I see that a woman <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> vnderstands the Hebrewes at the first sight, and speakes to them (for ought wee finde) without interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9004:53"/>I find the Amorites and Sidonians differing in the name of Hermon, one calling it Sirion, and the other She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nir, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.9. But I see not, but both the Hebrewes, and some Canaanites agree in the name Hermon. This groundworke then of seuenty mens being named in the tenth of <hi>Genesis</hi> to import necessarily seuenty tongues in the eleuenth chapter, I cannot enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: yet referre my selfe to better iudgement.</p>
            <p>The second reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or seuenty tongues they fetch out of <hi>Moses: Deut.</hi> 32.8. from these words: <hi>when the most high diuided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sonnes of Adam, he set the bounds of the people, according to the number of the children of Israel.</hi> What all Iewes thought and gathered from that place, let two speake for the rest: Those be <hi>Ionathan ben Vzziel,</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si.

When he scattered the generation of the diuision, it was in his power to haue passed them out of the world, yet did he not so, but sets borders of the people. He reserues them, and does not destroy them.

            <p>THat the Hebrew tongue was from the foundation of the world, none denie, but whether the letters
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9004:55"/>
be so ancient, some question. Some hold that those letters that God wrote with his owne hand in the two tables, were the first letters that euer were written. The studious <hi>Pliny</hi> thinkes, <hi>that among the Assyrians, letters haue beene alwayes,</hi> but <hi>Gellius</hi> thinks they were inuented in <hi>Egypt</hi> by <hi>Mercury,</hi> and others think among the Syrians. If we examine <hi>Pliny</hi> well, we shall find him true in the first and last, howeuer in the middle. If the Assyrian tongue were the Chaldee tongue (as most like it was) then were those letters from the beginning of the world: the Hebrew and Chaldee letter, being all one, vnlesse the Assyrian differed from both. If you take Syrian in the sence that <hi>Theodoret</hi> does for Hebrew, then <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes true, that letters were first among the Syrians.

That the Phaenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Syrians first found out letters, is a receiued opinion in <hi>Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus. Eupolemus</hi> thinkes that the Phaenicians receiued Grammar from the Iewes, and the Greeks from the Phaenicians. And <hi>Euphorus</hi> thinks that <hi>Cadmus</hi> was hee that conueyed them. <hi>Chaerilus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> makes Phaenicians and Iewes all one.

                  <l>A wondrous people marcht behind along:</l>
                  <l>Their Dialect was the Phaenician tongue.</l>
                  <l>On hill of Solymae they dwelt: thereby</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These Phaenicians (if you will call
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9004:56"/>
them so) or Iewes, were the first that had letters. But the Iewes were not Phaenicians indeed nor their tongue the same, yet for bordering of their Countries, the Poet makes them all one. The Phaenician is not now to be had, vnlesse the <note n="*" place="margin">The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>slating of the word <hi>Phaenicia</hi> in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, seemes to confirme this for true.</note>Punick or Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, and Phaenick or Phaenician, were all one (which most like they were) And then some few lines of the tongue are to be found in <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Paenulus,</hi> which as <hi>Paraeus</hi> saith, can little or nothing be made off. <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> speakes of <hi>Sancuniathou,</hi> that wrote the Phaenician history in the same tongue, but more of the language he saith not: But to the matter. That letters were so long in vse before the giuing of the Law, I am induced to beleeue vpon these reasons.</p>
            <p>First <hi>Iosephus</hi> is of this mind, that letters were before the flood. And the Scripture cites <hi>Enochs</hi> prophecie, which whether it were written by him or not, is vncertaine: yet if there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9004:56"/>
were any such thing, those many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we find of it in <hi>Tertullian, Clemens,</hi> and others, do argue, that so much could not punctually bee kept by word of mouth.</p>
            <p>A second reason to mooue mee to thinke of letters before the giuing of the Law is, to thinke of <hi>Iosephs</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in Egypt, which seeme almost impossible without writing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: But omitting that, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how all arts and sciences in the world should then flourish, as (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their infancy) they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the groundworke of all learning, letters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly: Againe for the Iewes, vpon the writing of the law to be put to spelling (as they that had neuer seene letters before) and not to be able to reade it, had beene a law vpon the law, adding to the hardnesse of it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly: Nor can I thinke, that when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>blot me out of thy book</hi> that hee taketh the Metaphor from

            <head>CAP. XXX. Of the Hebrew tongue.</head>
            <p>WHo so will goe about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Hebrew tongue, may iustly receiue the censure, that he of Rome did, who had made a long booke in the praise of <hi>Hercules: This labour is in vaine, for neuer any one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praised Hercules.</hi> Other commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this tongue needeth none, then what it hath of its selfe, namely, for Sanctitie it was the tongue of God, and for Antiquitie it was the tongue of <hi>Adam</hi>: God the first founder, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> the first speaker of it. In this tong were laid vp the mysteries of the old Testament. It begun with the world and the Church, and continued &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in glory, till y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captiuitie in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, which was a Babel to this tongue, and brought to confusion this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first confusion, had
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:9004:58"/>
escaped without ruine. At their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, it was in some kinde repaired, but farre from former perfection. The holy Scriptures veiwed by <hi>Ezra,</hi> a scribe fit for the kingdome of heauen, in whose treasure were things new and old. In the <hi>Maccabean</hi> times all went to ruine, language and lawes and all lost: and since that time to this day, the pure Hebrew hath lost her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie, being onely knowne by schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or at least not without teaching. Our Sauiours times spake the Syrian, <hi>Kepha, Golgotha, Talitha,</hi> and other words do witnesse; In aftertimes the vnwearied Masorites arose, helpers to preserue the Bible Hebrew intire, and Grammarians helpers to preserue the Idiome aliue; but for restoring it to the old familiaritie, neither of them could preuaile. For, the Iewes haue at this day no abiding citie, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, no proper tongue, but speake as the countries wherein they liue. This whereof they were once
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9004:58"/>
most nice is gone, and this groat they haue lost. As the man in <hi>Seneca</hi> that through sicknes lost his memorie, and forgot his own name; so they for their sin haue lost their language, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their own tongue. Their <hi>Cain</hi>-like wandring, after the murther of their brother, according to the flesh, Christ Iesus, hath lost them this precious marke of Gods fauour, and branded them with a worse marke: <hi>Cauterio conspirationis antiquae,</hi> as saith Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in another case. Before the confusion of tongues all the world spake their tongue and no other, but since the confusion of the Iewes, they speake the language of all the world, and not their owne. And that it is not with them so, onely of late, but hath been long; <hi>Theodoret</hi> beareth witnesse in these words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Other nations</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue their children speaking quickly in their owne mother tongue. Howbeit, there are no children of the Hebrewes who naturally spake the Hebrew tongue,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9004:59"/>
but the language of the countrie where they are borne. Afterward when they grow vp they are taught the letters, and learne to read the holy Scripture in the Hebrew tongue. Thus Theod. in quaest. on Gen</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 59.60.</p>
            <p>About this their training vp of their children, and growth of men, in their owne tongue and learning: a Rabbin hath this saying in <hi>Pirke Auoth.</hi> Perek. 1. <hi>Ben He He saith. At fiue yeares old for the Scripture, at ten for Mishneh, at thirteene</hi>

               <hi>for Profoundnesse, at nintie for Meditation, at one hundred he is as dead and past and gone out of the world.</hi> The Iewes looke for a pompous kingdome, when <hi>Messias</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> shall come, whom they watch for euerie
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9004:59"/>
moment till he come, as it is in the 12. Article of their Creed, in their common prayer booke. Hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them (as they hope) a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kingdome (and of that minde, till they were better taught, were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Acts 1.6.) and then their tongue shall reuiue againe, as they surmise. But the diuine Apocaliptick writing after Ierusalem was ruined, might teach them what the second Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem must be, not on earth but from heauen, Apoc. 21, 2. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their tongue.</p>
            <p>The characters, we now haue the Hebrew tongue in, <hi>Scaliger</hi> thinkes are but of a latter hatch, and not the same that the Iewes vsed from <hi>Moses,</hi> till the destruction of the temple. For, that they vsed the Phaenician or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanaean character, which now is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Samaritan. How truely I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the Readers iudgement.</p>
            <p>The character wee now haue is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a set or a running letter: the first,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9004:60"/>
the Bible is ordinarily Printed in, in the latter the most of the Rabbins.</p>
            <p>The whole tongue is contained in the Bible, and no one booke else in the world, containes in it a whole language. And this shewes that the Scripture speakes to all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, since it speakes of all sorts of things. This language is (as God said the Iewes should bee, if they would keepe his Law.) A lender to all, and a borrower of none. All tongues are in debt to this, and this to none. The Easterne most especially must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this. <hi>Some men in the East (saith Origen) reserue their old speech, (meaning by likelihood the Hebrew) and haue not altered it, but haue continued in the Easterne tongue, because they haue continued in the Easterne countries.</hi> No Easterne tongue that I haue heard of, is Hebrew now, so that what to say to <hi>Origen</hi> I cannot tell, vnlesse he meane that those that haue continued in the East, haue kept neerest this holy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9004:60"/>
tongue, because neerest the holy land: this to be true is knowne to the meanest learned. In their speech it is apparent, and by their writing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. All of them haue learned from the Hebrew, to write from the right hand to the left (or as we vsuall call it in England, to write, and reade backward:) The <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi> writing excepted, which is indeed from the right hand to the left, but not with the lines crossing the leafe as other tongues doe, but the lines downe the leafe. A strange way by it selfe.</p>
            <p>Againe, most of the Easterne tongues do vse the Hebrew character for quicke writing, or some other end. The Chaldee letter is the verie fame. The Syrian though it haue two or three kinds of its owne, yet is content sometime to take vpon it the Hebrew character. The Arabian doth the like, especially the Iewes in Turkie vse in hatred of Mahumetans, to write
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9004:61"/>
downe their matters of Religion; in the Hebrew character, though in the Arabian tongue. So do the Christian Arabians for the same cause in their holy things, vse the Arabian tongue, but Syrian letter. And I take a place in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to be meant to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, also about the Persian tongue. His words out of another are these. <hi>The Persians besides their owne letters do also vse the letters of the Syrians: as in our times many nations vse the Greeke, though almost euery nation hath a proper character.</hi> I referre to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to iudge whether hee meane not that the Persians (as other countries about them did,) did vse the Hebrew character for their quicke writing: which is called Syrian by <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To speake of the grace, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and fulnesse of the Hebrew tongue, is to no purpose to relate, for euen those that cannot reade this tongue haue reade thus much of it.</p>

            <head>CAP. XXXI. Of Vowels.</head>
            <p>EAsterne tongues, especially the Hebrew and her three Dialects, Chaldee, Syrian, and Arabian, are written sometimes with vowells, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without: with, for certainty, without, for the speedier writing: we haue Hebrew Bibles of both kinds. The Septuagint it seemes translated by the vnpricked Bible, as S, <hi>Hierome</hi> in his commentary vpon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets seemeth to import, &amp; as to any one that examineth it is easie to find. Instead of all other places in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. it is apparant: where the seuenty Translators reseruing the letters haue strangely altered the vowels.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew hath it thus. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Halo im tetibh seeth, weim lo tetibh lephatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahh hhatatha rebhats.</hi> Which is: <hi>If thou do well in offering and do not well in diuiding thou hast sinned, be quiet.</hi> This, follow with one consent, the Greeke and many of the Latine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: They could not thus translate, because they knew not the text, or because they wanted pointed Bibles, but on set purpose to hide pearles from swine (as the best learned think.) But that they did alwayes misse on set purpose (where they missed) their many lapses seeme to deny: but som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they mistooke the vnpricked text, and so misconstrued. A vowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bible they might haue had but would not.</p>
            <p>Some there bee that thinke the vowels of the Hebrew, were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented for many yeares After Christ.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9004:62"/>
Which to mee seemeth to be all one, as to deny sinewes to a body: or to keepe an infant vnswadled, and to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to turne and bend any way till hee grow out of fashion. For mine owne satisfaction I am fully resolued, that the letters and vowels of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew were as the soule and body in a child, knit together at their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and beginning: and that they had both one Author.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For, first a tongue cannot bee learned without vowells, though at last, skill and practice may make it to be read without. Grammar and not nature makes men to do this, and this also helped out with the sence of the place we read.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Masorites should amend that which the Septuagint could not see, and that they should read righter, then the other (who were of farre greater Authority) I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Lastly, it is aboue the skill of a meere man to point the Bible; nay, scarsely a verse as it is. The ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements may puzzle all the world for that skill.</p>

            <p>THe two Testaments are like the Apostles at Ierusalem (when the confusion of tongues at Babel was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recompensed with multiplicitie of tongues at Sion) speaking in different languages, but speaking both to one purpose. They differ from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely in language and time: but for matter the new is veiled in the old,

The old (as all can tell) is written in Hebrew, but some forraigne langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are also admitted into Scripture, besides the Hebrew, as forraigne nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to be admitted also to the Church besides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes.

The first are as it were his backe parts, by which we behold him a farre off: The latter shewes him to vs face to face. The world is as a booke consisting of three leaues, and euerie leafe printed with many letters, and euery letter a lecture. The leaues heauen, the aire, and earth with the water.

               <hi>MOSES</hi> in the first verse of the Bible refutes three heathen opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: namely theirs, that thought the world was eternall, for he saith, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but few mark how sweetly this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with the same Phrase in manner, in the <hi>Haphtara</hi> which is read by the Iewes to this portion of <hi>Moses</hi>

               </note> Elohim he created heauen and earth. The first word <hi>in the beginning</hi> may draw our mindes and thoughts to the last thing, the latter end, and this thought must draw our affections from too much loue of the world, for it must haue an end as it had a beginning. I will not stand to comment vpon the word <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reshith in the beginning,</hi> for then I know not when to come to an end. To treat how the diuerse expositors la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour about the beginning of the world, is a world of labour. How the <hi>Ierus.

Satisfied am I with this, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9004:82"/>
the world and all things had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from God, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning created heauen and earth. Some of the Iewes do inuert the word <hi>Bereshith,</hi> and make it <hi>Betisri</hi> that is in the moneth <hi>Tisri</hi> was the world crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This month is about our Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that the world was created in this moneth (to let other reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone) this satisfies me, that the feast of Tabernacles which was in this moneth, is called the end of the yeare, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. And this I take to bee the reason, why the Iewes began to reade the Bible in their Synagogues, at the feast of Tabernacles, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might begin the lecture of the Creation, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. at that time of the yeare that the world was created.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Creation shewes the workeman powerfull and wise: The making of the Angells con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by <hi>Moses,</hi> lest men should (like those hereticks in <hi>Epiph.)</hi> thinke they helped God in the Creation.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God hides <hi>Moses</hi> after his death, so <hi>Moses</hi> hides the Creation of them, least they should be deified, and the honour due to the Creator giuen to the creature. God in framing the world, begins aboue and workes downeward; and in three dayes hee layes the parts of the world, and in the three other dayes, he adornes those parts.</p>
            <p>The first day hee makes all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, the matter of the earth, and comes downe so low as the light. The second lower, and makes the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or aire. The third lowest of all, and makes distinction of earth and water. Thus in three dayes the parts, or body of the world is laid, in three dayes more, and in the same order

they are furnished. For on</p>
            <p>The fourth day the Heauens which were made the first day are deckt with starrs. The fifth day the Firmament, which was made the second day, is filled with birds.

            <p>
               <hi>R.

On the second day, the firmament aboue. On the third, let the dry land appeare beneath. On the fourth day, lights aboue. On the fifth day, let the waters bring foorth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9004:83"/>
On the sixt, hee must create both Superior and Inferior, as he had done on the first, least there should bee confusion in his worke, therefore he made man of both, his soule from aboue, and his body from beneath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.

Euery one knowes the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the worlds lasting sixe thousand yeares, because it was made in sixe dayes: and of <hi>Elias</hi> Prophesie among the Iewes, of the world ending, at the end of sixe thousand: which Prophesie of his is flat against the words of Christ: Many beleeue these opinions, yet few prepare for the end which they thinke is so neere.</p>

of the Creation of the old world, what our proceedings must be, that wee may become a new creation, or new heauens, &amp; a new earth, renewed both in soule and bodie. On the first day he made the light, so the first thing in the new man must be light of knowledge, so saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to God must know that he is.</hi>

But of <hi>Israels</hi> affliction in <hi>Egypt,</hi> I finde the Heathens silent.

A type of Israels being in Egypt, and of <hi>Pharo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> being plagued for their sakes, was, when <hi>Pharoah</hi> suffered, for taking <hi>Sarah</hi> from her husband, and keeping

The reasons why God should thus suffer them to suffer: whether it were to fit them for the receiuing of him and his Law, or whether it were to whip them for their Idolatry: or for some other cause, I dare not enter too neare to search: this I see, that when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation (as it were) of the visible Church is laid thus in affliction, that that the Church cannot but looke for affliction, whilest it liues in the Egypt

            <p>THe letter of the Law is death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the spirit giueth life. The Iewes stand vpon the letter, and thinke to gaine life by the works of it, but them the Apostle frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth. And I take the aime of Christs Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. about the penny to extend to no lesse.<note place="margin">

               </note> Some came into the vineyard at the Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Day or the Age before the flood, and some at the third houre, or in the time before the Law, and some at the sixth and ninth houre, or vnder the heat and burden of the Iewish Law, and some at the last, vnder the Gospell: Those vnder the Law plead for merit, we haue borne the heat and burden of the day: that is, costly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, sore ceremonies, &amp;c. To whom the Master answers that his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:9004:102"/>
penny is his owne, and if he giue it, it is not for their merit, but his good will. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the law a Schoole-master, and so it is indeed: and such a Schoolemaster as that, that <hi>Liuy</hi> and <hi>Florus</hi> speake of in Italy, who brought forth his children that were trusted with him, to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who if he had not beene more mercyfull then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they had all perished. So they that rely vpon the works of the Law, are in fine constrained by the Law to come to Christ, who more mercifull then the Law, does deliuers them. And if you well weigh it, you shall find that as the whole Law, so euery part from one to another, brings vs to Christ. The Morall Law shewes vs what wee should do, and with the same sight we find that we cannot do it: This makes vs to seeke to the Ceremoniall for some sacrifice or ceremonie to answer for our not doing it: There wee see that burning a dead beast is but poore satisfaction for the sinnes of men
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:9004:103"/>
liuing, and that outward purifyings of mens selues can auaile but little to the cleansing of a soiled soule: this then deliuers vs to the Iudiciall Law, and by it we see what we deserue, and thus in fine wee are constrained to seeke to Christ <note n="*" place="margin">It was <hi>Iesus</hi> or <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suah,</hi> and not <hi>Moses</hi> or the Law that brought Israel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of Canaan.</note> Iesus, <hi>for there is no other name whereby wee must be saued.</hi> The Parable that our Sauiour propounds in the tenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> I thinke tends something to this purpose. <hi>A man</hi> (saith he) <hi>went from Ierusalem to Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho and fell among theeues, and they robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed leauing him halfe dead. A certaine Priest came that way, and when he saw him, he turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. A Leuite came that way, and when hee saw him, he passed by on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. But a good Samaritan came,</hi> (as the text imports) <hi>and pittied him, and salued him, and lodged him, and paid for him.</hi> Such a one is man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len among Satan, Sinne, and Death, and by them stopt, stript, and striped.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9004:103"/>
Satan dismounts him off his Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that should sustaine him: Sinne strips him of all Righteousnesse that should array him: Death strikes him with guiltinesse and wounds him. Here is a man in a wofull case, and none to aide him. By comes a Priest, that is, first come the sacrifices of the legall Priesthood, and they may passe by him, by they do not, nor they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not helpe him. By comes a Leuite, that is, the Ceremonies of the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law, and they may passe by him, but they doe not, they cannot helpe him. Or by comes a Priest, that is, the Angells may see him thus, but they let him lie, for they cannot helpe him. By comes a Leuite, that is, men and the world may see him thus, but they let him alone for euer, for they cannot succour him. But by comes a good Samaritan, that is, our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who is called a Samaritan, and is said to haue a Deuill, and hee pities him, salues him, lodges him, and paies
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9004:104"/>
for him. Hee pities him in very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, therefore hee saies, <hi>as I liue I would not the death of a sinner.</hi> Hee salues him with his owne blood, therefore tis said, <hi>By his stripes wee are healed.</hi> Hee lodges him in his owne Church, therefore the Church saith, He brought me in the winecellar, and loue was his banner ouer me. And he paies for him what he deserued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith, <hi>I haue trod the winepresse alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is said in the Booke of <hi>Kings</hi> that when the Shunamites dead child was to bee raised, <hi>Elisha</hi> first sent his staffe to bee laid vpon him, but that did no good: but when <hi>Elisha</hi> came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and lay vpon him, with his mouth to the Childes mouth, his eyes to his eyes, and his hands to his hands, then the child recouered. So when man was dead in trespasses, and sinne as it is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. God layes his <note n="*" place="margin">Psal 23.</note> staffe or Rod of the Law vpon him, but what good did this toward his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:9004:104"/>
recouery? Euen make him to long the more for <hi>Elisha</hi> or Christ, who when he came, and laid his mouth to mans mouth, and kissed humanity in his incarnation, and laid his eyes to his eyes, and his hands to his hands, and suffered for mans actions at his passion, then is man recured. God in the booke of <hi>Isay</hi> when hee is to send a Prophet to Israel, saies thus: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eshlah: whom shall I send, or who will go for vs? Isa.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. Vpon which words the Iew <hi>Kimchi</hi> paraphrases thus: <hi>Shalahti eth Micah, wehem maccim otho, Shalahti eth Amos, wehem korin otho</hi>

Then saies <hi>Esay,</hi> Behold I am here, send me. Imagine that (vpon the fall of man) you saw God about to send the great Prophet not to Israel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but to all the world, nor onely to teach, but also to redeeme. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9004:105"/>
you heard him thus questioning, whom shall I send to restore fallen man? and who will goe for vs? Should I send Angells? they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and consequently finite, and so cannot answer mine infinite Iustice. Should I send man himselfe? Alas, though hee once had power not to haue fallen, yet now hath he no power to raise himselfe againe. Should I send beasts to sacrifice themselues for him? Alas can the burning of dead beasts satisfie for the sinnes of all men aliue? Whom shall I send, or who will go for vs? Our Sauiour is ready to answer with <hi>Isay, Behold I am here, send mee.</hi> Here am I that am able to do it; send me, for I am willing. I am able, for I am God; I am willing, for I will become a man. I am God, and so can fulfill the Law which man hath broke. I will become man, that so I may suffer death which man hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. Behold I am here, send mee. Then as one of our country Martyrs at
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9004:105"/>
his death, so may all wee sing all our liues: <hi>None but Christ, none but Christ:</hi> None but Christ to cure the wounded trauailor, None but Christ to raise the dead, Shunamite, None but Christ to restore decaid mankind, None but Christ that would, None but Christ that could. No Angell, no man, no creature, no sacrifice; no ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, that would and could do this for vs, which wee could not doe for our selues, and say for vs <hi>I haue troad the winepresse alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Ceremoniall and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Law haue thus brought vs to Christ, wee may shake hands with them and farewell, but for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as it helpes to bring vs thither, so must it helpe to keepe vs there. For Christ came not to disanull this Law. but to fulfill it. He does not acquit vs from this, but furthers vs to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it. What else is the Gospell, but this in milder tearmes of Faith and Repentance: which is, since wee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:9004:106"/>
cannot keepe this Law, yet to striue to keepe it as we can, and to repent vs for that wee haue not kept it, and to relye vpon his merits that hath kept it for vs. Thus as loue to God and to our neighbours was the summe of the old, so true faith and vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the totall of the new. This was the tenour of Christs first words after his baptisme, <hi>Marke</hi> 1.15. and of his last words before his ascension, <hi>Marke</hi> 16.16.</p>
