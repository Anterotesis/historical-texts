            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE late Usurpation upon the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
by a <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> was so remarkable and
singular, that every instance of it ought to be
recorded to posterity. They begun very early
with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Hospital, commonly called
the <hi>Charter-house:</hi> and the King sent a <hi>Papist</hi> to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Pensioner or poor Brother there, contrary to all rules
of that Foundation. But he came accordingly armed
with a Royal Dispensation, both as to his Conformity to
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and as to the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Supremacy: Which they are bound to take at
their admission into that place.</p>
            <p>The Governours of the Hospital, Persons of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
quality, shewed themselves Faithful Trustees to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
upon that occasion. And, tho' they had no precedent,
at that time, to follow, made a vigorous resistance to this
encroaching power. Whereby they did good Service also to
the Publick, in that low station of a private Hospital. As
sometimes a little Frontier Garrison, well defended, gives a
check to a great Army, and a good example to the rest
of the Countrey, to stand stoutly upon their defence.</p>

This Letter was not delivered to the Master of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital,
but to the Register at his house in the City. Who
thereupon did not come to acquaint the Master with the
contents of it, but sent this <hi>Andrew Popham</hi> to him, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
with a Certificate under his hand, in the usual form,
as for an Admission of course. Giving the Master no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that he was a Papist, on that the King had dispens'd with
his taking the Oaths and with his Religion.</p>
            <p>The Certificate was This.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Popham</hi> came to the Master with this Certificate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
to be admitted. The Master askt him, where his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Nomination was, and to whom it was directed? He
said it was directed to the Governors of the Hospital, and
he had left it in the Register's hands. If it was directed to
the Governors, the Master told him, it must be deliver'd to
them, before he could act upon it. And so telling him
when there would be a meeting of the Governors, dismist
him without admission.</p>
            <p>The day appointed for the meeting of the Governors, was
the Munday after Twelve-tide; but there did not come a
full number at that time, so they could not act. But on the
17<hi>th.</hi> following, there was a full Assembly, and <hi>Popham</hi> was
present, and his business heard. The King's Letter being
read to the Governors, My Lord Chancellor <hi>Ieffrys</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mov'd, that they should immediately, without any debate,
proceed to vote, Whether <hi>Andrew Popham</hi> should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
or no, according to the King's Letter. And 'twas
put upon the Master, as Junior, to vote first. But the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
told them, he thought it was his duty to acquaint
their Lordships with the state and constitution of the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94239:4"/>
before they proceeded to a Vote. This was opposed
by some, but, after a little debate, the Master was heard;
Who thereupon acquainted their Lordships, That to admit
a Pensioner into that Hospital, without taking the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy, was not only contrary to the
Constitutions of the House, but also to an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
provided in that case; namely, to the <hi>Charter-House
Act 3. Car.</hi> In which it is declar'd and order'd in express
terms, that no Person, Governour, Officer, nor Pensioner,
shall be admitted into this Hospital, till they have taken the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. When the Master
had said this, One Governour answer'd, <hi>What</hi> is this to the
purpose? To whom the late Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> reply'd, He
thought it was very much to the purpose; For an Act of
Parliament was not so slight a thing, but that it deserv'd
to be consider'd. Hereupon, after some discourse, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
was put again,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The words of the Act of Parliament are these:</hi> And be it enacted and established by the Authority aforesaid, that every Person that shall from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be elected a Governour of the said Hospital, shall, before he exercise the Place of a Governour, take the several Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.—And that the Preacher, Minister, Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Usher, Officers, and poor Men, and every of them henceforth to be elected or admitted, shall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exercise or take benefit of any such place, take the said several Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance.</note> Whether <hi>Andrew Popham</hi> should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
or no: and it was carried in the Negative.</p>
            <p>This, I think, was the first <hi>Stand</hi> that was made against the
<hi>Dispensing</hi> Power, by any Society in <hi>England.</hi> After which, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the opposition it met with at the University of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
and at <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Governours
of <hi>Charter-House</hi> had a fresh Example in sight, of a tame resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to that <hi>Dispensing</hi> Power, in an Instance where both
the honour of the Church, and many Acts of Parliament,
were concern'd; But that had no other effect upon them,
than to make them think it the more necessary to stand in
the breach that was already made, and to stop the progress
of that Torrent, which was in a fair way, at that time, to
over-run the Nation.</p>
            <p>They intended to have return'd an Answer in Writing
forthwith to the King's Letter; But as soon as that Vote
was past, my Lord Chancellor flung away, and some others
followed him; so that there was not a Number left to act
as an Assembly, or to do any more business at that time.
My Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> attempted several times afterwards
to have another Assembly, that this Letter might be writ
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94239:4"/>
to the King, but could not get a full Number together, till
Midsummer following.</p>
            <p>While the business was hanging thus, there happen'd an
accident, which we thought would have put an end to the
controversie. Another Person appear'd with a Letter of
Nomination from the King of a Date antecedent to that
of <hi>Popham</hi>'s. And 'twas a Person qualified for the Place,
one <hi>Cardonel,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Protestant Naturaliz'd. This we
thought had been a soft method, invented by the Court,
to supersede <hi>Popham</hi>'s Letter, and so let the Controversie
fall without nolse. But it prov'd otherwise; for when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this
Man's pretensions came to be known at Court, The King
sent another Letter to exclude him, and to reinforce His
former Order for <hi>Popham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The KING's Second Letter was this.</p>

Forces of the Dispensing Power might be employ'd in this
attack against <hi>Charter-house.</hi> At length a Broad-Seal was
sent, to compleat and ratify this Dispensation for <hi>Popham;</hi>
and a Copy of it left with the Master, collated, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
with the Original. They brought also Witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, to attest the delivery and collation, and
so left it in the Master's hands.</p>
            <p>These Letters-Patents did not respect <hi>Popham</hi> onely, but
several Others also in the University of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> Four
or Five there, that were dispens'd with for like unqualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
And because the form of one of these new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations
is worth seeing, I will set down the form of this
in general, as it relates to them all; and particularly, all
that belongs to <hi>Andrew Popham.</hi> They begun thus.</p>

               <hi>IN WITNESS</hi> whereof we have caused these Our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be made Patents. WITNESS Our Self at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
the Fourth day of March, <hi>in the Third Year of Our
Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a great mistake committed in these Letters
Patents and in a part that requir'd the greatest care. The
Act of Parliament that should have been dispens'd with
in behalf of <hi>Popham,</hi> was 3 <hi>Caroli.</hi> Whereas the Patents
refer to, and dispence with one in the 3<hi>d.</hi> or 4<hi>th.</hi> Year
of King <hi>Iames.</hi> The Governours were made sensible of
this, but they would not lay any stress upon a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
when the substance was faulty, and therefore
took no notice of it.</p>
            <p>This is the summ and substance of the Letters Patents,
MANDATORY and DISPENSATORY. And as to the
Case of <hi>Popham,</hi> in vertue of that clause, where the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of</hi> Sutton's <hi>Hospital, and all other persons concerned,
are required to act and perform whatsoever ought to be done
and performed by them respectively, for the Electing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
and establishing the said</hi> Andrew Popham <hi>in the
said Hospital.</hi> In vertue, I say, of this clause, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
present admission of the Master; Admissions
being made by his Order. But he told them, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was now depending before the Governours in a
Body, and therefore no single Governour could act se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately
in it.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as I told you, call'd an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the Governours several times, but without
success: Some coming, and some staying away, so as the
number still fell short; till Midsummer day came, which
being a stated Assembly, there were Nine Governours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Then the King's Second Letter, and these Letters
Patents were read and considered; And thereupon a
Letter was drawn up to give reasons to his Majesty why
they could not comply with his pleasure as to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of <hi>Andrew Popham</hi> into that Hospital. This Letter
was Signed by Eight Governours, and directed and sent
to one of the Secretaries of State to represent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of it to the King.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94239:8"/>
            <p>The LETTER was as followeth.</p>

                  <p>HIS Majesty's Two Letters, the one da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> last, and the
other the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> last, countersigned by
your Lordship, came to our hands. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
His Majesty requires us, that we admit <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Popham</hi> to be a Pensioner in <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
without tendring any Oath or Oaths unto
the said <hi>Andrew Popham,</hi> or requiring of him
any Subscription, Recognition, or other Act
or Acts in Conformity to the Doctrine and
Discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the
same is now Established; And notwithstanding
any Statute, Order, or Constitution, of or in the
said Hospital, with all which His Majesty was
pleased to Dispense. Which Letters were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with the respect that is due to whatsoever
cometh from His Majesty. And it hath not
been any fault of ours, that an Answer hath
not been sooner returned. Several Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
having been appointed in order to it, but
there were not, at those times, so many Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in or about the Town, in a condition to
attend, as would make up the number directed
by the Constitutions. We could not till now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Lordship, that upon debate of the
aforesaid Letters, it is agreed to represent, in
the most humble manner, to His Majesty by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94239:8"/>
your Lordship's means, and through your
hands; That we apprehend our selves to be
tyed up, and to lye under such strict obligations,
that we are not at liberty to comply with what is
required from us, for these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>For that the said Hospital is of a private Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
and the Governours obliged to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Constitutions of the same.</p>
                  <p>That by an Act of Parliament, made in the
Third Year of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
First, of blessed memory, It is Enacted, That
every poor man to be elected and admitted into
the said Hospital, shall, before he receive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of any such place, take the Oaths of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Allegiance.</p>
                  <p>Therefore We pray your Lordship to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to His Majesty that we conceive, We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with a Faithful discharge of our Trust, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the said <hi>Andrew Popham.</hi> This, We pray
your Lordship to represent to His Majesty in the
most humble manner; Whereby you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely

This Letter, when it was read to the King, he gave it,
as we heard, to the Lord Chancellor: And bid him find
out a way how he might have right done Him at that
Hospital. But there were several reasons that hinder'd the
further proceedings of the <hi>Court</hi> against <hi>Charter-House.</hi>
The Persons concern'd were of so great a Character, so
much consider'd by the Nation, and so well able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their cause, that the Ecclesiastical Commissioners
(who were the support of the <hi>Dispensing</hi> Power) had no
mind to meddle with them. Besides, they had their hands
full of other business at that time. They were quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the two Universities upon the same point. And
the next Spring, they fell upon the Clergy, for not read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's Declaration about Liberty of Conscience.
The Archbishop, and six Bishops more were sent to the
Tower, by Warrant from the Privy-Council: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
formally Try'd at the <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench</hi> Barr. These
things had put the Nation into a great ferment and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness,
so that it was necessary to allow some time for
things to settle and grow calm again, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
upon any more angry business. But towards the
latter end of the Summer, when they should have begun
their Prosecutions a fresh, They see the Heavens grow
cloudy, and a storm a coming from abroad. Then the
<hi>Court</hi> begun to think of new measures, how to please
the Nation, and put all things to rights again. So that
it was no more time to call to account the disobedient
Governors of <hi>Charter-House;</hi> who, by the necessity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
had been conniv'd at thus long. But in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
we had several threatnings, That a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>
(which was the battering Engine of those days) should
be brought against the Corporation. And that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
particularly, should be Summon'd before the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Commissioners. But all this came to no effect;
Neither could they ever get any <hi>Popish</hi> Governor, or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
Pensioner, admitted into that Society.</p>
