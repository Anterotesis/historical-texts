            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In ſo much, that whoſoever having a daughter or daughters heire or heires, ſhall in his life time without grée of his Lord marry any of them, he ſuffereth by the right and generall cuſtome of the Realme perpetuall diſinheriſon, without ever recovering any thing, but by the grace &amp; méere mercy of his Lord. If it be prooved that any woman holden in ward do forfit with her body, ſhe ſhalbe deprived of her heritage, &amp; her portion ſhall goe and accrue to her parceners. And if they all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, the whole heritage ſhall fall as eſcheate to the Lord. But after ſuch heires be once lawfully maried, though they become widdow afterwards they ſhall no more be holden in ward, nor then by their incontinency can they forfit any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. But yet they may not remarry without their Lords aſſent. Thus far <hi>Glanvill.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. X.</hi> How the law came to a certainty in the point of a womans being out of ward.</head>
               <p>CHooſe now whether ye will learne of <hi>Glanvil</hi> and <hi>Bracton,</hi> what the law was in their time, or of Mr. <hi>Littleton,</hi> that wrote many ſcore yeares after the making of Weſtm. 1. In mine opinion, neither did this law bring any advantage to Lords, neither doth it ſhew that heires females, oftenants in Chivalry, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at 14. yeares, neither is there any cléere proofe that the law was cléerely ſo taken. The letter of the Statute doth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:307:18"/>
not expreſly give 2. yeares to tender mariage, but reſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth covetous Lords, that they ſhall not hold the land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 2. yeres after the 14. which ſéemech plainly to import, as it is reaſonably taken both by <hi>Needh.</hi> &amp; <hi>Billing 35. <hi>H. 6</hi>
                  </hi> that before the making of this law, the age of male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male in this point, tooke no difference. I may be asked, how it commeth then to paſſe, that the law is ſo cléere in that which <hi>Littleton</hi> concludeth withall, viꝪt. That the Lord ſhall not have two yeres to tender his woman ward marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſave onely where ſhe is under 14. and unmaried at the death of her anceſtor: before the Statute, it was either out of doubt, that a daughter and heire, ſhould not be cleane out of ward. at 14. or at the leaſt it was doubted, whether ſhe ſhould or no: and the words of the Statute whatſoever Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, maketh not the matter plaine enough. But we have the helpe of Reverend <hi>Priſot,</hi> in the Booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned. <hi>3. 5. Henrici 6. Weſtm. 1.</hi> (ſaith he) was made in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, who purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to put all the law into certainty, and in writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to makes Bookes thereof, by helpe of the moſt ſage men of the law in this Realme, Iudges and others. And he made a Booke two yeares after the making of this Statute in which all the Statute is reherſed, which booke goeth on, and ſaith by expreſſe words: that no woman ſhalbe ſaid to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, thereby to be in ward after ſhe is paſt the age of 14. Thus ſaith <hi>Priſot.</hi> By him therefore and by other Iuſtices in the Eſchequer chamber it was ruled cleere, that where the Kings tenant in Chivalry died leaving his daughter and heire of the age of 15. yeare, ſhe ſhould not be in ward. And <hi>Billing</hi> ſaith for law, that if betwéene the 14. and 16. yere, when an heire female is in ward another ward falleth which holdeth in Chivalry of the firſt, the Lord ſhall not have gard, <hi>per cauſe de garde,</hi> for the firſt ward is out of his power to all intents excepting onely tender of mariage. And another Iuſtice ſaith, if a tenant hold ofone lord bypriority, &amp; of another by poſteriority, the daughter heir vnder. 14. ſhal
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:307:18"/>
be in cuſtody of the anteriour Lord till ſhe be 16. but ſhée may enter vpon the land by poſteriority, as ſoone as ſhee commeth to 14. likewiſe if the Lord hath once maried this woman-ward, after the age of 14. ſhe may preſently, enter into her land: for now the Lord hath had all that, which to him belongeth, the marriage.

                     <hi>H.</hi> 8. fo. 2:</hi> If the Kings tenant in chiefe, having feoffees to his uſe, marry his daughter, vnder age, to a man of full age, and dye, this daughter, being heire, is out of ward for her body though not for her land: for that ſhalbe in ward in this caſe, an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:307:19"/>
the Kings poſſeſſion muſt bee voided by ſuite and livery. But had ſhe béene of full age of 14. yeares at her fathers death, no ſuch thing had néeded, neither ſhould ſhe have bin in ward, nor the King have any primer ſeiſin: For that was not as yet ſeene into by the Statutes of <hi>H. 7.</hi> which had given ward, reliefe and herriots upon the death of him, which died inteſtate and ſeiſed of onely a bare uſe: againe, if the King have a woman ward which he marrieth before ſhe be 14, ſhe ſhalbe be to all intents out of ward at 14. and may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſue her livery. 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for as a ward maſculine, married by his Lord vnder 21. ſhalbe <hi>ſui luris</hi> at 21. ſo ſhall a ward feminine being maried before 14. bee out of ward at 14. altogether. In the old <hi>Natura brevium</hi> in the writ <hi>de electione cuſtodiae.</hi> it is ſaid, that where the tenant marieth his daughter being under age, to a man of ful age, &amp; dieth, the daughter ſhalbe out of ward. But if he mary his daughter, being of full age, to a man under age, and die, ſhe ſhall be in ward. This Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi> taketh to be no law: even ſo doe I: his reaſon is, that no Lord can have the marriage of her that is already married, or compell any heire to be twice married. For if a tenant marry his ſon and die, and then the ſonnes wife dieth holden, the Lord ſhall not have his body in ward to marry him. Which is cleare: ſpecially if the ſonne were <hi>infra annos nubiles</hi> at the time of his fathers death. But certainely, if the Lord couple his ward to a wife which dieth, the ward is at full liberty for his body, and ſhall not be married by his Lord.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why an heire female of full age married by her father to a man under age, ſhould not be out of ward, muſt be becauſe the ſuppoſition of law faileth: her husband is not able <hi>arma portare &amp; officiis fungi militaribus, vel pro iiſdem faciendis cum alio paciſci.</hi> But this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, me thinketh a woman married, ſhould bee out of ward for all her huſbands nonage, thought the woman bee but twelve yeares old a boy knight ſhall be out of ward for his body: ſhall a woman <hi>innupta &amp; matura viro</hi> be in kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:307:19"/>
of any but her huſband, ſhall ſhee at 14. yeares age bee ward becauſe ſhe hath a huſband but 19. yeare olds, who ſhould not have béene in ward had ſhe had no huſband at al? <hi>non videtur.</hi> The huſbands ability to doe ſouldiers ſervice, is neither the onely nor the principall cauſe in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, why a woman is by law out of ward at 14. yeares age. But law going with the trace or tide of nature, that hath made women (as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith) fit to carry <hi>cey</hi> and <hi>key cloge</hi> betimes, ſuffereth them to mary very early: And it ſhould be a miſchievous, inconvenient, unjuſt, and unnatural law, that ſhould hold a woman from her huſband, or from her inheritance, which is without offence of law maried, &amp; fully able to bring forth children, becauſe her huſband is not fully fit for all mannor of horſemanſhip. Be not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good woman abſterred from a young huſband, by <hi>old natura brevium.</hi>

               <p>Now ſéeing that <hi>Glanuile,</hi> the Statute of Ireland, <hi>Bract. Britton,</hi> and al do agrée, that euery Lord might take his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices by the hands of the eldeſt partner, (the reaſon whereof was a deſire which the Law had to conſerue Seignories in their intierties, &amp; that Lords ſhould not take or diuide them into mynnomes, and Crotchets) what was it that cauſed the making of this ninth Chapter of <hi>Marlebridge?</hi> It ſhould ſéeme that Lords in thoſe dayes played vpon the aduantage, And though they were ſcrupulous in taking of homage, by which they were ſhut from ſucceſſion, and yet willing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take intirely all other emoluments incident or annext to the tenure, from one paire of hands: yet ſuite of Court, which is burdenous or inconuenient to none but to the tenants, they would be and were content to diſſipate, and it ſhould ſéeme alſo that in puiſne Siſters and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heyres, though they were eaſily intreated, that the eldeſt ſhould do all ſuit and ſeruice, yet they could be well content to giue them nothing for their paines, and therefore a Statute was needfull, for other things I will not accuſe old writers of error, they erred not perhaps if they take it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:307:32"/>
as it was taken by Lawyers then, though that taking ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered from Lawes conformitie.</p>
               <p>This I ſay, (to me) the ſtatute of Ireland is ſufficient to proue that the eldeſt Siſter ſhall haue no gard, marriage, or ſubiection of the yongeſt, and neither homage nor fealty (by <hi>Littl.</hi>) can be taken otherwiſe, then a ſeruice incident to a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, for which it is lawfull to diſtraine. As therefore when a Mannor deſcendeth to two partners, each one may haue parcell of the demeſne, and parcell of the ſeruices, and ſo of one there may ſtep vp two Mannors: And if the diuiſion be that one ſhall haue the demeſnes, and another the ſeruices, the ſuite is now in a very haut ſuſpention, and the Mannor for a time broken in pieces: but it ſhal be a Mannor againe, if ſhe which had the ſeruices die without Iſſue, <hi>(per Thiru. 12. H. 4. fo. 34. 35)</hi> So I doubt not but when a tenement, holden by ſeruice military, deſcendeth vnto two coparce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and diviſion is euenly made, each of them may pay rents and do ſeruice for her part to the Lord, who may take fealty and homage of either of them, if he will: And may be compellable to take homage of one of them at the leaſt, which for the warrantie ſhall be auailable to both.</p>

               <p>OF old time, ſome Crimes were numbred amongſt the Cauſes of Diſſoluing marriage: but <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> changed the Law here in part, and the Canons vpon the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Quos Deus coniunxit, &amp;c.</hi> will not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes that Matrimony rightly made and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, can bee diſſolued, <hi>quoad ad vinculum Matrimonij.</hi> though for fornication they ſuffer a parting, <hi>quoad Torum.</hi> So that <hi>nodus legitimi Matrimonij,</hi> is neuer diſſolued but by death, and the wife as long as ſhe liueth is ſubiect to the law of her huſband by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſaith <hi>Lagus,</hi> ſéeing that in Contracts of Wedlock we regard as well what is decent and conuenient, as what is lawfull, I cannot tell why we be not bound in diſſoluing of it to follow the like equitie: and for example, if a Wife cannot dwell with her huſband without manifeſt danger of death, becauſe he is cruell and bloudy, why may not ſhee be ſeparated <hi>iudicis ordinarij cognitione precedente.</hi>

               <p>As if a man ſeiſed of thrée Mannors takes a wife, and grants a rent charge iſſuing out of all thrée Mannors, and dieth: now if the wife by aſſignment of the heyre, accept one Mannor in Dower for all, the two parts of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor remaine ſubiect to the diſtreſſe of the granter, becauſe the woman (for the two parts) accepted here her Dower <hi>in counter comen droit.</hi> But had ſhee vpon recouery of Dower béene aſſigned this Mannor by the Viſcount, ſhe ſhould haue held all diſcharged.</p>

               <p>NOw that Matrimony is celebrated and conſummate, here is ſo ſtrait a fellowſhip or rather identitie of perſon, that if a feoffement bee made to a man and his wife iointly with <hi>I. S.</hi> the Baron &amp; Feme take but a moity, and in a feoffement to Baron and Feme, and <hi>I. S.</hi> and <hi>T. K.</hi> they take but a third part, and where a feoffement is made to a man and his wife ioyntly, they take not ſeuerall moities, as other ioynt Feoffees doe, but the Baron and feme take intirely together, and in Law they are ſaid to be ſeiſed by intierties, and there is no halfing betwixt them: For if the Baron charge the whole land or part of it with a rent, the wife ſhall hold it diſcharged after his death, and if he ſell all or part and die. the wife ſhall recouer all by Writt of <hi>cui in vita.</hi> See <hi>40. aſſi. pla. 7.</hi> If a Villeine and his Wife purchaſe land ioyntly, the Lord enter, and the Villeine die, the Feme or her Heyre ſhall haue the whole Land, <hi>Eadem lex videtur,</hi> where the Huſband ioynt-purchaſer is an Alien borne, or attaint in premunire, or of fellonie. But the booke of Aſſiſes goeth not ſo farre.</p>
               <p>The <hi>videtur</hi> is Parliament <hi>43. in Brooke,</hi> where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye ſhall ſee it was holden <hi>5.

And vpon the like reaſon is the caſe <hi>Dyer 3. Eliz. fo. 196.</hi> Sir <hi>Rob. Catline</hi> purchaſe land held <hi>in capite</hi> to him and his wife and his heyres without licence, and the Queene pardons all offences, <hi>pro quacunque aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ſibi facta,</hi> and doth not ſpeake of the wife in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and yet it was allowed in the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>

S.</hi> ſhould haue held his moity, notwithſtanding the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments decrée, and this ſeemeth to bee the better opinion, though there were in manner equall number to maintaine, That if the feoffement were before couerture, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould voyd it for a moity, but if it were after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture, it ſhould voyde for no part againſt the Feme, when ſhee was diſcouerte, leauing to Parliaments their omnipotencie, it is cléere the huſband cannot ſeuer the Ioynture betwixt him and his wife, as an other Ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant may, if the Ioynture were made during Couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe there is then no moity: Otherwiſe it is if the Ioynture were made before the Marriage: And if lands be giuen to a man and his wife, <hi>habendum</hi> one moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the huſband, and <hi>habendum</hi> the other moity to the wife, now they bee ſeiſed of moities as Tenants in Commom: But for this I finde no other authority, then the opinion of <hi>Knightly in Dyer, 28.

               <p>MOreouer, this Conglutination of perſons in Baron and feme, forbiddeth all manner of feoffing or giuing by the one vnto the other, for a man cannot giue any thing vnto himſelfe, therefore <hi>27.

               <p>And the meaning muſt bee taken and obſerued: in the booke of <hi>4. H. 7. fo. 4.</hi> is another memorable Cauſe, A man was bound to <hi>I. S.</hi> by obligation to make a ſure eſtate to a woman in certaine tenements within three moneths after his fathers death: The Obligor marrieth the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his fathers life time, and the Matrimony continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, till the three moneths be expired; the obligation is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, <hi>Vauiſor</hi> ſaid, the huſband might well haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition by fine leuied, vpon a writt of Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant brought by a ſtranger, againſt the Baron and feme. <hi>Fiſher</hi> ſaid he might haue performed it by making a Leaſe vnto a ſtranger, the remainder to the wife, <hi>quaere</hi> of that. <hi>Vauiſors</hi> performance had beene good I thinke, if there had beene in the beginning a full purpoſe and intent of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage betwixt the woman and the Obligor: But that appeares not, and therefore being that hee hath brought himſelfe to an impoſſibility of performance either of words or meaning, the Obligée muſt néeds be allowed the aduantage. If the obligation had béene to the woman her ſelfe, the condition by inter-marriage had béene diſpenſed with; for where the Obligee is a cauſe that the condition cannot be performed, the not performing is without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie to the Obligor, as if in the old dayes, I had béene bound to an Abbot that <hi>A.</hi> ſhould infeoffe him, &amp;c. before Chriſtmas, if <hi>A.</hi> had preſently entred into Religion, my

bond had preſently beene forfeited: not ſo, If <hi>A.</hi> had béene profeſſed, vnder the obedience of the Obligée.</p>

               <p>I finde none other cauſe in our Yéere-bookes alleaged why things may not paſſe by gift, betwéene Baron and feme, ſaue only vnitie of perſon.</p>
               <p>But vndoubtedly the reſtraint ſpringeth from a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique conſideration, rather to bréed, cheriſh and maintaine the vnity, then in iudging of an impoſſibility becauſe of the vnitie.</p>
               <p>But the Ciuill Law, <hi>vir non poteſt dare vxori, ne foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae amorem coniugalcm in quaeſtu habeant, &amp; prohibenter inter coniuges donationes, quia ſilicerct coniugibus inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem donare matrimonia fierint venalia &amp; ſaepe diſtraheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe it would amount to arguing <hi>inter coniuges,</hi> there is a reſtraint by that law. <hi>Ne priuignus dare queat nouercae vel nouerca priuigno.</hi> What if the Matrimonie be <hi>inualidum &amp; legibus non conſiſtens, yet non valet inter coniuges putatiuos facta donatio, ne melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſint conditionis quam illi qui recte faciont:</hi> But a gift to a plaine Concubine is good enough: vnleſſe the giuer be a Soldier. By old <hi>Iohn Bracton, lib. 2. ca 5. Non valent donationes inter virum &amp; vxorem; non enim poterit vir dare vxori, nec e conuerſo conſtante Matrimonio, quia hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſmodi donationes prohibitae ſunt inter tales perſonas, nec infraudem facere poſſint conſtitutioni, veluti ſi Maritus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net extraneae perſonae ea mente vt redonet in vita viri vel poſt mortem:</hi> hee maketh his reaſon in the 14.

               <p>TO debate matters of infancie would aſke a whole vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume <hi>perſe:</hi> But breefly know that all deeds, gifts, grants, &amp;c. made by an Infant which take not effect, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery of the infant be abſolutely void, By matters in <hi>fait</hi> or writing, which take effect, by hand and deliuery are onely voydable by the infant, or by them which haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants eſtate.</p>
               <p>Out of his rule are excepted acts apparently of neceſſity or profit to the infant, or which can be no diſprofit to him, for manger boire, neceſſarie apparell and ſchooling, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation or couenant of an Infant is good.</p>
               <p>Alſo an Infants preſentation to a Church is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for danger of lapſe, and becauſe it is no matter of emolument, and things done by vertue of office, as giuing of goods, or payment of debts by an infant Executrix, are good, ſo are acts which concerne the infants proper pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace. As if eſtate be made to an Infant of two acres, to haue and to hold, the one for life, the other in fee, a feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one acre made by the Infant is a good election: And it is ſaid <hi>fo. 104.</hi> in <hi>Dyer,</hi> that an Infant is bound by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:307:65"/>
all Statute Lawes, if there be not an expreſſe exemption; Now whatſoeuer a Feme ſole might auoyd by infancie, ſhe and her huſband may auoid it by entry or action after Marriage, if they take the time, elſe not.</p>
               <p>For example, An infant feme ſole hath title to enter for Mortmaine, within a yeare after alienation, or title to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the purchaſe of her villeine before his alienation, if by lacheſſe ſhe let ſlip her aduantage, as ſhe may doe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding her infancie, no wiſe huſband that ſhe taketh afterward can mend it, for here was but a title to that which neither ſhe nor her aunceſtor euer had: But if an infant Feme ſole haue a right, as vpon diſſeiſin done to her or her aunceſtor, ſhe may alwayes enter, whilſt ſhe is ſole, notwithſtanding any deſcent during infancie; And ſo may her huſband which marrieth her after the deſcent: <hi>Littl.</hi> teacheth vs, <hi>fo. 95. Chap.</hi> Deſcents, that lacheſſe of a huſband which ſuffers deſcent, ſhall not toll the entry of a Feme couert, or her heyres after Marriage diſſolued. But there is an addition to <hi>Littleton,</hi> that it is otherwiſe where a title is already giuen to a Feme ſole which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a huſband, and ſuffers deſcent, &amp;c. for it ſhall now be accounted the Womans folly that ſhee would take ſuch a huſband.</p>
               <p>Howſoeuer it be Law, or howſoeuer it be vnderſtood, the Caſe before muſt néeds be good Law, for an infant Feme hath as much fauor as an infant Male: And taking of an huſband cannot toll an entry which was ſaued to a Feme ſole by infancie, neither doe I perceiue, how the huſbands lacheſſe at the time of deſcent, can toll the Wiues Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to make any imputation of folly, where infancie might excuſe it.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Parkins,</hi> If a man leaſe two acres to me for life, the remainder of one of theſe acres to a Feme ſole, which afterwards takes a huſband, and then the Leſſée dying, the Baron entreth into one acre, and thereof enfeoffes a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by mets and bonds, the wife ſhall not after his death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

If this be infallible Law, I doubt not then if a Feme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant diſſeiſed doe marry, and during her infancie the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſuffereth a deſcent, but her entry is ſaued, and ſhe may enter, after Couerture diſſolued if not before: But <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> concludeth with a <hi>quaere,</hi> and ſo muſt I.</p>

               <p>And therefore to ſay that the Baron might haue pleaded <hi>miſnoſmer</hi> or ioynt-tenancie will not ſerue to falſifie a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery: But if ſhe can proue that the demandant had no right nor cauſe of action, but iointly with a ſtranger, which ſtranger by his deed ſhewed forth to the Court had releaſed before commencement of ſuit all his right to her huſband being in poſſeſſion, this will ſerue to falſifie the recouery for a moity.</p>

               <p>YOu muſt vnderſtand ſomewhat alſo of a Remitter. And becauſe women learne faſter by example then by precept, I will not ſtay to define a Remitter: Baron and Feme ſeiſed together in ſpeciall taile, haue Iſſue a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the wife dyeth, the Baron catcheth another wife, hath Iſſue by her another daughter, diſcontinueth the taile, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſeth the diſcontinuee and dieth, now is the Land deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the two daughters, the eldeſt daughter is remitted (that is remaunded and ſetled in the ancient eſtate) for a moitie, and driuen to a <hi>Formedone</hi> againſt her Siſter for the other moity, for here the Siſters are by ſeuerall titles tenants in common not parceners.</p>
               <p>If Tenant in taile infeoffe a Feme ſole and die, and then his ſonne being vnder age, intermarrieth with the Feme Feoffée, this is a remitter to the Sonne, and his wife which before had fée-ſimple hath now nothing at all in the land. But if the ſonne had beene of full age at the time of eſpouſals, hee had not regained the ancient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, but ſtood ſeiſed onely <hi>in droit ſa feme.</hi> If a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeiſed, &amp;c. take a huſband which alieneth in fee, and then takes backe an eſtate to him and his wife for life, this repriſall (though it were by Indenture or by fine) is meerely the act of the Huſband, and the woman <hi>ſans</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is adiudged in her Remitter, the reuerſion of the Leſſor running to ſmoke, rightly to ſmoke, which is ſomething more then nothing: for if after all this the Leſſor bring an action of waſte againſt the Baron and Feme, the Baron cannot barre her by ſhewing her repriſall and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but hee is ſtopped from ſpeaking againſt his owne Feoffement and receipt.</p>
               <p>

               <p>For in euery caſe where a woman is receiued to plead in her huſbands abſence, ſhe ſhall haue aduantage as if ſhee were a Feme ſole.

               <p>
                  <hi>Newton</hi> Chiefe Iuſtice of the Common place, thought it ſhould by implication of words: for hee tooke <hi>dont nul fine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> to be a generall exception, and therefore this alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by fine with warrant to remaine a collater all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie, as it was at Common Law.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Littleton</hi> giueth his voyce with them of contrary opinion which thought it an obſcure expoſition to permit ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuocable alienation by Tenant in <hi>droit ſa feme</hi> onely by his warranting concord without aſſetts when the Statute hath in the beginning taken it expreſly from tenant by the Courteſie alienating by Feoffement. <hi>Nul fine</hi> therefore, is as much to ſay, <hi>nul loyall fine</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully leuied, <hi>viz.</hi> a fine leuied by Baron and Feme, for it is true that before this Statute was made (and ſomewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it too) there was no eſtate taile come into England. A fine might then well and rightfully haue beene leuied by Baron &amp; Feme, the Barons heire be bound with warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the wiues heire barred for euer: But now ſince the Statute if Baron and Feme had made a feoffement in fée by deede in the Countrey, the womans heyre after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of them both may haue a Writ of entry, <hi>ſur cui in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> for all the huſbands warranty. And this Statute of Gloceſter, had left a fine no more force then a feoffement here, if the finall exception had not beene; for when it comes with <hi>inſemente &amp; in meſme le manner</hi> giuing a writt of entry to auoyd the alienation made by the father in the mothers life time, this might be extended perhaps to a fine leuied by them both, for where the Baron and feme doth alien by fine, its true that the Baron doth alien:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:307:77"/>
Leſt therefore a fine leuied by Baron and Feme ſhould be thought to be inféebliſhed, this exception of a fine was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and it is to be intended of a fine loyall: For when the Iuſtices know once that tenant in right of his wife, commeth to leuie a fine onely in his owne name they will not receiue it.</p>

               <p>I Haue ſhewed what ſtrength a Demiſe or Leaſe for yeares made of the Wiues Land by Baron and Feme, or by the Baron onely was of before the Statute, and is of being made ſince the Statute without the appointed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſolemnitie: Now a little to the very Statute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As I ſaid before, the ordinance is that Leaſes ſhall bee good, &amp;c. But not directly that any terme ſhal be boyd, though voyd of ſtrength by this Statute they may be many wayes, as appeares by the prouiſo.</p>
               <p>Note that the forerunning Leaſe, Demiſe or occupation by Fermors muſt bee deriued from one that had Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (for if at the end of a primitiue Leaſe made by the Lord of whom the Tenancie is holden, or by the Kings grantée or committée of wardſhip, or by tenant in Dower, or by Tenant <hi>per le Courteſie,</hi> ſome of which may by good

               <p>This for ought I perceiue is by a prudent interpretation of the Conſtitution rather vpon equitie and intent, then vpon the Text, tenants in fée ſimple or tailed which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their poſſeſſion to their déere off-ſpring, will not make Leaſes to any great diſaduantage of any of their owne babes or blood, and therefore their Leaſes may well bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

was argued on the one part, that reduction of the poſſeſſion by the ſtatute 27. &amp;c. was of effect alone with their feoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and becauſe this poſſeſſion was regained without either tort or folly in the wife, whoſe agréement whether ſhe would or no, was included in her husbands agreement du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Couerture, ſhe muſt néeds when Couerture was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, till diſclaimer, or ſome act done to the contrarie be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And although the Statute of 27. ſettle poſſeſſions according to qualitie and quantitie of the vſe, yet it ſéemeth not that ſo it ſhall continue, but they may change by a former ancient right, for the Act being affirmatiue takes not the Common Lawes operation in remitters: beſides that, it hath an expreſſe ſauing of eygne right: further, if that the wife ſhould not be remitted, this inconuenience followeth, the Baron might charge the Wiues inheritance with a rent, to the whole yearly value, or be bound in a Statute merchant, &amp;c. and then making a feoffement to his wiues vſe, ſhee ſhould hold the land charged after his death.

Iacobi Rot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 571,</hi> where the Plaintiffe declared that the Defendant in conſideration that the Plaintiffe had formerly married his Daughter at his ſpeciall requeſt, the Defendant promiſed the Plaintiffe to pay him euery yéere during the life of the Defendant ten pound, &amp;c. and as my report ſaith, the Plaintiffe vpon <hi>non aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, had verdict and iudgement in the Kings Bench, but vpon a writ of error in Exchequer Chamber, the Iudgement was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed, for that the Marriage was executed before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made, and yet the declaration ſuppoſed that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant requeſted the Plaintiffe to Marriage, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But let me not run ſo farre from my Tert as neuer to finde the way backe againe: A man may ſue for Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age money in his owne name onely, and ſo is it generally where that which is in demand, or to be recouered, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth méerely and onely to the Baron. Example, <hi>43. Ed. 3. fo. 8.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> brought a Writt of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe againſt one, for chaſing in a free Chace that he held in right of his Wife, and the Writt awarded good, though the Wife were not named in it, becauſe nothing was to be recouered by damages.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe is it if the Baron bring a Writt of Treſpaſſe for ſtrayes taken in Lands holden in right of his Wife. And <hi>eod. anno fo. 26.</hi> for breaking of a houſe and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of timber, the Huſband alone ſhall haue the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becauſe hee may when hee liſt pull downe a houſe or ſell timber ſtanding vpon his Wiues Inheritance, or make a releaſe to any body vpon ſuch manner of treſpaſſe, and the Wiues action is gone for euer.</p>
               <p>There is alſo the ſame yeare <hi>fo. 16.</hi> another Caſe, wherein becauſe a <hi>decies tantum</hi> was brought by Baron
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:307:98"/>
and Feme, the Writt abated; for though the firſt action concerned the Wiues Intereſt, yet nothing is to be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redin a <hi>decies tantum</hi> but damages, &amp;c. Sée the Booke of <hi>20. H. 6. fo. 1.</hi> a Writt of maintenance wherein nothing is recouerable, but damages, was brought by Baron and Feme vpon maintenance in a bill of freſh force againſt them, by the better opinion they might ioyne, &amp;c. And the Defendant paſſeth Ouſter, but not by award, <hi>41. Ed. 3. f. 9.</hi> a Writ of Champertie brought by the Baron onely vpon an aſſiſe which had paſſed againſt him and his wife, was allowed good notwithſtanding exceptions taken of the wiues Intereſt, &amp;c. vpon the reaſons before expreſſed. And by <hi>Finch,</hi> if a man haue a Ward in right of his Wife, Dower ſhall be demanded againſt him onely, becauſe the gard is a Chattell veſted: But if a Writt of Wardſhip be to be brought, it ſhall be againſt the Baron and feme, &amp;c. becauſe of voucher.</p>
               <p>And in treſpaſſe, if the Plaintiffe recouer againſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and Feme by falſe verdict, they both muſt wyne in the attaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that muſt be according to the record <hi>46. Ed. 3. fo. 20.</hi> a man brought a Writt of rauiſhment de gard, declaring vpon a poſſeſſion, <hi>iure vxoris,</hi> and the Writ held good: yet in this caſe there is more then damages to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, for the Plaintiffe ſhall haue the Infant reſtored by the very words of his Writt. But there againe it was agréed, that an action to recouer a Ward muſt be againſt them both, becauſe of voucher, though in a writt of Dower it be <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> becauſe therein there is no voucher, &amp;c. If Baron and Feme ſell the Wiues Inheritance by fine for twenty pound, an action of debt for the money ſhall bee brought by the Baron onely, for the grant was onely the Barons grant, and if he die, the Executors ſhall haue the action and not the Feme. <hi>48. Ed. 3. fo. 18.</hi>

So is it if he alone deliuer ſuch Charters, he alone may haue action againſt the Bayliffe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But a Writt of Detinue of Charters of the Wiues inheritance muſt be ſued by both, &amp;c. becauſe the Charters themſelues are to be recouered. And therefore vpon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them the Baron and Feme muſt ioyne for recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A <hi>quare impedit was brought 50. of Ed. 3. fo. 13.</hi> and the Baron declared of an agréement betwixt thrée Siſters to preſent by turne to a Church, whereof they had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſan, and this was the turne of his Wife, &amp;c. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant demands Iudgement of the Writt, becauſe the Wife being ſtill aliue was not named, but this Writt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was awarded good, becauſe nothing was to be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red here but onely the Preſentment and not the Aduouſan. And if a Writt ſhould be awarded to the Biſhop againſt the Baron, the Wife thereby ſhould not be out of poſſeſſion, becauſe ſhe is not partie to the Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides that, ſhe is ayded by <hi>Weſt. 2. cap. 3.</hi> And for a generall rule where the Huſbands releaſe is good, the action may be brought in his name onely, as vpon cutting of trées, graſſe, Corne, &amp;c.

               <p>BVt for the ordinarie courſe of ſuing of Appeales, <hi>3.

If any man bee wounded, and in perill of death, the offender ſhould be arreſted, and put in ſuretie, till knowledge be had, whether hée which is hurt will liue or no. And where any man is found dead, the Coroner vpon view of the body, ſhould enquire who were the murderers, their abettors, conſenters and who were preſent at the murder committed, whether man or woman, and he ought to inroll, and certifie their names. The vſe had béene alſo (as ſaith the Statute) that within a day and years after any death or murder, the felony ſhould not bée determined at the Kings ſuit, and that for ſauing of the parties ſuit, or elſe the partie was agréed with, by which it is the more chargeable, and thereby murders were increaſt: and alſo, he that will ſue in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, muſt ſue in proper perſon.

Therefore the Defendant pleaded generally, <hi>Ne vnques accouple. &amp;c.</hi> which the Plaintiffe accepted of his owne accord, and a Writ was awarded to the Biſhop. But all mens opinions ſeemed to be, that this was no good plea, becauſe the Statute is, that the huſband ſhall haue the Appeale, though they agréed that when the Action is by Common Law, as an Appeale <hi>De morte viri, ne vnques accouple,</hi> is a good plea, for no woman ſhall reuenge her huſbands death by Appeale, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhee were wife as well in right as in poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> giueth the Appeale, where the woman rauiſhed hath no huſband, to her father or next of bloud, &amp;c. which is vnderſtood <hi>vt ſupra,</hi> where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conſenteth to the rauiſher, for otherwiſe the woman her ſelfe muſt purſue the Appeale, vpon <hi>Weſt. 2. cap. 34.</hi> for the father cannot haue by the Common Law, either Appeale of rape of his daughter, or of death, either of ſon or Daughter: But it ſéemeth that by this Statute, if a woman be next heire to her which is rauiſhed, and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, ſhe may haue an Appeale of rape againſt the raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher, as well as any procheuie heire male may. And learne, If a woman which is rauiſhed dye, and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band takes another wife, whether hée may now haue an Appeale or no. It is ſaid, that if a Lord rauiſh his Nief, ſhe cannot haue an Appeale of rape againſt him; but the King may puniſh it by way of Indictment.</p>
