            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The letter of the Statute doth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:307:18"/>
not expreÅ¿ly give 2. yeares to tender mariage, but reÅ¿t rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth covetous Lords, that they Å¿hall not hold the land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 2. yeres after the 14. which Å¿Ã©emech plainly to import, as it is reaÅ¿onably taken both by <hi>Needh.</hi> &amp; <hi>Billing 35. <hi>H. 6</hi>
                  </hi> that before the making of this law, the age of male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male in this point, tooke no difference. I may be asked, how it commeth then to paÅ¿Å¿e, that the law is Å¿o clÃ©ere in that which <hi>Littleton</hi> concludeth withall, viêªt. That the Lord Å¿hall not have two yeres to tender his woman ward marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Å¿ave onely where Å¿he is under 14. and unmaried at the death of her anceÅ¿tor: before the Statute, it was either out of doubt, that a daughter and heire, Å¿hould not be cleane out of ward. at 14. or at the leaÅ¿t it was doubted, whether Å¿he Å¿hould or no: and the words of the Statute whatÅ¿oever Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> Å¿aith, maketh not the matter plaine enough. But we have the helpe of Reverend <hi>PriÅ¿ot,</hi> in the Booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned. <hi>3. 5. Henrici 6.

And he made a Booke two yeares after the making of this Statute in which all the Statute is reherÅ¿ed, which booke goeth on, and Å¿aith by expreÅ¿Å¿e words: that no woman Å¿halbe Å¿aid to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, thereby to be in ward after Å¿he is paÅ¿t the age of 14. Thus Å¿aith <hi>PriÅ¿ot.</hi> By him therefore and by other IuÅ¿tices in the EÅ¿chequer chamber it was ruled cleere, that where the Kings tenant in Chivalry died leaving his daughter and heire of the age of 15. yeare, Å¿he Å¿hould not be in ward. And <hi>Billing</hi> Å¿aith for law, that if betwÃ©ene the 14. and 16. yere, when an heire female is in ward another ward falleth which holdeth in Chivalry of the firÅ¿t, the Lord Å¿hall not have gard, <hi>per cauÅ¿e de garde,</hi> for the firÅ¿t ward is out of his power to all intents excepting onely tender of mariage. And another IuÅ¿tice Å¿aith, if a tenant hold ofone lord bypriority, &amp; of another by poÅ¿teriority, the daughter heir vnder. 14. Å¿hal

But if he mary his daughter, being of full age, to a man under age, and die, Å¿he Å¿hall be in ward. This Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi> taketh to be no law: even Å¿o doe I: his reaÅ¿on is, that no Lord can have the marriage of her that is already married, or compell any heire to be twice married. For if a tenant marry his Å¿on and die, and then the Å¿onnes wife dieth holden, the Lord Å¿hall not have his body in ward to marry him.

               <p>The reaÅ¿on why an heire female of full age married by her father to a man under age, Å¿hould not be out of ward, muÅ¿t be becauÅ¿e the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition of law faileth: her husband is not able <hi>arma portare &amp; officiis fungi militaribus, vel pro iiÅ¿dem faciendis cum alio paciÅ¿ci.</hi> But this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding, me thinketh a woman married, Å¿hould bee out of ward for all her huÅ¿bands nonage, thought the woman bee but twelve yeares old a boy knight Å¿hall be out of ward for his body: Å¿hall a woman <hi>innupta &amp; matura viro</hi> be in kÃ©ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>NOw that Matrimony is celebrated and conÅ¿ummate, here is Å¿o Å¿trait a fellowÅ¿hip or rather identitie of perÅ¿on, that if a feoffement bee made to a man and his wife iointly with <hi>I.

But the booke of AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿es goeth not Å¿o farre.</p>
               <p>The <hi>videtur</hi> is Parliament <hi>43. in Brooke,</hi> where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e ye Å¿hall Å¿ee it was holden <hi>5.

               <p>MOreouer, this Conglutination of perÅ¿ons in Baron and feme, forbiddeth all manner of feoffing or giuing by the one vnto the other, for a man cannot giue any thing vnto himÅ¿elfe, therefore <hi>27.

               <p>And the meaning muÅ¿t bee taken and obÅ¿erued: in the booke of <hi>4. H. 7. fo. 4.</hi> is another memorable CauÅ¿e, A man was bound to <hi>I.

If the obligation had bÃ©ene to the woman her Å¿elfe, the condition by inter-marriage had bÃ©ene diÅ¿penÅ¿ed with; for where the Obligee is a cauÅ¿e that the condition cannot be performed, the not performing is without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie to the Obligor, as if in the old dayes, I had bÃ©ene bound to an Abbot that <hi>A.</hi> Å¿hould infeoffe him, &amp;c. before ChriÅ¿tmas, if <hi>A.</hi> had preÅ¿ently entred into Religion, my

               <p>Out of his rule are excepted acts apparently of neceÅ¿Å¿ity or profit to the infant, or which can be no diÅ¿profit to him, for manger boire, neceÅ¿Å¿arie apparell and Å¿chooling, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation or couenant of an Infant is good.</p>

were not countermanded preÅ¿ently by taking a huÅ¿band.

               <p>BEfore the Statute (Å¿aith M. <hi>Littleton</hi>) if Tenant by the CourteÅ¿ie did alien, &amp;c. in fee with warrantie, onely this, after his diÅ¿ceaÅ¿e, Å¿hould barre the Heyre: for this was a collaterall warrantie before the Statute. Since the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:307:76"/>
Statute it is cleere, that whether tenant by the CourteÅ¿ie, or tenant in the right of his wife, doe alien the wiues he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritace or marriage by his deede in <hi>pais,</hi> which warrantie leauing none aÅ¿Å¿ets, it is no barre to the heyre: But what if the Baron alien by fine leuied in the Kings court, with warrantie, Å¿hall this barre the heyre without any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cended in value?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Newton</hi> Chiefe IuÅ¿tice of the Common place, thought it Å¿hould by implication of words: for hee tooke <hi>dont nul fine<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> &amp;c.</hi> to be a generall exception, and therefore this alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by fine with warrant to remaine a collater all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie, as it was at Common Law.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Littleton</hi> giueth his voyce with them of contrary opinion which thought it an obÅ¿cure expoÅ¿ition to permit ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuocable alienation by Tenant in <hi>droit Å¿a feme</hi> onely by his warranting concord without aÅ¿Å¿etts when the Statute hath in the beginning taken it expreÅ¿ly from tenant by the CourteÅ¿ie alienating by Feoffement. <hi>Nul fine</hi> therefore, is as much to Å¿ay, <hi>nul loyall fine</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully leuied, <hi>viz.</hi> a fine leuied by Baron and Feme, for it is true that before this Statute was made (and Å¿omewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it too) there was no eÅ¿tate taile come into England. A fine might then well and rightfully haue beene leuied by Baron &amp; Feme, the Barons heire be bound with warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the wiues heire barred for euer: But now Å¿ince the Statute if Baron and Feme had made a feoffement in fÃ©e by deede in the Countrey, the womans heyre after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaÅ¿e of them both may haue a Writ of entry, <hi>Å¿ur cui in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> for all the huÅ¿bands warranty. And this Statute of GloceÅ¿ter, had left a fine no more force then a feoffement here, if the finall exception had not beene; for when it comes with <hi>inÅ¿emente &amp; in meÅ¿me le manner</hi> giuing a writt of entry to auoyd the alienation made by the father in the mothers life time, this might be extended perhaps to a fine leuied by them both, for where the Baron and feme doth alien by fine, its true that the Baron doth alien:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:307:77"/>
LeÅ¿t therefore a fine leuied by Baron and Feme Å¿hould be thought to be infÃ©ebliÅ¿hed, this exception of a fine was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ary, and it is to be intended of a fine loyall: For when the IuÅ¿tices know once that tenant in right of his wife, commeth to leuie a fine onely in his owne name they will not receiue it.</p>

But all mens opinions Å¿eemed to be, that this was no good plea, becauÅ¿e the Statute is, that the huÅ¿band Å¿hall haue the Appeale, though they agrÃ©ed that when the Action is by Common Law, as an Appeale <hi>De morte viri, ne vnques accouple,</hi> is a good plea, for no woman Å¿hall reuenge her huÅ¿bands death by Appeale, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hee were wife as well in right as in poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
