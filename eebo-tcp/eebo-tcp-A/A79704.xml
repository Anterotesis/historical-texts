            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eſides the diverſe cauſes of our former ſolemne Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both for the evill of Sin and of Puniſhment, lying ſtill in a great meaſure upon the whole Land, wee ſhould lay to heart the late ſhamefull backſliding and compliance of many with the Enemies, in the houre of temptation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is to be lamented, though the Lord our God hath taken pains to purge us by his Judgments of Sword and Peſtilence, yet there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our lives, our ſcumme remains in us, many returning with the dog to their former profaneneſſe, neglect of Gods worſhip in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, uncleanneſſe, drunkenneſſe, and other great provocations, as if they had been delivered to do all theſe abominations: Have we not juſt cauſe to mourn and be afraid that the Lord kindle the fire again, heap on more wood, and cauſe his fury to reſt upon us?</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is high time when the whole Land is threatned with a new breach from the North, to acknowledge our great and ſenſeleſſe ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who have no wayes rendred to the Lord according to the benefits received, though the Lord hath begun to draw back his hand in a ſenſible and unexpected delivery from the raging Peſtilence, and hath given us a little breathing from the cruell inſulting Enemie, yet all our promiſes and vows uttered in the day of our trouble, have proven to be as the early dew and morning cloud; neither have we brought forth the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and amendment of our wayes, while the Lord looked for them, after ſo gracious a Delivery: ſo that it is juſt with our God to diſappoint us of our expectation, when we look for healing to ſend new troubles, and to raiſe up in his wrath ſome, who have banded themſelves together in the North, contrary to our ſolemne Covenants.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Seeing our God hears Prayer, it is our duty to run to him in this day of trouble, and to wreſtle with tears and ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>plications, that our God in he might of his power would cruſh this Cockatrice Egge, that it break not forth into a fierie flying Serpent; that the inſolent pride of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of this diviſive and ſeditious Bond, may be rebuked by the Lord; that the ſimple who have been miſ-led, may be convinced and drawn out of the ſnare, that theſe who ſtand, may be ſtabliſhed by grace in their ſtedfaſtnes, and ſtrengthened with the ſpirit of Unity and Courage to oppoſe that diviſive motion: Laſtly, that the Work of Uniformity in Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be finiſhed, our Armies bleſſed and compaſſed with Gods favour, and a firme and well-grounded Peace ſettled betwixt the Kings Majeſty and Parliaments of both Kingdomes.</p>
