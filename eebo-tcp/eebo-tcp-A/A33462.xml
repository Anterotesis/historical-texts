            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(by the breath of God.) Now by Scripture is meant the Word of God written. Written then, Printed now; (by the way note and grant that written and printed come all to one; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten then, printed now) ſo then by Scriptures we meane the Word of God written.</p>
            <p>Now here the firſt caſe is, What ground there is that we ſhould ground our ſelves on the Scriptures, ſith for a matter of two thouſand years the Church was without Scripture, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny went to heaven when there was (before <hi>Moſes)</hi> no Scripture at all, and the Chriſtian Church was beſt and pureſt before the New Teſtament was written at all? This was pleaded in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> to juſtle out
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101419:27"/>
the Scriptures, and to place Traditions in the place of the Scriptures. All this ſhould not ſhake and totter the heart of a Chriſtian. Before <hi>Moſes</hi> the Lord did teach by tradition, without Scripture, and the Church did by the providence of God walk by as certaine rules then, as now. For this they who<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> of Traditions</note> will may ſee Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> againſt <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Reaſons are given why then the written word was not neceſſary as 'tis now; as that the Church was in families: after it came to be all one Nation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, now over all Nations. As alſo that the Patriarchs then had a ſpirit we have not. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> ſay they have an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, which <hi>Wotton</hi> calls (a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101419:27"/>
lewd opinion) yet they ſay this as onely for themſelves But ſure the Patriarchs, and the Church under the Patriarchs, had a certain and infallible rule to walk by, which was to them as the Scriptures are to us Their rule was the Word of God <hi>(but not written)</hi> ours is the ſame Word of God <hi>(but writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)</hi> It is enough that the Law hath now tied us to the Word of God written. And for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, the Apoſtles, men immediately inſpired being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and other infallible men (not Apoſtles) as <hi>Mark, Luke,</hi> there was no ſuch neceſſity to have the Word of God written, as there was after. Wherefore they did provide for this ere they died, and committed the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101419:28"/>
Word of God to writing, when there ſhould be no ſuch men to conſult with.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſit down by the Scriptures, the Word of God written, as the onely ſure card, and rule to guide us in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, and life: For if we leave this once, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Aire,</hi> no place for this poor <hi>Dove,</hi> this poore ſoul of ours to reſt her foot; without which, when, and where to ſtay, none can tell.</p>
            <p>That then we may not run from opinion to opinion, from Chriſt to Chriſt, from Church to church, till we have run our ſelvs out of all, our onely ſure way is to flie to the Scriptures, to the written VVord of God, as to an Anchour, that ſo we may have hope, if hope, then faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101419:28"/>
Before we go further we muſt take it as cleare, that by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Chriſt and his Apoſtles do meane the VVord of God written. Our enquiry is, <hi>What written word?</hi> Not the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copy, for that was in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and there onely, and not<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 9 Heb. 9. 4</note> to be ſeen of every body, if of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body, but the high Prieſt: and I know nothing but thoſe Tables periſhed with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nor can it be, that when he did call upon them to ſearch the Scriptures he did ſend them to the Ark, which then was not. I doubt not but he meant by the Scriptures, the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Prophets.</hi> Now who can think that Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did turn over the Church and people of God to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101419:29"/>
written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets own hands? thoſe were not then extant, nor when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to be ſeene of every body. What then? when he bade them ſearch the Scriptures, he muſt needes meane ſome tranſcribed <hi>Copies,</hi> or ſome <hi>Tranſlations</hi> For <hi>Copies</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> I doubt me whether the common people did then underſtand the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Bereans,</hi> who did ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>I</hi> think it paſt queſtion, that there were many ordinary people, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>Coblers</hi> or <hi>Taylors,</hi> or ſuch, as Dr <hi>J. Rainolds</hi> ſeems to judg.</p>
            <p>If this be granted that thoſe who were commanded to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and commended for <hi>ſearching the Scriptures,</hi> did not, could not ſearch the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101419:29"/>
               <hi>Hebrew,</hi> what ſhall we think then? No other can be imagined but ſome Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they did underſtand, <hi>Syriack, Chaldee,</hi> but chiefly the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, which the moſt, if not all, underſtood.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators were ſubject to miſtake, and erre, or worſe, being no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and if they did underſtand the Hebrew, yet ſith they could not come by the firſt Original Copy, they muſt needs have recourſe to ſome tranſcribed Copies. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church were to repaire to Tranſlations, or to tranſcribed Copies, all comes to one, ſith neither Tranſcribers nor Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were Prophets. Very good men let them be, yet men they were, and ſubject to errour.</hi> May I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101419:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpeake my Opinion, I think when Chriſt ſaid <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> he meant the Sc i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures tranſlated into Greek, and by Scriptures, the Apoſtles meant the Greek Tranſlation, which tongue, if not in Chriſts time, yet in the Apoſtles times in a manner all did underſtand. VVherefore when the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>(is given by inſpiration, and is profitable)</hi> he meanes it is profitable to be read, or heard read in the Greek Tranſlation. And the rather am I of this minde, becauſe Schollars do know that the New Teſtament doth cite the places out of the Old Teſtament according to the Greek Tranſlation, and moſt an end are very punctual in it. However, whither we look on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101419:30"/>
Tranſlations, or Tranſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſith the firſt Table writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by God himſelfe was loſt with the Temple, and the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Greek Copy of the Tranſlation of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, the Learned think, (and I think they think well in it) burned by <hi>Julius Coeſars</hi> Army, when they fired <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and the famous Library there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epheſians</hi> were built on the Prophets and Apoſtles; the Apoſtles they had with them, but the Prophets were dead and gone; <hi>Malachi</hi> was the laſt; the Apoſtles they might conſult with and they had their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but for the writings of the Prophets, the <hi>Epheſians</hi> being <hi>Gentiles</hi> (I take it for granted)

            <p>But that we may not leave any rubb in the conſciences of the weak, as touching the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures, as touching the Originals and Tranſlations, we will ſhut up all in brief.</p>
            <p>For the Originals, though we have not the Primitive Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies written by the finger of God in the Tables, or by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or by the Apoſtles, and the reſt in the Greek for the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, yet we have Copies in both languages, which Copies vary not from the Primitive

            <p>What if there be variety of readings in ſome Copies? and ſome miſtakes in writing or Printing? this makes nothing againſt our doctrine, ſith for all this the fountaine runs clear, and if the fountain be not clear all tranſlations muſt needs be muddie.</p>

The foundation I firſt lay is, <hi>That we may have a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty moral of things whereof we have no evidence:</hi> which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſettle us in an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red faith, free from all feare, and material doubt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. We beleeve without making any queſtion of it, that<note place="margin">Scot. prole. Sent. q. <hi>2.</hi> quart.</note> there is ſuch a place as <hi>Rome,</hi> though we never ſaw it, that ſuch a man is our father, ſuch a woman our mother, and we out of conſcience do duties to them, albeit we have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent certainty of it, but by belief that ſuch a Prince is true heir to a Crown, and out of conſcience we do performe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and yet we can have <note place="margin">Howard. p: <hi>37.</hi>
               </note>no more certainty of this but moral: For who hath or can
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101419:36"/>
have an evidence of this, that ſuch an heire is the true begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of ſuch a King.</p>
            <p>It's agreed on by almoſt all Divines of all ſides, that if one of the Propoſitions be in the Scripture, and the other be but a moral certainty which leaves no dubitation behinde it, the concluſion bindes the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>As thus, every childe is bound in conſcience to honour his Parents</hi> (this is an act of faith grounded on the Scripture) <hi>ſuch or ſuch a man is my father,</hi> this is but a moral certainty, yet hence it followes, that <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I ſtand bound, in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to honour ſuch a man as my Father.</hi> And that he is my Father, all the certainty I can have is but moral, built on the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101419:37"/>
credit of my mother. If theſe reaſonings were not firme, it would deſtroy all Policy and Order in this life, nor could Gods Law to <hi>honour father and mother</hi> binde the conſcience, nor can a man tell that he was baptized in his youth but by ſuch Teſtimonies as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">De concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is l. 2. 0. 9.</note> Therefore I like that of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> who ſtands upon it, that of ſuch like things a certainty may be had from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of men, in ſome ſort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comparable to natural evidence it ſelf, for that it leaves no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or dubitation in our minds: But what of all this? Why it ſhewes that the general conſent of (in a manner) all <hi>Hebricians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> in the Chriſtian world, conſenting that our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals

are by the good hand of God preſerved uncorrupt, and pure, is a ſufficient perſwaſion, to breed a moral certainty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to natural evidence, excluding all reaſonable dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary.</p>
            <p>That the Originals were for the proviſion and food of the ſoules of his Church kept pure and uncorrupt by the Prophets and <hi>Jewes</hi> for the old; by the Apoſtles and Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Scot l. <hi>1.</hi> D. <hi>26.</hi> contra iſtam.</note> ſealed up by St. <hi>John</hi> the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of Chriſt, as <hi>Scotus</hi> calls him.

Thus the caſe ſtands. The Originals are to be received and believed. That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> are the true Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals we believe by humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, which leave the mind without perplexitie, without all doubting, and ſo it follows, that by mans teſtimonie the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals are to be received, and believed by us, ſo that the heart ſtands free from any true cauſe of any doubting at all, which being equivalent to the higheſt certainty that is, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but lay a foundation to build our faith upon, this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty being a meanes by which we come to the other of the Scriptures, being the laſt ground on which we build our faith; we are not to look for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101419:38"/>
in arguments of this nature. It's a fooliſh thing to expect from a Mathematician to deale by perſwaſion: his Art lies in evident and ocular demonſtration. Now 'tis as abſurd to expect demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from an Orator or Moraliſt; his buſineſſe lies in perſwaſion. But yet in our point in hand, our perſwaſions muſt be grounded on ſuch moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as is to us without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and without feare of the contrary.

of all, the principles are proving, but not proved: For that which is the firſt cannot be proved by any thing before it; elſe the firſt were not the firſt; as the firſt mover is never mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved And in all <hi>Inferiour</hi> Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the firſt principles of that Science, muſt be proved in an higher Schoole.

               <hi>2.</hi> As touching Tranſlations.</head>
            <p>IT is granted that tranſlators were not led by ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſpirit as the Prophets, and Apoſtles were. In the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> after much debating by witty and learned heads, they concluded, <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">Canus Bel.</note> 
               <hi>Tranſlators were not Apoſtles, but very near unto them.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Papiſts are of the ſame mind, onely <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the ſeaventie two Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours of the old Teſtament into Greeke were infallible. Some are ſo quite another way, that they like not any translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Difference of Churches <hi>c. 11</hi>
               </note>at all. Smith, the <hi>Se-baptiſt</hi> is utterly againſt reading tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in times of worſhip. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101419:47"/>
his <hi>Reaſons,</hi> two are the chiefeſt. One is, <hi>that we muſt worſhip God with the beſt we have: Tranſlations are not the beſt, but the Originals.</hi> Yet I hope they that know not the Originals, Tranſlations are the beſt they have.</p>
            <p>If this were true, then none can worſhip God in and by reading of the Scriptures, but ſuch as underſtand the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; nor is that currant in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Divinity, that we muſt ſerve God with the beſt. There is good, there is better, there is beſt of all: So that if one do that which is good, he ſinnes not, though he do not that which is better, if he do that which is better, he ſinnes not, though he do not do that which is beſt of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101419:47"/>
all. He ſinnes not, who keepes within the circle of that which is good, albeit he do not do that which is better, or that which is beſt of all.</p>
            <p>Againe, a thing may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely better in it ſelf, yet a leſſe good thing in it ſelfe may be better in ſome reſpects and circumſtances. As ſimply in it ſelf, marriage is ſimply better then a ſingle life, yet in ſome reſpects <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews that a ſingle life is better then marriage; <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note>and this is <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity, <hi>Though a man do not that which is better, nor that which is beſt, yet as long as he doth do that which is good, he ſins not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His other reaſon is, <hi>That we muſt worſhip God with our owne gifts, not with anothers: As</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101419:48"/>
               <hi>Tranſlations are not our doing, but made by the gifts and paines of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> To this we ſay, that 'tis true, we muſt worſhip God with our owne gifts, but it is not true, that in the worſhip of God with the help, and by the meanes of that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers we do not exerciſe our owne gifts. The maine of the worſhip of God is, <hi>That we worſhip him in and with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and truth in the inward parts:</hi> and ſo we muſt and may doe, and do do, when we make uſe of Tranſlations. When we reade tranſlations, we muſt reade them with Faith, and with the Spirit, which are our inward gifts and graces, elſe our reading is not to profit our ſelves withal: and what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101419:48"/>
the tranſlation is, to the uſe of <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they do not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cannot prove.</p>
            <p>So we are ſaid to ſing with the Spirit, and yet we ſing with the Spirit the better for that; and to pray with the Spirit, and yet the book is no hindrance to that neither. Others gifts as long as they rather further then hinder the uſe of our own gifts, can be no blur in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>The ſame man doth wrangle with the originals too, not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but denying the uſe of the book in the originals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in worſhip, for that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles wrote books, but did never divide their books into Chapters and Verſes, till <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> but the other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101419:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
day firſt made the verſes of the New Teſtament, which being man invention, is not, ſaith he, to be uſed in the worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>But whether <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did it firſt for chapters, or <hi>Robert,</hi> or <hi>Henry Stephens</hi> for the New Teſtament did it into verſes, is not material, ſith we place no Religion in it, and this proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is known to be a great helpe to men in the worſhip of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We paſſe by this as a giddineſſe of a weak braine in this <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He grants <hi>Tranſlations</hi> are of good uſe, but not in the worſhip of God: and if of good uſe elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, why not there? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Colloſſians,</hi>

               <hi>in them richly, in all wiſdome.</hi> They being <hi>Grecians,</hi> I take it for granted, that the moſt of them were not skilled in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the New Teſtament being not written, not any of it, till after <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> not all of it nntill <hi>John</hi> a matter of ſixty years after Chriſts death. This to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> could not be meant of the New Teſtament, but of the Old. So againe, the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> being <hi>Grecians,</hi> did not underſtand the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet they were commanded to <hi>prove all things:</hi> By what? why by the Scriptures, and this was the Old Teſtament which, they underſtanding not (the <hi>Hebrew)</hi> then it cannot but be meant of the tranſlation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:101419:50"/>
This Concluſion I think is clear, ſith the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were commanded to read <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> and read them they could not but in a tranſlation; therefore <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are commanded by God, as an Ordinance and conſtitution of Heaven it felf.</hi>

               <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> had together certaine Learned Jewes, skilful in the Greek Language, in number ſeventy two, and by them he cauſed the Old Teſtament to be done into Greek about two hundred and ninety years before the Birth of Chriſt: And this is obſerved to be a fit time to have it done; for, if it had not been done till after the coming of Chriſt, either the Jewes out of envy would have kept and hid the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies, or corrupted them, or elſe caſt ſome ſuſpition, and evil report of evil doings on the tranſlators; All which (it being done at this time) was prevented.</p>

Now though this were done before the coming of Chriſt, and ſo of the time of the full calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet it was not ſo long before, but that it was a fit preparative againſt the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (whoſe language ſince <hi>Alexanders</hi> conqueſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally was Greek) and ſith there then was no printing, no Copies could be ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad but by manuſcripts, and writing, which is great labour and coſt, and this being ſuch a ſlow work, there needed that this tranſlation ſhould be done ſome good ſpace before the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that ſo a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number of Manuſcript-written Copies might be had and ſcattered abroad among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

language whatſoever.

               <hi>Wotton:</hi> his words are theſe. <hi>No man ever dreamed that we commonly build our faith upon our Engliſh tranſlation.</hi> What he would have by the word <hi>(com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly)</hi> I know not, except his heart did faile his penne, when he wrote this, and by this word <hi>(commonly)</hi> he had a conceit that he might finde by it ſome ſhift and ſtarting hole.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> ſtrange ſpeech it is to me, that <hi>Engliſh</hi> men (of ſuch he ſpeaks) who can underſtand no language but <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſhould be ſaid not to build their faith on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſlation.

not. And if they muſt not build their faith on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> translation they are left nothing to build their faith on. And what is this, but to leave all unlearned in the Originals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rule. And if this be not to ſteale Atheiſme into the hearts of the common people, I know not what is, ſith Atheiſme is ſuch a welcome gueſt to the corrupt heart as it is.</p>

               <hi>Which makes me call to mind an Obſervation of</hi> Villeroy, <hi>a late wiſe Secretary of</hi> France, That the maine different Sects of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the East, and the fierce op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they made each againſt each, made the people weary of the Chriſtian Religion, and ſo <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> crept in with his religion, and was too welcome to almoſt all, who
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101419:56"/>
were almoſt weary of the ſundry He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and Schiſms, which were ſo brief and rife amongſt Chriſtians of the Eaſt: And this (ſaith he) overthrew the Chriſtian Church firſt, and the Chriſtian Empires and ſtates next, over the Eaſt, and let in <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alchoran, and <hi>Mahomets</hi> Sword.</p>
            <p>I doubt there is ſcarce any ſtrange opinion preſſing hither, but would be welcome to us: The Chriſtian Religion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ſuch danger ſince my time as it is now, ſith men runne ſo many and ſo contrary wayes, that few can now tell which is true. And ſince ſo great a Clerk, and ſo great a Reformer as <hi>Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> hath left the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> man no rule to prove his own, or to diſprove the contrary:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101419:56"/>
For if the Engliſh translation be not to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, let <hi>Elias</hi> come, and tell us what, and which is the rule, and on what an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man may build his faith on, being that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left him but his Engliſh translation.</p>
            <p>So the old Church after <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi,</hi> what was left to the moſt but the Greek Tranſlation? and after the Apoſtles were dead and gone, the Chriſtian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were tied to the Greek tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Old Teſtament, or elſe the Old Teſtament was no rule to them, except to a few, who underſtood the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</p>
            <p>That which all men ſay, (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> is not to be doubted, but al the learned <hi>(I</hi> think)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101419:57"/>
agree, that the Church uſed no tranſlation but the <hi>Greek,</hi> for a matter of ſix hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth of Chriſt, for two hundred yeares before. So that for my part, I look upon it as a <hi>poſition</hi> full of danger for men to affirme, <hi>That tranſlations are not a rule to ground our faith on, when we underſtand no other.</hi> That (ſay I) or none: not none, therefore that.</p>
            <p>And now at laſt, after the clearing of what is paſt, we come to the maine point, to find out what it is that a poore ſoule who underſtands not the Originals muſt reſt upon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, that the Lord is not, nor will not be wanting to his Church in things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſalvation: And to have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101419:57"/>
a rule to build our faith on, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. And that rule for common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be the Scripture tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, or nothing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take it to be a ſpecial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that the Scriptures ſhould be tranſlated for the uſe of the Church in ſeveral lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>

the Word of God: and if it do not agree with the Original, it is not the tranſlation of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>And now we will draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the main concluſion, <hi>How a ſimple Countrey-man is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Bible to be the Word.</hi> Doctor <hi>Jackſon,</hi> and Maſter <hi>John Goodwin</hi> have ſet downe many, and many excellent things, but they flie ſo high, that they are for Eagles. One may ſay of their books, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of his books of Philoſophy, <hi>That they were publiſhed, yet not publiſhed,</hi> ſeeing not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without his help. Now all the conſiderations theſe great Sophies have, and let there be as much more added to them,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101419:60"/>
yet they will not do the work, till they come to the teſtimony of the ſpirit: They may and do work, and acquire in us an humane faith, which may ſtand free from actual heſitation, and doubting, but not from poſſible dubitation, for lay them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet they may deceive, or be deceived.</p>

            <p>Well then, though all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſons, the conſent of all the world, will not help us to that faith in the Word, which will help us to heaven, yet they are a preparation, and ſuch a preparation to this faith infuſed, that we cannot ordinarily look for faith infuſed, but by the way of this faith which is gotten by the arguments, reaſons, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, convictions, and helps wrought by the Argumentations, and conſiderations propoſed by men which do work (as moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it doth) in us an acquired hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane faith free from actual (though not from poſſible) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake and doubting.</p>

This may be and is, a faire meanes to bring us to look on the Scripture without any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al queſtion made of it as the Word of God. And then by the uſe of the Word to attain to a Divine faith, which is infallible by reaſon of the Divine infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible truth rightly conceived and believed by it. For it is out of queſtion that by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of men, who are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply infallible, both we may, and do attain unto that faith in the divine Revelations of the Word, which are or is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
            <p>Its no Paradox to hold, that <hi>a thing not infallible, may by way of Miniſtry lead us to that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which is infallible:</hi> For my part, I hold <hi>univerſal tradition</hi> as

            <p>But what is this to tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101419:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Much every way.

            <p>Now, what ſhall a poore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Chriſtian do, if that he hath nothing to reſt his poore ſoul on? the originals he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not; if he did, the firſt Copies are not to be had; and he cannot tell whether the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew

So I dare lay it on the ſame God, that he in his providence is ſo with the Church of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they have and do preſerve the Greek Text uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and clear: As for ſome ſcapes by Tranſcribers, that comes to no more, then to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a book to be corrupt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome ſcapes in the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and 'tis certaine, that what miſtake is in one print, is correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another.</p>

            <p>For what if Interpreters and Tranſlators were not Prophets, yet God hath and doth uſe ſo to guide them, that they have been, are, and ſhall be preſerved from ſo erring in tranſlating the Scriptures, that the ſouls of his people may have that which will feed them to eternal life, that they ſhall have ſufficient for their inſtruction, and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, and ſalvation hereafter?

            </p>
            <p>So here is no uſe of the Spirit to reveal new lights, but to ſhew us the evidence of theſe truthes which are in the Word. <hi>A private ſpirit is to lead us from, this is to lead us to the Word.</hi> And all this is done by illightning our underſtandings, and ſanctifying our wills to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and to approve the evidence of truth, which is in the Scripture and no other.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101419:76"/>
in their converſion, that then they are <hi>Goddified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report is that thoſe ſprung up amongſt us, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are of the ſame fancy, and that they preſſe this place of <hi>John,</hi> that being once borne of God, they do not commit ſinne, for Gods ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in them, and that they cannot commit ſin, becauſe they are borne of God.</p>
            <p>Their ſenſleſſe ſenſe cannot<note place="margin">1 John 1: 8, 9, 10.</note> be the meaning of that place. For the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Epiſtle ſaith, <hi>that, if we ſay that we have no ſinne, we make him a liar.</hi> And is not<note place="margin">Concil. <hi>Milevit. can.</hi> 6.</note> this a ſinne, and a very great one too, to make God a liar? <hi>John</hi> ſaith not, if <hi>(you)</hi> but if <hi>(we),</hi> comprehending himſelfe too:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101419:76"/>
and I hope it cannot be thought but <hi>John,</hi> a chiefe Apoſtle, was born of God.</p>
            <p>Beſides it is not onely ſaid, <hi>That he who is borne of God doth not ſinne, but (cannot) ſinne.</hi> And all over the Bible in the ſtories of the beſt of men who were borne of God, we ſee that they could ſinne, and did ſinne, and thoſe ſinnes which were very great too.</p>
            <p>This then is not the ſenſe of the place, that there was, is, or ever ſhall be any meere man borne ſo of God as not to ſin, or to be in and under ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as to ſay truly of him, that he <hi>(cannot)</hi> ſin.</p>
            <p>Now for that which theſe write, <hi>that when once made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Divine nature, they</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:101419:77"/>
               <hi>are as perfect as</hi> Adam <hi>in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> This is but their owne fancy, it is no ſuch matter: But ſay it were ſo, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but as perfect as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven, yet from that it followes not, that it could, or can be ſaid of them ſimply, that they cannot ſinne: For <hi>Adam</hi> did, and therefore could ſinne: he had indeed a Tempter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but no concupiſcence to tempt him within. Nay, more then that, the lapſed Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their fall had nothing from within, nothing from without to tempt them. Within nothing but purity and holineſſe, no ſin, no ſhadow of ſinne: Nothing from without to tempt them; nothing within but holineſſe, nothing without but holineſſe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101419:77"/>
without ſpot, or wrinkle, yet then thoſe very Angels were ſin-able, for they did fall, and therefore could ſin.</p>
            <p>The truth is, None but God ia abſolutely free from all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſinning: God onely<note place="margin">Apoc. 15. 4</note> in this ſenſe is holy, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth not lie, but he <hi>cannot lie: Adam</hi> in Paradiſe was made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the Angels in Heaven were made more pure then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> both <hi>Adam</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels had the advantage of the places to be kept from ſinne, but being creatures crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with free will, thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe (that heaven upon earth) might and did ſinne; and ſo might all the reſt of the Angels too, had they not been ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101419:78"/>
by grace for thoſe were<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21</note> elected, and<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 11. 5</note> Election is of grace. And ſhould the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Angels ſinne but once the leaſt ſin that is, they could not be ſaved, as it fell out with thoſe Angels which did ſin: For<note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14</note> Chriſt took not the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, becauſe they cannot be reſtored by a Mediatour. The Angels are holy, <hi>Daniel</hi> 4. 13. and ſo muſt be ſaved, which could not be, if they could and ſhould ſinne, <hi>Matthew</hi> 21. 30, 31.<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 10</note> Againe, thoſe miniſtering ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do alwayes ſee the face of God, which were not true, if they ſhould ſin: For no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did thoſe non-Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſin, but they preſently left
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101419:78"/>
their habitation, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. and were caſt downe into <hi>Tartar,</hi> that is Hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 4.</p>
            <p>Indeed when men are once in Heaven they are ſafe from ſin, there is no place for tears, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not for ſinne, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4. Now <hi>Luke</hi> 20. There is no more promiſed to the bleſſed men after the reſurrection, then to the Angels, that then they ſhall be equal, not ſuperior to the Angels: therefore nor men, nor Angels Elect can or ſhall ſin in Heaven, which the other Angels did once in Heaven, for that they were not Elect, nor confirmed in and by grace.</p>
            <p>Thus then you ſee that it could not be ſaid of the unelect
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101419:79"/>
Angels once in heaven, nor of any ſort of men till they come to heaven that they nor do, nor can ſin. For my part, <hi>I</hi> think, that thoſe who ſay they do not, they cannot ſin, though they ſay ſo, yet I think they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not think ſo. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a golden ſaying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine:</hi> He ſaith, he who thinks<note place="margin">De Civit. Dei. l. <hi>14.</hi> c. <hi>8</hi>
               </note> he can live without ſinne, doth not avoid ſinne, but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all pardon. So that this is not the ſenſe of the words, That ever any man was, is, or ſhall be in the world, who either cannot or doth not ſin.</p>

For this is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that of the ſame Saint <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Whoſoevor ſinneth hath not ſeene him, neither known him, meaning,</hi> that the ſeeing and knowing him doth not let in ſin, but rather this is againſt ſin. So <hi>Paul, I do that I would not, I do not do what I would:</hi> there is no queſtion, but there is ſome ignorance, ſome not knowing of him when any ſinne is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Anthony Burges</hi> ſpeech <hi>I</hi> think is in the right. All ſins ſaith he are called, becauſe all ſinners are ignorant of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101419:80"/>
they ſhould know, <hi>there being no ſinne which doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſome errour in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical judgement: For although a man ſin wilfully and adviſedly, ſo that there is no other cauſe of the malice, but the malice it ſelf, as</hi> Auſtine <hi>ſpeaks of ſome of his ſins; yet even then there is an errour in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Burgeſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Antinom. p. <hi>237</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>that mans conſcience.</hi> Thus he, and to this I ſubſcribe. So that it is not faith, nor knowledge which dwelleth in us, is the cauſe why we ſin, but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, it is ſin which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us: <hi>Not I (as I) but ſinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> So then a man borne of God, when he treads beſide the line, he may ſay, <hi>it is not I, but ſinne that dwells in me:</hi> ſo in this ſenſe, it is a truth, that he that is borne of God, as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101419:80"/>
born of God doth not ſin, <hi>nor cannot ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is pious, and truth, but under correction I do not think it to be the ſquare meaning of this text. What then? ſome think it to be this. <hi>He that is borne of God, ſinneth not,</hi> that is, <hi>ſinneth not as the devil did,</hi> who <hi>ve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſe</hi> 8. of this chapter, <hi>ſinneth</hi> (not ſinned) <hi>but ſinneth from the beginning.</hi> And this is like to be the mind of this text, for that it is ſaid in the ſame verſe before, He <hi>that committeth ſinne is of the Devill.</hi> That I think is too ſhort which ſome ſay, that the proper ſenſe of this Text is, he that is <hi>born of God ſinneth not, that ſinne of blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word then, the full mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101419:81"/>
is, <hi>that he that is borne of God doth not commit ſinne,</hi> that is, he doth not make it his practice, his occupation, his work; he doth it, when he doth it beſides his minde, and when he doth it, he<note place="margin">Luke 15</note> is beſides himſelf in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as the Prodigal was. It is long of ſome fits in his diſeaſe, when he doth it not onely as his act, but as his work, who give<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16</note> themſelves over to be ſould, and ſervants to ſin. So <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7: 23: <hi>Depart from me all ye that work iniquity:</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of ſuch who are not regenerate, whoſe deſire is to ſin, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to commit it: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the regenerate do ſin: ſo this our Apoſtle, <hi>If we ſay we ſay we have no ſin we ſeduce our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:101419:81"/>
Nor do they ſin onely of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, but ſometimes they fall into greater ſins, even into ſome of the greateſt ſins, but this is not<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 16</note> unto death as our Apoſtle ſaith. So that ſuch as are born of God ſin they may, ſin they do, and ſometimes great ſins, but to go on in a courſe of finning to the death, this they do not, that they cannot do, becauſe they are born of God.</p>
            <p>The onely ſhew of exception that can be taken, is, that <hi>Adam</hi> who is called (they ſay) <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>ult. the ſon of God did ſin,</hi> and might, as the ſtate ſtood with him, unto death: And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels called the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> Job 2. 1. did a many of them ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</p>

But we read not that theſe were ſaid to be borne of God, or that they had this ſeed remaining in them. They were called the ſons of God in reſpect of that that holineſſe wherein they were created; but the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that are (ſaid to be borne of God) are ſo ſaid, not onely in reſpect of the image of God, but of Chriſt, and the grace of regeneration, which is rooted in Chriſt, which as it cannot die in Chriſt the roote, ſo it cannot wither away in Chriſtians the branches. The ſap, which is ſtill alive and freſh in Chriſt, is by the Spirit of Chriſt kept ſo alive in them, that albeit it do not keep them from ſinning, yet it doth ſo preſerve them, that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101419:82"/>
they cannot ſin unto death; they are ſo the members of Chriſt, that he will not ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his true members to ſin all their ſpiritual life away.</p>
