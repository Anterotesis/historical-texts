            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A SEDITIOUS DISCOURSE <hi>CONCERNING</hi> The RELIGION of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eeting with your <hi>Discourse of the Religion of</hi> England, <hi>asserting, That Reformed Christianity settled in its due Latitude, is the Stability and Advancement of this Kingdom:</hi> I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to peruse it, because, casting my Eye upon your Preface, I found your first words acknowledge, <hi>That Religion is deeply imprinted in humane Nature, and hath a great power over it;</hi> therefore I could not but hope to meet with the great Effects of it, in your own; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, since you seem'd so sollicitous only for the <hi>Peace of Religion, and the Nation;</hi> and that you did so ingenuously profess, <hi>That nothing was suggested in your Discourse for Politick ends: That Episcopacy was not undermin'd, nor</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48679:3"/>
               <hi>any other Form of Government insinuated: That all Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Arrogance, presuming to give Rules to Governors, or teach them what to do, was carefully avoided: That only the Possibility, Expediency, and Necessity of Moderation was represented: And that you humbly desired this honest inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours in pursuance of Peace, might find a favourable reception.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the pretended Incense you offer to the Publick good, hoping that the smoke of it will skreen your False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from view; but being smoke, it vanisheth, and leaves your designs so perspicuous, that I esteemed my self obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to detect you, and to shew the World how contrary your Discourse is to all these Pretensions in your Preface: A man may see an itching humor in you to be doing, but what, one can hardly conjecture, but by the shadows of your motions, which are subtle and violent, and therefore properly to be called <hi>Presbiterian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three differing wayes of Religion are mentioned in your Discourse to be in this Realm, <hi>viz. Protestants of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>Protestants Non-conformists, and Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the <hi>Papists</hi> you begin, and therein spend seven Sections, which are premised on purpose to make your Reader more attentive and kind to the Author, who would be accounted so fiery an enemy to them: But this part of your Discourse I am not concerned in, who neither am, nor ever was a <hi>Papist;</hi> nor do I pretend to understand their Religion, as you do; therefore I shall leave them to the consideration of the Parliament, who, you confess, <hi>hath appointed a Committee to receive Informations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them:</hi> only I shall offer somewhat out of your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, whereby it may truly be discern'd how true an enemy you are in your heart to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48679:3"/>I have heard very wise and great Politicians say, that <hi>Jesuites</hi> are but <hi>Popish Presbiterians,</hi> and <hi>Presbiterians</hi> but <hi>Protestant Jesuites:</hi> and it is no wonder, that Cocks of the Game, bred up in the same Principles, should sometimes fight with one another, not coldly, as with some others, but with most sharp and deadly stroakes, provoked and enabled by the Spurs of Emulation and Pragmaticallness: Under this consideration I confesse you may be looked upon as an enemy, but wherein else, we will now consider.</p>
            <p>In your Preface you acknowledge that in this your discourse, <hi>you only submissively offer to the consideration of your Superiours, a Relaxation only of the Prescribed Uniformity, and some Indulgence to Dissenters of sound Faith, and good life:</hi> amongst which number you account the <hi>Papists,</hi> because after the Character you have given of their Faith and Actions, you say in your Seventh <hi>Section, That Notwithstanding they have not changed their Principles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but have taken methods of greater artifice and subtilty, yet you professe that your whole preceeding Discourse against them, is not directed against the security of their Persons and Fortunes, or any meet Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Clemencie towards them;</hi> but advise, <hi>That they may have their Faith to themselves, without being vexed with snares, or any wayes afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here your Proposing a <hi>Tolleration for Popery,</hi> under the pretence of a <hi>meet Indulgence or Clemencie,</hi> must not by any means be thought a <hi>suggestion for Politique Ends,</hi> although 'tis one of the chiefest in your whole discourse, since it increases the number of the Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which presently makes the body of them (in your opinion) so <hi>momentous, &amp;c.</hi> Next, The <hi>security</hi> (without any limitation) which you plead
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48679:4"/>
for their <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> (which at once proposes the Repealing of all the Poenall Statutes against them (which you account <hi>snares</hi>) is in your opinion, <hi>only a Relaxation of the prescribed Uniformity, and no pragmatical arrogance, nor doth not</hi> (in the least) <hi>presume to teach your Governours what to doe,</hi> contrary to the established Sanctions both of Church and State. But <hi>Dat veniam Corvis,</hi> You may write what you please, provided you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <hi>That you only propound these things in Case of insuperable necessity, and that for Truth's sake:</hi> but should any thing of the like nature be in the least motioned by any else of whatsoever persuasion, we know the Tune, you would sing presently.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, I will accompany you to your main design where you would be, though with much cunning &amp; sliness you creep to it by degrees, and with more Pollicy, even then, conceal it, when you speak it; so that none may see your skin, but only such as can see thorough the thin lawn of your Rhetorick.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>10</label> First then in your Tenth <hi>Sect.</hi> you tell us, That you would have <hi>Reformed Christianity</hi> to be settled in the Kingdom in its <hi>full extent.</hi> In your Eleventh, <hi>That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Non-Conformists are most momentous in the Ballance of the Nation.</hi> In your Twelfth, <hi>That the Extirpation of them is most difficult and unprofitable.</hi> And in your Thirteenth, <hi>That all this your discourse for them, is neither threatning nor intimation of Rebellion.</hi> I could wish, you had not mentioned these last words, for the very telling us, you do not threaten, after you have discoursed so largely of the number, momentousnesse, and weight of <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Conformists,</hi> and withall of the impossibility of their extirpation, which was never yet thought of, Does deeply <hi>threaten. Reform'd Christanity</hi> must be settled in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48679:4"/>
its <hi>full extent:</hi> this argues, that it is not yet done; Those who require it, are an <hi>innumerous people, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> and <hi>momentous,</hi> (which indeed they did demonstrate sufficiently but the other day, when they bare down all before them) and now being again debarr'd from the <hi>Benefices</hi> and <hi>Fatness</hi> of the Land, they esteem themselves ruin'd and extirpated: and yet they cannot be extirpated; because it is neither good nor feasable; not feasable, and therefore, cannot; not good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and therefore will not: all this you say, and yet if any think you threaten in all this, he is much mistaken; you do not use to threaten, before you strike, nor strike, before you find evidently you can prevail, and strike home.</p>
            <p>But what is the Cause of all this Dissatisfaction, disgust, and disorder here amongst us? Because <hi>Reform'd Christianity is not settled and cherished in its due extent.</hi> O Sir, ought you not here to have expressed plainly and cleerly what you mean by <hi>Pure reformed Christianity,</hi> and what is the <hi>due and right extent thereof?</hi> This is the great and only work you had to doe, which you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble and neglect, and only tell us in general, <hi>That the line of this extent must be the measure of all mens Zeal; That this will advance Gods Kingdome and the Churches Glory: That this will promote the designes of Gospel, being true Protestantisme in its Latitude:</hi> this is all can be gathered from you: what is then the <hi>Latitude,</hi> what the <hi>right extent</hi> of <hi>Reformed Christianity?</hi> it is, say you, <hi>A measure extended in its right Latitude, for God and the Churches Glory:</hi> what is it? It is <hi>a Latitude cherished unto its extent according to the designes of Gospel:</hi> thus you enlighten us; what do we hear by all this, but what <hi>Protestant Conformists,</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformists, Papists</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48679:5"/>
and all say as well as you, and yet the Land is never a whit the wiser. But you think, more then you speak, as wise ones use to doe: and speak indeed like an awful Legislator, that is modelling a Plat-form of government within himself, and we must not know what you doe, till you have done it. I may indeed conjecture your meaning, and think you would only have the <hi>Presbiterians</hi> included within this line of Communication, and <hi>true extent of Reformed Christianity:</hi> so that made equal with the Reverend Bishops, they may Preach in Pulpits, what now they utter in darkness; and by their Vocal Zeal, render <hi>Episcopacy</hi> first <hi>unnecessary,</hi> then <hi>inexpedient,</hi> and at length <hi>Antichristian.</hi> But I will not use any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of my own, nor understand any more then you would have me; only give me leave to tell you, unto your no lesse satisfaction, then what you have given us, That <hi>Reformed Christianity</hi> is already settled, rooted, and cherished in the Land unto its due extent, unto its true Latitude, unto the right measure of Zeal, that will advance Gods Kingdome and the Churches Glory, promote virtue, and all the designes of Gospel, in the very best reformed way, which is, <hi>Protestantisme</hi> in its just and proper Latitude. What you propose to be done (as not done) is done already, so that all your Discourse, Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Legislation, for ought I see yet, is needless.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>12</label> Your Twelfth Section pretends to strike a smart blow; and your Thirteenth Section sayes it is not smart at all: something you have to say, and in the verie saying of it, you would have us to believe it is nothing. <hi>Violence</hi> (say you) <hi>towards Non-conformists will do no good with them that are a rational, willing People</hi> (to dispute and disobey the Government of Church and State) <hi>numerous, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous, sober, and peaceable men</hi> (sufficiently experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the late times) <hi>in whom no small part of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sobriety, frugality, and industry doth reside; who are not the Wasters, but mostly in the number of Getters</hi> (by plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the whole Nation) <hi>with whom Trade will cease, the Vitals of the Land expire, Money grow scarce, Rents fall, and all for the loss of those men, who rule themselves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that great Principle of Protestantism, Judgement of Discretion: Nor will there be found Magistrates to put such forceable wayes in execution upon them, to the terror of the whole Nation:</hi> Why do you then insinuate the suspicion of these fears? But we understand the figure of your stile in your whole Discourse, and do not question (by the assistance of God) but that the wisdom of His Majestie will obviate all the designs and threats of your Partie: in the mean time, Pray declare what Violence is either acted, or so much as thought of against those so <hi>rational,</hi> so <hi>willing,</hi> so <hi>sober,</hi> so <hi>peaceable,</hi> so <hi>momentous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> He that pretends a fear in himself, where no fear is, may well be suspected to contrive evil against his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whom he pretends to be afraid of: Remember this, it is no secret propertie of Malice and Sedition, but well

O say you, <hi>Rulers themselves must be ruled by Reason, or do worse.</hi> And so must their Subjects too, or else all will go ill; but which is the Reason Paramount in this case, that of Subjects? or their Rulers? But how doth this rid us of the fears you latelie put us in? <hi>Rulers must know their People;</hi> who is ignorant of that? and yet it were to be wished they did not know too near and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly some of their ill qualities, which were better stifled: <hi>Alas these Dissenters know they should have patience, and stand in their stations;</hi> 'tis true; but knowing and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are two things, and so is it likewise to stand in their stations in their <hi>own Houses, and in a Camp. Their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composure may speak Woe and Misery, not Wars and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.</hi> Marry Sir, Woe and Miserie is too much: but all our <hi>Woe and Miserie</hi> hath hitherto proceeded from <hi>Wars and Tumults,</hi> as their original issue; and if you assure us of the like <hi>Effect,</hi> we may well dread the like <hi>Cause. Their sullen Mutinies make no noise, though they may loosen all the joints and ligaments of Policy. They have not any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive motions, though they may bring a Paralitick or Hectick distemper, or Atrophy, or stop the current of vital blood in the veins of the State.</hi> O hold Sir, your heart runs over too abundantly: And is this your Rhetorick of persuading us to fear nothing from this <hi>sober, peaceable, rational,</hi> and <hi>willing People?</hi> because the Discomposure they are in, will bring nothing but <hi>Woe and Misery;</hi> their sullen <hi>Mutinies</hi> only <hi>loosing the joints and ligaments of</hi>

               <hi>Policy: their momentous issue will bring only a Paraletick or Hectick distemper, &amp;c.</hi> nothing else, no not any thing else: You cannot surely but smile in your own bosome, whilst you use such frightful horrors and dreadful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these, to acquit us of fear. Do you esteem all these dismal Events upon a Nation as Trifles? And <hi>are your sober, peaceable, rational and willing People ready to act all this without regret,</hi> as things of no moment amongst their momentous progeny? Surely, had you not already moulded every thing amongst your selves unto your own satisfaction, so that you are now ready, as you phrase it your self, <hi>to stand in your stations,</hi> you would not yet have dropt from your Pen, these your most villanous and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous derisions: let me prophesie for once, however plausible and facile the means you have projected may appear now unto you, you will miss of your end (as you have once already through the infinite mercie of Almightie God to this poor Nation) and fall your selves into these heavie miseries, which you mention as slight things, by way of derision to the State and Kingdom.</p>

               <hi>are deadly and needless Choke-pears, which you cannot swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; they are Popish Rites, besides Holy Scripture; they are Forms of men, and not of God; they are racks, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous scandals to weak Consciences;</hi> and so they were then: nor is there any more change in you, than in <hi>Aesop's</hi> Fox, who by force worried the Pullen, when he had them in his reach; and when he found them safely roosted, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded them by kindest words, that they might be all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for that he loved them all in <hi>Visceribus suis.</hi> And if the Bishops will but pull you up to them, because they think it not convenient to come down to you, we shall soon see how dearly you love them, and how quickly the frozen Serpent being warm'd in their bosome, will hiss and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48679:9"/>
sting both them and us; but of this we shall perceive more in your following Discourse.</p>
            <p>But why do you choose this Legislative way intermixt with supplications, for the obtaining of an End which you lately compassed so successfully by the Swords of <hi>your industrious, ready, and willing People?</hi> O, you sigh us out the reason hereof in most compassionate tones: <hi>The wiser sort of Dissenters (Presbiterians)</hi> say you, <hi>whose Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity were they gain'd, would most avail</hi> (for what?) <hi>are weary of these strifes, they dread the consequence of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the hurrying into other extreams, and the wilde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of some spirits; they would not be left again to the late uncertainty and continual vacillations in Government: and they have long since seen the manifold errors committed in the Policy of the late times: they know that such unfixed liberty would not secure them; and therefore it may be well thought, they would accept reasonable terms, and rest satisfied therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all this, the Nation well enough perceives, that <hi>you the wiser sort of Dissenters,</hi> are as readie now for War in your minds, as you were 28 Years ago, when it was first begun, and prospered in your hands: for you walk not any longer now in the dark, as then you did; you have the same resolution; greater purses, by plundring and cheating the whole Nation; more men educated already in your principles, and train'd up to your hands: and, which is the sum of all, a greater probabilitie now of Victorie, than before you durst promise to your selves. Why then do you not proceed prosperously, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get by strength, that authoritie and power, for which you do now so whiningly pray and supplicate? O! there is a <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>momentous</hi> reason for it, which you have not yet told us plain enough: Is it your inclination
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48679:10"/>
and love to Peaceableness? Love to your poor Countrie which you are loth to see any more imbroyl'd? Fear of success? No: shall I tell it you? wonder you needs must, how I got into your heart to find out your meaning; for your meaning once found out, will enable us sufficiently to understand your words; but your words will never guide us sufficiently to find out your meaning: It is this; You wise Dissenters do now seriously consider, that after you had betrayed the People into the waste of so much Time, Treasure, and Blood, in your last victorious War, enterprised for the rooting out of those <hi>damnable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Points and Practices in the Church of</hi> England; which now to currie favour with the same Partie (after strange Revolutions set up again by the miraculous hand of God) you call <hi>Trifling, and Indifferent things:</hi> in that very nick of time, when you looked to receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of your triumphant malice (the Victorie now wholly obtain'd, and the English Church and State then under your feet) it pleased God in his just judgment, for your Hypocrisie to Him, Treason and Sedition against the Church your Mother, and the King your Father, to let that Bodie of <hi>Puritans</hi> (whereof you were the leading part) to shiver imperceivably into several pieces, and the simpler part thereof (called afterwards <hi>Independents</hi>) to cast you the wiser part (then and ever since called <hi>Presbiterians</hi>) out of the Saddle: So that you reaped nothing considerable (besides the plundering the Nation) to what you expected, for your ten Years policie, sweat, and labour: And that very same Authoritie which then did back you, did, by the just judgment of God, so refine it self, by casting out their Members, which were judged by the rest not pure enough for their Design, that at last it dwindled into nothing: And you have now lived to see
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48679:10"/>
the same Church and State settled again, and cherished by the Magistrates (to the infinite satisfaction of all honest and sober men) which you had overthrown as you thought for evermore. And this is the only thing you dread again, here expressed by your self in such general words, as before we did not, but now do wholly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand: <hi>You fear strifes; the consequence of changings; the hurrying into extremes; the excursion of some spirits; the uncertainty and vacillations in Government, unfix'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> &amp;c. All this fear, in one word, is, lest you be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of your end as you was before: And you have very good reason to fear it; for why may not the Body of <hi>Presbiterians</hi> drop into several parts, to undermine and ruine themselves (after the Victory obtain'd) by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meals, till the last drop left alone, dry up, or be consumed by other second causes, as well as the Body of <hi>Puritans</hi> then did? And therefore you think it better (all things rightly considered) rather than fight again with so much expence to an uncertain event (and it may be, become liable to pay for the mischief you have formerly done) to entreat the Clergy that they would be pleased out of their own great love and bounty, to make you partakers of what they enjoy: For, it is but <hi>a little thing, a triste, a thing meer inaifferent, a very nothing that differences</hi> you and them: <hi>All Sacred Truths; All Indispensable Duties; All Established Principles; All Divine Rules of Sacraments, Prayers, and Worship; All indisputable Verities, they all agree in most harmoniously:</hi> and <hi>the other little, small, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, petty things, let them not be imposed to the Churches distemper and religious damage.</hi> Here is the sum and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the <hi>wise Dissenters;</hi> They would not be thought yet fully resolved to raise any more Wars, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered with them so ill before; nor threaten, as they did;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48679:11"/>
nor exaggerate the weightiness of the Cause as they did; but try now for a while some contrary Topick means, that for ought they know, may speed better. Their End indeed, (which is their own Profit,) is the same it was; but the means to obtain it, is new, <hi>viz. Humble Supplications:</hi> and that which hinders this Union, (which in Processe of our late Wars) were <hi>Fundamental Points,</hi> and <hi>the very Vitals of Christianity,</hi> yet they must be called in this calmer way, <hi>Indifferent little things:</hi> for things that are begged must be called <hi>little,</hi> though they are never so <hi>great;</hi> but when they are demanded by force, they must be named <hi>Great,</hi> though never so <hi>little.</hi> The doubt that our Reverend Bishops may justly have, is, Whether a Condescention to incorporate you into their own Sphere, may not prove ruinous to their own Clergy, and the whole State: for whilst you are below as Suppliants, your differences are <hi>little;</hi> but when you are in power, they will be then <hi>momentous</hi> again: And so the established Government of the Church, must perish by their own good liking.</p>

As an explicite assent, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, may by Superiors be too rigidly exacted in doubtful things; so the unreasonable stiffness and harshness of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, may keep them from that compliance in practice, which their Conscience (becalm'd from passion and prejudice) would not gainsay. Every Christian should be deeply sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the common Interest of Reformed Christianity, which is incomparably more valuable than those private, and little narrow Models, which may have much of fancy and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Well-minded persons may easily be deceived touching their private sentiments in Religion: they may think they are under the uncontroulable sway of Conscience, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are but bound up by custom, education, complexion, interest, or some other kind of prejudice. The prudent and sober should not easily settle upon such Opinions as will never settle the Nation, but tend rather to infinite perplexity and</hi>

Nevertheless (when all is said) some dissatisfaction doth invincibly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the judgment, in that case, Christian humility and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as discretion, adviseth such persons to acquiesce in their private security and freedom, and not to reach af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that liberty that may unsettle the Publick order, and undermine the common safety.</hi>

the melancholly mistakes of the People, by foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new jealousies amongst them: so that by raising again the winds of a general discontent, and then being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded by the confusion of another storm, you might more easily set up your selves: By such Cunnings, the Multitude may be carried above the perception of their understanding, contrary to what Religion would persuade them; but then we have seen by experience, that being once shaken in some Opinion, of which they had a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they presently fall into the same uncertainty of the other parts of their belief, which had no more authority with them, than those which were already shaken in them. We have sufficiently experimented how by destroying Charity, and disuniting the continuity of Faith, how it begot diversity of Opinions, which produced different Sects, whose Dissentions have been so mazed in the Errors of their own confusions, that at last they reduced Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be almost nothing but believing some few Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tending only to the overthrow of Church and State; which was quickly effected, and the <hi>Presbiterians</hi> (who were the Authors of it) presently thrown by, as it was expected, because it is the nature of the Vulgar (who erre alwayes in the extremes) to despise all humane Laws, when they are once misled in those which are Divine.</p>

            <p>To conclude, although you are pleased to beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, when you say, <hi>The chief Prejudices have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered; and these three important Interests being known aright, are found not to oppose, but to require this Latitude of Religion.</hi> How honestly and satisfactorily you have performed it, I leave to the judgment of the impartial Reader; and shall only further observe, that by your words (<hi>if all these Interests are rightly known</hi>) it seems you have in reserve another great Point (no less than the true interest of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and consequently the whole Government) to be better stated, and otherwise to be disputed, although already established by so many Laws, when you shall be seated in that power you gape for: but as I have (I hope) very justly called <hi>my Answer</hi> to you, <hi>Dolus an Virtus?</hi> so you will find, that you shall never have wit enough to catch us with Tricks, nor courage enough to convince us by the Sword, That your pragmatical Proposition is the <hi>Interest of</hi> England.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48679:19"/>
with all Fidelity and Obedience, considered of the several Matters comprised in Your Majesties late Gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> last, and Your most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speech at the beginning of this present Session,</p>
                           <p>Do, in the first place for our selves, and in the names of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> render to Your Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, the Tribute of our most hearty Thanks, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Grace and Goodness wherewith Your Majesty hath been pleased to publish Your Royal Intentions of adhering to Your Act of Indempnity and Oblivion, by a Constant and Religious Observance of it. And our hearts are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarged in these returns of Thanksgivings, when we consider Your Majesties most Princely and Heroick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of relying upon the Affections of Your People, and abhorring all sort of Military and Arbitrary Rule. But above all, We can never enough remember, to the Honour of Your Majesties Piety, and our unspeakable Comfort, those solemn and most endearing Invitations of us Your Majesties Subjects, to prepare Laws to be presented to Your Majesty, against the growth and encrease of Popery; and withall, to provide more Laws against Licentiousness and Impiety; at the same time Declaring Your own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions for maintaining the Act of Uniformity. And it becomes us alwayes to acknowledge and admire Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Wisdom in this Your Declaration, whereby Your Majesty is pleased to resolve, not only by Sumptuary Laws, but by Your own Royal Example of Frugality, to restrain that excess in mens Expences, which is grown so general and so exorbitant; and to direct our Endevours to find out fit and proper Laws for Advancement of Trade and Commerce.</p>
                           <p>After all this, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to believe, That it is with extreme unwillingness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48679:20"/>
of heart, that we are brought to differ from any thing which Your Majesty hath thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; And though we do no way doubt, but that the unreasonable Distempers of mens Spirits, and the many Mutinies and Conspiracies which were carryed on, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late Intervalls of Parliament, did reasonably incline Your Majesty to endevour by Your Declaration to give some allay to those ill humours, till the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Assembled; and the hopes of Indulgence, if the Parliament should consent to it, especially seeing the pretenders to this Indulgence, did seem to make some Titles to it, by virtue of Your Majesties Declaration from <hi>Breda.</hi> Nevertheless, we Your Majesties most Dutifull and Loyal Subjects, who are now returned to serve in Parliament, from those several parts and places of Your Kingdom, for which we are chosen, Do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer to Your Majesties great Wisdom, That it is in no sort advisable that there be any Indulgence to such persons who presume to dissent from the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the Religion established.</p>
                           <p>For these Reasons,</p>
                           <p>VVE have considered the nature of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> and are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of opinion, That Your Majesty ought not to be pressed with it any further,</p>
                           <p>Because it is not a Promise in it self, but only a Gracious Delaration of Your Majesties Intentions, to do what in You lay, and what a Parliament should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise Your Majesty to do; and no such Advice was ever given, or thought fit to be offered; nor could it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise understood, because there were Laws of Uniformity then in being, which could not be dispensed with, but by Act of Parliament.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48679:20"/>They who do pretend a right to that supposed promise, put the Right into the hands of their Representatives, whom they chose to serve for them in this Parliament, who have passed, and Your Majesty consented to the Act of Uniformity. If any shall presume to say, that a Right to the benefit of this Declaration doth still remain after this Act passed,</p>
                           <p>It tends to dissolve the very Bonds of Government, and to suppose a disability in Your Majesty and the Houses of Parliament, to make a Law contrary to any part of Your Majesties Declaration, though both Houses should advise Your Majesty to it.</p>
                           <p>We have also considered the nature of the Indulgence proposed, with reference to those Consequences, which must necessarily attend it.</p>
                           <p>It will establish Schism by a Law, and make the whole Government of the Church precarious, and the Censures of it of no Moment or Consideration at all.</p>
                           <p>It will no way become the Gravity or wisdom of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to pass a Law at one Session for Uniformity, and at the next Session (the reasons of Uniformity continuing still the same) to pass another Law to frustrate or weaken the execution of it.</p>
                           <p>It will expose Your Majesty to the restless Importunity of every Sect or Opinion, and of every single person also, who shall presume to dissent from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It will be a cause of increasing Sects and Sectaries, whose numbers will weaken the true Protestant Profession so far, that it will at least be difficult for it, to defend it self against them: And, which is yet further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, those Numbers, which by being troublesome to the Government, find they can arrive to an Indulgence, well,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48679:21"/>
as their numbers increase, be yet more troublesom, that so at length they may arrive to a general Tolleration, which Your Majesty hath declared against; and in time, some prevalent Sect, will at last contend for an establishment; which, for ought can be foreseen, may end in Popery.</p>
                           <p>It is a thing altogether without President, and will take away all means of convicting Recusants, and be inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the method and proceedings of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Lastly, It is humbly conceived, that the Indulgence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, will be so far from tending to the Peace of the Kingdom, that it is rather likely to occasion great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. And on the contrary, That the asserting of the Laws, and the Religion establisht, according to the Act of Uniformity, is the most probable means to produce a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Peace and Obedience throughout Your Kingdom: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the variety of Professions in Religion, when openly indulged, doth directly distinguish men into parties, and withall, gives them opportunity to count their numbers; which, considering the Animosities, that out of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pride will be kept on foot by the several Factions, doth tend directly and inevitably to open disturbance. Nor can Your Majesty have any Security, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Worship of the several Factions, which are all Governed by a several Rule, shall be consistent with the Peace of Your Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>And if any persons shall presume to disturb the Peace of the Kingdom, We do in all humility declare, That we will for ever, and in all Occasions, be ready with our utmost endevour and assistance, to adhere to, and serve Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty according to our bounden Duty and Allegiance.</p>
