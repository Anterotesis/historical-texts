            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My Lord, my Captaine and I haue had many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of much conference vpon very ſerious buſines, into which this Priſoner hath often intruded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and thereby hath

greatly hindred our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments.

            <p>Hee is called (my Lord) <hi>Profeſsion.</hi>

               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1842:87"/>
               <hi>Ancient,</hi> What can you ſay for the King againſt the Priſoner at the Barre?</p>
            <p>My Lord, when I bare <note place="margin">The <hi>Ancient</hi> his Witneſſe.</note> my colours of a <hi>Holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation,</hi> and diſplaid the ſame in <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Deed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the company, he hath attempted, and that not ſeldome to rend and teare them; and this not onely within our ſelues: but ſometime alſo before, and in the very ſight of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hath ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face my Colours, through his violent diſpoſition, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed nature, with the helpe of enraged paſſions, to my vtter diſgrace, and not to mine onely, but to the whole <hi>band</hi> of good qualities, gifts, and graces,

in the Towne of <hi>Soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So heady he is, and ſo peruerſly bent to his owne will, that hee neuer regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for the preſent, what may happen afterwards. Our two Sergeants can more at large diſcouer him, if it pleaſe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to heare them: Here they ſtand by me.</p>
            <p>What do you call them, ſaith the Iudge? My Lord, ſaith the <hi>Ancient,</hi> the one is Sergeant <hi>Vnity,</hi> and the other is Sergeant <hi>Order,</hi> worthy Souldiers (my Lord) and very ſeruiceable for good gouernment.</p>
            <p>Sergeant <hi>Vnity,</hi> come in, What can you ſay of this Priſoner?</p>
            <p>My Lord, when all the <note place="margin">Sergeant <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> wineſſe.</note>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:1842:88"/>
whole band louingly, as one man, were obedient in all things, hee vpon euery leaſt diſcontent did muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and endeuoured to ſet vs at ods one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He hath adhered to ſecret Conſpiracies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Corruptions; yea, and hath not beene only found to fauour, but alſo to ſtand for, and to grace our open enemies, euen Satans ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and the pompes and vanities of this wicked world; to whom hee hath beene ſo ſeruiceable, as if he had beene a preſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier for them, forgetting his faith and allegiance to his owne Soueraigne. If he be not (my Lord) ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he will at the length be

our vtter ouerthrow. My fellow, Sergeant <hi>Order,</hi> can ſay more.</p>
            <p>Sergeant <hi>Order,</hi> What is that you haue to witneſſe againſt the Priſoner?</p>
            <p>My Lord, whenſoeuer he <note place="margin">Sergeant <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> wineſſe.</note> commeth out of that lewd Harlots houſe, Miſtreſſe <hi>Hearts,</hi> and from among her young Strumpets, hee is ſo enraged, as hee beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelfe more like a ſauage beaſt than a man: All is by him put out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, our <hi>Captaine</hi> cannot rule him, eſpecially when hee hath gotten a peſtilent fellow, one <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company <note place="margin">Companie is to <hi>Wilfull-Will.</hi>
               </note> him, and another cogging deceitfull compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, called <hi>Shew of good,</hi> to hearten him in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1842:89"/>
courſes and bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendments. Of himſelfe he is ill enough, but theſe (my Lord) make him altogether vncapable of good counſel, or of the beſt aduice that our Captaine can giue him.</p>
            <p>Where are, ſaith the Iudge, theſe fellowes; why were they not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and brought in hither with him?</p>
            <p>My Lord, as ſoone as he was attached and brought vnder authority, they both preſently fled. Our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Reaſon</hi> made diligent ſearch after them, but could not finde them. For my Lord, theſe Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons durſt neuer appeare with him, but when they knew him to bee wholly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1842:90"/>
bent to his owne will, and when they were very ſure our Captaine had not ſtrength enough with him to withſtand them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would keepe cloſe, and not apparantly be ſeene to countenance him. If order might bee taken for apprehending of theſe, there would be ſome hope of better gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this priſoner, if he hap to be releaſed.</p>
            <p>Vpon this the Iudge gaue order to Maſter <hi>Sheriffe,</hi> to his <hi>Vnder-Sheriffe,</hi> and to all the Iuſtices of the Bench for the ſpeedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of theſe two lewd and rebellious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Then the Cryer was commanded to call in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1842:90"/>
one witneſſe more, which was one of the Corporals of the Band, whoſe name was <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> who being there attending preſently appeared.</p>
            <p>The Corporall being at the Barre, it was demanded of him what he could ſay, more than had beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</p>

            <p>Our <hi>Powder</hi> of holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections hee hath damped, the <hi>Match</hi> of feruency of ſpirit hee hath put out: the <hi>Small-ſhot</hi> of ſpirituall eiaculations he ſo ſtopped, as in time of need they would not goe off; of the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Spirit, the Word of God, hee quite tooke away the edge: hee brake the <hi>Helmet</hi> of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bruſed the <hi>Breſt-plate</hi> of righteouſneſſe: the

And not ſeldome hath hee fallen vpon the <hi>Sentinels,</hi> quicke appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and put out their eyes, ſo as they could not, if the Enemies had approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, haue diſcerned them.</p>

My Lord, by his wilfull vnrulineſſe, and by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Maſterfulneſſe, hee hath often indangered the whole <hi>Iland of man,</hi> the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part called <hi>Corps,</hi> and the higher called <hi>Soule;</hi> and in a manner deliuered them into the Enemies hand. For the common Souldiers, the powers and faculties of both are too often ſwayed by him to follow him in his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Lord, if he be not ſuppreſſed and brought in obedience to our worthy Captaine, he will ſurely at the length yeeld this his Maieſties right into the hands of forraigne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which daily watch to

               </note> reaſon to curſe the day that euer I knew him, and hee onely it is that hath brought mee to this poore ſtate.</p>
            <p>I was a man of ſome <note place="margin">The couetous are vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ſeeking their owne gaine.</note> credit, my neighbours well know, till I had to do with him, who would lend mee nothing but vpon Vſurie, and that vpon great bonds and morgage of lands: and ſo greedy a Wolfe was he vpon his prey, that if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but one day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee would take the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1842:108"/>
benefit of the Morgage, or forfeiture; or if he forbore longer, I payed him by preſents and gifts ſo much with the vſe, as made me to groane vnder the burthen, feeling my ſelfe in an irrecouerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Sometimes to keepe day with him, I was enforced either to buy for time, or elſe to ſell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of hand to make readie monies: either of which was as bad, or worſe than the biting of vſurie, for when <hi>William Greedy</hi> a brother of his, or alſo <hi>Gain</hi> his Couſin perceiued my need, oh how did hee in ſelling for time extort from mee; and in buying for readie money preſſe

me? So that to eſcape a whirle-poole, I fell into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring gulfes, and thus he vndid me.</p>
            <p>And not being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content (woe vnto him,) when I became Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (my Lord) who was before a good <hi>Free-holder,</hi> he put into our <hi>Land-lords</hi>

into their hands, and to driue out ſuch as had been mercifull releeuers of their poore neighbours.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1842:110"/>
and to make vs poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hatefull to God and man. For hee careth not, (my Lord) ſo as he may not be charged any way, what we doe, or what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth of vs.</p>
            <p>And yet to make vp the height of vnmercifulneſſe, hee will be the firſt, if wee of meere extreme need doe amiſſe, that will cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs and purſue vs to death.

            <p>Thus (my Lord) was I moued and drawne on to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1842:112"/>
lend him, according to the Statute, onely I took good Security, becauſe I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to bee waſtfull. Aduantage I neuer tooke, but onely when I ſaw that he was an idle fellow and careleſſe, and would neuer keepe day, then I would onely threaten him to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him, (my Lord) and if hee then brought any kindneſſe to my wife, it is more than I know of, and more than I deſire of him.</p>
            <p>Sometimes hee would offer to ſell mee the land <note place="margin">In buying.</note> morgaged to mee, when he could not pay, and told me that of neceſſitie hee muſt ſell it, and if I would not, another ſhould buy it. Then I thought my

            <p>For my threatning of <note place="margin">In not giuing.</note> him and his Companie, when they went a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; true it is, becauſe I ſay, that as they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed themſelues, they thought to relie on mee, and ſo in like ſort to haue eaten me vp too: for idely had they liued, and worke they neither could nor would. And whereas they accuſe me that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to ſteale, herein they very much wrong me (my Lord) for it was their <hi>Loue to liue ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and their <hi>Pinching neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,</hi> which led and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them to fall to ſhifting and ſtealing,

            <p>It is very true which

            <p>This Sonne they ſoe cockered, and made ſo much off, as they ſuffered him to ſet his loue vpon one <hi>Coueting,</hi> a very har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and withall the baſe daughter of <hi>Deſire,</hi> vpon which filthy <hi>harlotry</hi> hee begat this fellow <hi>Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> the priſoner now at the barre: who when hee was but a very babe, ſo continually lay ſucking at his mother <hi>Couetings</hi> breaſts, as ſhe had not milke inough for him, and therefore with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Gaines</hi> conſent, ſhe put him to be nurſed, and nouriſhed vp of one <hi>Grec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> the wife of <hi>Money-loue;</hi> Now ſo it fell out, that

            <p>Then the Iudge asked him, if he knew the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>

            <p>My Lord, though I know him to be blinded with <hi>Selfeloue,</hi> and with an ouer good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of himſelfe, as rich men commoly be, ſo ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> as alſo that hee is <note place="margin">Pro. 28. 11.</note> flattered by ſuch, as hee himſelfe hath named to your Lordſhip, that hee will neuer beleeue what I ſhall ſay; yet will I deliuer vndoubted tokens to the Iury for them to know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, that he is the very man, according to his name; a right Mamoniſt. <note place="margin">Signes of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netous perſon.</note> For, my Lord he cannot deny that he was euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his eſtate, Heb. 13. 5. but through the loue
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1842:130"/>
of money, which he coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after, he hath laboured and made haſte to be rich. 1. Tim. 6. 9. Pro. 23. 4. Pro. 28. 20. and neuer would be ſatisfied, Eccle. 5. 6. 10. nor haue inough, Eſay 56. 11. For as riches en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſo he ſet his heart vpon them, Pſal. 62. 10. His cheifeſt ioy was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his wealth was great, and becauſe his hand had gotten much, Iob. 31. 25. he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſiluer, rather then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and gold rather then knowledge; Pro. 8. 10. His truſt was in his riches, Pro. 11. 28. Ier. 48. 7. His wealth was his ſtrong City, Pro. 10. 15. and as a high wall in his conceit,

Pro. 18. 11 Greedy hath he beene of gaine, and through his greedineſſe, hath he troubled his owne houſe, Pro. 15. 27. by chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, chaſing, turmoiling, pinching fare, and ſuch like meanes; He hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his eſtate by vniuſt gaine and oppreſſion, Pro. 28. 8. and 22. 16.

In his aboundance he hath not had power giuen him to liue plentifully, Eccleſ. 6. 2. but hath ſpared more then needeth, Pro. 11. 24.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1842:131"/>
Ier. 22. 13. For he alwayes onely looked to his owne wayes, and to his owne gaine, Eſay 56. 11.

Ier. 22. 13, Hee hath made vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt gaine, Ezech. 22. 13. 24. And gotten greedily by extortion. Ezech. 22. 12. His eyes and his heart were only for Couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Ier. 22. 17. Beſides all theſe (my Lord) hee hath ſuffered the cares of this world, and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of riches to choake the Word of God, that it hath beene without fruit
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1842:131"/>
in him. Mat 13. 22. Hee neuer deuiſed liberall things, Eſay. 32. 8. nor to deſpiſe the gaine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, Eſay 32. 8. Any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition tending to coſt was euer diſpleaſing to him, and like the young man in the Goſpel, would <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> he go away heauily: as one grieued to part with his goods. As an <hi>Ahab</hi> he neuer could ſee a <hi>Nabothes</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard lying commodiouſly for him, but he eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaped after it. If he gaue to the poore, and to good vſes, it was of neceſſitie not freely, 2.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1842:132"/>
tooke him to bee, Pro. 13. 7.</p>
            <p>And whereas this man ſaith, that hee hath euer <note place="margin">When doth a man bare Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</note> hated Couetouſneſſe, (as indeed hee ought to haue done,) Pro. 28. 16.

1 To diſcouer to vs our miſerable and wretched <note place="margin">1 <hi>To know our ſelues by nature.</hi>
               </note> eſtate through corruption of nature. For the laying open hereof, there is a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcription of ſin, with the power, nature, fruites, and effects thereof; how it firſt came, how intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bred, and brought vp, by whom, and where, with the ſeuerall kinds of ſinne, and the differing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinfull men, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vertuous courſes, and vnder what colour they ſo do, to their owne ruine at the length.</p>
            <p n="2">2 To ſhew how a man <note place="margin">2 <hi>How to bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
               </note> may come to a holy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſo happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himſelfe out of his naturall wretched eſtate.
<pb facs="tcp:1842:164"/>
To worke this, here is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered how a man is to ſearch out ſinne, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie graces are required thereto, with the helpes how to diſcouer ſinne, and to know ſinnes to bee ſins; what commonly bee the lets and hinderances in the diſcouery and ſearch of our ſinnes; what to do, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſound out our ſinnes, and how to become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thereby, and how to ſit downe to iudge of our ſelues without all partialli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Moreouer here is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, what gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are requiſite to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. Laſtly, how we may know ſinne to be ſubdued, and in whom it is truly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1842:164"/>
Theſe things being the true ſcope and right vſe of this Book, and the matters therein contained ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull and neceſſary to euery true Chriſtian, I hope no ſober minded man can, much leſſe will find fault with it.</p>
            <p>If the manner laying <note place="margin">The manner is allegoricall.</note> thoſe things downe in a continued allegorie, bee the offence to ſome, I doe ſuppoſe they know, that <hi>Nathan</hi> did teach a <hi>Dauid</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. Ca. 5.</note> by an allegorie: <hi>Eſay</hi> and <note place="margin">Ezech. 17. 2. &amp; 19.</note> 
               <hi>Ezechiel</hi> taught the Iewes ſo too, and that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpake many parables to his hearers.</p>
            <p>If any thinke it had bin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">Obiection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> for a yonger wit, then for one growne old and
<pb facs="tcp:1842:165"/>
gray headed; ſurely <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Eſat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezechiel</hi> were not yong; neither did thoſe formes of ſpeaking dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any thing from their holy aged grauities. And it may be thus to allegorize vpon ſuch a ſubiect matter from all theſe paſſages, in politicke gouernment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then ſome perhaps, conceit, though the thing done to their hand may ſeeme now moſt eaſie.</p>
            <p>But the fault, if a fault, peraduenture, is nor ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply imputed for making an allegorie: but in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſo largely, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting (as it were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude wiſe) ſome things, for the weightineſſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:1842:165"/>
matter therein conteined, not ſeeming graue inough as the parables of Chriſt, &amp; his Prophets were. For ſinne and ſinfull courſes of men ſhould be ſo deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as the Readers might rather be moued to lante<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then occaſioned to laugh.</p>
            <p>Firſt for the largeneſſe, it is no more then the ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the intended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe required, as the ſcope before mentioned may ſufficiently witneſſe. The parables of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ca 15. &amp; 16. Ca. 17. &amp; 19.</note> were large, and they were proſecuted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of thoſe things from whence they were taken, to lay open fully thereby what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb facs="tcp:1842:166"/>
and this is but ſo, and no more.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe the matter of this allegoricall diſcourſe to be ſuch (as may appeare by the manifold leſſons before layed down, being the ſummarie Contents of the booke) as ought to worke in euery Chriſtian Reader ſorrow of heart in the deep conſideration of his miſeries, till he be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of his wretched eſtate: and withall to cauſe a diligent endeuour in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſadnes to better his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of liuing Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like before God; neither of which is preuented by the manner of handling, if all would doe, as ſome haue done, firſt to reade it after
<pb facs="tcp:1842:166"/>
the letter, and then attend piouſly to the ſpirituall ſence, they would attaine to that, which in ſo pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning it, I aymed at. I knew the natures of men in the world; I perſuaded my ſelf that the allegorie would draw many to read, which might be as a bate to catch them, perhaps, at vnawares and to mooue them to fall into a meditation at the length of the ſpirituall vſe thereof: which I well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that others more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly bent, would at the firſt diſcerne and make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of.</p>
            <p>If two or three paſſages carrie not that grauitie in ſhew, as ſome, perhaps, could wiſh they did; Let
<pb facs="tcp:1842:167"/>
theſe conſider therin thoſe places the enforced nature of the allegory. Then how that elſe wherin all the reſt of the book the cariage of the matter is very far from the nature of ſo odious &amp; ſo baſe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, if it be in the hand of a piouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected &amp; wel minded Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Laſtly, that euen thoſe few paſſages are ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes; &amp; are no more an occaſion to guilty parties, with the conceits thereof to make themſelues mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then that great Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> his mocking (in a matter none more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) was to the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> when yet, perhaps, ſome ſtands by of the wiſer ſort, abhorring <hi>Baal,</hi> might
<pb facs="tcp:1842:167"/>
ſmile ſecretly thereat.</p>
            <p>There is a kinde of ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ioyfull laughter, for any thing I know, which may ſtand with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber grauitie, and with the beſt mans pietie, iuſtly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned from the right apprehenſion of things, elſe had not <hi>Abraham</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into it, nor holy <hi>Iob,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 17. Ca. 29. 24. Pſal. 52. 6.</note> nor the righteous in ſeeing (which is ſtrange) matter of feare. Well, I haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed this booke as it is: It may be ſome humor took me, as once it did old <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who apparelled <hi>Ioſeph</hi> differently from all the reſt of his brethren in a partie coloured coat. It may alſo bee that I tooke (as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in his <hi>Ioſeph)</hi> more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb facs="tcp:1842:168"/>
in this Lad, then in twentie other of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren borne before him, or in a younger <hi>Beniamin</hi> brought forth ſoone after him.</p>
            <p>When I thus did appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell him, I intended to ſend him forth to his brethren, hoping hereby to procure him the more acceptance, where hee happily ſhould come: and my expectation hath not failed; deceiued altogether I am not, as was <hi>Iacob</hi> in ſending his <hi>Ioſeph</hi> among his enuious bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. For not onely hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, but ſome thouſands haue welcomed him to their houſes. They ſay they like his countenance, his habit and manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:1842:168"/>
well enough, though other too nice bee not ſo well pleaſed therewith.</p>
            <p>But who can pleaſe all? or how can any one ſo write or ſpeake, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent euery man? If any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, and abuſe him in their too carnal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without the truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſpirituall vſe, let them blame themſelues, &amp; neither me nor him: for the fault is their owne, which I wiſh them to amend?</p>
            <p>You that like him, I pray you ſtil accept of him for whoſe ſake, to further your ſpiritual meditation, I haue ſent him out with theſe <hi>Contents,</hi> and more marginall notes.</p>
            <p>His habite is no whit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb facs="tcp:1842:169"/>
which he is conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by mee to weare, not onely on working dayes, but euen vpon holy daies and Sondayes too, if he go abroad. A fitter garment I haue not now for him: and if I ſhould ſend out the poore Lad naked; I know it would not pleaſe you.</p>
            <p>This his coate, though not altered in the faſhion, yet is it made ſomewhat longer. For though from his firſt birth into the world it bee ſcarce halfe a yeare, yet he is growne a little bigger; but I thinke him to become to his full ſtature: ſo he wil be, but as a litle pigmie to be carried abroad in any mans poket.</p>
            <p>I pray you now this
<pb facs="tcp:1842:169"/>
fourth time accept him, &amp; vſe him, as I haue intended him for you, and you ſhal reape the fruite, though I forbid you not to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly merry with him. So fare you well in all friend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wellwiſhes.</p>
