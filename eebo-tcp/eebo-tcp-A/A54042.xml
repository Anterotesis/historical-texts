            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Many deep CONSIDERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS have been upon my heart concerning the STATE of ISRAEL, both paſt, preſent and to come, ſome of which I find drawings to communicate; together with ſome QUESTIONS and ANSWERS concerning UNITY.</head>
            <p>The <hi>Conſiderations</hi> concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are theſe which follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THe pretious living State, which my ſoul remembreth to have been, about the beginning of the late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this Nation, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was bent to ſeek after the Lord, and applied their hearts to wait upon him in faſtings and earneſt ſupplications, wherein my heart hath often had the teſtimony, that they were accepted of him, and had many times the ſeal of his preſence and power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: yea my heart did truly unite with and enjoy the Lord in what was then given forth, and I can never be drawn to deny the truth and worth of that diſpenſation, though I know it was ſwallowed up by a greater deſolation, ſoon following after, and ſince by the breaking forth of a more lively diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The over-running of that ſtate by the ſubtilty of the enemy, drawing the minds of the ſimple and upright-hearted from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42257:2"/>
living feeling, and from the inward power of Religion, into Diſputations and Contentions about Forms of Worſhip and Church-government, which drew out the reaſoning part, and withdrew the ſpirit of the mind from feeding on its proper nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; and ſo Life decayed in the Spirit, while Wiſdom and Knowledge and Subtilty encreaſed in the Underſtanding. And ſo the upright-hearted miſſing of Life, where before they had found it, were ſcattered up and down to ſeek after it: and thoſe, who abode where they were, grew dry, barren and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, loſing the ſavour, ſweetneſs, meekneſs, love, and indeed whatever was living and pretious, and remained fixing their minds on that, which the Lord had departed from. Oh the darkneſs and miſery of this ſtate! O the pain of the hearts where Life was ſtirring, for want of the living God! O the death and formality of thoſe, that were dead and formal! Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had not the Lord pittied his People in this ſtate, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them in his Life and Power (which this great deſolation made way for) it had been determined concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever: for Death had over-grown the generality, and Life was even gaſping and expiring in the ſingle-hearted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The pretious breaking forth of the Lord (at this diſmal time, in this hour of diſtreſs and deſperate condition of <hi>Iſrael)</hi> in ſome hidden Veſſels, whom he had kept waiting upon him, and whom he had preſerved freſh in the ſenſe of him: to whom his appearance was very glorious, to whom he opened the ſtate of the Earth and the ſtate of his People, giving them the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel</hi> to preach to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them that his Spirit and Power ſhould go along with them, bidding them go forth to till and dreſs the Earth, and to gather his People into his Fold. And who can utter what the glory of this Light was, in its ſhining and breaking forth in their hearts! how welcome to their weary ſouls, how pleaſant to the eye of their ſpirits, how demonſtrative and ſatisfactory to their hearts! O the joy of that day (ſurely it can never be forgotten by them) wherein they ſenſibly felt the pouring down of the Spirit of Life upon them, and their hearts gathered into the boſom of Eternal Reſt, and their ſouls and bodies ſanctified and ſet apart for the Lord and his Service.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42257:2"/>
4. The contemptible means God put into their hands, to work his work by; which was not by preaching any new thing, but by directing to a <hi>Principle,</hi> which God had already <hi>hid in the earth</hi> of every man's heart, and which was to be known by its divine Nature and Light, turning againſt and repoving ſin, teſtifying that this was the way the Lord of Heaven and Earth had choſen, to bring his Sons and Daughters into the Power and Glory of his Life. O what heart can receive this, what eye can ſee any beauty in this, but that which the Lord toucheth and openeth! I teſtifie (in the ſence of Life) that the wiſdom of man, yea the wiſdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> corrupted, cannot but deſpiſe and turn from this. Is not this the loweſt of all diſpenſations? Is not this common to all mankind? Doth not this fall ſhort (in its ſelf as I may ſay, and as it hath formerly been diſpenſed) of the diſpenſation of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> much more of the diſpenſation by Chriſt and his Apoſtles? Who would have looked for the Lord here! And yet this hath the Lord cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to gather his People by, and to appear to the world in, and hath gathered the Life, Vertue and Subſtance of all former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations into it, as thoſe who are gathered thereby and have waited upon him therein, and felt the Nature and Power of his Life (and ſeen things paſt, preſent and to come) are living Witneſſes of, againſt all the gain-ſayings, thoughts and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The contemptibleneſs of the Veſſels, which the Lord choſe to fill with this Treaſure, and to let forth this diſpenſation of his Life through. They were for the moſt part mean, as to the outward, young country lads, of no dèep underſtanding or ready expreſſion, but very fit to be deſpiſed every where by the wiſdom of man, and onely to be owned in the Power of that Life, wherein they came forth. How ridiculous was their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of coming forth and appearance, to the eye of man! about what poor, trivial circumſtances, habits, geſtures and things did they ſeem to lay great weight, and make great matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! How far did they ſeem from being acquainted with the Myſteries and Depths of Religion! But their chief preaching was <hi>Repentance, and about a Light within, and of turning to that, and proclaiming the great and terrible Day of the Lord to be at hand:</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42257:3"/>
wherein I confeſs my heart exceedingly deſpiſed them, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder that any wiſe man, or ſort of Profeſſors did, or do yet deſpiſe them. Yea they themſelves were very ſenſible of their own weakneſs, and unfitneſs for that great work and ſervice wherewith the Lord had honoured them, and of their inability to reaſon with man; and ſo (in the fear and in the watch of their ſpirits) kept cloſe to their tetſimony, and to the movings of his power, not mattering to anſwer or ſatisfy the reaſoning part of man, but ſingly minding the reaching to and raiſing of that, to which their Teſtimony was.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The bleſſing that God gave to this his diſpenſation of Life in their hands. O how did the Lord proſper them in gathering his ſcattered wandering ſheep into his fold of Reſt! How did their words drop down like dew, and refreſh the hungry thirſty ſouls! How did they reach to the Life in thoſe to whom they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, raiſing up that which lay dead in the grave, to give a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving teſtimony to the living voice of God in them! How did they batter the wiſdom and reaſonings of man, making the lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof ſtoop and bow to the weak and fooliſh babe of the begettings of Life! Eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what the power of Life hath wrought through them in the hearts and conſciences of thoſe, who have longed after and waited for the Lord. O the breathings and meltings of ſoul, the ſence of the living preſence of God, the ſubjecting of the heart unto the Lord, the awakening of and giving ſtrength unto his Witneſs, the falling down and weakning of the powers of darkneſs, the clear ſhining of the Light of Life in the heart, and the ſweet running of the pure ſtreams thereof into the enlivened ſouls, which hath often been known and ſealed to from the powerful appearance of God in their miniſtry! Indeed when I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered theſe and ſuch like things in my heart, and narrowly marked them in my converſe with them, I have been often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to cry out concerning them, <hi>Truly here is man very weak and contemptible, but God very glorious and powerful.</hi> And indeed, when at any time I looked on the man, I was hardly able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear diſdaining them: but on the other hand, when the eye of my ſpirit beheld the power and glory of the Lord in them, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42257:3"/>
could hardly forbear over-eſteeming and exalting them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The glory which the Lord advanced theſe Veſſels to, ſince his beginning to make uſe of them. How hath he enriched them with gifts and abilities, and every way fitted them for the ſervice and employment, he hath had for them! How hath he enlarged their miniſtry, that they who had very little to ſay, either by way of declaration or diſputation at firſt, now abound with ſtrength, and abundantly ſurpaſs the knowledge and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom both of the World, and of other Profeſſors of Religion! The Lord indeed hath adorned them, putting his beauty upon them, and cauſing them to grow up in his ſtrength, and in his wiſdom. This mine eye hath ſeen and often took notice of, bleſſing the Name of the Lord, and praying to him for their preſervation. And ſurely whoever he be, that hath either known himſelf or heard the relation of the poverty of theſe young ſtriplings, when they firſt came forth in the Power of the Lord, how empty in themſelves they then were, how ſenſible they went up and down of their own weakneſs, how little they had to ſay to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that came to obſerve them and enquire of them, how afraid they were to be drawn from their watch, at what a diſtance they ſtood from entring into reaſoning about things, I ſay, he that did know and doth conſider this, and ſhall alſo behold how the Lord hath advanced them ſince, making them mighty and honourable with his gifts and abilities (with the beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the very man flouriſheth, to the ſight of every eye that is in any meaſure truly open) cannot but acknowledge the change to be wonderful.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I have had the ſence and conſideration of this alſo in my heart, That their danger is now greater, then when they were poorer, weaker, and not ſo enriched and gifted by the Lord. The enemy is very ſubtil and watchful, and there is danger to <hi>Iſrael</hi> all along, both in the poverty and in the riches; but the greater danger is in the riches: becauſe then man is apt to forget God, and to loſe ſomewhat of the ſence of his dependance (which keeps the ſoul low and ſafe in the Life) and alſo to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſomewhat of exaltation to creep upon him, which preſently in a degree corrupts and betrays him. <hi>The heart that is in any meaſure lifted up in its ſelf; ſo far it is not upright to the Lord.</hi> Let
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42257:4"/>
every one feel this, waiting to be preſerved, and praying for thoſe who are moſt beautified, and advanced by gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the Life, becauſe in this reſpect (and at this time) their danger is greateſt. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> is poor, low, weak, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, ſeeing no lovelineſs nor worthineſs in himſelf, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the meer mercy, and tender bowels of the Lord in the free Covenant of his love <hi>&amp;c,</hi> then is <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſafe. But when he hath a being given him in the Life, and is richly adorned with the ornaments of Life, and come to have the power it ſelf in his hand to make uſe of; then is he in more danger of becoming ſomewhat of himſelf, and of forgetting him that formed him (being apt to make uſe of his gifts without ſuch an immediate ſence of the giver, as he had in his trembling and weak eſtate) and ſo of departing out of that humble, tender, abaſed, contrite ſtate and temper of ſpirit, wherein he was ſtill preſerved.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This alſo hath been manifeſt to me, and deeply impreſſed on my ſpirit all along, That the Lord may, if he ſee good, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome great and eminent ones to fall in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf, and the Lord may let out temptation upon him, and ſuffer it to enter, that he may bring him to the ſence and feeling of his weakneſs again. Yea, thoſe who have felt the power of the Lord in and through an inſtrument, may give more to the inſtrument than belongs unto it, and ſo put the Lord upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the honour due to him, which is miſplaced and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that, which is but his inſtrument. This is the Lord's day (the Light thereof is his, the Life his, the Power his) and the glory thereof will he not give to another. If therefore any man, in this day, ſhall take to himſelf what belongs to the Lord, or any other ſhall give it him, the Lord will not ſo loſe it, but will find out a way to recover his own: And happy is the man, who lieth continually perfectly-abaſed before the Lord, aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of the Lord's to himſelf, nor attributing any thing of the Lords to another, that the Lord alone may be exalted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where. And let all gifts ſerve the Seed, and its riſing over all gifts be waited for, that the Life every where may have its due, being lifted up over all.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I have had a deep ſence of this alſo, That if the Lord ſhould ſuffer ſuch a thing to fall out among us, it may cauſe a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42257:4"/>
great ſhaking and ſhattering in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Surely I may ſay, it would come very unexpectedly and unſuſpectedly to many; and ſo ſuch perſons would be ſurprized with it, and not at all prepared for it. Alas, who could ſuſpect (feeling perſons ſo eminent in the power, and ſo exerciſed and skilful in the way and paths of righteouſneſs, and ſo able to inſtruct others therein) that they could poſſibly fall in any degree, from the Truth and Power of Life! And yet they are not free from temptation: and if they be confident of their own ſtrength, and forget the tender hand of the Lord, he may ſuffer a temptation to enter them, which preſently begets a ground for evil weeds to ſpring up in, and for blindneſs, and hardneſs, and error from the pure Power to creep in at.</p>
            <p>O dear Friends, who know the pretiouſneſs of Life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the preſervation of the Lord in your ſeveral conditions, Let us fear the Lord and his goodneſs to us, remembring what a low ebb we were at, when the Lord viſited us, and how freely he viſited, and how freely he daily preſerveth, that we may not be hardened or lifted up againſt the World, or againſt any ſort of Profeſſors, but may magnifie the grace which hath made and keepeth up the difference between us and them, praying to the Lord for them, and watching for the hour of his mercy to them, exerciſing all manner of ſweetneſs and meekneſs and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering towards them in the mean time, alſo pittying and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all the tempted ones among our ſelves, as ſuch who are ſenſible that we alſo may be tempted, and that underſtand the ground why we fall not by the temptation.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay more? There are three <hi>Queries</hi> appearing in my view, in relation to this thing, which the hearts of ſome may deſire ſatisfaction about, to which I find ſomewhat in way of anſwer ſpringing up in me.</p>

                  <p>Keeping to the meaſure of Life in the particular, and not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing others, by an apprehenſion concerning them, but onely knowing and honouring them as they are felt and diſcerned in the Life, this will preſerve every particular (that is thus order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) from being tainted with any of their ſnares or deviations. O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> O little Babes, <hi>Know no man after the fleſh, but the Lord alone in his living Spirit.</hi> For man is but a veſſel, wherein the Life may appear or diſappear at pleaſure; and the Lord is not engaged to make uſe of man in his ſervice, further then he ſeeth good. The Lord may appear where he hath never appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and he may not appear where he hath hitherto appeared very frequently and powerfully. O know the Life in thine own heart, that is to be the Judge in thee concerning the appearances of Life in others. If that judge not, be ſtill and ſilent in thy

Let man have no more than his due, while the Lord pleaſeth to make uſe of him; and to ſuch there will accrue no great ſhaking or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, when the Lord layeth aſide any of his own inſtruments.

                  <p>Indeed this is a very difficult thing: not becauſe the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Power of the Lord is at a loſs to or concerning man in this ſtate, but becauſe this condition ſets a man's ſpirit at ſo great a diſtance from the uſe of that remedy, which the Lord hath appointed for man's recovery. It is very hard to bring ſuch an one to the ſence of his loſs (whereby the depth of his fall might be prevented) until he be gone very far: and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goes in his declining from the Life, the harder will his recovory be. Again, It is hard for ſuch an one to become ſo poor, and lye ſo low and ſo long at the foot of God's grace, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be contented to be ſo laid aſide and not made uſe of, as the Spirit of the Lord may judge neceſſary for him, to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect abaſement of ſpirit, and to work that perfectly out of him, whereby the enemy now entred to betray him: yea the judgement of the Lord (the righteous and ſevere judgement of the Lord) is hard to be born in this ſtate; and it is much, if ſuch a Veſſel do not break here, in its new forming on the wheel. Yet that which boweth before the Lord, being willing to be ſmitten and abaſed by him, and to lye under his correction and judgement his ſeaſon, even until he ſay it is enough, the Lord will without doubt reſtore into his favour, if not alſo into the honour of his ſervice again.</p>

                  <p>O tender heart, the enemy may make uſe of this to trouble and afflict thee, but it was not ſo intended by the Lord, who is very full of unutterable bowels, and who hath a day of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els for thy ſtate: yea his day, which hath already dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ſo dawning, as to reach thee.
