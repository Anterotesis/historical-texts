            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Coſen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOW accept of my hearty Thanks for all your Services and loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and God Allmighty reward you: I am now preparing my ſelf for another World, and do heartily forgive all my Enemies. There was Four of my Witneſſes that did not appear; one Mr. <hi>White</hi> and his Wife, Mrs. <hi>Fairelace</hi> and the Maid, where I was that Night. Let not God lay my Blood to their Charge: and God forgive all thoſe that ſwore falcely againſt me. And whether before my Execution, or after, God is pleaſed to do it (but I am ſure he will Reveal it) and when it is brought to light, the World then will know my Wrongs. In the mean time I reſigne my Soul and Body to him, who is a juſt God, and by this means will bring me to himſelf. This Affliction is a great one, and more than human Nature can bear; but I truſt in him, that he will not lay more on me, than he will give me the Grace of his holy Spirit to undergo. And indeed I look upon it as a Fatherly Chaſtiſement, <hi>for whom he loves he doth chaſtiſe</hi>:For if I had my Deſerts, he might have taken me off in the midſt of all my Sins, and have rewarded me with the Puniſhment of the everlaſting Priſon (<hi>Hell</hi>) prepared for all impenitent Sinners: But I hope he will give me the Grace of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to repent my ſelf of all my Sins; which I have, and do, and ſhall, with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lowly, and obedient Heart, and not in the leaſt cloke, or diſſemble them before my heavenly Father, who gave up his only begoten Son to dy for Sinners (and me the greateſt.) And I hope he will give me the Grace to follow his Example, who was falſly Accuſed, Condemned, and ſuffered a ſhameful Death upon the Croſs; I being now falſly to ſuffer a ſhamful Death: At which time I ſincerely and heartily beg of him to ſupport me, which I truſt in God he will: Humbly beging Pardon, and confeſſing the Sins I have been guilty of. Now I have Two Things to beg of you, for Chriſt his ſake: The Firſt is, That you will take it from me a dying Man, without the leaſt Hopes of Pardon here, from any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Man, <hi>That I am Innocent, Clear, and Free, In Thought, Word, and Deed,</hi> of this bloody, barbarous, unheard of, and inhuman Murther, for which I do ſuffer, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing, and certainly believing no Salvation can be had from the Almighty God, the Searcher of Hearts, That at the Houre of Death dies with a Ly in his Mouth. Therefore I deſire your Prayers (for me being Innocent) and all other good Chriſtians Prayers, That God Almighty will be pleaſed to bring to light this bloody Deed, not when we would have him, but at his one appointed time (not our Will, but his own be done.) The other is, That you would be pleaſed to ſpeak to your Miniſter, or any other Divine you know, to viſit me, and get him to come as ſoon as you can; and let me ſee you, for I have deſired that no body may come at me, but your ſelf, and Cozen <hi>William,</hi> and ſome Divines; being I will not now diſcourſe any Perſons relating to worldly Affairs, but what may tend for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my poor Soul: So recommending you to god, I reſt</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>The moſt wronged Man, the moſt unhappy Man, as to this World; yet one of the moſt happy Men through Chriſt my Saviour, in whom I truſt for my eternal Salvation. 
HENRY HARRISON.</signed>
