            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

moneths, ten dayes after the Deluge; and <hi>3513.</hi> yeeres, ſixe moneths, ten dayes after the Creation of <hi>Adam.</hi> Thus, and then, was this Citie of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> taken, and for ſeuentie yeeres, remayned the Iewes in this Captiuitie: And this, in briefe, is the generall occaſion why, and the time when theſe Lamentations were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Reader, I tender to thy conſideration, two things; First, the Pen-man: ſecondly, the Art and Methode of this <hi>Threnodia.</hi> As for the firſt, It was penn'd by <hi>Ieremie</hi> the Prophet, the ſonne of <hi>Hilkiah</hi> a Prieſt; and vndoubtedly endighted by the Spirit of God; ſome thinke it was written, when the Prophe: was in priſon; others, when hee was with <hi>Godoliah</hi> at <hi>Maſpath:</hi> but whither at the one place or at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is not much materiall to diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as touching the Art and Methode, it is ſhort and conciſe, as being most naturall to ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a ſubject: <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayes, <hi>Lamentationes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent eſſe conciſae, &amp; breues, quia cito lachryma exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſcit, &amp; difficile eſt, auditores autlectores, in illo affectu ſummae commiſerationis, diu tenere.</hi> The Methode is truly elegious, not bound to any ordinarie ſet forme, but wildly depending vpon the ſudden ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that new griefes preſent; and indeed the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ſorrowes can not be, but diſtracted from all rules of methode, the neglect of which, is veniall in ſuch ejulations as theſe, as which, in all the Scriptures, there is none ſo copious, none ſo ardent, concerning which <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene</hi> confeſſes, <hi>Threnos Ieremiae nunquam à ſe ſiccis oculis lectos eſſe.</hi> Yet ſome think there is a methode kept, but too fine and intricate, for our groſſe apprehenſions; touching this point, Saint


<pb facs="tcp:2495:5"/>
Ambroſe <hi>lib. 8. Epiſt. ad Iuſt.</hi> ſayes, <hi>Demus, cas ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum artem non ſcripſiſſe, at certè ſecundum gratiam ſcripſiſſe fatendum eſt, quae omn em artem longe ſupera<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and with this I reſt.</p>
            <p>You ſhall obſerue, that the foure first Chapters of theſe Lamentations carry a ſtrict order, in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, for euery Verſe throughout euery Chapter begins with a ſeuerall letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, except the third Chapter, wherein the firſt and euery third Verſe onely is tyed to a Letter, and continues the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet through, which forme the Prophet vſed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Eloquence, partly for Memorie ſake, meaning either literally thus, that it ought to be perfect as the Alphabet, in Memorie, or Hieroglyphically thus, that as the Alphabet is the Radix of all wordes, ſo the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Iewes, were the combination of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
            <p>For the ſame Cauſes, I likewiſe here in my Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, haue obſerued the ſame forme, and continue the Alphabet, in Engliſh, as the Prophet did in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, deſirous to be his ſhaddow, as much as I can.</p>
            <p>It appeares by the ſtrictneſſe of the order, that theſe Lamentations were Originally writ in Verſe, and as ſome thinke, in Sapphicks, but many of our learned Neotericks denie, that any writings of the Iewes carry, now, any direct, or certaine Lawes of Poeſie, though (they confeſſe) ſome ruinous Accents, here and there diſcouered, makes them imagin, they writ ſome things in verſe, but now, it ſeemes that God in diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, hath likewiſe diſſolued, and ſtrucke dumbe their muſicke.</p>

            <l>Sages are baniſht from Iuditiall Courts,</l>
            <l>And Youth takes no delight in youthfull ſports;</l>
            <l>Our ioyes are gone, and promiſe no returning,</l>
            <l>Our pleaſure's turn'd to paine; our mirth, to mourning;</l>
            <l>Our Hand hath loſt her Sword; our Head, his Crowne;</l>
            <l>Our Church, her Glorie; our Weale, her high Renowne;</l>
            <l>Lord, we haue ſinn'd, and theſe our ſins haue brought</l>
            <l>This world of griefe; (O purchace dearely bought!)</l>
            <l>

From hence our ſorrowes, and from hence our Feares</l>
            <l>Proceed; for this, our eyes are blinde with Teares;</l>
            <l>But that (aye that) which my poore heart doth count</l>
            <l>Her ſharpeſt torture, is; Thy ſacred Mount,</l>
            <l>Sacred Mount <hi>Sion; Sion,</hi> that diuine</l>
            <l>Seate of thy glorie's raz'd; her tender Vine,</l>
            <l>Laden with ſwelling Clusters, is deſtroyd,</l>
            <l>And Foxes now, what once thy Lambs, enioyd.</l>
            <l>But thou (O thou Eternall God) whoſe Throne</l>
            <l>Is permanent, whoſe glorie's euer One,</l>
            <l>Vnapt for Change, abiding ſtill the ſame,</l>
            <l>Though Earth conſume, and Heauen diſſolue her frame,</l>
            <l>Why doſt thou (ah!) why doſt thou thus abſent</l>
            <l>Thy glorious Face? Oh, wherefore haſt thou rent</l>
            <l>Thy Mercy from vs? O! when wilt thou bee</l>
            <l>Attond to them, that haue no truſt, but Thee.</l>
            <l>Reſtore vs (Lord) and let our ſoules poſſeſſe</l>
            <l>Our wonted peace; O, let thy Hand redreſſe,</l>
            <l>Our waſted fortunes; Let thine Eye behold</l>
            <l>Thy ſcatter'd Flocke, and driue them to their Fold;</l>
            <l>Canſt thou reject that People, which thy Hand</l>
            <l>Hath choſe, and planted in the promis'd Land?</l>
            <l>O thou (the Spring of mercy) wilt thou ſend</l>
            <l>No eaſe to our Afflictions, no end?</l>
