            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>clearly and sincerely preached and professed, then and there is moste acceptable time and saluation, and moste perillous time, daunger and damnation: moste acceptable tyme and saluation for them that vnderstande, beleeue and professe the same truely, and most peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous time, daunger and damnation, for them that neglecte, refuse or abuse the same cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly. For the one sorte shall bee taken as children out of a Schoole too enioy their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inheritance, the other shall bee taken as beasts out of a pasture vntoo the day of slau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter. Those that learne and folowe the will and wisedome of God in the worde of God, shal be sure as Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue al things necessarie and comfortable by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and also to inherite Gods kingdome: and those that feede their owne affections in fleshly lustes and in worldly vanities, shall bee taken as beastes from the pasture vntoo slau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter, from pleasure and pastime worldely, vnto payne and perdition eternally. Consider therfore how Gods children learne by Gods woorde written in holy Scripture for theire learning, so as in reading or hearing of the same they seeke and finde comfort of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with suche meditation of the meaning
<pb facs="tcp:7290:2"/>
thereof, as doothe dayly mortifie their carnall affections. All others do eyther vtterly refuse or corruptly abuse the woorde of God, euer feeding their carnall affections, I say, suche as refuse Gods worde do feede their affections in worldely vanities and fleshely lustes, and such as abuse Gods worde, do feed also their affections in some ceremoniall superstitions or hypocriticall abuse of Gods woorde. But Gods children bee all taught of God, so too vse the hearing, reading and meditation of Gods woorde written in holy Scriptures by inspiration of God, taught also as the woorde of faith, preached by ministers and preachers sent of God, that thereby Gods spirite dothe put good lawes intoo their minds, and write them in their heartes. And then they feling their myndes illuminated with the truth, and theirs hearts inflamed with the sincerity and simplicitie of Gods woorde, may boldly and comfortably say that God of his owne good will hath begotten vs by the worde of truthe, wee are nowe borne not of blood, not of the will of fleshe, nor of the will of man, but of God. VVee are nowe not in the fleshe, but in the spirite, bycause the spirite of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7290:3"/>
So then wee are nowe detters, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too the fleshe too lyue after the fleshe, but vntoo the spirite. For if wee shoulde liue after the fleshe, wee shoulde die, but if wee mortifie the deedes of the bodye by the spirite, wee shall lyue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods children vse the hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, preaching and meditation of Gods woorde, not to feede, but to kill their carnall lustes.</p>
            <p>All others, whether that they doo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlye refuse, or else accepte and vse the woorde of God, yet they doo but feede carnall affections, through diuelishe illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, eyther with worldely vanities and fleshely lustes euidently, or else with some abuse of Gods woorde colourably and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly.</p>
            <p>Of this matter did I wryte a little Booke beyng at Geneua in the time of Queene Maries raigne, when I was there by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse Englishe men mooued and requested too cause it too bee printed: and so then with a lyttle Preface I dyd sende many of those Bookes so printed, intoo this Realme of Englande.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7290:3"/>
And nowe finding none of those Bookes too be solde in anie place, but beeing of some desired too peruse one of them (whiche was founde in a freendes hande) and putte it too printing agayn, with some admonition meete for this tyme, I haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ritten this Epistle or Preface, aduertising and desiring all suche as will reade it, so to search the holie Scriptures, and their owne consciences, that they may see and take occasions to pittie and praye for them selues, for all men, and especially for the Queenes moste excellent Maiestie, and all those that bee in aucthoritie vnder her, that wee may liue a peaceable and quiet life, with godlynesse and honestie. And not too vse suche feeding of their owne affections, as causeth suspecting, enuying, mysliking, and mysreporting of others, especially of such as be in authoritie: for that of such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges commonly commeth greate daunger, and the vtter ouerthrowe of the Churche and Common wealth, with all vngodlinesse and iniquitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7290:4"/>
And seeing that the grace of God that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth saluation to all men, hath appeared, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs, that wee forsaking vngodlinesse and worldly lustes, shoulde liue soberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and godlily in this presente worlde. Therefore lette vs not in feeding our owne worldly and fleshly affections prouoke God vtterly too ouerthrowe: but in learning and folowing the will and wisedome of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed and taught in Gods woorde by Gods grace, pray and desire God too preserue and prosper our Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the same in Christ Iesu.</p>

and necessary. And this saluation can not be gotten by mans workes, in kéeping of the lawe, but it is fréely giuen by Gods grace to the beleuers of the Gospell. The righteousnesse of the lawe of God is so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie a yoake by reason of the infirmitie of mans flesh, as no man is able too beare: the glad tidings of the gospell of Christ by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the grace of god be so cléere and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vnto the faythfull, as causeth all things to bée vnto them pleasant and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. So Abraham hearing and beléeuing the promise in his séed, which was the glad tydings in Chryst to come, felt no losse nor lacke, neyther of his natiue countrie &amp; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from whence hée was called, neither of bis deare sonne which was commaunded to be sacrifised, but had great abundance of all riches, with a sure promise of blessed suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and large landes of possession, and was by imputation of righteousnesse taken and named to be the friende of God, and the father of the faythful. So Adam whiche did not by any abilitie of free will perfitly obey Gods commaundement to continue in the pleasures of Paradise: did (by hearing and beleuing the glad tidings that the séed of the

            <p>Here is an example in Adam at the first, shewing vnto all men that should come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for euer, that nothing is so good as that it may continue commodious and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto man without fayth in Christ by the light of the Gospel, nor nothing so euyl, but that it shall serue by the grace of God vnto the profit and plesure of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christ according to the gospel. Yea the righteous lawe of God, which is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie yoke, charging man with more than he is able to beare, declaring sinne and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wrath, when it is separated from the gospel &amp; fayth in Christe, bringeth cursing, death and damnation vnto man: but being well vsed, to driue and force men vnto the comforte and perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the gospel by fayth in Christ, it is both holy and righteous in it self, and also good and profitable vnto man. Let vs therfore so abuse nothing, as it may drawe and stay vs from faith in Christ and the libertie of his Gospell: but so rightely

outwardely thou cannot be bolde eyther to glorie in thy self, or to iudge any other.</p>
            <p>They which haue not the right vse of the law, can haue no true knowledge of sinne. but thou that wilt iudge thy self by the law shalt feele what is in thy selfe against the lawe.</p>

Undoutedly there is no true knowledge of Chryst learned of Gods worde, but a false idoll of Christ, forged by imagination in the hearts of them, that can be content to say that Chryst their Sauior is like vnto any such vile things.

Surely such knowledge of sinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by this lawe, that when as any man in his owne conscience afore the face of God, wil truly measure by the line of this law, howe far he is fallen from the righteousnesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God, into sinne abhominably offending God, then shall be perceiue that through the infirmitie of his owne flesh, he doth fall so farre from al power of frée will, from all ablitie to performe fully his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto God, that in him selfe he can haue no hope to escape the rigor of the lawe, the letter of the law, which killeth, curseth and condemneth all faults, infirmities and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in man, vnto whome God did giue in creation both purenesse and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therfore as in him that presumeth to be iustified by his déedes in doing of this law, any impurenesse or imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by the righteousnesse contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the lawe: so contrariwise vnto him that féeleth and with fayth in Christe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth his owne faultes and infirmities, al horrible sinnes, and gréeuons crimes shall be graciously pardoned through the mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pitie of the Lorde ouer the lawe.</p>

So is the lawe a tutour or scholemaster, teaching man what he oweth of dutie, and forcing him to flée vnto the promise of God in Christ for mercy. They therfore vse the law lawfully, which learne by it to knowe what man ought to do and performe of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and so be made méete and desirous too heare the glad tidings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel of Christ, in whome God doth promis and performe vnto man all things freely. For the lawe sheweth vnto man death and damnation in all his owne deedes, and the gospel allureth man vnto assuraunce of saluation in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes merites.</p>
            <p>So Adam in Paradise being broughte vnto a perceiuing and féeling of his owne sinfull miseries through the lawe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente, was by the gladde tidin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Gospell, by the promise in the seede of the woman to breake the heade of the Serpent, comforted and called to come by fayth in Christe forth of his owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vnto Gods mercies.</p>
            <p>So the Israelites in wildernesse, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after their greuous idolatrie vnto the golden calfe, being brought vnder feare of the law, vnto a féeling of themselues, were

recouered with comfort in the promise of a Prophet to be raysed vp of God vnto them of their brethren. And continually all the dayes of Iosua, the Iudges, and the Kings, and so forth, so oft as by any plagues, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings and threatnings of the lawe, they were brought vnto true féeling and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of themselues and their owne faultes: they euer lerned to flée vnto Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to finde recouerie in his mercies: but when as they followed their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, flattering themselues, then fell they continually from euill vnto worsse sinnes, and sorrowes, miseries and mischéefs. For in continuance of times, and lack of grace, they lost Iudges, Kings, and good Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their owne vtterly, they and their countrey were brought into subiection to serue strangers. Their temple, gods house made to be replenished with riches of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, was turned into a den of theeues, which did rob God of his honour and Gods people of muche riches, and of all maner of godlinesse: and in the place of godly Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and true Prophetes, false flatterers, and ambitious prelates did by many mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes draw men from god vnto themselues,

from Goddes lawes, vnto their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to labour in conscience vnder intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burdens. Wherefore as afore time God had by the crueltie of Pharao driuen them out of Egypt, to be allured and led by méeke Moses toward the lande of promise, so then at that time did God driue them by those euils fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seruing vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letter of the lawe, which killeth, to be called by Christ at his comming, vnto the libertie of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, which by the spirit quickneth.

            <p>I knowe and thinke assuredly, that I and all Christians, be one church, one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in suche vnitie of liuely faithe whiche worketh by charitie, as dothe euer kéepe vs togither as members of one bodie in Christe, although wée be farre asunder by reason of diuers times and places in the worlde, and by the holy spirite, worde, and sacraments of God in this church, is such holinesse as doth euer striue and preuaile against vngodlines, such holinesse as is the continual purging of men from their sins, to furnishe and garnishe them with godly righteousnesse in Christ. This Church or congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is so catholike, so made one of many, so made one mysticall bodie in Christ of many men in all places, as is one mannes naturall body, of diuers members euery one seuerally hauing their own pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and proportions, &amp; all together ioyned accordingly in one body of one person.</p>

The vnitie of them that be sanctified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed, and deliuered from the seruice of the Diuell, the flesh and the worlde, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in holinesse and righteousnesse, is by Christ and in Christ a common comfort and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie vnto al them, of euery thing that is good or profitable vnto any of them, which although many times they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bée séene, and perceyued of worldely men, nor well knowne one to another, yet being all of one faith, be euer altogether afore god in one mind as members of one body, to haue communion, comfort and commodity euery one with al other in Christ their head.

In this Church of Christ and companie of Saintes, I knowe and receiue freely by fayth forgiuenesse of sins, which be so great and gréeuous debts as do deserue death and damnation: and as the least of them could neuer haue bene dyscharged, but onely by the precious passion and oblation of Christ once for all

            <p>Now thus beleuing and comparing the kingdome of heauen with the pleasures of
<pb facs="tcp:7290:29"/>
Paradise, and the holinesse of regeneration with the purenesse of creation, I finde and féele how that I do get more, and better by faith in Christ, than that which I did loose by sinne in Adam. Yea I haue good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and comfortable experience how that God hath concluded al men vnder sin, to be mercyful vnto all, how that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truely describing &amp; declaring the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of God, and the sinfulnesse of man, hath concluded all men vnder their owne sinnes, that righteousnesse which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the faith of Christ, might be giuen vnto the beléeuers: howe that through the righteousnesse of the lawe and infirmities of mannes flesh, God doth make greate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of sinne to appeare in all mens beedes and deseruings, that more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of grace might bée graunted and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the merits of Christ, vnto all that receyue and beleeue the Gospell. O blessed be God for the gifte of this beléefe, by the which he maketh the losse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plesures of Paradise through ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sinne, to serue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inheritance of the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by gods grace. And the sinfull sorowes in mans conscience to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable signes
<pb facs="tcp:7290:29"/>
and tokens of sauing health by Christes Phisicke and medicines. And all dangers, plagues, and vengeance for sinne in the world, to driue men to assurance of health and wealth by faith in the Lorde.</p>
            <p>There can be nothing so sure &amp; certaine as this faith, which commeth by hearing of Gods worde, which is the worke of Gods spirite, whiche is confirmed by the life, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and death of al that euer were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles, Euangelists, &amp; Martyres to teach and witnesse Gods truth. For this faith is not only a knowledge of the grace, mercy, &amp; goodnesse of God, but also an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the same vnto mannes self by the word &amp; sprite of God. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the ground worke &amp; stay of al good hope, the argument and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all such mysteries, as be hid and couered from worldlings, to be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and reueled only vnto Gods children. Therefore any man may easely learne to speake these wordes, but the goodnesse of God towards ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by these words signified, is such, as can not be knowne or perceiued of them which be of bloud, or of the will of the Flesh, or of the wil of man, but only of them whiche be borne of God, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:7290:30"/>
be priuiledged by Christ to be the children of God. For this beléef is not of the fréewill of man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut of the holy spirit of God, not by keping customes or traditions of men, but by hearing the word of God, by hearing or reading the glad tidings of the Gospell in such sorte as can not be reueled, but onely in Christ, of the heauenly father, by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ghost, vnto Gods children.</p>
            <p>The blind eyes of wittie worldlings, in séeking for worldely wealth, &amp; contemning Gods worde, can sée, and finde in déede no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the wrath and vengeance of God in al things, and especially in sicknesse, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, wars, and losse of any lands or goods, but the cleare eyes of faythfull christians, by the light of the Gospell seeking the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of god, and the righteousnesse therof, in all things, and especially in losse of anie góodes, or suffering any paynes, do euer sée the mercifull pitie and tender loue of their heauenly father alwayes keping them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rodde of correction, and the crosse of persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his most deare children.</p>
            <p>All Iewish persons wil haue such a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, as shall make them Princes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in a worldely kingdome: faythfull
<pb facs="tcp:7290:30"/>
christians haue the sonne of god their Lord and sauior, which hath bought and brought them from this world to bee a holie people, and kingly priesthode vnto God in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Hierusalem.</p>
            <p>The Crosse, the passion &amp; death of Christ is an offence vnto all such as be delited and drouned in Iewishe ceremonies and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and a foolishnesse vnto such as glory in Gréekish learning and wisedome: but for all faithfull Christians whiche beléeue the Gospell of the same crosse, death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is the power of God vnto their euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting rest and saluation.</p>
            <p>Grosse idolaters do boldly and blindly i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine a presence of God in imagerie, or vnder the forme of some maner of bodie, to be kept and honored of them, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their fantasie: but the cléere light of the Gospell, doth euidentely vnto the faithfull shewe <hi>EMANVEL,</hi> him which is God with vs, so that they most comfortably sée by fayth, Christ God and man, so in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie glorified in heauen, that in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his spirit, with the ministers of hys worde, and members of his mystical bodie vpon earth, he is alwayes present amongst
<pb facs="tcp:7290:31"/>
men, bestowing suche giftes of his grace vpon them, and receiuing suche honoure, thankes, &amp; seruice of them as may be most for his honor and glory, and their comforte and commoditie.</p>
            <p>Uoluptuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epicures be alwayes we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the time present, and voide of all good hope of that which is to come: but faithfull Christians chéerefully bestowe their time in honest godly study, labors, and exercise, with most comfortable hope and desire of Christ to come in Maiestie, to receiue them into his eternall ioy and glory.</p>
            <p>Coniurers and Charmers doe imagine suche a vertue too be in their wordes and waters, circles and crosses, brethinges and blessinges, as shoulde poure aboundance of holynesse, into any thing as pleaseth them, yea as coulde force the deuil from hell, and God from heauen to appeare vnder some likenesse presently vnto them: Faithefull Christians by Gods worde doe learne and knowe, how that the holy Ghost by faithe in Christ, doth purge mennes hartes from al vngodlynesse, and replenishe them with such gratious goodnesse as sanctifieth them, and all things, as causeth them with all
<pb facs="tcp:7290:31"/>
manner of Gods good creatures, euer too serue God in holinesse and rightuousnesse, without any presumption or desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure either God or the deuill.</p>
            <p>Superstitious hypocrites, can sée no face of that Churche whiche they wil cleue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but in solemne shewe of Ceremonies, and pompe of Prelates: faithfull Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do euidently sée in the holy Scriptures, suche a foundation of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles ioyned vnto Christe the heade cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner stone, as is moste necessary, commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and sufficient for them, in faith, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and conuersation, to be framed, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made members and partes agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto that head &amp; foundation. They sée by faith that face of Christes church, which god by his word hath shewed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful.</p>
            <p>Desperate persons can neuer trust, nor desire of God forgeuenesse of sinnes, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their bodies, nor life euerlasting. But faithfull Christians, by glad tydinges of the Gospell, be taught and encouraged, to desire and beléeue, that their sinnes shall be vtterly abolished, their bodyes from corruption and deathe chaunged and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that they themselues vnto the image of
<pb facs="tcp:7290:32"/>
God in Christ reformed may in life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting with Christ be glorified.</p>
            <p>For in the light of the gospel of Christ, is the vncouered face of Christ, the euidente example and doctrine of Christ, so shewed to be séene, as doth transforme the faithfull beleuers into the same image of godlinesse, which is in Christes doctrine and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as doth moue and make men to put of olde Adam, that they may become newe creatures in Christ. So they be taughte of the father to know the sonne, they be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen of the father to come vnto the sonne, they be transformed from the custome and trade of this world, to be framed and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned like vnto the sonne of God, as vnto the heade corner stone of a spirituall house, of a holie temple, to offer spirituall sacryfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces acceptable vnto God, to offer as Paule teacheth the Romaines, their owne bodies a sacrifice holie, liuely, and acceptable vnto God, and as Paul calleth the charitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of the Philippians goods, odours of swéete sauour, acceptable sacrifices, ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt vnto God. So that fayth which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by the Gospell, maketh mens bodies and mindes, landes and goods, and al that
<pb facs="tcp:7290:32"/>
they haue to be sanctified, sacrificed, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto God. For the Gospell teacheth howe that God ordeyneth and gyueth all things vnto mannes comfort and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, and howe that men should do all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnto Gods honour and glorie.</p>
            <p>So by the Gospel al holinesse and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all gracious goodnesse, all true trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and riches, be giuen abundantly vnto man, and all honour and seruice, all thanks and prayse, be rendred duely vnto god. But vnto all manner of men lacking the lyghte of the Gospell, all manner of things be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, yea al their owne dooings be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable afore God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and damnable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. For nothing can be good or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto man, which doth offend and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please God. Nothing can please God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith in Christe, and it is vnpossible to haue fayth in Christe, and not to haue the Gospell of Christe.</p>
            <p>Therfore it was verie necessarie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that afore the cleare lyghte of the Gospell did fully shine vnto the world, that the experience of other thinges shoulde be well tried and knowne in the world.</p>
            <p>For suche is the good ordinance of God,
<pb facs="tcp:7290:33"/>
to vse all maner of meanes, to bring me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vaine hope in any other thing vnto a sure faith in christ only, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes by hering of gods word, according to Christes gospel.</p>
            <p>For of all the good creatures of God, and of the habilitie of fréewill, man had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent experience in paradise, afore there was any infirmitie, and corruption of nature by reason of sinne. And afterwardes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses made vnto the fathers, the lawe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Moyses, with all Sacrifices and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple, dyd serue for a season to make men myndefull and desirous of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng and kingdome of Chryste, whyche should performe the promisse, and satisfye the Lawe, beautifying his Churche with suche cleare lyght of the Gospel as shoulde vtterly abolishe all shadowes, and figures of Sacrifices and Ceremonies, with the Tabernacle and the Temple. And Christ himselfe did in bodie depart from the earth to be glorified in Heauen: so as by sending from thence the holie Ghoste was most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for men, to haue Christe in spirite alwayes present with them vppon earthe. So therfore after all other good thinges as
<pb facs="tcp:7290:33"/>
the last and the best, God hath thus, in the ende of the worlde, set vp the kingdom of Christ, with the clere lighte of the Gospell, and comfortable presence of his spirite.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that man in Paradyse amongest all Goddes creatures, hauing a pure nature, did not then by the habilitie of his Fréewill, nor by the goodnesse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, continue and stande in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse: he should not imagine that now in the vanities of this worlde, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his fleshe, being drowned in sinne, he can finde any thing able to rayse him vp vnto rightuousnesse. Also it is a cruel thing, by the heauie yoke of the law, to force men thoroughe feare to fall into Desperation, which should by the libertie of the Gospell be allured of loue to walke in the way of saluation. And it is a perillous presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, with gréeuous offence against God, and a great blemishing of the gospell, to renue the same, or deuise any other such like sacrifices or Ceremonies as God hathe now once abolished by the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel. And finally there can be nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto the truth of god, &amp; the comfort of man, than to imagin any bodily presence of
<pb facs="tcp:7290:34"/>
Christ vpon earth with men, vnto whome he sayde it was expedient, that he shuld de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from them, for else the holy Ghost the comforter should not come vnto them. But if I depart, sayth Christ, I will send him, and he when he commeth, shal reproue the worlde of sinne, of righteousnesse, and of iudgement: but he shall comforte you, and hée shall remayne with you. For beholde through his power, and presence, you prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospell haue me alwayes wyth you, in all tymes and places euen vnto the ende of the worlde.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore it is euident, howe that al other things did serue in other times and places, so that now remaineth vnto vs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gospell of Christe, with suche spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence of Christe, as is the power of God vnto the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all that do beléeue. For all that do beleeue the Gospel, be made children of God to enherite his heauenlye kingdome, membres of Christes mysticall body, to be liuely stones of an holy churche and temple, garnished not with golde, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, copper, or colour, in caruings or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges to please the eyes of men: but with holynesse and righteousenesse acceptable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

God. The goodly costly ornamentes &amp; deckings of the tabernacle of Moses, of the temple of Salomon curiously wrought by the hands of cunning workmen, serued but for a season, &amp; coulde no longer continue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to please God or profit man. But faith which worketh by charitie, &amp; is in hearing of the gospel, wrought in the harts &amp; minds of men, by the inspiration of the holy gost, with beautiful frutes of charitable works, shall alwayes shyne and set forth the glory of God in the church of Christe: for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes churche is the elect kinred, the Kingly Priesthood, the holie assemblie, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, which God hath called oute of darknesse, vnto his maruellous light, for to shewe and set forth his vertues.</p>
            <p>They be surely built vpon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophetes and the Apostles, fast framed vnto the heade corner Christe, in faithe euer working and fashioning them by charitie, so conformably vnto the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and doctrine of Christe set forth by the Prophets, Apostles, and Euangelists, that al diuelish deceytfulnesse in the world, can neither blynde, nor bring them to mistake, and forsake their Lord and sauiour Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:7290:35"/>
and his holy Catholike Church: for they in Faith doe euer sée the face of Christe, and the forme and fashion of Christes churche in holy Scriptures, euen so as God by his worde dothe sufficiently shewe to be séene, knowne and reuerenced of all men at all tymes, and in all places.</p>
            <p>But suche men as care not for the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can not cléerely sée or knowe any thing that is good and godly, but boldly and blyndely in all thinges misiudge, mystake, and mislike Christ and his holye Churche, according vnto the common custome, and mannes fonde imagination. For when as they will not learne to vnderstand &amp; know the truthe, by the worde of God, then they do deserue to be deceiued with lyes, by the crafte of the Diuell, in learning suche say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as lacketh all knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. What knowledge or vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gette they, which learne to saye, that they doe beléeue as the Churche teacheth? and bée taught to say and confesse their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe in a straunge Language? When as they say, I doe beléeue as the Churche tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and the Churche teacheth them that vnderstand no Latine, to say, <hi>Credo in Deum

Patrem omnipotentem. &amp;c.</hi> Surely in suche sayings they learne to vnderstand and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing, but take what soeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> craft of the deuill into their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination so highly, that they wil neuer hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For there is no lesson that lyketh and pleseth them so wel, as the lesson of that Doctor which sayth, Say that thou beléeuest as the Church doth, and my soule for thyne. O what auayleth it a man to say wordes, the whiche he doth nothyng perceyue in mynde, nor declare in déeds, or who is able in heauen or earth to paye the price, or guage the pledge of mannes soule, but onely Christ the sonne of God? Take héede, for the falling of their Doctor or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher into the Dungeon of damnation is no excuse for them, that wylfullye folowe a blinde guide. They are wilfull and blynd, which refuse the gospell of God, and folow the Doctrine of men. They deserue to bee damned for folowing a blinde guide, which will not be taughte the Christian Beléefe, but in suche a tongue as they can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand neuer a worde: which wil not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to beleue the holy catholike church,
<pb facs="tcp:7290:36"/>
but in such sort as they shal neither beléeue nor know the Gospell of Christ. For they which learn by the Gospel to know Christ and beléeue in him, haue a lyuely Faythe, working by charitie, not of selfe loue sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by their owne merites, to saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or to haue vainglorie, but knowing and beléeuing that they be saued wholly by Christes merites onely, of a pure loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God and their neighbour, without any truste or looking vnto the worthynesse of their owne déeds, they be earnestly bent vnto good woorkes to the glorie of God, and the profite of all men.</p>
            <p>Thou that lackest the light of the gospel, maist say, that thou beléeuest as the church doth, and yet thinke in thy heart, that thou by thy good déedes maist be saued: yea that thou wouldest not do good deedes, but that thou beleeuest by them to win heauen. And so trusting to winne Heauen by thy good workes, which the truth of the gospel tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth can not be purchased but by Christes bloud, and doing all thy workes for loue of thy selfe, without pure loue of God and thy neighboure, albeit thou say vnto men, that thou beléeuest as the Church doth, yet afore

God thy heart and mynde is voyd of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten faith and godly charitie, and far from any true loue of Christ and his Gospell.</p>

               <p>Certayne differences of chaste loue, and of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte loue, of Christianitie, and of Idolatrie: of Christes Churche, and of Antichristes kingdome: of the Masse, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a greate difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte the pure loue of honeste matrimonie, and the filthy loue of vile harlotrie. If the harlot knowe she shall not be forsaken, then will she set light to offend hir paramour, in da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with other: the more assured that an honest matrone is of hir husbandes loue, the more diligent will shée be to please him only, and to passe for none other. So there is great difference betwixt the godly chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christians, &amp; the selfe loue of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. For tell the worldling, that God so much doth loue him, that he can not be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forsaken and damned: then will hée
<pb facs="tcp:7290:37"/>
care litle to forsake God and fal into sinne: the faithful Christian perceiuing in Christ most certaine assuraunce of gods loue and saluation, is so satisfied and comforted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that nothing can separate him from the loue of God in Christ Iesu.</p>
            <p>The loue of harlots is soone extinguished in pouertie and sicknesse: the loue in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke is then thorough pitifull prouision of the one for the other wonderously purified and increaced betwixte man and wyse.</p>
            <p>Worldlings be wearie of Religion lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wealthe and prosperitie: Christians finde comfortable increase of pure loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crosse of Christ.</p>
            <p>Harlots vse outwardly muche curious trimming, &amp; many gorgeous vanities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly infected with filthy fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; many vile vices. Matrones haue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a comfortable countenance &amp; plain apparell, being inwardly beautifyed with modestie, honestie, and such vertues.</p>
            <p>So comparing Idolatrie vnto Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, it is euident to be séene howe on the one parte outwardly, places and persones with imagerie and crosses, copes and vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ceremonies and shews be solemnly
<pb facs="tcp:7290:37"/>
set forth, which inwardly be filled with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication, hypocrisie and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And on the other part how outwardly persons and places, after moste playn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and fashion, without any counterfaited garmentes, images, ceremonies or any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities in comfortable preaching of the Gospel, &amp; ministration of the Sacramentes be inwardly replenished with faithe, hope, and charitie. The whoorishe church of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriste, taketh of all maner of men, what so euer she can catche to make hir selfe to séeme gay and goodly. The holy Church of Christ wil receiue nothing of any man, but of Christe onely, that she in déede maye bée chast, pure, and holy.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Masse made of manye mennes inuentions, is taken as a thyng moste profitable, and plesant vnto the one: nothing but the plaine preaching of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, sealed with the sacramentes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes only institution and ordinance, can be receiued as comfortable and commodious vnto the other.</p>
            <p>Into the Masse be nowe gathered suche solemne shewes, dumme ceremonies, with straunge words and whisperings, as alore
<pb facs="tcp:7290:38"/>
haue bene vsed of the Gentiles in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, of the Iewes in Superstition, and of sorcerers incantations and coniuryngs: which were all vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, refused, and separated of Christe and his disciples, from suche preaching of the Gospel, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments as the churche of Christ hath receiued of Christ, and doth kéepe and vse according vnto Christs onely institution &amp; ordinance. For in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be written all suche things as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes churche did receyue of Christ by hym and his disciples so instituted and taught, as should euer after bée obserued and kept. And therfore it is verie euident by playne writings in the holy Scriptures, how that Christe and his Apostles by preachyng of the Gospell and ministration of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, did teach men in all places, to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselues to be offered as a sacrifice to serue God in holinesse and righteousnes, as liuely membres of Christes mysticall body: but how by saying Masse, to make of bread and wyne turned into Christes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodye a sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, there is not one worde in al holy scripture, no, there is not in all holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:7290:38"/>
any maner of Masse now vsed, taught or commaunded by Gods worde.</p>
            <p>For Moyses and the Prophets set foorth in writings all sacrifices and Ceremonies pertaining vnto the Law. And lyke wise do the Apostles and Euangelistes all suche as belong vnto the Gospell. And all that is written in the new Testament by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Euangelistes, contaynyng all suche doctrine and déedes of Christ and his disciples, as God woulde by them should be taught vnto vs, doth as muche reproue the Masse, as in the old Testament Moses and the Prophetes did reproue the sacrifices of the Israelites in Dan and Bethell. For as vnlike is the Masse at the Altare, vnto the Lordes Supper at the Table, as were the Calfes sette vp by Ieroboam in Dan and Bethel, vnlyke vnto the Arke and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatorie betwixt the Cherubins in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Hierusalem.</p>
            <p>And as the Prophetes and Priestes of God did teache suche a memoriall and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God at Hierusalem, as shoulde moue and stirre vp the minds of men there to remember and reuerence God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: but Ieroboam and his Priestes, did
<pb facs="tcp:7290:39"/>
teache and make men to beléeue that their Idolles were not onely images of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but the same God that brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Egipt, in such corporal presence then there in Dan and Bethell, as did kéepe the Israelites myndes from heauen, and theyr personall presence from Ierusalem: euen so now godly preachers do teach such a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, &amp; presence of Christe in the Lordes supper, as should moue and make all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten men to remember &amp; reuerence Christe in heauen, but vngodly priestes do pretend such a bodily presence of Christ vpon their altares, as doth draw mennes minds from heauen, and their personall presence from the Lordes supper at the Lordes table.</p>
            <p>Then were the Israelites blynde and bolde to set vp Calues, imagining so to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and please god in Dan and Bethel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ieroboam, as their forfathers did mrst dishonor and displease God in wildernesse with Aaron.</p>
            <p>And what a bolde blindnesse is it nowe of Christians to set vp a sort of their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vnto the honour of God, when as God by the light of the Gospell hathe aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his owne Ceremonies as vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:7290:39"/>
vnto his seruice? And what a boldnesse is it to say, that Christes bodily presence is kept vpon earth vnder the forme of bread, which according vnto the scriptures, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vp from the earthe, and glorified in heauen in the forme of man? The light of the gospell hath vanquished ceremonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordeined of God as now vnprofitable, &amp; can any ceremonies deuised by man now blemish the gospell &amp; not be abhominable?</p>
            <p>The comfortable abundance of the holie Ghoste did not come vntill the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ was departed and gon: and howe then can they receiue abundant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Christes spirite, whiche bée infected and blynded with a grosse imagination of Christes body? The flesh profiteth nothyng sayth Christ, the wordes that I speake, bee spirite and lyfe: he dothe not saye that the wombe whiche did conceiue and bear him, or the breast that gaue him sucke is blessed: but, Blessed be they which heare the word of God and kéepe it, as though he had sayd: Not those whiche woulde haue him God and man in bodilye presence, or imagine him to be in any visible thyng: But those which know and honour God in the truth
<pb facs="tcp:7290:40"/>
of his worde and presence of spirite be blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Those in wyldernesse whiche did not knowe what was become of Moses, being in talke with God vppon the toppe of the mountain, bycause they did desire and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue a bodily presence of God too be wyth them at the foote of the mountayne, coulde not be contented and comforted with a true spirituall presence of God, but were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and plagued for the vaine imagination of a bodily presence. Those can haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable feeding of the words, which be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and lyfe, at the Lordes supper, whiche will haue a wonderfull gasing stocke at a gorgeous Masse. Which will desire and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine Christ to be bodily vpon earth, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not see and knowe by fayth, Christes body so glorified in Heauen; as causeth his spiritual presence, euer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue most comfortable vnto all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in any place vpon earth.</p>
            <p>The playne preaching of Gods woorde surely sealed with the Sacramente of the Lordes Supper, sheweth and offereth in spirite and truthe to be seene and receyued by faith, the body and bloud of Christe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in heauen in the forme of man.</p>

their priestes and suche as haue highest au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer them. So mighte the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in wildernesse with Aaron, &amp; in Dan and Bethel vnder Ieroboam haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For Aaron and Ieroboam did teache and commaund the people to do reuerence ther, not as vnto Images or Idols, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the God that broughte them out of the land of Egipt. Howbeit for all that euer the priest could teach, or the king commaund, those Images were Idols, and all they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable Idolatrers, which did beléeue that Doctrine of the priest, or obey that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the king.</p>
            <p>Wherfore it is not the teaching of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, nor the commaundement of princes which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cause Christ to be bodily present after suche sort in any thing, as may there be honored as God, or that shall excuse any person beléeuing or honouring that, which is taughte and commaunded according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mannes imagination against the worde of God.</p>
            <p>They say that Christ said, This is my body, and Christes saying is Gods worde, and not mannes imagination. I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Christes saying is gods worde, and that he

so saide of the bread which he toke, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thankes geuing, brake, and gaue vnto his Disciples to be eaten in remembrance of him. But how agreeth that saying vnto such bread as the prieste taketh, and after brethings, and blessings lifteth vp, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vnto the people to be honoured, and reuerenced in the steade of him? The word of God wrongly wrested, and not rightly applied, is at some times abused to teache Deuilish lies in steade of godly truth. The woord written by the spirit of God, to raise a man from vnder danger of despaire, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hope of Goddes helpe vpwardes, was wrongly wrested by the Deuill, to moue Christ standing vpon the pinacle, wilfully to fall downewardes. So like wise the woords spoken of Christ vnto his disciples, to raise vp their mindes in comfortable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him glorified in heauen, be euil abused of priestes, to bring downe his bodily presence amongste them to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed vpon earth.</p>
            <p>Surely this same saying, He shall geue his Angels charge ouer thee, &amp;c. Which is the woorde of God spoken and applied to raise vp a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daungerous sorowes in

miseries, vnto a comfortable trust in Gods grace and mercies, may be abused by the deuil, to make a man of presumption in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the euident ordinance of God, to fall into the danger of tempting God. And so such woordes as be good and godly, spoken with suche circumstances of Christes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as teacheth men to keepe a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remembrance of Christes death, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vntoo Christes institution, may be Diuelishly whispered in suche sorte by the priest at the aulter, as shuld séeme to make a bodily presence of Christ to be sacrificed and honored according vnto mannes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. There is nothing more perillous than to take the woorde, or any good gifte of God, and to abuse it contrary vnto the will and commaundement of God. The vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable seruant, which said vp to kéepe safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the talent, or treasure of his Lord, which was deliuered vnto him to haue bene bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed in vsurie, was by the woorde of his owne mouthe condemned, when as he did confesse that he did otherwise keepe the Lords treasure, than as the Lord had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. And if any man thinke that he may say vnto Christe, Lord I knowe that
<pb facs="tcp:7290:42"/>
thou did say of the bread and the wine, this is my body, this is my bloud, take, eat, and drinke in remembrance of mée: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I euer with suche reuerence ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them, as was due vnto thée: surely vnto such a man, Christe in conscience wil at some times answer, O wicked seruant, by these woordes of thine owne mouthe, do I condemne thée. For thou doest confesse that I bad thée take, eate, drinke this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, why diddest thou then contrary vnto my commaundement, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this to be kept, honored, and sacrificed as the bodily presence of me? The woordes of Christ be moste true: but when as they be pronounced with such circumstances as be moste contrary vnto the custome of the christians, then they haue a meaning most contrary vnto the doctrine and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of Christe.</p>
            <p>The giftes of God in all things, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his sacraments, be good and godly, but the abuse of them contrary vnto Gods commaundement, is diuelish and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The preacher, and the coniurer vse bothe, the name, and the word of God, and good praiers, howbeit not in like manner,
<pb facs="tcp:7290:43"/>
nor for one purpose, for in beléef, behauior, and purpose, they be cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary the one vnto the other.</p>
            <p>There was neuer séene in the world, two things so muche contrary the one vnto the other, as is the masse &amp; the Lordes supper. Therefore whatsoeuer is well vsed in the one is euill abused in the other. And truely that fault of abuse is no smal offence, albeit that which is abused, séemeth sometime to be but a little thing. For it is a great sin to delight or be occupied in little trifles, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting or refusing Gods great giftes and benefits in waightie matters.</p>
            <p>So do Priests in their masse abuse gaie garments, neglecting the seemely simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Lordes supper: and therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no small sinne, preferring their owne imagination vnto Christes institution.</p>
            <p>So Adam in Paradise by the abuse of the fruite of one trée, contrary vnto Gods commaundement, shewed suche a sinfull minde, as was disobedient vnto God, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned by the Diuell, to preferre a fantasie of false persuasion, vnto all the profits and pleasures in Paradise of Gods gracious gifte and prouision.</p>

Yet for the imagination of priuate pleasure or profit in the abuse of some little things doe deserue death and damnation vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, with losse of al things that is theirs, The Israelites placed by Gods prouision in the Lande of promisse, by their owne craft and crueltie plucking some parts and parcels one from an other, did at lengthe deserue the losse of all together, both lands and goodes, and themselues to bée taken of strangers and vsed as captiues.

vineyard, and yet by the policie of Iesabel, with the consent of the rulers and elders of Iezrael was Naboth spoiled cruelly, bothe of his life, and of his enheritance: and so A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab ioyned the vnrighteous possession of a vineyarde vnto his kingdome, not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice willing the crueltie of Naboths death, but of couetousnesse taking the profite of Iesabels policie, which was a woman ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouraged than corrected &amp; chastised by the King &amp; the countrey, to expulse and persecute Gods Prophets, for the fauoure shée bare vnto Baals priests.</p>
            <p>And these things then neglected of the king, the rulers, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as small trifles, were soone after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and plagued of God with greate and gréeuous vengeance. O Lorde, when, and with what, wilte thou rewarde them, that haue more vncharitable gaines, than righteous possessions? that haue conueyed by couetousnesse, pretie portions of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vnto little or nothing of their owne enheritance: that can be content to take profite of other mennes euill policies, and also themselues to deuise and practise craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cruelnesse, that haue burned and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb facs="tcp:7290:44"/>
the preachers of the gospel of Christ to receiue and set vp sayers and singers of a ceremonious masse? I write not these things to stirre vp cankred stomakes vnto enuie against other, but to moue charitable men of pitie to pray vnto God for their countrey.</p>
            <p>O England, if that thou dost think that superstitious ceremonies, worldly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and craftily cloked couetousnesse and ambition, be but smal trifles, yet shouldest thou be well assured that God will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remember such smal trifles, and not long delay the ful reward of more abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable abuses in greater matters.</p>
            <p>It is a great mater when as any things of great goodnesse either by Gods creation or institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be in any wise abused through mannes imagination. So was woman created and commended of God vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a helper vnto comfort, and natural séede giuen to the increase of mankinde, being both together sanctified in matrimony, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods glory, and vnto mannes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, comforte, and commoditie. But the floude in Noes time whiche drouned the whole worlde: and fire with Brimstone
<pb facs="tcp:7290:45"/>
which destroyed Sodome and Gomor, did witnesse by vengeance how great and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a matter the abhominable sin of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, whiche did mistake vnto themselues wiues for bodily beautie onely, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise misuse themselues in satisfying of their filthy lasts vnnaturally. Also the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in the lande of promisse did loue, and take in mariage many straunge wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, hating and forsaking their own law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wiues, yea they did offer their séede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Moloch, sacrifising their children vnto Idols, and with these euill abuses of these good things, they so infected and poysoned the lande, that it did euen vomit and spue out them, as most vile filthinesse afore the face of God and man.</p>
            <p>Let all men take héede, whiche knowe that God hath created man and woman, and sanctified wedlocke vnto their necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and comfortable felowship: that they do nothing contrary vnto Gods ordinance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refusing suche comfortable helpe, as they need of one wife, or else abusing many women, or worse wayes deuised &amp; taught by the Deuil, to satisfie their filthy lusts: &amp; that vnder pretence of honest loue to make
<pb facs="tcp:7290:45"/>
godly matrimonie, there be no craftely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered couetousnesse, to commit abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ivolatrie. Take héede all parentes, and you that haue Wardes, that yee offer not your séede vnto Moloch, that ye sacrifice not your children vnto Idols, ioyning them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither by your couetousnesse, which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, when as there is none suche loue in them, as may make godly matrimony. Yea &amp; all men ought to beware that they cloke not their gréedie couetousnesse, and filthie lustes, vnder the pretence of any godly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For when as Sichem Emors sonne, being the head man of the citie of Sichem, sought to satisfy his carnal lust with Dina Iacobs daughter, &amp; persuaded the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Sichem, through couetousnesse of gains to be had of other mens goods, to take circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, &amp; appéere in outward profession like vnto the Israelites in religion, then that deuilishe purpose, couered vnder that godly pretence, prouoked vengeance to the vtter destruction of Sichem and all those citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Matrimony of gods institution, &amp; circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as a sacrament to seale the profession of gods pure religion, were good things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto gods ordinance: but the abuse
<pb facs="tcp:7290:46"/>
of them was a greate euill and a hainous sinne contrary vnto Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therfore is the plage and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which fell vpon them, written to be a warning, that vengeance from God will fall vppon all Cities and countreys, in the which suche hypocrites, by suche abuses of Gods ordinances and sacraments, do sore slander the true profession of Gods pure religion.</p>
            <p>O England, beware least that thou be found still to kéepe and flatter filthie leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, couetousnesse, and ambition, cloked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of honestie, religion, and godlinesse. Beware also of the false hearts of such flatterers, as easily gaue any honor or authoritie from Christ and the king vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pope: to kéepe lands and goods from the crowne, the Churche, and the common wealth vnto themselues. Englande, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of them that haue graunted vnto the Pope all authoritie, why they do denie him his purgatorie? and if they thinke that there is purgatorie, wheras séely soules lie to be reléeued by saying masse, why do not they restore and bestow al their lands and goods to maintein many masses, for to ease
<pb facs="tcp:7290:46"/>
and deliuer séely soules out of so great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and miseries? And if they do know that there can be no purgation for sinneful soules, but onely Christes bloud, clensing liuing mennes hearts by faith hearing and beleeuing the gospell, why do they suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priestes in saying masses so dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and damnably to abuse the word of god, and the churche and spouse of Christe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto the gospell of Christe? yée that know, that gods word is abused, if it be not so plainly red, preached, or pronounced, as may make men to vnderstand, knowe, and beleeue gods truth, and that the séely soules and simple persones, hated and contemned héer liuing in this world, be the church and spouse which Christ hath purchased, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; sanctified vnto him selfe by his owne bloud: I beséeche you beware of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of purgatorie, whiche by their masse bring themselues and all theirs, into suche a madde mase, as too imagine that their woords which cannot be heard and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to comforte the consciences of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, may in any wise serue to saue or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the soules of the deade: or that those landes and goods which be bestowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
<pb facs="tcp:7290:47"/>
their temples with their owne idle bellies, and with carued and painted ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, be any other things, than the open and abhominable spoile &amp; robbery of the liuely stones, members, and ministers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Churche, and mysticall bodie of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>This sinfull abuse, is like to cause En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to be sore plaged, especially bicause of suche men, as did pretende a loue vnto Christes gospell to gette abbay Landes, and churche goodes into their handes, and nowe consent, to expell and persecute the gospell, to kepe the same in their hands, and in the meane time neither be ashamed nor afraid of their manifest and manifold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie in suche solemne othes, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase and possession of their lands &amp; goodes, for the inheritance of the Crowne, for the iuste authoritie of the king, for the vsurped primacie of the pope, for the profession both of godly religion, and of vngodly Idolatrie and Superstition, as by the woords of their owne mouthes, taking God to witnesse, they haue shewed them selues afore all the worlde, periurers, theeues, and traitoures
<pb facs="tcp:7290:47"/>
vnto their countrey, vnto their king, vnto GOD, and vnto man: vndoutedly these euill abuses, bée sure tokens of sore venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce.</p>
            <p>Likewise all abused oblations and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices do rather prouoke, than appease the anger and wrathe of God towardes man: as was wel séene in the sacrifice of Caine, lacking faith: and in the multitude of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered of the Israelites, with bloudie ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of vncharitable gotten goods. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lord crieth, saying, that he is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened, sore greeued, and wearied with many sacrifices. He sayth, the hands of the offerers be bloudy, he hateth al burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of spoile and robberie, euery thing is spoile and robberie afore God, that is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or kept vncharitably amongst men. O howe vncharitably did the Pharisies catch and kéepe vnto themselues by their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the riches and releefe which yong men did owe vnsoo their olde impotent parentes by Gods commaundement, They did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend such a seruice towards god the father &amp; the church their moother, as though al obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto their hands for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

Such were the priestes pastors in Israell,

féeding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flock.

            <p>The grosse vices in manifest abuses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were neuer so euill and abhominable, as was in Christes time the fine coloured hipocrisy of those, which once caused Christ to bée crucified at Hierusalem, or of suche as yet take vppon them dayly to sacrifice Christ in all places.</p>
            <p>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Paradise abused an apple, a small trifle, neglecting many good gifts of God: they in Hierusalem, &amp; in al places, teache &amp;

kéepe mens traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, neglecting &amp; making of no force the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of God.</p>
            <p>Many men at other times abhominably sinned concerning godly Matrimonie, and natural séed, moued only by couetousnesse or carnall beautie, to take wiues, and kéepe whoores, or otherwise vnnaturally to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their filthie lusts: these Priests through couetousnesse and ambition, with vsurped authoritie, did then in the Iewishe Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge, and do nowe in the Romish churche, abuse the amiable daughters of the holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the consciences of deuoute men in the spiritual Hierusalem: &amp; also vnkindly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey and corruptly abuse the immortall séed of the woorde of the liuing God. Naturall séede is ordeined of God to continue succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnto men vppon earth: and the séede of Gods woorde to serue in regeneration of Gods children vnto Gods kyngdome. And what good fruite can spring of suche good séede amongest them that condemne and forsweare godly matrimonie? and that wilfully spill by Massing, suche séede as should be well sowen in preaching?</p>
            <p>Aaron in wildernesse, of the golde that was brought out of Egypte made a Calfe,

            <p>Ieroboam knowing that God had orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his glory, that al Israel should year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare afore his face only in Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, yet to drawe and keepe the ten tribes from God vnder his dominion, did set vp two golden calues, the one in Dan, and the other in Bethel, saying: this is my GOD which brought thée out of Egipt to Israell.</p>
            <p>The chéefe priestes and the elders, being certified by the Souldiers whiche watched the sepulchre, that Chryst was risen with maiestie and glorie, yet to keep themselues in estimation and authoritie, did giue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to set forth not a figure of a golden calfe, but a diuelish face of a forged lie.</p>
            <p>And now when as the holie Ghost with preachers of the Gospell, witnesseth that

Christcs body is glorified in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in forme of man: yet to drawe and kéepe mens min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from heauen, and to continue a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced priesthoode in estimation vppon earth, they haue pretended a presence and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christes bodie, voyd of all glory, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of bread and wine.</p>
            <p>Christes bodie was once for all sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and then, for euer so glorified: that as he was once in forme of man seen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant amongst men vpon earth, so is hee nowe taken from amongst men, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Heauen.

For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he had put awaye and abolished figures and shadows fully and clerely performing the truth in bodily presence, then did hée in body ascende from the earth to bée glorified
<pb facs="tcp:7290:51"/>
in heauen, so as all Faithfull in euery place vppon earth might haue a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and commodious presence of Chryste with them in spirite, than coulde haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vnto some men in any one place in body.</p>
            <p>So nowe the mercifull goodnesse of God, is in many things by many meanes so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as after a sort it might bée spied and perceiued: but in Christe only so promysed and perfourmed, and by preaching of the Gospell through power of the spirite so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed &amp; offered, as vnto saluation it may be receyued and enioyed.</p>
            <p>Seing therfore, that it hath pleased God to graunt &amp; giue vnto man in Christe, after suche sorte all treasures, man can haue no néede, nor shuld not haue any will or desire to take any thing either of any other perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els after any other sort or fashion. For it is an abhominable contempt of God to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain any thing fréely offred of him, &amp; to seke or desire the same or a worse to be gotten and purchased of any other. It is a spitefull mocking of Christe, to say, that any thing may be graunted and gotten by some other meane, which Christ did purchase and buy
<pb facs="tcp:7290:52"/>
with his precious bloud: as though Christe had not so well and wisely bestowed hys bloodsheding, as some other might haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed some meaner thing. Some men imagin that they néed not for euery thing to call vpon Christ, and that they shoulde not themselues presume to pray vnto God, but rather humble them selues in praying to saincts, to be mediators for them vnto god. These mens presumptuous arrogancie is abhominable afore the face of God, for that they wil not know themselues to be so vile and sinfull, that none other can bée able, or méete to bring them vnto God, or by anie meane to purchase vnto them any thing of GOD, but onely Christe by his precious bloud. They doe imagine after a worldelie fashion, GOD to be like a proud Prince, whiche woulde haue suters to speake vnto his seruants: and so in iudging of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto al examples &amp; doctrine in Gods word, they dare not take the way in at the dore, by the which all faithful be called and receiued as Gods fréendes, but in bold and blinde presumption, to climbe ouer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, deserue to bée repulsed and throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, as despisers of Gods grace, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb facs="tcp:7290:52"/>

For god is robbed of his honor due to his maiesty, by such as presume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth of his holie word to iudge him like vnto proud princes of this wicked worlde. And saincts departing from hence, be not put in office and placed afore God to bee hearers and offerers of men and their prayers. For onely Christe, whiche is the dore of grace, euer standing open vnto all faythfull, is sufficient to bée mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this matter of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to bring &amp; present men and their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers afore the face of GOD. And so Paul 1.

or for any good thing of any other than of God, or by any other mean than by faith in Christ, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel of christ, is an vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfull refusing of the liuing god, of his gracious goodnesse, and of sauing health in Christe, to deserue by so doyng, vengeance with the worlde, &amp; damnation with diuels.</p>

For commonly in mans imagination is suche a false fayned fashion of Christe, and his kingdome, as is most vnlike and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto the true face and fourme of Christ and his holy Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is nothing agréeable vnto that whiche is clearely and comfortably reuealed vnto suche as searche and sée the same in holy scripture.

            <p>For they flée from the poore little flocke and crosse of Christe, as from perillous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes and mischeuous plagues, &amp; they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, regard, and reuerence the gretest mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of priestes and prelates, with moste solemne shewes and ceremonies: as though the kingdom of Christ were a thing full of worldly glory &amp; outwarde holines.

the scriptures, and folowing custome in blinde imagination of Christe and the Church they run vnto the diuell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Antichristes kingdome.</p>
            <p>They imagin that in folowing the most they shall escape da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, when as in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the best, they forsake saluation. Many were drouned in the floude, when as fewe entred with Noe to be saued in the shippe. Many taried and perisht in the fire, when as fewe followed Lot out of Sodome and Gomor. Many in all places did continue in idolatrie, when as Abraham was called &amp; did go to serue God in a straunge countrey. Of the Israelits which came out of Egipt many deserued to die in wildernesse, and fewe did enter into the lande of promise.</p>
            <p>Tenne tribes fell from the kingdome of Dauid into idolatry vnder Ieroboam, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a few in comparison went from thence to kéepe the lawe and ordinaunce of God at Hierusalem. Many euer finde and take the broade way which leadeth vnto perdition, when as fewe enter in at the narrow gate vnto saluation. Many be called and few be chosen: yea &amp; God doth choose those whiche the world doth refuse. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the plaine

            <p>Many do imagin that if God work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersly to set vp any in high authoritie, then whatsoeuer such a one doth commaund, is good and godly. It was a wonderfull work of God to set vp Ieroboam and make hym king of Israell: and yet moste vngodly dyd hée cause his people to commit idolatrie in Dan and Bethell. And when as he was made a king by the wonderful working of God, and caused the people whiche hée was king ouer abhominably to committe idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try agaynste God: yet euen then in so doing did hée say, and commaunde euery thing in the name of God, as the true honour and seruice of God. But neyther the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worke of God in making him king, nor his owne saying or meaning to establishe that kingdome, coulde make or proue that to be the honor and seruice of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, whiche was contrary vnto the worde and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God. O Englande beware and take good héede that thou neyther resist au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
<pb facs="tcp:7290:55"/>
nor yet committe idolatrie. For if thou folowing mans imagination take ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two ways, then doest thou pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillously procéede towardes perdition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto the commaundement of God in the worde of God. For the woorde of God teacheth neuer to resist authoritie, but euer to pray for al men, and especially for suche as be in authoritie: and yet if any thing bée taught and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto Gods word and wil, then rather to obéy god than man, how high in authoritie soeuer they be, which take vpon them so to teache or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde. Therefore if thou féele authoritie heauie and greuous vnto thée, which surely is Gods ordinance for mans comforte and commoditie, doe not repine &amp; murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods ordinaunce, but repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thine owne faults, whiche doe cause God to scourge &amp; beat thée with that rod of authoritie, whiche when thou of curst hart by wishing, woord, or déed woldst snap and pull out of Gods handes, then didst thou deserue and cause God to take from thée that rod of his fatherly correction, &amp; poure vppon thée plagues of intollerable venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. So the Israelites impaciently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:7290:55"/>
the correction of seueritie vnder Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, were plagued with idolatrie vnder Ieroboam. But when as the childe that is corrected, or the people that is plaged, doth humbly submit himself vnder the hande of God his heauenly lord &amp; Father, then will God of fatherly affection, cherish his child, spare his people, and caste the rod into the fire, eyther as he did graciously change the hart, and mollifie the minde of Manasses, or else as hée did righteously remoue and destroy the power and person of Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donosor, of Saul, and of suche other.</p>
            <p>Take ye héede and bee warned as well princes as peoples, as wel ye that be in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, as you that bée vnder authoritie: for when as the one is punished by the fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the other, then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of them that doo suffer, is the cause of the faulte in the other.</p>
            <p>When as the people in Israell kindled the fury of God fiercely agaynst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, then Satan had power to persuade Dauid their King to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a great faulte, in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryng the people, for the whiche GOD did greuously plage them. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Dauid had gréeuousely synned agaynste God in
<pb facs="tcp:7290:56"/>
abominable murder and adultery, then the sinfull sedition of the people stirred vp by ambitious Absalon, serued as the sworde of God to plague Dauid, &amp; expulse him. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye wyse, when as one dothe pyttie and praye for an other, then God dothe pardon the faultes, and remedye the myseries of bothe. As Dauid séeing the people perishe, and the angel with the sword of the plague ready to procéede to stryke the citie, dyd fall downe in greeuous sorowe, confessing his owne faulte, and pittifully bewayling and praying for the plagued people: so that then Dauids sinne was pardoned, &amp; the plague among the people ceased, and bothe partes of God chearished and comforted. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the people after the death of Absalon, perceyuing and féeling their owne faulte, were gréeued with the expulsion, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red restitution of Dauid their King: so as they reuerently receyued him, he louingly did pardon them, and God graciously did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and blesse both him and them together in a peasable and prosperous kingdome. So surely whensouer men will sorrowe and confesse their owne sinnes, pittie and praye for the myseries of other, then wyll
<pb facs="tcp:7290:56"/>
God forgiue the sinnes, remedie the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, comforte the consciences, and blesse and prosper the countreyes and kingdomes of such godly persons.</p>
            <p>And therfore, all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had nede to beware of suche vngodly mindes, as desire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite to sée or heare the mischief and miseries or faultes and euils in other. For all they that haue so euil disposed mindes, shal soone be forced to fynde and feele in them selues the same euils whiche they nowe will and wishe vnto other. No man shoulde imagin bycause hée can finde a faulte in other, that therfore he himself is not giltie: or bycause other bée plagued, that hee shall bée blessed. Adam in Paradise founde faulte with the woman, and the woman with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and GOD did not take the faulte of one to be an excuse for an other, but rather as cause of greatter offence, and of more iuste condemnation vnto them all. The Pharisie did finde faults in the Publican, and had nothyng in hym selfe that coulde please GOD. The Publicane féeling and confessyng his owne faultes obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mercye and grace of God. And also note, that those whyche had theyr bloude
<pb facs="tcp:7290:57"/>
mixt with sacrifice, beyng cruelly killed of Herode: and those whiche were miserably ouerwhelmed with the fall of a Toure in <hi>Siloe,</hi> were not the greatest sinners afore God: but ráther shewed as notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to giue warning vnto all men, that if they woulde not repent and amende them selues, beyng then spared, they shoulde pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and be destroyed with suche vengeance and plagues, as they did sée poured vppon those other that then suffered.</p>
            <p>So the moates in other mennes eyes should make vs diligent to pul the beames out of our owne eyes: and the plagues of other mennes punishmentes bée good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings for vs of repentance &amp; amendment. But when as menne lightly regarding the good counsel of Gods word, and boldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumyng vppon false prophecies, and vayne worldly policies, doe imagin that faultes founde in other, make muche for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and prayse of them: and the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of other, for the deliuerance or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them: then doe their blynde eyes whiche will not sée and sorowe their owne sinnes, and other mennes miseries, despise the long sufferance and mercifull pacience
<pb facs="tcp:7290:57"/>
of God alluring them by al maner of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto repentance &amp; amendment: &amp; their hard harts which can not repent, doth heap &amp; store vp against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, the wrath and vengeance of God, in the day of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whiche commeth so sore and sodaynly vppon them that they shall fynde no way to auoyde it, nor be able to abyde it.</p>
            <p>O Englande take héede. For when God dothe beginne to iudge those that hée of hys house and familye, then doothe hée make ready, and threaten vengeaunce and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition vnto suche as bée strangers and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto hym, and vnto his house, hys churche, his Gospell, his truthe. As surely as the Lorde liueth, if thou wilt not soone sée, take good héede, repent and amend, thou shalt not long be without féeling and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that carnall libertie sclaundering the Gospell, can bee no couer nor cloake for superstitious Papistrie refusing the Gospell. Nor worldely couetousnesse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and abusing any landes or goods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning vnto the churche of Christe, and to the common wealth, shall not excuse or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend abhominable idolatrie agaynst the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, and saluation of mens soules.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus dothe the woorde of God in holy Scriptures giue good light vnto the right way from all dangers vnto the beste assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all goodnesse. For the lawe whiche declareth and requireth mans duetie, dothe proue that man being frayle of flesh, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the deuil, &amp; bewitched of the worlde, dothe deserue wrathe and vengeance. And the Gospell bringing gladde tydings of free deliuerance, doth set foorth the mercies and grace of god in Christ vnto man. And then man by faith doth flée from himself, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and the world, vnto all gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christe onely. So the kéeping and the walking of the right way, is the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and increase of suche fayth as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of Gods worde. And fayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commeth of Goddes worde, is continued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the forsaking or leauing of other
<pb facs="tcp:7290:61"/>
things, to looke and truste onely vnto the worde and promise of God. So Abraham did forsake his owne kinred and countrey, leauing all reasoning and doubting eyther of prouision amongs straungers, eyther of the barennesse of his own body, and of hys wiues wombe, eyther of the sacrifising of his sonne. I saye Abraham doubting or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring none of these things, but onely regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and trusting the word and promise of GOD, was made strong in faith, giuing prayse vnto God, beyng throughly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he whiche had promised was able to performe. So Peter regarding nothing but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> calling of Christ, did come forth of the ship &amp; walke vpon the waters by a strong &amp; sure fayth: but looking aside at the windes and waues, by a faynte and féeble fayth did sinke downward in danger to be drowned.</p>
            <p>Learne therfore all ye that be called and commaunded of Christ to flée from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of desolation, not to feare, stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and doubt for lands and goods, wiues and children, frends or foes, fire or sworde: but be ye strong in fayth, throughly persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that be which hath promised, is able to perform vnto you in suffring for his cause,
<pb facs="tcp:7290:62"/>
that one haire of your heades shall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and that for the losse of any thing here in this present world, ye shall receyue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfold recompence, and afterwards in the world to come life euerlasting. Surely all your goods, countrey, and kinred, shall not be so muche hurt by the worlde, as blessed of God, when as you in Christes cause for Gods glory, by death, prison, exile, or any manner of persecution bée forced to leaue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them wholly vnto the fatherly prouidence of God. But if ye forsake God for loue of them, then doe yée deserue that God should destroy you, and plage them.</p>
            <p>As when the Israelites at Cades were called of God to come forth of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into the lande of promise, then they douted and feared so muche the daunger of euils, to their wiues and children, that they refused Gods calling, and God therefore returned them vnto long trauell, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles in wildernesse, where as their bodies and carkases, all died and perished, their wiues &amp; children were ofte and grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously plagued.</p>
            <p>And euen so, when as a man is called in witnessing of Gods truth by any deathe, to
<pb facs="tcp:7290:62"/>
come spedily out of this world into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then if for feare or loue of fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des &amp; goods, hée vtterly wil refuse &amp; deny so to forsake all, &amp; come vnto God, he shall deserue that God with long wretchednesse in this worlde, shold destroy him, and plage all that is hys.</p>

countrey there abiding in the shadowe of death vnder Idolatrie, that they will not desire séek and find the churche of Christ in other places openly assembled in suche sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profession of Christen Religion, as God dothe blesse and beautifie with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and grace of his cléere truth &amp; comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table countenance. Many knowing and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the truth inwardly in their mind, yet frame themselues in outwarde apperance to please the world, hauing their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to witnesse, that in purposing so to please bothe God and man, they can not long escape the iudgement, shame &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vnfaithfull flattering &amp; dissembling bothe with God &amp; man. For in halting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon both sides, they can not vprightly stand or go with either party: but in bowing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Baal, they fall from God. And hauing good knowledge of God, and yet giuing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of offence to the simple that lacke knowlege, they deserue worse than a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to be tyed about their necke, and to be drowned in the sea: bycause they seeing vngodlinesse, doe wittingly presume afore the face of God, to bring them selues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers folowing their example in danger of
<pb facs="tcp:7290:63"/>
the same that they sée is vngodly, by going to Masse, and pretending a loue and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege vnto the gospell, they make the simple ignorant to think that the Masse is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, or that for policye a faythfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may company with the vngodly, at vngodlynesse. A man may haue iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to kéepe or change any place, but neuer to yelde or agrée vnto any euill and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing. It is not the flying from place to place only, but from the vngodly fashion of this worlde, vnto newnesse of life that can profite man and please God. So therefore vse all places as may helpe beste, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of your liues. And where as ye do sée Idolatry mainteined &amp; forced by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, fary not in that countrey, except God haue so there prouided for you that ye shall not be forced for feare of man to bowe vnto Baal, for to flatter &amp; please worldly powers, to heare or say the vngodly Masse. And if ye come forth of youre countrey for loue of youre pure religion, reste not but in suche places, as haue the riche blessings of sincere godly doctrine and discipline.</p>
            <p>If yée forsake your countrey for Christes cause, doe not leaue Christes Churche,

Gods blessings, grace, and chéerful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to please Christes enimies. When as God shall sende his messanger in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit &amp; power of Helias, then they that halte vpon both sides, shall bée sharply rebuked, they that be neyther hote nor colde shall bée cast vp, vomited and spued forthe, as moste vngodly and wicked. They that flatter Princes, and mock and persecute prophets and preachers, shall bée in daunger of fire from heauen to destroy them. The priests of Baal shall not escape the rage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stirred of zele in seing howe abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by them they haue of long time ben de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, &amp; God dishonored.

<pb facs="tcp:7290:64"/>
their faces that they haue forsaken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Gospell of Chryste, whiche is the power of God vnto saluation of all that do beléeue, and required &amp; taken the masse whiche is the author and maker of sedition &amp; murder of mens soules, then shal ye heare and see that there is no way to escape the wrath and vengeance of God, but by flée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now from this frowarde and peruerse generation, vnto that sauing health whiche God in Christe, by the light &amp; ministerie of the Gospel doth shew, send &amp; offer to you.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7290:65"/>
Abraham did, so shall ye be strong in faith, and take and kéepe the right way eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the ende. For thou shalt see, finde and féele in leauing or loosing any thing, to take and beare the crosse of Christ, manifold recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence héere, and in the worlde to come lyfe euerlasting: and paynful death vpon earth, spéedy passage vnto the ioyes of heauen: in close prison and bonds of the body, libertie of conscience to solace the minde in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie meditation, and in expulsion or fléeing from kindred and countrie, entrance into a christen congregation, garnished with all godlinesse belonging vnto Christes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And for the loue and desire to sée and enioy the restitution and aduauncement of this kingdome rather than of any worldy wealth, vain glory, or tyrannous emperie, do not woorke or wish vengeaunce vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, least that it fall vppon your selues, or else least that of Chryst your earnest zeles be reproued, for that ye do not well knowe your owne minde and spirite: but lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably looking vpon the scattered flocke, crie and cal vnto the father of mercie and pitie, that as the Lorde of the haruest, he woulde send forth labourers, faithful pastors, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
