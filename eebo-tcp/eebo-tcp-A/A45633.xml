            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NOTHING could be more indirect and illegal, than the Expulſion of Mr. <hi>Colmar,</hi> except perhaps thoſe Arts which have been made uſe of to defend it. The greateſt Injuſtice will appear to be ſupported by no leſs Subornation; and the Evidence that was defective here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, hath not more criminally been omitted in the Tryal, than it hath been ſupply'd after it. At the hearing before the Vice-Chancellor, upon the Tryal it-ſelf, in the Commiſſion of Appeal, and laſtly in the Viſitation; It is own'd and confeſs'd, that there was no legal Proof againſt Mr. <hi>Colmar,</hi> but afterwards when there was room and leiſure for Artifice and Forgery, ſome Oaths are ſaid to be obtain'd; and He that was ſentenc'd upon Surmiſes, is libell'd by Affidavits. If the Reports, mention'd in thoſe Pamphlets, were admitted to be true, and the Evidence clear and authentick; yet the Oaths being taken long after the Tryal, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affect the Cauſe; and tho they may aſperſe the pretended Criminal, yet can they neither juſtifie the Sentence, nor bar the Appeal, nor acquit the Judge.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96582:3"/>
            <p>To publiſh the plain and direct Proofs, the occaſion'd a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, is the proper and regular Method of maintaining and vindicating it; but new Depoſitions ſubſequent to the Tryal, and never produc'd in it, prove nothing but the diſingenuous Malice of the Adverſary, and the weakneſs of the Cauſe. However it will not be an eaſier Task to prove the impertinence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency of thoſe Accuſations, than the falſity of them too. The Witneſſes are ſo ſcandalous, the Depoſitions are ſo incoherent, the Proofs that confront them are ſo ſtrong, the Credit of the Suborner is ſo notorious; and in ſhort, the whole Method of the Contrivance will be ſo plainly detected, that none can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on by theſe Arts but ſuch whom their own Prejudices have made willing to be deceiv'd: For indeed we have happily to do with thoſe Enemies, whoſe Deſigns, however miſchievous, are equally weak, and that Innocence which is injur'd hy their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, receives Protection from their Folly.</p>
            <p>While this Matter between Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colmar</hi> was tranſacted in a private College, and the reports of it were not likely to exceed thoſe Bounds; A publick Vindication of Mr. <hi>Colmar</hi> was needleſs in that place where the known Characters of the Accuſer, and of the Party accus'd alike prevented Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and ſupply'd an Apology. In that very College where the late Rector had by two Oaths been accus'd of Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; none of the Fellows, tho obliged by Oath to the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſuch a Crime, if true, ever charg'd Mr. <hi>Colmar;</hi> and in that Univerſity where the Rector after one Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had been cenſur'd anew for notorious Hereſie. Mr. <hi>Colmar</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96582:3"/>had within the ſpace of two Years receiv'd two Degrees, and with them neceſſarily a publick Approbation, as well of his Morals as his Ability. Thus far therefore the Scandals, while bounded within this Sphere, loſt their Venom and Force, and had no other effect than to ſhow the known falſity of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But now when Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> (who always wiſely appeals from thoſe Judges that know him) hath thought fit to expoſe theſe Scandals on a wider Stage, and hath endeavour'd by three printed Libels publickly to ſupport the Charge of Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi> Incontinence; He is concern'd to undeceive that happy part of the World, who are yet unacquainted with Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> and his Veracity.</p>
            <p>The falſity therefore of the whole Charge ſhall be ſhewn, and after the Proof of the Grievance, it will be an eaſie Task to ſhew the Juſtice of the Appeal. The little Objections that have been ſtarted in Law againſt it, ſhall be conſider'd; and when it ſhall appear, than an Appeal is not more warranted by Reaſon, than by the Rules of Common, Canon and Civil Law, and by the conſtant Practice of all Colleges, he muſt ſtill think that this his Act was as juſtifiable in it ſelf, as in the Conſequences of it, Meritorious. For ſince upon his Appeal, My Lord of <hi>Exeter</hi> was occaſionally induced to know the many other Oppreſſions and Enormities in the College, and at laſt by a general Viſitation hath happily reform'd them; He cannot but amidſt theſe publick Calumnies be ſatisfied however, That at the hazard of his own Reputation, he hath in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in a lower Sphere contributed to the freeing his own
<pb facs="tcp:96582:4"/>private College from Incontinence, Bribery and Oppreſſion, and the whole Univerſity from Hereſie and Socinianiſm.</p>
            <p>What Aſſiſtance Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> us'd in thoſe three Pamphlets, and what Author concurr'd with him therein, Mr. <hi>Colmar</hi> thinks is not worth while to enquire: The Matter was certainly taken from the Doctor himſelf; The Stile and Argument are ſuch as ſeem to come from the ſame Hand, and therefore the ſafeſt way is to give him the Honour of thoſe Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which he perhaps will not diſavow, and which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Contradiction, no body elſe will Challenge.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF Mr. <hi>James Colmer,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Charge againſt Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> is ſo heavy, and the Proofs of it in appearance ſo ſtrong, That many who were unacquainted with the Art and Method of the Subornation were ſo ſevere as to imagine, That during his Acquaintaince with Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi> he had learn'd to copy out his Pattern, and to reduce his avow'd Principles into Practice. He finds himſelf therefore under a double neceſſity both of clearing himſelf from thoſe groundleſs Scandals, which the late Rectors Malice had of late invented; and from thoſe <hi>more juſt</hi> Suſpitions, to which the ſame Mans former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with him had expos'd him. In the mean time He is not inſenſible that an eaſie Belief is naturally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for all <hi>Slanders;</hi> That the Impreſſions which they generally make, are deep; That the <hi>Proof</hi> of a <hi>Negative,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96582:5"/>and the Diſcovery of a <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>indirect Contrivance</hi> is difficult; and therefore if the Evidence, which ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be produc'd in his Favour, were not very plain and direct, He could not hope to overcome thoſe ſettled and <hi>laſting Prejudices.</hi> Whoever is accus'd, is juſtly in <hi>all Laws</hi> entitled to favourable <hi>Preſumptions</hi> and <hi>Allowances;</hi> Thoſe Advantages as the <hi>Guard</hi> and <hi>Refuge</hi> of Innocence, have always been countenanc'd and admitted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>Informer</hi> was Scandalous, the Information, tho it could not be confuted, found little Credit; if the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> were perjur'd, the Teſtimony, however true perhaps in it ſelf, was diſallow'd; if they had been tamper'd with, and <hi>brib'd</hi> into Evidence, the falſity of the Depoſition was ſuppos'd; if the <hi>Affidavits</hi> of the ſame Perſons were <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> to each other, both of them have been juſtly rejected: And laſtly, Some Teſtimonies, however direct and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, have been diſcredited nevertheleſs barely upon the <hi>improbability of Circumſtances,</hi> and <hi>over-ballanc'd</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the <hi>known Reputation of</hi> the Party accus'd. Now in this Caſe tho every one of theſe Methods hath ſometimes refuted an Accuſation, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> hath the concurrent Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them <hi>all;</hi> his Defence therefore ſhall conſiſt of all thoſe Heads, by which it is poſſible to diſprove a Calumny, and firſt.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The Credit of the Informer, and Perjury of the Witneſſes ſhall be examin'd.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>The indirect Practices, by which the Evidence was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſhall be expos'd.</hi>
               </item>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96582:5"/>
               <item>3. <hi>The know Reputation of the Party accus'd, ſhall be fully made out and clear'd.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>The falſity and improbability of the Depoſitions themſelves ſhall be prov'd.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And when upon inquiry it ſhall appear, that an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a Creditable Perſon, falſe and incoherent in it ſelf, hath been obtaind by ill means, publiſh'd by a bad Man, and vouch'd by ſcandalous Witneſſes; Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> doubts not that this Libel againſt him will in all Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mens Opinion be thought as ill grounded as the Sentence.</p>
            <p>It might be expected now, that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> ſhould give here an account of the Tryal, and diſtinguiſh the new and ſupplemental Teſtimonies from thoſe which occaſion'd the Sentence: Upon that view it would be eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the riſe, progreſs, decay, and growth of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; how before the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> (a proper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge) it was <hi>unprepar'd, trivial</hi> and <hi>incoherent;</hi> before the <hi>Rector</hi> himſelf where <hi>no Oath</hi> could be given, and where the Parties never appear'd, it was ſomewhat further <hi>advanc'd</hi> and <hi>improv'd;</hi> before the <hi>Viſitor</hi> and his <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> where Oaths might have been tender'd, and legal Examination of the Teſtimonies might have been obtain'd, it <hi>fell</hi> and wholly <hi>diſappear'd;</hi> but now at laſt when Judicial Proceedings were at an end, and Witneſſes could never be confronted, it is <hi>reviv'd, dreſs'd up,</hi> and <hi>augmented.</hi> This indeed would be a neceſſary Task as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96582:6"/>well in reſpect of the <hi>Viſitor</hi> as of the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> but it is already anticipated in the <hi>Account of the Proceedings of the Biſhop of</hi> Exeter, which is ſo <hi>full</hi> in that Panticular, that it is not capable of addition, and ſo late, that it needs not be repeated. The faithfulneſs of that Relation is ſo exact, that it will evidently appear, that no one Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of it, however immaterial after all the repeated Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the <hi>Criminals,</hi> hath yet been refuted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon a Compariſon of it with theſe Pamphlets, eſpecially the laſt, it will not be hard to obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Dates of the Evidence, and in ſome meaſure to diſcover the whole Method of the Subornation: By that means the Injuſtice of the Sentence will be detected; but it is my farther concern at preſent to ſhow the falſity of the Libel.</p>

               <head>1. Concerning the Credit of the <hi>Informer,</hi> and the Perjury of the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> could wiſh that his own Vindication did not ſo far depend on the Proof of others Crimes, that he might act on the defenſive only, and clear himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeaching others. But when a Calumny is to be diſprov'd, it is neceſſary for Men to know the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter in this Caſe a true repreſentation of ill Men is not ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Malice, but Prudence; nor is a <hi>Recrimination,</hi> but a neceſſary <hi>Defence.</hi> As to the <hi>Informer</hi> then, Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96582:6"/>it is not to be deny'd, I ſuppoſe, that he was upon two expreſs and direct Depoſitions judicially accus'd of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence with his Servant; and that he was ſo conſcious of his Guilt in that, as well as other Particulars, that upon that account only he demurr'd to the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of a <hi>known</hi> and <hi>lawful Judge,</hi> becauſe he could not anſwer to the <hi>Charge</hi> before him. The <hi>Affidavits</hi> that were taken in the <hi>Viſitation,</hi> are here annex'd; The Exceptions againſt them ſhall be elſewhere clear'd and refuted; and upon the peruſal of the whole, it will be evident that the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fornication was not ſo much heretofore the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> Province, as the Practice of Adultery. Tho this Teſtimony voluntarily made by the Party her-ſelf upon Oath, be very ſtrong and convincing, tho the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Tokens which attend and confirm the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, be plain and undeniable; yet ought the <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> to have leſs weight, if he had formerly been free from the <hi>imputation</hi> of ſuch <hi>Immoralities.</hi> Much undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is to be allow'd to the Credit of the Perſon accus'd, and a tenderneſs is to be us'd in receiving, and in report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Accuſation; but when, as by the <hi>following Oath,</hi> he appears to have been always <hi>reputed</hi> a <hi>notorious Adulterer;</hi> when his Principles are ſuch as ſecond thoſe Reports, he cannot juſtly expect that Favour to which another Man of a different <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> might be deſervedly entitled.</p>
               <p>He may remember, I preſume, how oft in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own Relations, and before Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> he hath declared, That the Word <hi>Fornication</hi> in the Bible was <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96582:7"/>and that nothing was forbidden by that Name but <hi>Idolatry</hi> and running after <hi>ſtrange Gods.</hi> He hath always expreſſed ſo great a tenderneſs for Husbands or Wives in the Caſe of Coldneſs, that the Latitude which he allow'd them therein, would in the Language of all other <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> be properly term'd the <hi>groſſeſt Adultery.</hi> He having often declar'd, that there was an Obligation in Juſtice to allow another to anſwer the ſame Expectation, which he could not ſatisfie himſelf. Other Expreſſions are not out of reſpect to him, but out of decency omitted, as being too groſs to bear Repetition. To repeat his other Crimes, his <hi>Hereſie, Bribery</hi> and <hi>Extortion,</hi> were to give the Hiſtory of his Life; but what is moſt to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, his particular Talent in <hi>Champerty</hi> and <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> his Intrigues with Witneſſes, and his artificial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Evidence, need not be nicely inſiſted on here, as being this laſt Term ſufficiently diſcover'd and expos'd in <hi>Chancery.</hi> This is the <hi>Accuſer</hi> that promoted and carried on an Information of Incontinence, and the Inſtruments by which he compaſs'd his Deſigns, are of the ſame make and ſize. The whole material Evidence proceeds originally from <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> and <hi>Anne Aris,</hi> and is reſolv'd into the Credit of their Teſtimony, ſo that if their Oaths can have little <hi>weight,</hi> the traditional reports, however authentically deriv'd from them, muſt have <hi>leſs.</hi> As to <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> then, you may take her true Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter from Dr. <hi>Bury's</hi> own pen, who thus with his uſual Elegance, and with more than ordinary Truth in one of his <hi>Papers</hi> deſcribes her.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96582:7"/>
               <p>Anne <hi>was known to be ſcarce half-witted, and the Proverb which ſaith,</hi> Children and Fools ſpeak Truth, <hi>is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of what they ſpeak of their own Accord; but when they are in other Folks Conduct, then they ſpeak as they are prompted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here the main Witneſs on whoſe looſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was expell'd; upon whoſe Teſtimony the Sentence is ſupported, is own'd and confeſs'd to be a Fool, Half-witted, very pliable to a Suborner, and eaſie to be drawn into Perjury. The other Witneſs <hi>Anne Aris</hi> was one that was expell'd the College by the late Rector; One that had caus'd the Expulſion of one Man, for this ſame Act of which ſhe now accuſes another: One that at her Delivery, and ever ſince had ſolemnly vow'd that <hi>Smith</hi> only was the Father of the Child, which now at the Rectors requeſt after more than a Years diſtance from the Death of it, ſhe charges on Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> Theſe are the two Witneſſes, who having before given contradictory Evidence, do at the ſame time ſwear Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> Guilty, and themſelves once for-ſworn, and upon each of theſe ſingly depends a <hi>Conviction,</hi> and an <hi>Expulſion.</hi> If a Man would look back then on the Informer, and conſider the main Witneſſes, and the nature of the Cauſe, he could not reaſonably expect much Truth from any of them, but if he will look forward on the groſs, and apparent falſity of the Evidence it ſelf; he will find it ſuch, as not only <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi> but <hi>exceeds</hi> his Expectation.</p>

               <head>Of the Indirect <hi>Practices</hi> by which the <hi>Evidence</hi> was obtain'd.</head>
               <p>The Servants of <hi>Exeter</hi> College purchaſe their Places at no eaſie Rate, and hold them upon very hard Terms: Some of 'em upon their Entrance were forc'd to furniſh the late Rector with Mony; others that could not purchaſe the ſame way, were oblig'd under the Penalty of a Forfeiture to ſupply him with Affidavits. When Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> then had juſtly oppos'd the Rector in the Election of Mr. <hi>Kingston;</hi> the Rector did upon that account declare that he would deny Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> his Degree, and by Conſequence compaſs his Expulſion: This his reſolution he communicated to his Daughters in <hi>Devon-ſhire,</hi> and the Perſons are therefore named, becauſe Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> hath been pleas'd to deny the Matter of Fact.</p>
               <p>Now in revenge of this Affront, and in purſuance of his Deſign he privately in his Cloſet perſwades <hi>Smith</hi> (one of his Dependants) to accuſe Mr. <hi>Colmer:</hi> There <hi>Smith</hi> (as by the Rectors own Confeſſion ſince appears) was threatned, till he wept, was frightned with the loſs of his Place, and the ruin of his Wife and his Family; and yet could by no proſpect either of Reward or puniſhment be brib'd or terrified into Perjury. <hi>Thomaſin Smith</hi> was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Witneſs, which the Rector labour'd to gain; and ſhe tho much tempted, was ſo far from confirming the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Charge, that ſhe repeated <hi>Anne Sparrows</hi> Words; and wholly clear'd and acquitted Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> And it is to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96582:8"/>noted, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Thomaſin</hi> have ſworn in the <hi>Vice-Chancellors Court</hi> in the Cauſe between <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Crab,</hi> expreſly contrary to what they are ſaid to confeſs in the late <hi>Caſe.</hi> This then was thought no Evidence before the <hi>Vice-Chancellor;</hi> but when Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> had adviſedly made himſelf Judge of the Cauſe; Equivocal Expreſſions were not only put to a ſtrein'd and foreign Interpretation, but were crodited againſt the direct Oaths that were offer'd by the Authors of them. And tho doubtful Words from theſe two Perſons, ill conſtrued, and worſe atteſted were admitted as Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> yet the <hi>Affidavits</hi> tender'd by the ſame Perſons at the <hi>Tryal</hi> in his behalf were ſuſpected, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd: Thus the <hi>Tryal</hi> went on, and the Sentence paſs'd; but the Injuſtice of it was ſo viſible, and the ſcandal ſo great, that even the <hi>Rector</hi> himſelf without additional Evidence, could not ſupport the Infamy of it. When therefore his firſt Witneſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſtubborn and inflexible <hi>Honeſty,</hi> could by no Threats or Arguments be induc'd to ſwear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Directions, nor to juſtifie his late Sentence; His next effort was made upon the pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, half-witted <hi>Anne Sparrow,</hi> who according to his own Character of her was exactly fitted to <hi>receive</hi> any <hi>Oath,</hi> and to <hi>vouch</hi> it. Sir <hi>Kingſton</hi> then a known Agent of the <hi>Rector,</hi> and equally concern'd to be an Enemy of Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> goes to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96582:9"/>the Wench at <hi>London;</hi> and (as appears by <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit</hi>) perſwades her to charge Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> with an Offence, of which ſhe had before upon Oath once, and before credible Witneſſes oftentimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted him. The <hi>Oath</hi> then that was ready for her, was eaſily digeſted: She ſwore indeed that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was concern'd with her; but it appears upon Oath that ſhe immediately afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to <hi>Anne Pierce,</hi> That ſhe ſwore only what Mr. <hi>Kingſton</hi> bad her. So that here a weak, ſilly and ſcandalous <hi>Wench,</hi> who was firſt tempted by <hi>Eliz. Roberts,</hi> and afterwards by Mr. <hi>Kingſton</hi> to accuſe an innocent Perſon, aſſoon as out of their Cuſtody, diſavows the Accuſation, acquits the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſcovers the Suborners: And when this Creature repeated in <hi>Oxford</hi> the like Oaths which ſhe made at <hi>London,</hi> it is obſervable, that tho ſhe had been known to be about the Town from <hi>January</hi> to <hi>June,</hi> yet ſhe was never examin'd till upon the return of Mr. <hi>Kingſton</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> ſhe was again under the ſame Perſons management, and more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the Influences of the <hi>Rector;</hi> and therefore it is eaſie to imagine the Reaſon, why ſuch a ſenſeleſs proſtitute <hi>Strumpet</hi> was immediatly after all theſe Crimes and Perjuries entertain'd for three Weeks together by the late <hi>Rector</hi> in his Lodgings; and why, upon the taking that Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing however materially ſaid by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96582:9"/>was inſerted into the Oath, which was not approv'd by Dr. <hi>Bury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there was a double Expulſion to be carried on, and therefore two Baſtards at leaſt to be found, and Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was to be intitled to them both. <hi>Anne Aris</hi> then Daughter to a Servant of the College, who had been long ſince expell'd, was now thought by the <hi>Rector</hi> a Perſon fit to be recall'd, examin'd and corrupted: Above a Year had now paſs'd ſince her Delivery; <hi>Smith</hi> had been accus'd by her as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Child, and was upon that Account already expell'd; yet now at this diſtance of time, ſhe is tempted to diſavow what it her Pains ſhe had ſolemnly declar'd; and to charge a new Man, Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> Her Mother <hi>Buckland</hi> had a dependance on the <hi>Rector,</hi> and had been as to her Employment in the College, for her ill Manners particularly diſobligd by Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> and upon his deſire, turn'd off by his Friends. And therefore it is not very probable, that a Man under Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Circumſtances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accus'd of, and expell'd for Incontinence, would have exaſperated this Woman, and turn'd her out of a conſiderable part of her Imployment, if he had been conſcious, as ſhe pretends, that ſhe could charge him with ſuch a <hi>Crime,</hi> and had ever been privy to any laſcivious <hi>Intrigues.</hi> This Woman then having been long and often diſcours'd by Dr.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96582:10"/>
                  <hi>Bury</hi> in his Dining-Room, at laſt revenges her ſelf on Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> ſecures her Intereſt with the Doctor, and tempts and perſwades her Daughter to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear her former Accuſation; and upon his Exigence to ſupply the late <hi>Rector</hi> with an <hi>Affidavit.</hi> The Wench then retracts what ſhe had before teſtifi'd; and upon theſe <hi>Motives,</hi> and upon theſe <hi>Inſtigations,</hi> accuſes Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> but immediately afterwards, (as <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi> had done before) She of her own accord proteſts againſt her own falſe Evidence, weeps at the mention of it; and (as appears by Oath) owns, that this <hi>Story</hi> was put into her Head, and that ſhe was <hi>inveigled</hi> to accuſe him. Theſe are the two Witneſſes, on whoſe Credit the whole Charge depends; and theſe are the Methods by which the Evidence was obtain'd; Such Agents were ſingled out as were known Dependents of Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi> and avow'd Enemies of Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> ſuch Witneſſes were choſen as confeſſedly had little claim to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and leſs to Honeſty; and yet Truth is ſo prevalent, and Perjury ſo hard to be conceal'd, that even theſe Witneſſes, under this Management, voluntarily diſcover'd the Contrivance, and became Witneſſes of that Subornation to which they were Parties.</p>

               <p>This Head might poſſibly be accus'd as <hi>vain,</hi> if the Malice of Mr. <hi>Colmers</hi> Adverſaries had not made it neceſſary. In one of the late <hi>Libels</hi> he hath been tax'd as a Perſon formerly guilty of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,</hi> tho upon enquiry it will appear that thoſe Accuſations are equally groundleſs, and far leſs plauſible than the preſent Charge. He was firſt elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> College from <hi>Exeter,</hi> and was thence elected Fellow by thoſe of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Teſtimonials which he lately has receiv'd from all the Fellows of that College, then and now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, ſufficiently ſhew what Opinion they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had, and ſtill retain of his <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi> amongſt them. The late concern of the Fellows of <hi>Exeter</hi> in his behalf, the diſmiſſion of the Cauſe by the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> and the Receipt of the Appeal by the Right Reverend <hi>Viſitor</hi> will ſufficiently ſhew that he is diſreſpected by none there, but Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> and his Confederates. And above all the reſt, there cannot be a clearer Inſtance of the good Opinion of the whole <hi>Univerſity</hi> than that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction, his Degree in Phyſick with a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia Practicandi</hi> was lately granted to him, and by conſequence his <hi>Morals</hi> were upon that ſtrict enquiry,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96582:11"/>fully approv'd by the <hi>Univerſity</hi> in General, and by theſe of his own Profeſſion in particular. And therefore till Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> can equally approve himſelf to that Learned and Judicious <hi>Body,</hi> it is not to be doubted but that his <hi>Calumnies</hi> againſt him will be no more ſucceſsful in their effects, then they are true in themſelves.</p>

               <p>The Artifice that was us'd in gaining the <hi>Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits</hi> of theſe ſenſeleſs Witneſſes, is an indirect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod at leaſt of producing Truth; but is a very baſe and ſcandalous way of promoting Falſhood. Men that have any Credit themſelves, are wont to look into the repute of their Evidence, and not upon the extorted Oaths of any proſtitute Wretch to frame, and dreſs up an Information. However, ſince Teſtimonies of ſuch Perſons are here produc'd; It is incumbent upon Me not only as I ſafely may to deny the whole Charge; but to confute the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ſupports it. Now certainly the Oath of <hi>Anne Sparrow,</hi> that clears Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> will ballance the Oath of the ſame Perſon that charges him. If a <hi>Teſtis Vacillans</hi> is rejected in Law, much more a perjur'd Witneſs that ſwears counter to her ſelf, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96582:11"/>falſifies her own Depoſitions. If ſhe ſwore Truth before Alderman <hi>Fifield,</hi> Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> is acquitted; and if ſhe then ſwore falſe, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> can never afterwards upon her Teſtimony be juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.</p>
               <p>A contradictory Oath can mean nothing, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms a Crime, and denies it; it takes off its own Load, and therefore when there is no Charge remaining, all Laws allow an Acquittal. If <hi>Aris</hi> had only to do with <hi>Smith,</hi> as ſhe ſwore at her Delivery Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> cannot be joynt Father of the Child, as at ſo great a diſtance ſhe atteſted. The Queſtion only then is which <hi>Anne Aris</hi> is to belive'd, whether ſhe in her Pains, and in all probability at no great diſtance from Death, or whether we muſt credit her ſixteen Months afterwards purſuing her Mothers Revenge, and acted by the Influence of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi> For the Indemnity of a Pariſh indeed great Liberties are and ought to be allow'd, and that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will charge a putative Father before a Juſtice, that will not in the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> convict an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer. And in this Caſe not only a Mans Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies at Stake, but his Civil Intereſt is in danger; Continence is the <hi>Condition</hi> of his <hi>Free-hold,</hi> and therefore ſlight and trivial Proofs, much leſs none, ought not to diveſt him of it. It being clear then, that the Witneſſes have ſworn againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96582:12"/>Mr. <hi>Colmers</hi> Innocence is juſtified by the ſame <hi>Affidavits</hi> by which it is pretended to be impeach'd. However it is neceſſary to purſue the Evidence, and to diſcover probably therein no Footſteps of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, but very viſible Marks of Subornation: For ſince the <hi>Perjury</hi> of <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> is <hi>plain,</hi> and ſince it is probable that they were ſeduc'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled into contradictory Oaths, the only doubt that remains is on whom muſt fall the Guilt of ſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. The late <hi>Rector</hi> pretends to accuſe Mr. <hi>Maundrel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cleaveland,</hi> but nothing is brought to ſupport the Charge, but one of <hi>Anne Sparrow</hi>'s ſayings, and one of them too (ſuch as they are) we have againſt Mr. <hi>Kingſton.</hi> Now in ſuch a Perplexity as this is, when Men have deſignedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to promote Perjury; the things themſelves well weigh'd, the Circumſtances examin'd, and the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Perſons</hi> concern'd are in all probability the <hi>Guides</hi> that will let us into the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> then, and Mr. <hi>Maundrel</hi> both Maſters of Arts, and both in Orders, are Men of unſpotted and clear Reputation, and who are ready upon Oath to deny and diſavow the Charge. The late <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> (as the Court of Chancery well knows) is not unpractis'd in Evidencing; and his Aſſociate Mr. <hi>Kingſton</hi> is regiſtred in Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi>'s Diary, as one of his ſingular Friends and Companions. I ſhall not therefore much inſiſt on the Oaths of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96582:12"/>two Witneſſes that ſwear; that they were ſeduc'd and inviegl'd into the Accuſation of Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> tho even theſe too are wholly rely'd on by thoſe that want better Evidence: But I ſhall rely on the whole Management of the Deſing, which, if taken together and ſeen at one view, diſcovers <hi>it ſelf.</hi> The late Rector <hi>himſelf</hi> own'd, in the firſt Paper by him publiſh'd, that he Cloſeted the meaneſt Servants of his College; that he beat them out of <hi>their Sayings;</hi> that he <hi>labour'd</hi> for Oaths, and laſtly that he turn'd one of them out of her Place, becauſe her Husband would not ſwear againſt Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> Did he not expel Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> afterwards, upon the conſtructive Evidence of <hi>Winks</hi> and <hi>Smiles,</hi> without one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſworn or unſworn of his own knowledg to any one concludent Circumſtance? And why ſhould we think this Evidence leſs true than the ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; or that a Man us'd leſs indirect practice in furniſhing out a <hi>Libel,</hi> than in dreſſing up an <hi>Accuſation?</hi> In ſhort then, a ſenſleſs Wench, who within the Year had liv'd privately with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in his Lodgings, was deliver'd of a Baſtard; and therefore for the <hi>Rector</hi>'s Reputation more than the <hi>College</hi>'s, it was neceſſary that a Father ſhould be procured for it. The pretended Affronts that he'had receiv'd, aggravated by the former Intimacy, inclin'd him to make choice of Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> What Arts he then made uſe of to gain Witneſſes, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96582:13"/>afterwards to expel him without any, is already known, and truly related; Since that time, when Mr. <hi>Colmar</hi> deſir'd nothing more, than an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of confronting thoſe Witneſſes (that were ſaid to ſwear againſt him) and of hearing their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; all Opportunities of ſo fair a Tryal, either before the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> the <hi>Viſitor,</hi> or his <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> have been deny'd him. If theſe Witneſſes had then appear'd, and the Teſtimony that is printed could not have been evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> muſt have ſubmitted to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and this had been a clear way of acquitting Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi> but a dangerous one too, and ſuch an one as might have opened the Contrivance. The ſafeſt Method then was not to print the Evidence taken at the Tryal (for there was none, or ſuch as amounted to nothing), but to publiſh ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental Affidavits, falſe in themſelves, <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>ſecretly</hi> obtain'd, and which poſſibly with ſome Men might be thought the <hi>grounds</hi> of the Sentence, tho in truth they were taken long after it.</p>
               <p>I have examined however even thoſe ſurreptitious Depoſitions, moſt of them have been prov'd falſe already, and the reſt are of the ſame ſtamp. <hi>Alice Gigger</hi> boaſts in Print, that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> offer'd to maintain her as a Gentlewoman, if ſhe would ride with him to <hi>Hinkſey;</hi> but that ſhe refus'd his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96582:13"/>If this Oath had been as <hi>moſt</hi> of the reſt, <hi>without Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> it might have been better ſecur'd from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Confutation. But now ſince this <hi>Alice Gigger</hi> hath unadviſedly venturd upon two Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that were deſign'd, if true, to make the Information credible, they muſt equally, if notoriouſly falſe, diſprove her Depoſition. The place where Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Horſe is ſaid to ſtand, was Mr. <hi>Crowder</hi>'s in <hi>Holy-Well;</hi> but it is proved upon Oath, that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> had no Horſe there, and conſequently, that the Affidavit is groundleſs. The Wench farther ſwears, That ſhe received a Letter from her Brother, by which ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not to accuſe Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> but the ſame Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwears that ſhe muſt <hi>then</hi> receive that from him which he never ſent; that he is wholly a Stranger to the Contents of it, and never was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to write, nor ever actually did write any thing concerning Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> As to the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Lawrence</hi> of a Violence in vain offer'd her ſeven Years ſince: Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> own'd at the meeting, and ſince, that the ſaid <hi>Lawrence</hi> refus'd to accuſe Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> but upon condition ſhe ſhould not be produc'd to teſtifie it to his <hi>face.</hi> The Perſon to whom ſhe was ſaid to complain of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Rudeneſs was her <hi>Dame,</hi> (who was preſent, and diſownd it) but in her <hi>Aſſidavit</hi> 'tis the <hi>Dames</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96582:14"/>(who hath been dead about ſix Years). Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the place where this Depoſition was taken, renders it ſuſpicious (as appears by what's already ſaid), eſpecially ſince the Witneſs declin'd Swearing in the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi>'s Court afterward, where ſhe might have been Counter-examin'd. <hi>Freek</hi> and <hi>Claſe</hi> teſtifie from <hi>Ann Aris;</hi> that ſhe always utterly refus'd Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s rude Offers: But ſhe ſwears, That before that time ſhe had comply'd with them. The <hi>whole Charge</hi> then being thus clearly anſwer'd, I ſhall trouble the Reader but with one Obſervation more, which may be now at laſt unneceſſary perhaps, but is not otherwiſe immaterial: When the Rectour at the Tryal endeavour'd to procure Witneſſes; <hi>Joyce Aris,</hi> who had been expell'd the College for Lying, eaſily comply'd with his requeſt, and was brought as one of his main Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> Trivial Paſſages and Speeches of <hi>Ann Sparrow,</hi> ſhe at that time repeats, and is very earneſt and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent (as far as her Capacity ſerved) in accuſing him, but mentions nothing in the mean time of the plain and groſs Incontinence of Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> to which, ſome Months afterwards, ſhe ſwears her ſelf privy. Now <hi>ſince</hi> here was no kindneſs for Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> (for ſhe was now a voluntary and warm Witneſs againſt him) <hi>ſince</hi> there could be no danger to any other Party by the Diſcovery (for the Offence of the Woman was <hi>known,</hi> the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96582:14"/>Child <hi>dead,</hi> and the pretended Adulterer <hi>expell'd;</hi>) can any reaſon be aſſign'd, why a paſſionate Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould inſiſt upon, and urge, and improve an idle frivolous Story againſt a pretended Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and omit a plain and direct Proof of his Guilt; to which ſhe now pretends <hi>before that time</hi> to have been conſcious. It is clear then that ſhe was ignorant of any ſuch Crime <hi>now,</hi> but was in time taught to <hi>know backwards,</hi> and to <hi>antedate</hi> that Oath which ſhe afterwards <hi>learnt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what more in ſuch a Caſe can be hop'd for, to clear an <hi>innocent Perſon</hi> from the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Slanders of a revengeful Libeller? The Perſon accus'd a Man of <hi>known Reputation,</hi> the <hi>Informer</hi> and <hi>Agents infamous;</hi> ſome of the Witneſſes <hi>disoblig</hi>'d and <hi>malicious;</hi> another <hi>ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> and <hi>half witted;</hi> all contradicting themſelves and <hi>evidently forſworn; Threats</hi> uſed to frighten others into the like <hi>Information; Places</hi> taken away from thoſe that declin'd the <hi>Perjury;</hi> no Oath judicially taken, but all in the abſence of the Party, after the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>ſurreptitiouſly</hi> obtain'd; the whole Contrivance manag'd by a Man of <hi>known Incontinence</hi> upon his own account, for diſcharging himſelf of a groſs and notorious Crime, and carried on by the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted Oaths</hi> of his own proſtitute <hi>Servants, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and <hi>Dependents.</hi>

If he had been guilty of the Crime, he would never, upon an Appeal, have enhanc'd his own Puniſhment, ſince it is plain, that upon proof of the Charge, the Loſs would have been no <hi>leſs,</hi> and the Ignominy much <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> He hath deſired nothing hitherto but a Tryal, and would willingly have ſubmitted to the deciſion of any <hi>Judge,</hi> but ſuch an one who is likewiſe a <hi>Witneſs</hi> and <hi>Accuſer,</hi> and who purſu'd his own <hi>Intereſt</hi> as well as <hi>Revenge</hi> in his Conviction.

In this Caſe there neither is, nor never was any Diſpute, but that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> is within the reach of the Local Statutes of the College, and ſubject to Expulſion; but the Queſtion is only whether he was lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convict of Incontinence according to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Appointment of the Statute: and whether after ſuch Conviction, he had liberty of appeal.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons that are given againſt Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>'s Liberty of Appealing are three.

               <p>A Fellowſhip fell void in <hi>Exeter</hi> College in <hi>Oxon,</hi> to which none were intituled but ſuch as were born within the Dioceſs of <hi>Sarum:</hi> One <hi>Hide</hi> that ſtood Candidate for the place with <hi>Goddard,</hi> procur'd a falſe Certificate from a <hi>ſenſeleſs half-witted</hi> Midwife, purporting that <hi>Goddard</hi> was born at <hi>Eaſtwoodhay</hi> within the Dioceſs of <hi>Winton.</hi> The Rector upon this falſe Certificate declar'd <hi>Goddard</hi> incapable, and <hi>Hyde</hi> choſen, and expell'd ten of the Fellows who gave their Voices for the Election of <hi>Goddard.</hi> The Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon this grievance <hi>Appeal</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> their Viſitor, and upon enquiry it appear'd that the Certificate was <hi>falſe,</hi> and the <hi>expell'd</hi> Fellows were by his Sentence juſtly <hi>reſtor'd.</hi> Afterwards upon an Information above, the Matter was further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, the Parties that were Inſtrumental in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſe Certificate were fin'd, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor receiv'd a publick reprehenſion for giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the Certificate, and for expelling the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. 'Tis here clear that the Fellows appeal'd from an unjuſt Sentence of the Rector, and 'tis as evident that without liberty of <hi>Appealing</hi> there muſt in this, as in many other Caſes, a way have been open'd to the greateſt and moſt unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:96582:18"/>
               <p>And therefore in all other Colleges where the Viſitor is ſubject to like or greater Reſtrictions, and the Fellows are under Obligations of the ſame: Oath, all <hi>other</hi> Appeals have always been diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, and thoſe to the Viſitor always admitted. In the Statutes of <hi>Corp. Ch. Coll. Trin. Coll.</hi> and <hi>All-Souls</hi> Statutes the Oaths are as ſtrong, the Viſitor as to this reſpect is as much reſtraind, and yet Appeals have ſtill been as frequent as Grievances.</p>
               <p>Now when Appeals always in all Colleges, and particularly in <hi>Exeter,</hi> have been made to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, we may reflect on the knowledge of a Man who childiſhly declaims upon Deſuetude, and hath wrote out part of a Common Place Book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of <hi>Non-uſer.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. If Cuſtom then, and ſubſequent uſage can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain a Statute; the Oath of the Fellow doth not bar the Appeal to the Viſitor. The Oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly hath its force, and fecures the College from any Suit at Law; or any diſturbance from abroad, but never was intended to bar the Members of it from a Recourſe to the <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Conſervator</hi> of the College.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96582:18"/>
               <p>All thoſe Applications <hi>ad Praelatos, Proceres, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnates,</hi> which are expreſly forbidden, explain the general Words, and put a reſtriction upon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. A Viſitor who is the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of the Founder, is entruſted with the Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the College, and an <hi>Appeal</hi> to him is the proper Method of preſerving the Peace of it, and of <hi>redreſſing</hi> the private Grievances, not of <hi>promoting</hi> them. The <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> that allow great Liberties of Appealing, even after Renunciation, except ſometimes the Caſe of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries</hi> and <hi>Religious Societies.</hi> But even <hi>there</hi> an Appeall to the <hi>Supreme Abbot,</hi> or to the <hi>Principal of the Order,</hi> was never diſputed, but eſteemed no other than it really is, a private recourſe to a <hi>proper</hi> and to a <hi>domeſtick Forum.</hi> Now then, <hi>univerſal Authority</hi> is lodg'd in the Viſitor by Statute, and is caſt upon him by <hi>Law:</hi> And it is abſurd to imagin, that an Oath of a Fellow in <hi>general</hi> Words, either can or was ever deſign'd to diveſt him of that Power, without <hi>naming</hi> him. And therefore, after the Practice of all Colleges, thus plainly prov'd, which is a ſufficient <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the Senſe of the Statute, I inſiſt on this <hi>undeniable Argument,</hi> That if the Pounder had deſign'd to bar the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, he would in the particular; Recital which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96582:19"/>he there makes, that leaſt <hi>once</hi> have mention'd him; he would in the Statute about the Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Fellows, have inſerted <hi>Appellatione remotâ</hi> he would have been as expreſs in taking away the Viſitor's Authority, as he was in conferring it <hi>upon</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Author of the Caſe inſiſts, that the Rector ſhould have the ſame Allowances upon his Expulſion as the Fellows, and the like liberty of Appeal; if he would read the Statute, he might find, that the Rector <hi>wants</hi> not the ſame Right, that he hath an Appeal <hi>to</hi> the Viſitor; but neither they nor he have any <hi>from</hi> him. The Rector may be expell'd by the Biſhops Commiſſary; and then the Statutes ſufficiently warrant a farther recourſe to the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi> himſelf. For it is the whole Deſign and Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Statutes to have Members of the College concluded by no other Sentence than that of the Viſitor. And therefore when a Fellow is expell'd by the Rector, or the Rector by the Commiſſary, the Statute doth never bar an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal; becauſe <hi>one</hi> might be made to the Viſitor; but when the Rector is remov'd by the Viſtor himſelf, then, and <hi>then only</hi> is ſaid <hi>Ceſſantibus appellationis remediis.</hi> And therefore as it is very
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96582:19"/>plain that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> hath purſu'd the direction of the Statutes; ſo in Dr. <hi>Bury</hi>'s Appeal it is equally clear that he is guilty of Perjury by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Theſe are the <hi>Statutes</hi> that <hi>lead</hi> the <hi>Oath,</hi> and that beſt <hi>expound</hi> it. The <hi>Oath</hi> is deſign'd ſummarily to <hi>repeat</hi> what the Statutes at large <hi>explain.</hi> The <hi>local</hi> Laws are not <hi>enlarg'd</hi> by it, but <hi>enforc'd.</hi> The ſtricteſt Obligation to the <hi>Statutes</hi> ariſes from the <hi>Oath,</hi> and the beſt <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> is to be drawn from the <hi>Statutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this you may ſee the Weakneſs of <hi>Exeter Caſe,</hi> and the Falſhood of it is, I ſuppoſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready notorious. One thing more may be added; That whatever could not be <hi>provid</hi> by ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Oaths, is ſaid to be <hi>own'd</hi> by Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> and a bold aſſertion of a Lye ſupplies the want of Evidence. Every one of thoſe Conceſſions are diſallow'd, and might be eaſily diſprov'd, did I think, when their <hi>Affidavits</hi> are ſo<hi rend="sup">1</hi> falſe, any Credit would be given to their bare <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an incumbent Duty upon every honeſt Man to defend himſelf from Oppreſſion and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. The <hi>Appeal</hi> hath <hi>righted</hi> Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> from

                     <hi>Weeks</hi> then and now living in the Houſe with Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi> whom ſhe this Informant preſently awaked, and the ſaid <hi>Grace Weeks</hi> did ſeveral times ſtrike the ſaid Doctor, and forced him to leave the Bed for that time. And the next day Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> asked this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant very angryly why ſhe made ſuch a Busſle and waked <hi>Grace Weeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Informant further declares, That afterwards the ſaid Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> took away the Keys of the Doors betwixt the lodging Chamber of the Doctor, and the Room where this Informant and the ſaid <hi>Grace Weeks</hi> lodged; and ſeveral Nights after the ſaid Doctor came in his Shirt to this Informants Bed, and came into the Bed to her and the ſaid <hi>Grace Weeks,</hi> and to the beſt of her remembrance came in like manner to her Bed almoſt every Night during her ſtay in the Houſe, and was angry with her for not lying on that ſide of the Bed as he uſed to come to, as he had directed her; and when he was in Bed with this Informant, he bid her lie ſtill, and ſeveral times attempted her Chaſtity; and when no Perſon was in the Lodgings but the Doctor and this Informant, he called this Informant to him, and asked her ſeveral filthy Queſtions which ſhe will be ready to ſet forth when ſhe ſhall be called to prove the ſame.
