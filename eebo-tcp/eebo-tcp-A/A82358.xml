            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The <hi>EAST-INDIA</hi> Company's Anſwer to the Petition of <hi>John Jolliffe</hi> and <hi>Edmond Harriſon</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of themſelves and others.</head>
            <p>THE ſaid Company ſay, That they believe the Petitioners and others might ſend ſuch a Ship as they mention, on an Interloping Voyage to <hi>India,</hi> but know not to what Value the Cargo might amount, becauſe no part of it ever came into their hands or the hands of any of their Servants, to the Companies knowledge, though they have heard the Cargo was conſigned to one <hi>Boucher</hi> and others, whom the Company had put out of their Service for breach of their Truſt, who were Men of Expenſive Lives, took upon them to be Perſons under a Publick Character, and as ſuch, without any Commiſſion from His Majeſty aſſumed a Chargeable Equipage, and addreſſed themſelves to the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court to make a Treaty of Commerce, and procure a <hi>Phirmaund</hi> for the <hi>New Company,</hi> as they called the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers.</hi> By the charge of which Attempt and the weight of their own great Debts before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, they were reduced to ſuch Neceſſities, as diſabled them from making any returns of the ſaid Cargoe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Company have likewiſe been informed, That if the ſaid <hi>Boucher,</hi> and the reſt, had been in any condition to load the ſaid Ship with the returns of her Cargoe, ſhe might have come out of <hi>Surrat</hi> River while the Kings Ship <hi>Phoenix</hi> was on a Voyage to <hi>Muſcat,</hi> as well as after the <hi>Phoenix</hi> was come away for <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>China Merchant</hi> did.</p>
            <p>The Company have alſo been informed, That the Judges of Admiralty appointed by His Majeſty's Commiſſion, as well as by the Company, did according to their duty condemn the Ship <hi>Adventure,</hi> and make demand of her from the Governour of <hi>Surrat</hi> to the uſe of his Majeſty and the Company, but have not heard that ſhe was delivered by the ſaid Governour, nor any part of her Cargoe.</p>
            <p>The Company have further heard, That Captain <hi>Goodlad</hi> died of a Lingering Feaver, and that Mr. <hi>Pettit,</hi> one of the Petitioners Factors was taken in an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> built Ship by the <hi>Sangana</hi>'s (being Native Pyrates) his Ship blown up, and himſelf wounded, of which wounds he dyed on ſhoar in the <hi>Sangana</hi>'s Country. And Mr. <hi>Boucher</hi> their other principal Factor that had the whole Cargoe in Poſſeſſion, as the Company have heard was alive when the laſt Ship came from <hi>Surrat.</hi> VVhat the Petitioners mean by the ſcandalous ſuggeſtion of Poyſon or whom they ſuſpect, the Company do not underſtand, having never heard one word of any ſuch doubt or ſuſpicion from Interlopers or others before they ſaw it in the Petition.</p>
            <p>To the Charge of adviſing his Late Majeſty to ſend one of His Majeſties Ships of VVar to ſuppreſs the Interlopers of <hi>India,</hi> as he did to the <hi>African Coaſt</hi> to preſerve the Royal Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Intereſt from ſuch injurious Attempts: The Company think it is enough to ſay, It was their Duty Humbly to inform his Majeſty of the Diſeaſe, the Contagious Nature, the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Symptoms and Prognoſticks of it; His Majeſty's own greater VViſdom and Foreſight di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Remedies he found moſt neceſſary to conſerve the reputation of this Nation, and the Trades, Dominion, and Naval Power of this Kingdom in thoſe remote parts of the VVorld.</p>
