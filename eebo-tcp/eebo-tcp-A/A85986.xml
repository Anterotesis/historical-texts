         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Miniſters of his Word to inſtruct his Church, it's from
his Grace; that he doth intruſt Magiſtrates with his
Sword for the protection of his Church, it's for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Both Jewell and Caſe, mans Soul and Body were
framed by him, as God of Nature; both Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
were by his Sonne redeemed, as the God of all
Grace. Both the internall and externall man do need
his Spirit for the good of both: Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are called to Office,<note place="margin">Ezra 1.</note> and bleſſed therein, by the
ſame Spirit.<note place="margin">Ezra 2. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were joined of old in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

Churches wanted,<note place="margin">Zech. 3.</note> for a ſeaſon, the Magiſtrates help, yet
in due ſeaſon were they made partakers of that Royall
favour.<note place="margin">Zech. 4. 10.</note> They wanted them firſt, that Gods glory might
not, on miſtake, be given to man; they had them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that the ſame Glory might not be ſtill abuſed by
man. No ſooner did Antichriſt make incroachments
on Chriſts Miniſtry, but he uſurped as faſt on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy;
<pb facs="tcp:114747:3"/>
he ſwallowed up that,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 1, 7, 8. Rev. 13. 11, 12.</note> as the two horned
Beaſt, Eccleſiaſtically; and he ſubdued this, as the ten
horned Beaſt, Politically. Chriſt recovered both from
Antichriſtian Yoke in his great Reformation, as both
had been uſurped from him, by Antichriſtian defection.
When he took care to purifie his Church in its Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
he ſhewed no leſs care about the Magiſtracy. As
ſome of both ſorts have witneſſed for him in a ſackcloth
condition; ſo ſome of both ſorts ſhall witneſs of him
in a ſeaſonable aſcenſion.<note place="margin">Rev. 11. Jer. 3. 14, 15. Jer. 30. 21.</note> When he gives his people
Paſtors after his own heart, he gives them Rulers to
govern in his waies. Thus he acts by men after the
manner of men, becauſe he deals with men in the
things of God. The world is his great houſe that muſt
be well taught; but it's through ſinne, a diſcompoſed
houſe that needs a good Rule. Gods intereſt is ſuch
in faithfull Rulers, that Satan will be ſtill attempting
all means to blaſt their faithfulneſs; if he cannot keep
them from doing Gods work, he will uſe inſtruments
to marre that very work. Much of it appeared in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
experiences, and we ſee it too ſadly in theſe latter
daies. Good men ſhall be ſeduced to betray Gods
work, yea and perſwaded that it's Satans work. That
which the Lord doth tender with moſt zeal, Error will
perſwade to ſlight with moſt neglect: If God put much
ſtreſs on the firſt Table of his Law, Error will take it
off from the Magiſtrates care. What many other
parts have ſadly bewailed, we finde now much cauſe
to bemoan afreſh. That ſpirit that once diſturbed
<hi>Germany,</hi> is gotten too deeply into our bowels. Chriſts
Miniſters were firſt ſtruck at by that hand, which
reached the next blow to the Magiſtrates. Thoſe
Foxes and Wolves that would worry Chriſts Flock,
cannot bear good will to faithfull Shepherds. They
<pb facs="tcp:114747:4"/>
would firſt debauch the ſpirits of men, and then their
bodies will be ſurely theirs. The Miniſters firſt ſhall
be Antichriſtian,<note place="margin">Sisidan. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Bullinger. Cloppenburg. Guy de Breſ.</note> and the Magiſtrates ſhall bear that
title next. <hi>Munſter</hi> had once many fair warnings,
but the things of their peace were hid from their
eyes. If we gain wiſdom by our neighbours harm,
it's a mercy of the choiceſt kinde. That good hand
of heaven that brought Your Honours into this
wilderneſs, hath much to do here for you, and by
you. <hi>Iſraels</hi> condition in their wilderneſs, is a moſt
lively parallell of this Land.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> They had Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
in his Ordinances,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 13.</note> but wanted a heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the ſame: Signall redemptions the Lord
wrought for them, but his wondrous works they
had ſoon forgotten:<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 3, 4 16. 25.</note> Magiſtrates and Miniſters he
provided them, but they ſlighted and ſcorned the
one and the others: Holy profeſſion God called

and <hi>Aaron</hi> were eaſily deſpiſed, when <hi>Corah</hi> and

Ordinances were counted humane,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 19, 20, 28, 29.</note> humane
preſumptions were counted Divine. Their Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſpirits that would equalize all, ſoon met with
a check from their Superior. They ſank alive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the earths bowels,<note place="margin">Numb. 16. 32</note> that bid defiance to the God

paid dear for fooliſh deſires. When the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were doing them moſt good, they were then

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Civil power of the Magistrate in matters of
Religion is a weighty Point much controverted in
theſe daies, as it hath formerly been upon ſeverall
accounts. The Champions of Truth have been put
upon it in all ages to vindicate this part of Chriſts
intereſt, againſt the renewed aſſaults of numerous
adverſaries. The ſophiſticall miſtakes of its oppugners hath drawn
them and their followers into dangerous abſurdities and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
therein. Very few of them, if any, have laboured to
ſtate the queſtion aright, that they might debate it methodically.
Many outcries we indeed meet with againſt compulſion of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but very little of ſober diſcourſe about the Magiſtrates Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
power in Religious matters, where it croſſes the pretence of
conſcience. That no violent force ſhould or can be put upon mens
conſciences, being granted to them, moſt of their Arguments fight
with their own ſhadows: Some would ſeem to oppoſe all kinde of

a licentious liberty of all ſorts therein. Others admit of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and ſeverall diſtinctions therein, and yet the ſtrength of
their reaſons, complies with the former, when duly weighod.
Many worthy Pens have taken very commendable pains in ſtating
and vindicating of that legall Right, which the Lords Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
ſubſtitute is entrusted with as <hi>Cuſtos &amp; vindex utriuſque
Tabulae:</hi> Specially M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:114747:6"/>
hath found abundant cauſe to praiſe the Lord for the due exerciſe
and vindication of that Power, the neglect and oppoſition whereof
was like to have proved their overthrow in Civils and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals.
The ſame ſpirit of Error hath ſtruggled there ſo hard for
Libertiniſm, hath gotten too much ſtrength and favour in theſe
Nations. The like deſign hath been therefore vigorouſly drawn on,
to take off the Magiſtrate from that part of his work which is the
moſt noble and moſt needfull in ſuch a ſeaſon: Various intereſts
have joined forces herein, yea divers good men have been enſnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into it at unawares. There is a fallacious plauſibility in many
things ſaid therein, which takes eaſily with the weak and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Chriſtian, as in all other doctrines of Error. Some would
promote it, that they may promote and ſhelter at pleaſure, their
Levelling, Ranting and Quaking principles. Others favour it
for fear of being reſtrained in ſome things which the Magiſtrate
cannot but ſee juſt cauſe to take cognizance of for regulation.
What rank our Queriſt is to be numbred in, we cannot certainly
ſay, his Paper not being ſubſcribed by any, though his drift may
be eaſily gueſſed at: It grieves our hearts moſt, to ſee any of
Chriſts profeſſed friends taking part in ſuch a quarrell with the
common enemy of his Word and Ordinances. The ſad conſequent
of ſinfull ſeparations from the Reformed Proteſtant Churches,
appears much in this,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> as in other things. When the unity of the
Spirit that ſhould keep the bond of peace in the unity of Chriſtian
Faith and Baptiſm within Gods houſe, comes into diſregard, it
cannot but prove fatally ominous to the uſhering in of thoſe many
evils, which have ſtill been concomitants thereof. The Primitive
times afford us many wofull inſtances of it, and <hi>Germany</hi> with
other parts hath verified it by ſad experience ever ſince the great
Reformation begun. Schiſmaticall rendings of the Church of
Christ were very ſeldom free from hereticall Apoſtaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Had
we no Record, Divine or Humane, Ancient or Modern to teſtifie
this truth, the poſture of perſons and things among us would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
it too abundantly. Yet would not we be miſtaken in
ſhewing the bitter fruits of ſinfull ſeparations, as if we diſowned
all ſeparations. There is a good ſeparation from evil, required
of God; as there is an evil ſeparation from good, forbidden by
him.<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17, 18.</note> A ſeparation from the man of ſinne, and from the ſinne of
man, is a Chriſtians duty, <hi>Revel. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 18, 19. Iſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb facs="tcp:114747:6"/>
of God is an unchriſtian ſinne. Chriſt owned the Jewiſh
Church in its publique Miniſtry and worſhip, though diſtempered
with many corruptions in every part thereof; whilſt they retained
the fundamentals of Religion, he ſtill entertained communion with
them. As long as that firſt adminiſtration of the Lords gracious
Covenant laſted, both he and his Apoſtles maintained correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
with that viſible Church of his, whilſt they did moſt keenly
rebuke the members thereof for their ſeverall enormities: yea,
and after their ſetting up of that Evangelicall worſhip (which as
the ſecond adminiſtration of the Lords gracious Covenant, was to
make an end of the Ceremonials, and continue to the worlds end,
<hi>Heb. 9. 10, 11, 12. Heb. 12. 26, 27. Matth. 28. 21. Matth.</hi> 26.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.) yet were they ſo ſhie of rending the Garment of
Chriſts body, his Church, that they did for a long time bear with
the Jewiſh outrages, labouring by all means to keep fair with them,
and broke not off, as long as they could hold with them in the great
foundation of Religion. The like courſe was taken by God and
his ſervants towards <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> before their <hi>Babylonian</hi>
Captivity. The Kingdom of the ten Tribes (often called <hi>Iſrael,
Ephraim, Samaria, &amp;c.</hi> by way of diſtinction) revolted from
Gods worſhip, under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his ſucceſſors, corrupting the
ſame, perverting the Miniſtry, advancing the loweſt of the people
to the Prieſthood, joining Idolatry of ſeverall kindes thereto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet were they ſtill owned, and called the people and ſpouſe of God,
and communion with them kept by the Prophets till their Captivity.
So when the Kingdom of the two Tribes,<note place="margin">2 King. 17.</note> called <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
did gradually apoſtatize from the purity of Gods worſhip,
joining often Idolatry and groſs evils thereto, yet were they ſtill
honoured with the Name of Gods people, his Portion and Church,
<hi>Jerem. 50. 7. Jerem.</hi> 51. 5. Thus in former ages, though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
did increaſe apace in the Chriſtian Churches beginning in
the Apoſtles daies,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.</note> and ſucceſſively ſpreading till the Man of Sin
got into Chriſts Seat,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> being aſcended to his Meridian of Supream
Power,<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 36, 37, 38.</note> infallible in Eccleſiaſticals and temporals; yet were the
Lords ſervants in all their vigilant and zealous Vindications of
his Truth, very carefull ſtill to maintain the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Peace of
the Church to the utmoſt, till the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> by ſeparating
from Chriſtian Fundamentals,<note place="margin">Rev. 18. 4.</note> had neceſſitated them to ſeparate
utterly from her Communion.<note place="margin">Zech. 8. 16, 19.</note> Truth and Peace are ſo dear friends
to Chriſt, that his friends cannot but be friendly to them both,
<pb facs="tcp:114747:7"/>
as farre as their power reaches. Thoſe faithfull defenders of the
Truth who were driven away into the wilderneſs of <hi>America,</hi>
by a turbulent party (viſibly then complying with the <hi>Roman</hi>
Antichriſt) did ſtill teſtifie their care of preſerving that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
unity, in all their contentions for verity and purity. Though
they deſired much and prayed earneſtly for further Reformation
in the Pariſh Churches of <hi>England,</hi> yet did they ſtill own their
Church ſtate, and Communion therewith. Thus ſober Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will ſtill be manifeſting their love to Chriſtian peace, in their
hotteſt purſuits after Truth, whether in their own or others ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.
The fire of Chriſtian zeal is of ſingular uſe, when it
keeps within its proper place and ſeaſon. But when it's ſcattered,
and gets into the thatch, the miſchief thereof is unexpreſſible.
What dreadfull Convulſions and Inflammations hath not ſuch a
raſh zeal cauſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among us, both in Church and State? When
Chriſtians cannot diſcover and mend faults without unchriſtian
ſeparations from the Church, and unchurching of it, it muſt
needs prove the ground of many ſad effects: It did ſo in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
daies, it hath done ſo in ours. In ſtead of an amicable
debate of things controverted, bitter conteſts, and wofull ruptures
have attended ſuch courſes: In ſtead of amending one fault, more
are created afreſh; in ſtead of recovering one Truth, many
errours are eaſily let in. Romiſh Engineers are alwaies at hand,
to blow the bellows and widen differences; taking part now with
one, new with the other, under a diſguiſe, that their deſignes may
be carried on. They fiſh beſt in all ſuch troubled waters, and
improve the opportunities of gaining by our loſſes. This hath been
one main cauſe of ſo many out-cries for generall tolerations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the fair colours of Liberty of Conſcience, that every one
might follow his own liſt. The Magiſtrates power hath been ſo
often cried down and exclaimed againſt, leſt errour and ſinne
ſhould be any way curbed or checked in their unlimited unruly
power. Some well-minded Chriſtians have been that way ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
through miſ-applications and miſ-interpretations of
divers Scriptures, that they have too often pleaded the devils
cauſe, in thinking to plead the godlies intereſt. Some would give
too much to the Magiſtrate, and others too little. Some would
deſtroy Eccleſiaſticall Government by advancing the Civil:
Others would deſtroy the Civill by exalting the Eccleſiaſticall.
Theſe two powers which God hath appointed for the Churches
<pb facs="tcp:114747:7"/>
good in their reſpective capacities and motions, ſome would
confound, others would deſtroy, and others would make them
to deſtroy each other. Thus varieties of peccant humours
breed ſtill varieties of diſeaſes, in all ſublunary ſubjects, when
they break their bounds limited to them by the Supream Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
of all. To avoid all extreams in this affair, we finde
our ſelves obliged by Scripture and reaſon to own a <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraticall
power authorized by Gods Word to act officially
about ſacred things in a civil manner, either in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
forbidding, or puniſhing the externall man, according
to Gods revealed Word, for the Lords honour, and mans
good:</hi> A <hi>power</hi> we ſay <hi>authorized,</hi> not a private charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
act; <hi>Magiſtraticall,</hi> not Miniſteriall; acting <hi>officially,</hi>
not indifferently; about <hi>ſacred</hi> things of the first Table, in
a <hi>Civil</hi> manner, not by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures: <hi>concerning
the externall man</hi> expreſſed in words or deeds, not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
expreſſed by thoughts; <hi>according to Gods revealed
Word,</hi> not his own fanſie, or any mans will; <hi>for Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and the publique good,</hi> not for any ſelfiſh ends.
Thus we have the <hi>ſubject</hi> and <hi>matter,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>form,</hi>
the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of this <hi>Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
power,</hi> ſo needfull, ſo uſefull. How much is ſaid for
demonſtration hereof by the reaſon of God and of man, is
touched at in the following Tract, having been fully made
out by the Learned in all Ages. All godly Princes, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
and Chriſtian have been rendred famous, more or leſs,
according as they more or leſs tendred Gods intereſt in this
eminent charge. If any object, that the Jewiſh Princes were
Types of Chriſt therein; We anſwer, The Scripture expreſſes
two ſorts of Types:<note place="margin">There were alſo ſome mixt Types in morall things, which were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenters of Evangelicall ſubſtance, as <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Salomons</hi> acts of Juſtice, Piety, and authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, which having a Morall ground, Rule and end, are ſtill to be imitated in the like caſe, as the Scripture clears, both in firſt and ſecond Table; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 9. with <hi>Joh. 2. 17. Epheſ.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. compared with <hi>Exod. 20. Gen.</hi> 18. 18, 19, &amp;c.</note> Some properly for adumbration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation;
thus the High prieſt and Sacrifices typed out
Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2. Others for imitation and direction, thus
Gods dealings with <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Types, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or examples,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6, 11. The former Types were to expire, the latter
to endure: Now that power uſed by Jewiſh Magiſtrates had
<pb facs="tcp:114747:8"/>
nothing of a ſhadow, but much for example, being ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and commended of God therein, in performing a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
not Ceremoniall duty. If any object, It was part of the
Judiciall Law: We anſwer, 1. Let it be proved wherein
it was peculiar to the ſtate. 2. If that were granted, yet
the equity of thoſe Judicials is ſtill in force, and imitable
now as occaſion ſerves; its not now unlawfull, though all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicials
be not alwaies expedient:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Guildas.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

and promoting the will and honour of the ſupream God. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hints thereof they have gathered out of holy Writs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated

had learned much of the Patriarchs and Jews ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which they communicated to other Nations, as appears by
their Poeticall diſguiſes of Scripture ſtories, ſo abundant in
their Works. The ſeverall Churches reformed in <hi>France,
Holland, Switherland,</hi> &amp;c. in their Confeſſions and Writings,
<pb facs="tcp:114747:8"/>
have unanimouſly owned this power of the Magiſtrate, as of
ſingular conducement to the ſuppreſſion of evil, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the good. Many of the Learned Papiſts<note n="*" place="margin">J. Pariſionſ. Victoria.</note> themſelves,
(though the Jeſuites aſcribe ſo much to the Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
as oppoſes it diametrally) have in their ſober mood acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the foreſaid Magiſtraticall Powers upon the ſaid reaſons
to be very excellently uſefull.<note place="margin">Widrington.</note> Thus the clear light of this
Truth extorts acknowledgements from the very adverſaries.
It's ſo much the more ſad a judgement to ſee ſo many profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Truth prove oppoſers thereof. Theſe ſpirituall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſo common among us, are the worſt of all, and uſually
attended with temporall plagues. When there was no King in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> no Magiſtrate, no <hi>heir of reſtraint to put the wicked
to ſhame,</hi> as it was at <hi>Laiſh,</hi> Judg. 18. 7. ſo it fared with

               <note place="margin">Judg. 21. 25.</note> very few could be found doing what was good

judgement, to ſcatter all evil with his eyes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 8. All
kinde of evil gathered ſo faſt, that many a ſtorm followed
thoſe dark clouds. The power ordained of God for <hi>thy good,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle (without exception) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 5. is alſo
a <hi>revenger</hi> of <hi>every evil,</hi> (without exception, for which the
Law diſtinguiſhes not, we may not diſtinguiſh, and if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
one ſort of good or evil, you may as well except the other,
and ſo null the Text) and <hi>a terrour to all that do evil,</hi> ſo
<hi>that we muſt needs be ſubjects,</hi> not for wrath only, but alſo
<hi>for conſcience ſake:</hi> The conſcience you ſee is bound, though
it be not forced to ſuch an obedience. As the Magiſtrates
conſcience is bound in his charge as Gods Deputy to regulate
and promote every good of the externall man in Religion; ſo
is he bound in conſcience to forbid and puniſh evil therein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its degree. As thus his conſcience, ſo is the ſubjects
conſcience bound by the Divine precept; as the one in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſo the other in obeying. If any object, this will bring
tyranny and ſlavery: Anſwer, Where Gods Law is the Rule,
as here it ought to be, there can be neither tyranny nor ſlavery.
2. By the ſame reaſon you might deny his power about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table for fear of tyranny, and ſo make him a Cipher.
If you ſay, there is an Eccleſiaſticall way of dealing with
<pb facs="tcp:114747:9"/>
Chriſtians: We anſwer, 1. All are not Chriſtians. 2. All
Chriſtians regard not Church cenſures. 3. Chriſtians are to be
dealt with by the Church in matters of the ſecond Table alſo; Will
you deny the Magiſtrates cognizance of that therefore, that he may
be <hi>vox praeterea nihil?</hi> 4. The Church deals with offenders in
its way Eccleſiaſtically, the Magiſtrate in his, Civilly (without
interfering) with their reſpective members. If any pretend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
againſt either, the Word of God is the <hi>Regula regulans</hi>
that rules conſcience, and all things elſe. Conſcience is but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula
regulata,</hi> which obliges not againſt Gods Word, nor excuſes
from ſinne: <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledge their ſins of ignorance,
and againſt a good conſcience, and very great, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 12, 15.
<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11. If a man ſuffer with an erroneous conſcience,
its for ſinne, not for conſcience. Is was and is ſtill the great ſinne
of unregenerate conſcience, that it cannot be, its not ſubject to
the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. even the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the
wiſeſt and ſublimeſt conſcience, and judgement before converſion,
is thus fleſhly; and ſome of it remains in the beſt, as farre as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed.
The dictate of conſcience cannot be plea for any ſinne,
though ſometimes it may leſſen it, it never can null ſin. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their

all fit means of ſatisfying and rectifying mens conſciences, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in things leſs clear to ſome, but he muſt not neglect his duty,
becauſe ſome will ſtill be unſatisfied, no more than the Church is
to neglect theirs. It's the ſnare of an erroneous conſcience, that
it ſins either way, it cannot avoid ſin; there is ſo much the more
need that all means be endeavoured for the purging and clearing
thereof. It behoves the Magistrate as well as all other ſuperiours,
not to make himſelf guilty of other mens ſins,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 22.</note> by neglect of his

is cruell pity, both to the patient and others. The Magiſtrate
is Lord of the externall man, for good; though not of any mans
faith; mans ſoul being above his reach, whereof faith is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
act. He infringes no Chriſtian liberty, when he checks ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Libertiniſm, miſcalled liberty: proſecution of evil is no
<pb facs="tcp:114747:10"/>
perſecution of good. If Papiſts and others take occaſion to abuſe
any from hence, ſo do they abuſe and pervert Scripture, and all
good things. We muſt not think to do Jews or others good, by doing
or tollerating evil. Gods cauſe needs not be beholding to the devils
help, nor will it be furthered thereby. White witches are alwaies
moſt miſchievous in the concluſion. The Magiſtrates authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
owning of the truth, is not like to hinder the progreſs
thereof; he may poſſibly miſtake, and therefore needs all meet help,
being accountable to God for the matter and manner of his work.

IN
Anſwer to the Fallacious Queries of a Nameleſs Author,
lately ſpread about the City of Limrick.
For Detection of thoſe Myſterious Deſigns ſo vigorouſly
fomented, if not begun among us, by Romiſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers,
and Jeſuitick Emiſſaries, under No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall

            <head type="sub">Thus begins our Queriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether it be not better for us that a Patent
were granted to Monopolize all the Corn
and Cloth, and to have it meaſured out
unto us at their price, and pleaſure, which
yet were as intollerable, as for ſome men to
appoint, and meaſure out unto us what,
and how much we ſhall believe and practiſe in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The whole may be granted without danger as it's
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114747:11"/>
expreſſed. 2. If we may gueſs that their meaning by their
ſcope, is to ſhew by this compariſon, the unreaſonableneſs of
the Magiſtrates inforcing in Religious matters; then we anſwer
by ſhewing the fallacy of the compariſon, in ſetting forth the
true parallel. The Lord is the abſolute Sovereign of all things
Civil and Sacred; man is not ſo in neither, yet is the Magiſtrate
the Lords ſervant to enforce by Civil power the diſpoſall of
things in both, as God hath appointed in his Word: For things
Civil, it's eaſily granted; for Sacred matters, beſides many
other ſignall inſtances given in both Teſtaments, by way of
precept and promiſe, prefiguration and preſident, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi>
13. 5. <hi>Deut. 17. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Ezra 6. 11. 12. Ezra</hi> 7. 6, 11, 25,
26, 27. compare thoſe verſes together, proving the Kings
grant to be an anſwer to <hi>Ezra</hi>'s requeſt, for conſtituting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
with coercive power, in Religious things, in Gods
Name, <hi>Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Zech.</hi> 13. 3 4, 5, 6. a Propheſie of
Goſpel times: 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 1, 2. Iſa.</hi> 49 23. applicable eſpecially
to later daies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether there be not the ſame reaſon that they ſhould
be appointed by us what they ſhall believe and practiſe in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as for them to do ſo to us; ſeeing we can give as good ground
for what we believe and practiſe, as they can do for what they
would have, if not better?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's not reaſonable that either they or we ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
to each other, what is to be believed or practiſed in
Religion; but it's moſt reaſonable that Chriſts Law given to
us both, ſhould be inforced by the Magiſtrate, the Civil ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Chriſt. The former proofs do fully clear this, and
many other ſuch places, as alſo, 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 12, 13. 2 Chron.</hi>
19. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron. 34. 4, 5. Neh.</hi> 13. 19, 21, 22, &amp;c. We
might eaſily bring in many inſtances for each command of the
firſt Table, how the godly Magiſtrates acted for God according
to his command, were it neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Whether they that would force other mens conſciences be
willing to have their own forced?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No man may or can force another mans conſcience;
but the Magiſtrate is bound by his Office as the Lords Deputy,
to oblige and force the externall man to the obſervance of
Gods will manifeſted in his written word, though he be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and pretend conſcience. Beſides the former proofs clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114747:11"/>
this, ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 40, 41, &amp;c. though <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſcience for Idolatry, yet were they put to death by
<hi>Elijahs</hi> command, which execution was attended with ſpeciall
bleſſings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 2. They that plead conſcience for putting
Chriſtians to death, it excuſes not, but they ſhould ſuffer for
it, according to that indiſpenſable Law, <hi>Geneſ. 9. 6. Aſa,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron. 14. 4. commanded all to ſeek the Lord, and to do the
Law Nehemiah contended with the Nobles,</hi> and threatned
ſtrangers about their abuſes in Tithes, and the Sabbath, <hi>Neh.</hi>
13. 11, 17, 19, 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Whether Chriſt hath ſaid he will have an unwilling peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
compelled to ſerve him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though he hath not ſaid thoſe very words, yet hath
he ſaid in effect ſo much in thoſe many Scriptures that teſtifie
the Magiſtrates duty, to that end, either by precept command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, or by preſidents commended for it, or rewarded in it;
or by the contrary forbidden, reproved, threatned, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for neglect, contempt, or abuſe of that duty. The
Scriptures forementioned do fully prove this, as alſo very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, were it needfull to quote them. It was the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Aſa,</hi> and his people, 2 <hi>Chron. 14. 4, 5. 2 Chron.</hi> 15.
having been ſtirred up by the Prophet, they acted further,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 putting down the Idolatrous Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
with her Idoll, for which they were ſignally
bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. If a Father or Magiſtrate have not power to force a
Virgin to marry one ſhe cannot love; whether they have power to
force one where they cannot believe againſt the light and checks of
their own conſciences?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Diſcourſe hitherto hath been concerning acts
of the outward, not of the inward man, whereof Believing
is one, wherein the Magiſtrate hath no power nor authority,
neigher <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, nor <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as is confeſſed by all: So that the
queſtion as worded, is but captious and impertinent. Yet if
by Believing the Queriſt means profeſſion of faith, or practiſe
of religious duties required of the outward man, it's anſwered,
That though a Father or Magiſtrate have no power to force a
Virgin to marry one ſhe cannot love, yet hath the Magiſtrate
power to force one, where he cannot believe, though againſt
the light and check of his conſcience. Becauſe, 1. A Virgin
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114747:12"/>
before contract is not bound to any one perſon for a husband,
but every ſoul under Goſpel-publication is bound to own Chriſt
for a husband, and his Word written for the Rule of their faith,
profeſſion and practice.</p>
            <p>2. Though God allows Virgins to chuſe their husbands, yet
doth he not allow men to chuſe any Religion beſides his
own.</p>
            <p>3. As the Magiſtrate hath power to reſtrain forcibly all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
from fornication and adultery, and puniſh them for it;
ſo may and ſhould he reſtrain all perſons from ſpirituall forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and adultery committed by the outward man, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them for the ſame, though the light and checks of their
conſciences ſhould erroneouſly juſtifie them in their ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and adultery; ſeeing no plea of conſcience can be
on any account, a ſanctuary to any ſin, or breach of Gods
revealed will. The Scriptures formerly named do ſufficiently
clear this truth.</p>
            <p>We meet next with an Objection propoſed by the Queriſt
to be anſwered by himſelf, drawn from <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 23. which
being but a man of clouts for himſelf to skirmiſh withall, and
not ſo pertinent to the point in hand, as more weakly aſſerting
the Magiſtrates power, we wave, that we may come the ſooner
to more expreſs matter for demonſtration, by this Queriſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villed
at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. Whether the ſervants of the Lord are not forbidden to
ſtrive, but to be gentle towards all? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We readily grant it; and that it was of force of old
when tranſgreſſours of the firſt and ſecond Table were moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
dealt withall.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture quoted ſaith nothing for their purpoſe, in
that, 1. It ſpeaks not of Magiſtrates, but of Miniſters duty
properly, as appears by the whole context, directed to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
a Miniſter of Chriſt, as a directory for the Miniſtry.
2. Though it ſhould be applied to the Magiſtrate, yet will it
not exclude his civil Juriſdiction, and power, as it excludes
not the Miniſters: the ſcope of the place ſignifying to us, that
none of the Lords ſervants ſhould ſtrive for any evil matter,
nor in an evil manner, (though for good) but againſt evil in
a good manner, as <hi>Jud. 3. 4. Gal. 2. 11. Neh. 13. Rom.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6.
For this they are commended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2, 3. For the neglect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114747:12"/>
thereof they are rebuked, <hi>Rev. 2. 14. 20, 21. Rev.</hi> 3. 13, 16. To
this duty they are alſo often ſtirred up, both in their civil and
ſpirituall relations. It becometh not Chriſtian Magiſtrates to
be cowed in Chriſts Cauſe, nor to betray the ſame by coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
or by reſpects, <hi>Prov. 20. 8. Exod.</hi> 32. 20, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
<hi>Rom. 13. Zech.</hi> 13. 2, 3, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. Whether the Saints weapons againſt errors be carnall or
no? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. or whether the ſemi-independents were of that
minde in the Biſhops daies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To the firſt part, Miniſters weapons (of whom the
text properly quoted ſpeaks) are not carnall but ſpirituall, and
mighty through God; of this minde were judicious Chriſtians
(whether nick-named Independents or others) in the Biſhops
daies, as they are ſtill.</p>
            <p>2. If we ſhould grant it, to include the Magiſtrates weapons,
we deny them to be ſinfully carnall, though we grant them to
be civilly carnall, and yet according to Gods Ordinance, <hi>Rom.</hi>
13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. Whether it be not in vain for us to have Bibles in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
if even againſt our ſouls perſwaſions from the Scriptures,
we muſt beleeve as the Church or Pariſh beleeves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This Queſtion is impertinently propoſed to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
who deny either Church or Pariſh to be the Rule of
their faith; however it may be among the Papiſts, and all
Phariſaicall profeſſours of implicite faith, and blinde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture muſt therefore be tranſlated into all Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tongues, that every man may thereby learn to know and
diſcern, what the Church and we ought to beleeve, and to
conform his belief thereto.<note place="margin">Veritas Index ac Judex ſui &amp; obliqui.</note> Conſcience is to be enlightned

may be gradually directed,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note> through that light which ſhines

                  </gap>2.</note> diligently, and ſubmiſſively, till
ſatisfaction be mutually given and received. But this takes
not off the Magiſtrates power in commanding the outward

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. Whether our Magiſtrates and Governours be not wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to give them the Titles of Civil Magiſtrates only, if their
power be ſpirituall?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Magiſtrate is not wronged thereby, ſeeing his
Power is not ſpiritual, but civil, though ſometimes imployed
about ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>2. Our Magiſtrates are truly called Civil, becauſe the means
and manner of executing their Office, their Laws and Arms,
their Proceedings and Courſes, their Rewards and Puniſhments,
are all Civil only,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and not Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall. Though
their object is ſometimes ſpirituall, as in things of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So that its their duty to reduce all to Gods honour, and

None muſt neglect their duty for fear of miſtakes, but be ſo

appears that we make no man ſupream Judge of truth: but
give to every man his judgement of diſcretion for his own
practice, and among the reſt to the Magiſtrate, as in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,

               <hi>Qu.</hi> 14. Whether Laws made concerning Religion, and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
for people to come to their Town or Pariſh-Church, have
not alwaies catched the moſt holy and conſcientious men: witneſs
<hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children: and the reſt will be of what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
you will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As for an orderly bringing of people to the publick
place where the Miniſter of Chriſt duly authorized is to diſpenſe
the Word, the thing it ſelf is very needfull and uſefull. If
any particular branch of our Law be found leſs expedient, that
concerns our Lawgivers to look to, ſo that no conſcience truly
tender, and truly enlightned, may ſuffer; and no licentious
perſon may be ſuffered to ſpend thoſe precious ſeaſons, and
loſe the opportunities of his eternall welfare: when godly,
able Preachers are ſetled in all Pariſhes, there will be leſs excuſe
to idlers and wanderers. Till that can be obtained, the neareſt
may be attended. If any ſcruple it upon ſufficient ground to
be ſoberly rendered to the Magiſtrate, he may be excuſed from
that penalty, which the lazy and careleſs neglecters may be
obnoxious to through their default. If good men have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſometimes by the wreſting of a good Law, or executing of
an evil Law, ſhall it be a diſparagement to good Orders and
Laws? What is there ſo good but may be abuſed? <hi>Corruptio
optimi, peſſima.</hi> Shall men for bear their food, becauſe many
ſurfet and riot? Shall there be no wine in uſe, becauſe ſome
will be drunk? This a mad <hi>Seyth,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> may think well
of, but a wiſe man will improve the good and watch againſt the
evil. Are not Magiſtrates Nurſes to their people, Shepherds
to their flocks, Parents to theſe children? Should they not then
provide for their good, and labour to remove and prevent
all evil, both ſpirituall and temporall in their proper
places?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 15. Whether freedom of cenſcience will not join all ſorts of
perſons, ſouldiers and others, to their Officers and Magiſtrates,
becauſe each ſhared in the benefit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Would you explain what conſcientiouſneſs you mean,
and what freedom, we might anſwer more diſtinctly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.
Chriſtian liberty is indeed a choice jewell, purchaſed
by Chriſt, and given by Gods Spirit to all his Elect, in their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114747:17"/>
Regeneration: Thereby they are freed from the guilt of ſinne
in their juſtification, <hi>Rom. 3. 15. ch.</hi> 5. 1. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 2. From the
power and pollution of ſinne, in their redemption and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. 3. From the remainders of ſinne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
in their progreſſive renovation. 4. From the deadly
fruits and effects of ſinne, the curſe of the Law, the wrath of
God, the loſs of all good, and infliction of all evil in their
improved adoption. 5. They ſhall be freed from all fear of
future evil, to enjoy eternall good in their laſt diſſolution from
Grace to Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. 6. Their Chriſtian liberty makes
them free to all ſpirituall good in the right uſe of every creature
and Ordinance, ſo farre as their minde and heart are graciouſly
renewed. But for a ſinfull liberty to abuſe our ſelves, or any
creature and Ordinance, either in committing evil, or omiting
good, it's a Satanicall liberty, it's none of Chriſts purchaſe nor
gift. Will any ſober conſcientious Chriſtian plead for it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no. Thoſe are the vileſt drudges that have moſt of that
freedom. Do you deſire freedom to ſay and do what you will?
Is it not the high way to hell? The ruine of Church and State?
The confounding of all things? But you plead conſcience:
Why, what do you mean? If it be a pure conſcience it will
thus act by faith in love to good, againſt evil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. If it
be an erroneous conſcience, or ſcrupulous, or dubious in leſſer
things, there is a Chriſtian way to ſatisfie ſuch with tenderneſs,
prudence and fidelity, to the rectifying and ſetling of them
preſcribed, <hi>Rom. 14. Phil. 3. 15, 16. Gal.</hi> 6. 1. But if it be an evil
conſcience, a corrupt, a ſeared, a blinde conſcience, that is a
dreadfull evil indeed, <hi>Tit. 1. 15, 16. 1 Tim. 4. 2, 3. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5. Such are not to be dallied with, no more than the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous,
poyſoned and ulcerous bodies, that call for purging,
dieting, and looking to narrowly, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 25, 26. Tit.</hi> 3. 10,
11. Can you think a licentious liberty profitable to any man?
Is it for the Patients good that he be forſaken of his Phyſician
or Chirurgion, and left alone undreſſed, unlooked to? Is it
profitable to any family or ſociety, that the members thereof
ſhould be left in a diſordered, disjointed poſture? Is it for the
profit of Church or State, that their ſeverall members ſhould
be left to their own fanſie and will, to move as they liſt? Will
not ſuch dreadfull convulſions prove moſt deadly ſymptoms in
the Body Politick and Eccleſiaſticall, as they do in the Body
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114747:18"/>
Naturall and Oeconomicall? Is this your egregious method
of joining all Inferiors to their Superiors? Is ſuch a confuſion
the way to ſettlement? Is this Libertiniſm the way to any true
good, ſpirituall or temporall? Are not Officers like to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
bravely when their ſouldiers muſt be left to their own
will? Are not Magiſtrates like to ſpeed well, when their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhall own no Law, no Rule, no Charge, but as they
think good? Are not Parents and Governours of families in a
hopefull caſe, when the reins are laid on the neck of children
and ſervants? Is not every man naturally full of evil, and bent
to evil, empty of good, and backward thereto? Are not the
beſt ſtill minded of their emptineſs, inſufficiency, ſelfiſhneſs
and unworthineſs? that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf is feign to cry out, <hi>Rom.</hi>
7. 21. <hi>Oh miſerable!</hi> &amp;c. No wonder if the world be ſet on
fire, when young giddy <hi>Phaeton</hi> gets into his fathers ſeat.
Could your Rhetorick prevail, what a Metamorphoſis ſhould
we have in every relation and condition? How ſoon ſhould we
ſee the liberty of Chriſtianity turn'd into the liberty of Beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality?

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 16. Whether thoſe States, as the Low-Countries, who
grant ſuch liberty to ſouldiers and others, do not live quietly, and
flouriſh in great proſperity?</p>

If they flouriſh, the more beholding are they to that Divine
providence who preſerved them ſo wonderfully from that ruine
threatned in 1534, 1535, and other times by ſtirring up their
Rulers in a ſingular manner to watch againſt the pernicious
iſſue of the liberty then too much indulged. They have ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
deeply of late, and are like to ſmart more yet: God hath
not done with them: Neither is that liberty pretended ſuch
there in all parts, as you would make us beleeve: But if we

<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. When <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> made ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack

or reaſon. Hereticks are to be puniſhed by rejection and
excommunication, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. granted; this is the Church-cenſure
upon their members Eccleſiaſtically diſpenſed: <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander</hi> made ſhipwrack of their profeſſed faith,
and therefore were delivered to Satan by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 20.
granted: this was an Apoſtolicall cenſure. There was no
Civil Magiſtrates cenſure then could be had, therefore there
ſhould be none where it may be had: This is a <hi>non</hi> conſequence.
And what other puniſhment doth the Scripture appoint for
Hereticks? What Laws about them? very many, both in the
Old and New Teſtament, as you may ſee fully demonſtrated
by all our Reformers on this ſubject, as <hi>Zanchy, Calvin, Beza,

wherein you have the authority of the Magiſtrate to command,
forbid and puniſh by civil cenſure, and rule the externall man
(whether in ſpeech or action) in all things clearly declared by
the Word of God, and that for a godly peace. Chriſt gave
by his own practice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 17, 18. a ſufficient intimation to all
Chriſtians in authority, what care they ſhould have of purging
out and preventing corruption in worſhip, and he repeated
it with renewed rigour, <hi>Matth. 21. Mark 11. Luke</hi> 19. in
the firſt execution he throws out the buyers of Oxen and Sheep,
in this ſecond the ſellers alſo: at firſt Dove ſellers were gently
ſpoken to, to carry away their truck, but at laſt their ſeats alſo
are overthrown. Chriſt ſaith at firſt, <hi>You have made my Fathers
houſe an houſe of merchandize:</hi> but at laſt, <hi>Ye have made it a
den of theeves.</hi> Thus the zeal of Gods houſe, that inflamed
<hi>David</hi> the Type, had now eaten up Chriſt the ſon of <hi>David,</hi>
the grand Anti-type. Therein (as the learned <hi>Beza, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon,
Paeraeus, Snecanus, Ainſworth, Dike, &amp;c.</hi> obſerve)
Chriſt acted extraordinarily, becauſe the ordinary help was
neglected by the Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, as for the manner:
yet in effect he did ſhew what ſhould be done in the like caſe
by the Magiſtrate in his place, as alſo by the Church in their
place, as in the caſe of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> Numb. 14. of <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King.
18. 40. of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoſe malefactours were
extraordinarily executed by the Lords ſervants for breach of
the firſt and ſecond Table, becauſe the Magiſtrates duty was
neglected therein.</p>
            <p>2. That Law of Chriſt which authorizeth the Magiſtrate to
act for him, under him, and like him, in puniſhing the breaches
of every command, whether of the firſt or ſecond Table, doth
alſo regulate him in that execution. 1. Declaring his power
to be Civil, not Eccleſiaſticall, by civil orders, proceedings
and cenſures, not by ſuch means as he appoints to his Church.
Indeed the Magiſtrate may alſo be a Church-member, but in
this he acts not as ſuch, but as a civil Officer, yet under Chriſt.
2. His power reaches to things that concern the outward man,
whether verball or actuall, not mentall and ſecret.</p>
            <p>3. In thoſe externals he muſt have a clear rule of Gods
Word, either expreſly or by ſure conſequence, not his own
conceit, or any mans will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114747:21"/>
4. Therein he muſt proportion the puniſhment to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the tranſgreſſion, whether lighter or heavier, for
matter or manner, to avoid fooliſh pity and rigorous
cruelty.</p>
            <p>5. His end muſt be a godly peace,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. that thereby
all may be quickned to a peaceable life in all godlineſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty:
Thus the Magiſtrate is given as an Ordinance of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. being a power <hi>ordained of God for a terrour to all
evil works,</hi> v. 3. yea, <hi>the Miniſtry of God for mans good,</hi> v. 4.
and that <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi> v. 5. to be done and obeyed. Thus
acted pious <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 29. declaring corruption of worſhip in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
idolaters to be puniſhable by the Judge, <hi>Job.</hi> 31. 24, 28,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> the Magiſtrate, by Gods command, puniſhed
the breaches of the Sabbath, abuſe of Gods Name, Idolatry,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> that noble conquering Protector of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
reſolved himſelf, and adviſed others, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. &amp; 23. &amp; 24. <hi>chap.</hi>
Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> that faithfull Prince ordered his charge, and

are too often peſtered therewith, and their ejection is chiefly
to be minded. The principall efficient of that cure, is indeed
the mighty Spirit of God: His powerfull Word is the principal
Inſtrument. Yet are men and means appointed and bleſſed
of God in ſubſerviency thereto. Chriſt himſelf told his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

that they go not out, but with prayer and faſting.
It's dreadfull to ſee mens bodies poſſeſſed with ſuch gueſts, but
their ſouls poſſeſſion more frequent and terrible, is not ſo
much dreaded, becauſe leſs ſenſible. The ſad ſymptoms of ſuch
a Poſſeſſion are ſo wofully manifeſted in the Quaking crue,
that it infeſts all parts among us. It concerns all ſorts among
us, if ever, to obſerve Chriſts method for their ejection.
They fume and foam, they range and rage; toſſed they are
from one extream to another; ſometimes caſt into the fire,
then into the water; firſt ranting, then quaking. The filthy
excrements of theſe unclean ſpirits boil ſo exceſſively within
them, that they do enormouſly work out at every part of their

Scarce a Scripture word do they underſtand in a Scripture ſenſe,
but uſe that language only to deceive the ſimple. Their Chriſt,
their light, their heaven and hell, their perfection and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
when brought to the touch, prove but Chimaera's,
and fanatick conceits. That <hi>pure convincement</hi> of the Ranters
(as the Quakers call it) of God being all things, and all things
God, appears to be their grand Principle, but trimm'd anew,
to pleaſe the better. They finde no fault with the Ranters
principles, though they blame ſomething of their practiſe;

witneſs their books, complaining that they had a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement,

work enough among ſuch a variety of Bedlams? Is not this

refined for <hi>Engliſh</hi> uſe by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Wittagen-Mots (or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

Rule and Fountain, the Mother and Nurſe of our Civil Peace,
when execution anſwers their Inſtitution and Conſtitution.
Peace in general ſenſe, is the <hi>harmonious agreement</hi> of things,
attending their orderly compoſure and motion. Peace with
God (by Chriſt conjugally embraced) produces peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in man, and civil peace among men. Our civil peace

beams of Scripture light finde no credit nor favour with
them, if not ſuted to their phantaſticall light. Their own light
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114747:24"/>
is their Law, as it's their God, their Chriſt, their perfection,
their righteouſneſs, their All. All the Laws of God and men
muſt be reduced to that ſtandard. They judge themſelves ſtill
obſervers of the Law in the moſt egregious breaches thereof:
for indeed, what Law can they break, whoſe will is their only
Law? Sometimes they pretend that Will in them, not to be
their own, but Gods Will. But that eaſily appears to be but
a cunning ſhift, to father their will on God, as they do their
light and all. As then their Law is in their breaſt, though they
be daily convinced (by every one that ſpeaks with them, who
hath not loſt his reaſon and Religion at once, and particularly
by Authority) of their foul tranſgreſſions, yet are they ſtill
faultleſs. They witneſs perfection. You do but miſtake them.
They cannot ſin. They cannot break the Law. All Authority
is tyrannical, that humours them not. The beſt Miniſters are
fools and knaves to them. None knows and keeps the Laws
but themſelves and followers. Dare you then after this, charge
or puniſh theſe men for breach of any Law? No, by no means.
They are but miſunderſtood. Their railing and curſing, their
ſlandring and wandering, their idleneſs and irreverence, their
diſobedience and ſeducing, their errors and blaſphemies againſt
God and Chriſt, againſt the Divine Trinity and holy Spirit;
againſt the Scriptures and Ordinances of the Goſpel; their
contempt and ſcorn of all goodneſs and good men (not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
after their pipe,) Theſe are no breaches of Law, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and ſignes of their perfection. Their pride and paſſion,
their malice and hatred, their choler and rage, their Atheiſm
and ignorance, their deceits and charms are but conformities
to the light within. Yea their Phariſaicall abſtinence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,
their formalities and oſtentations, their diſorderly
ſpeeches and carriage, their oppoſing of Orders from God
and his ſervants, their ſelf-conceitedneſs and ſelf-confidence,
muſt not be thought breaches of Law, but fulfillings thereof.
In a word, if you think they can break the peace, by breaking
the Law, you are much miſtaken, for they are a Law to
themſelves; and the utmoſt miſchief they can do to us all,
(that comply not with them) is but the fulfilling of that

            <p>Truth in the Emanation of the Divine Being, or the Truth of
God, is the conformity of Gods expreſſion to himſelf; which
is conſidered Intentionally, Verbally and Actually, in his
Thoughts, Words and Works.</p>
            <p>I. The Truth of his Thoughts is called his Purpoſe and
Decree,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5, 11.</note> pleaſure and good will to ſignifie his eternal Councel
fore-ordaining all future things.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11.</note> This is an abſolute, entire,
perfect and unchangeable Act of the Divine Will,<note place="margin">Act 15. 18.</note> about the
good and evil of future Beings, as of themſelves, eſpecially
about rational creatures, men and Angels. This Divine Truth,
or Act, as it reſpects evil, is called Permiſſion and Regulation;
as it reſpects good,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5.</note> it's called fore-ordination. As it reſpects
the objects of Divine Benevolence,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2, 3.</note> it's called Election and
Predeſtination:<note place="margin">Act. 13. 48.</note> Election, chuſing them in Chriſt to glory:
Predeſtination, fore-appointing them to conformity and
Adoption by Chriſt:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28, 29, 30.</note> Election, called alſo his fore-knowledge
(which in the Hebrew imports affect and effect) regarding
chiefly the End, and Predeſtination the Means to that End.
That eternal purpoſe,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5, 6.</note> as it regards the objects of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning,
is called Reprobation and Predamnation. Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
being properly an Act of Sovereignty, (we cannot
ſpeak of God, but after the manner of men, with diſtinctions
and denominations extrinſecal, though he be one pure Act,
all the change being in the creature)<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 12.</note> is alſo called Preterition,
<hi>non</hi>-Election,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ 5. 9.</note> and <hi>non</hi>-Predeſtination, properly regarding
their State and End abſolutely.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 8.</note> Predamnation being an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114747:25"/>
Act of Juſtice properly,<note place="margin">Jud. 4.</note> conſiders the Means with tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to that End, viewing ſuch under the conſideration of future
ſinners. The like denominations may be given to Divine
Purpoſe,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> about Angels, <hi>conſideratis conſiderandis.</hi> Thus of
Intentional Truth.</p>
            <p>II. The Verbal Truth of God is called his Word, which is
the declaration of his Mind and Will, revealed to man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himſelf and all his creatures. This he did manifeſt to
<hi>Adam</hi> in his Creation, writing it upon his ſoul in the characters
of his own Image (in perfect knowledge,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 2.</note> righteouſneſs and
holineſs) and by poſitive ſignifications of his pleaſure.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> After
his fall,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> and ſucceſſively to others, this Truth of God, about
the ſalvation of his Elect, in and by Chriſt alone, with all
things elſe needfull to be known, he did variouſly reveal unto
men by Inſpirations,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> Dreams, Viſions, Oracles, Paternall
Traditions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from <hi>Moſes</hi> time ſaw it fit to give it in
writing (for a ſure Record to all Ages) by inſpiring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
the ſame upon the Spirits,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</note> and by the Pens of his holy.
Prophets and Apoſtles, ſucceſſively, in an immediate, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and extraordinary manner.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 19, 20, 21.</note> Thence are we ſaid to be built
upon their doctrinal or Scriptural foundation,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 10, 11</note> holding forth
Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17.</note> (as we are properly on Chriſt himſelf, the perſonal
foundation, held forth by them.) Theſe Writings are called
the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> containing
all things needfull to the ſalvation of Gods Elect,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good of man, called therefore his Laws and Statutes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
and Precepts, Teſtimonies and Judgements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being
the perfect Rule of Truth and Grace, faith and obedience;
Gods mercy and mans duty;<note place="margin">Veritas mentis, oris, operis.</note> requiring from man, truth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
oral and actual, <hi>i. e.</hi> a due conformity of every thought,
word and work, to that truth of God declared.</p>
            <p>III. The Actual Truth of God is manifeſted in all his Works
of Creation and Providence, carrying on a conſtant, perfect
conformity to Gods intentional Truth, as alſo to his verbal, in
order to his ſupream End, his own glory; by the ſeaſonable
and admirable diſpenſations of all his Attributes,<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 19.</note> eſpecially
mercy and juſtice,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 17.</note> towards men and Angels, in the moſt wiſe,
holy and powerfull preſerving of all his creatures,<note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 14.</note> and all their<note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 29.</note>
actions,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> as they were all created of nothing by the Word of his
power,<note place="margin">Gen. 1, &amp; 2.</note> in the ſpace of ſix daies, and all very good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:114747:25"/>
Errour then being a crooked deviation of mans judgement
from the truth of God revealed, will admit of ſeveral degrees
and conſiderations, according to the varieties and imports of
that truth, and mans deviating from it. Some truth is natural,
ſome moral, ſome ſpiritual; about external, internal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
things. Some are Fundamental of ſalvation, ſome <hi>ſupra-</hi>
fundamentall,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 4.</note> (or <hi>juxta</hi>) others more circumſtantial and
ſuperficial.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 7.</note> Errours in Fundamentals,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 5.</note> about the perfection of
God,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 3, 5.</note> the Trinity of Divine Perſons, Chriſt the Mediatour,
God-man,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> the fall of man, his forlorn ſtate, his abſolute need
of regeneration,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 3.</note> faith, repentance, obedience; as alſo of
the ſufficiency of Scripture, of mans eternal ſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
properly called Hereſies, which if obſtinately perſiſted in, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
due means uſed of reclaiming ſuch, render men unfit for
Chriſtian communion.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Supra</hi>-fundamental Truths are the next
built on them, which admit of various debates among the
Learned. Errours againſt them are dangerous, but not ſo
pernicious as the former,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 23, 24.</note> eſpecially if the perſon erring be
humble and teachable.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 1, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Gal. 6. 1, 2.</note> Such are many points of worſhip, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Circumſtantial Truths are more external, about
place and time,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7, 8, 9.</note> order and manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expreſſed in that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Verſe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note>
Quis, quid, ubi, quibus anxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.
Errours againſt theſe are bad, but nothing like the former.</p>
            <p>This needful explication will clear and anſwer to the Query.
The puniſhment for errour is not to exceed the nature of that
errour, and the manner of holding it; whether Eccleſiaſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the Church; or Civilly, by the Magiſtrate. The truth
of God gives a rule for all ſuch caſes, either in expreſs words,
or in clear conſequence, to be exactly ſtudied and obſerved,
by all perſons concerned, ſo that the ends of that puniſhment
be attended, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods honour, and the publick good; with
the parties alſo,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> as farre as may be. The Church meddles not
with Civil cenſures, ſuch as impriſoning, having its proper
way of Admonition, Suſpenſion, Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
its offending members. Impriſonment and other corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
for errours require a ſufficient cauſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> as in caſe of
herefie endangering mens ſouls, diſturbing Gods ſervice and
the publick peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A godly Magiſtrate will be heartily
glad never to meet with ſuch occaſions; but when he doth, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114747:26"/>
he cannot but be often forced to in this revolting age,<note place="margin">Crudelis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus crudelem facit medicum. <hi>Prov.</hi>
               </note> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
him to attend thoſe forementioned ends with zeal and
prudence, leſt fooliſh pity ſpoil the City, and leſt ſeeming gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
prove real cruelty to many. Deſtructive errours, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
blaſphemous ones, are the malignant humours of mens
conſciences, which endanger them and thouſands beſides, in
their eternal ſtate.<note place="margin">Les couſciences Libertines ſont de vrages beſtes ſaenuages, <hi>Adag.</hi> Gallic.</note> Such perſons, eſpecially if obſtinate, are
the very <hi>plagues</hi> of the body Politick, endangering the whole.
What miſchiefs may not ſuch Peſts procure, if without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint?
as ſad experience ſhew'd in the Familiſts crue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Henry Nichols</hi> was leader, followed by <hi>Hacket, Coppinger,</hi>
and <hi>Arthington;</hi>
               <note place="margin">See <hi>Engl.</hi> Hiſt.</note> till <hi>Hackets</hi> execution and <hi>Arthingtons</hi> recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
had repreſſed the fury thereof in Q <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time.
The Grundletonians in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> acted divers ſuch mad pranks,
as <hi>Valentinus, Baſilides,</hi> and the Carpocratians of old were
wont. Out of the North have we had the like Impoſtors of
late, to confirm the Proverb, <hi>Omne malum ab Aquilone.</hi> Such
phrenetick perſons had need be cloſely kept and look'd to, for
their own and others good. Such mad folks cannot be kept
from hurt, but by being kept from company. If reſtraint may
ſeem to endanger their bodies, they muſt thank themſelves, ſo
long as care is taken for ſutable accommodations. It were to
be wiſhed that fair means might prevent that rigor, but if the
Patient, by his folly, neceſſitate his Chirurgion to bind and
wound him, who muſt be blamed? If ſuch belong to God, he
will bleſs that very dreſſing to the humbling and healing of
them, whether in the ſeventh or eleventh hour; he beſt knows
how to order it, to the fulfilling of his eternal purpoſe, on ſuch
veſſels of mercy, to be prepared for glory, through grace.
Thus <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> that bloody wretch,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 33. 12.</note> was changed in his priſon,
and not till then. His heart was there broken and cured won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.<note place="margin">Eccl. 12. 11.</note>
The hammer of that weighty puniſhment drave
home to the head into his heart the many inſtructions of Gods
Word, which he had ſo long heard and deſpiſed, being guided
by the hand of Chriſts Spirit. Thus the believing thief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
at his execution.<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 17.</note> The prodigall child came not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
till his miſery, juſtly procured, was ſanctified of God, to
the opening of his eyes.<note place="margin">La cóz de la Yégua no haze mal al pótro. <hi>Adag.</hi> Hispan.</note> 
               <hi>England</hi> hath had experience of ſome
late Quakers, horriby blaſpemous, much reclaimed by the
priſon and laſh; and <hi>Ireland</hi> knows others of that tribe, who
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114747:26"/>
are come back again to ſobriety, by the ſenſe of that poverty,
whereinto their idle courſes and ill companions had reduced
them. But if any ſuch grow worſe ſtill, as is the uſual lot of
ſuch ſeducers, by a dreadfull judgement of heaven, it will fall
on their own heads, and that penalty will do others much good,
if it do them but little. It may deter many from the like exceſs,
ſo that <hi>paena ad paucos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Miédo guarda vinna y no Vinnadero. Hiſpan. <hi>Prov.</hi>
               </note> proves <hi>terror ad omnes.</hi> It keeps them
from doing more miſchief, and from increaſing their ſins and
eternal ſufferings thereby. Though Lions and Bears nature be
not changed by their chains, yet is their miſchief reſtrained
uſefully thereby. Better have the devil bound then looſe,
though he will be a devil ſtill.<note place="margin">Job 14. 14.</note> The duration of every mans life
is certainly fore-appointed of God,<note place="margin">Job 7. 1.</note> beyond which he ſhall not
paſs. This will not indeed excuſe any mans wilfull neglect of
himſelf or others, yet it may ſatisfie mans heart, upon the
unchangeable event of things. He that appoints the end, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
indeed the means ſubſervient thereto: when therefore
his providence indiſpenſably neceſſitates the defect of the
means, it clearly ſignifies that it's Gods purpoſe to have ſuch
a thing come to paſs.<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> comforts his Brethren on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
though they had uſed ill means, God over-ruled
them to a good end. But if ſuch malefactors haſten their own
end, by unlawfull means (as<note n="*" place="margin">A great Quaker.</note> 
               <hi>Parnell</hi> lately in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Gaol

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Conſcience properly cannot be compelled, it being
the Reflexion of mans judgement on himſelf,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note> with reſpect to
Gods judgement. Such is the nature of humane ſouls in their
intellectuals, that they cannot be forced, though they may be
moved by external objects. God alone is the Lord of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he made it, and knows how to rule it at his Will. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is his Royal ſear,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> his Throne of Majeſty, his Deputy
and Witneſs,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 29.</note> his Recorder and Judge, his Teacher and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
in mans heart. It was thus perfectly before the fall;
but it's now corrupted by mans ſin, and little remains of that
glorious fabrick, but ruinous heaps, though enough to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the wofulneſs of that fall. In the moſt, it ſtill lies under
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114747:27"/>
darkneſs and death; the devil being gotten into Gods ſeat, by
juſt judgement doth uſurp further,<note place="margin">Tit. 1, 15, 16.</note> in playing the pranks of a
dreadfull Jaylor. In the Regenerate, conſcience is purified,
and reſtored to its primitive uſe in part,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> though much evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
there,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> as in other faculties to be gradually removed.<note place="margin">Act. 24. 16.</note>
Conſcience then cannot be conſtrained, but the evil of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
perverted conſcience may be reſtrained. If that Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
that ſhould act Gods part in mans ſoul, be bribed by Satan
to take his part, through the compliance of inward corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
againſt God his Sovereign, he may ſurely be called to
account for it by men, as far as that treaſon appears externally.
God judges of the outward by the inward, man judges of the
inward by the outward man. The Magiſtrate is Gods exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Deputy,<note place="margin">Judg. 18. 7.</note> called therefore an heir of reſtraint, to put the
wicked to ſhame.<note place="margin">Judg. 17. 18, 19</note> The firſt and ſecond Table of Gods Law are
both committed to his charge,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 3, 4, 5.</note> as to the externals thereof, as
we hinted before. When that care was wanting, Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

ſo farre are the differences widened between God and
man,<note place="margin">Jerem. 5. 26.</note> which increaſes differences among men. The way then
to compoſe differences, is not to dally with any corruption,
(either of judgement, affection, or practice) but to remove it
effectually. Man can but uſe the means, and is obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
ſpecially the Magiſtrate in his place for God, as every one
ſhould do in himſelf, and by himſelf, through Gods help. To
leave every man to his own light, is to leave a mans ground to
it ſelf without dreſſing. The moſt conſciences are but like the
dunghill,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> as all are by nature, before converſion. The beſt
are like a garden,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note> wherein the Lord, through grace, hath ſet
and ſown the fruits of his Spirit. But if you let the dunghill
alone, will it ever be better? If you let the beſt garden alone,

World; the Angels are the Reapers; the Wicked are the
Tares; the Godly are the Wheat, ſaith Chriſt, deſcribing the
Tares to be ſuch as offend and do iniquity; the Wheat to be
the children of the Kingdom. By Field, you may underſtand,
either the ſtate of the Church viſible, univerſally conſidered in
the world; or the world, wherein that Church ſubſiſts, from
time to time. In either ſenſe the caſe will be clear.</p>
            <p>1. If you underſtand it of the Catholick Church, conſidered
in its ſucceſſion from age to age, it will ſignifie the permiſſion
of providence, which ſuffers ſome hypocrites ſtill to remain
therein,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> even in the pureſt times; but it cannot be meant of

Church lives,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> it muſt needs be meant of a providential Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Tares, for the time of this life, in the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of it, God forbearing long, and not deſtroying the
wicked ſuddenly, by his Angelical inſtruments, in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courſe of dealing below; though ſome notorious ones be
now and then pulled up by eminent Juſtice. But it cannot be
meant of mans duty, injoyned by Gods Precept, to let every
wicked man alone; for then ſhould he croſs the whole ſeries of
his Word, which injoyns the Magiſtrate his duty ſo clearly, for
puniſhing ſinne,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> whether againſt the firſt Table, as perjury,

iniquity,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 10.</note> till it comes to be ſealed up,<note place="margin">Zech. 6. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and they with it carried

collective of reprobates,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 23.</note> prepared for the fire, veſſels of wrath
fitted for deſtruction, in the complex of them. The Angels
have a providential command to let them alone, not to pluck
them all up at once by the root; for they being the moſt and
greateſt part of the world, it would endanger the deſtruction of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114747:28"/>
the whole world, and conſequently of the Wheat alſo, if all
ſhould thus ſuddenly be pulled up; ſignifying, that he will
ſuffer many wicked ones generally to abide in the world,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 10.</note> till
harveſt,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> though he deals with ſome of them judicially now and
then,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> in that way which may help, and not hurt the Wheat.</p>
            <p>5. Mind the Precept it ſelf, <hi>Let them alone;</hi> which implies a
ſufficient power in the inſtruments imployed, were but Gods
will ſignified, to take a ſpeedy courſe with all the Tares: A
power proper to Angels, not to any man or men.</p>
            <p>6. Mind Chriſts reaſon ſubjoined,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Leſt you root up the Wheat,</hi>
implying, ſuch a total plucking up of the Tares, as would prove
the deſtruction of the Wheat; which muſt needs therefore be
underſtood in the ſenſe fore-explained; for the puniſhing of
one or few offenders here and there, being ſo often comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and bleſſed from God,<note place="margin">Praemium as paena baſes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana ſocietatis.</note> to the common good of the reſt,
and the very pillar of Church and State, <hi>in genere mediorum,</hi>
cannot be thought or found ſo prejudicially deſtructive to the
good.</p>
            <p>This then is clearly the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>Let them alone;</hi>
that it's a Providential Command given to the Angels, not to
deſtroy the whole race of the wicked at once; and not a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Rule to men, for the not executing of Gods will, upon
this or that particular offender, whether in Civils or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticals.</p>

little Foxes, that ſpoil the tender buddings of his Vineyard?
Was there ever more need of that watchfull care, than in this
age, and in theſe parts? wherein the Romiſh Cubs ſwarm
round about us, under the mask of Notions and new Lights?
Should not a Sheep of Chriſt be like himſelf, a Lamb to God,

the devils ſervice, as to venture all to promote his intereſt,
ſhall Chriſts friends be the leſs zealous and active for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

other Scriptures, we muſt wiſely compare the context and
ſcope, with the Text and other Scriptures; for through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and unſtableneſs,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> Scriptures are wreſted to mens perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The ſcope here appears clearly to be a condemning of the
Diſciples raſhneſs, whoſe blind zeal would have carried Chriſt
beyond his preſent work, in that ſtate of humiliation, for the
converſion of ſouls.</p>
            <p>2. Diſtinguiſh between Chriſts humiliation and exaltation.
In the former he acted as the ſon of man,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15.</note> in all parts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
weakneſs conforming to us,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 4, 5, 6.</note> ſin only excepted. Therein
was he to act as a ſervant,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 2.</note> not intending to take on him the
Magiſtrates Office, in any ſuch caſes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 14. nor was it
fit that harſh means ſhould be uſed to thoſe ſtrangers, at his
firſt coming, which might have ſcared them away from Chriſt
and his ſalvation.<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 16.</note> But in his ſtate of exaltation he is King of
Kings and Lord of Lords;<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</note> by him Kings reign, and Princes
execute juſtice, who hath all power given him in heaven and
earth; and he gives his Witneſſes (whether Magiſtratical or
Miniſterial,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 5.</note> or both) power to conſume his enemies with fire
out of their mouth.</p>
            <p>3. Diſtinguiſh between Samaritan ſtrangers, and Jewiſh
rebels; between the groſly ignorant heathens, and the wilfully
obſtinate Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 7.</note> Againſt Jewiſh rebels the Lord ſent his
Armies to deſtroy the deſtroyers and abuſers of his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors;
though he would not fetch fire from heaven againſt the
mongrel heatheniſh Samaritans.</p>
            <p>4. Diſtinguiſh between Magiſtratical and Miniſterial cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
on offenders. Chriſt would not have his Diſciples and
Miniſters to uſurp the Magiſtrates work in civil bodily cenſures,
but to keep within their ſphere,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6.</note> with ſpiritual weapons, ſuch
as are anſwerable to the nature of their Miniſtry, as admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> towards their members ordinarily. The caſe of
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> was extraordinary,<note place="margin">Act. 5. 2, 3, 4.</note> was extraordinary, as alſo was the Call,
Abilities and Work of Apoſtles. The Civil ſword ſtill being left
to the Magiſtrates right uſe, who is regulated about it ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Whether it's not a burden enough for the Magiſtrate
to govern and judge in Civil cauſes, to preſerve the ſubjects right
and ſafety?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Magiſtrates burden is great indeed; <hi>Honos</hi> and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114747:30"/>
               <hi>Onus,</hi> Honour and Burden ever went together. Providence
orders all things ſo wiſely, that they who have moſt from God,
ſhould be obliged to do moſt for God.<note place="margin">Act. 20. 35.</note> It's more Royal to give,
than to receive, in Chriſts account. <hi>Magnates</hi> are <hi>Magnetes,</hi>
Great Men are Precious Loadſtones: They ſhould be <hi>Optimi,</hi>
that are <hi>Maximi,</hi> to anſwer Gods Title and Nature, whom
they repreſent. The higheſt Spheres of heaven carry the moſt
influence of light and life to all inferiours. Magiſtrates have a
greater burden of care and trouble, of danger and account, to
make them the more humble and holy, the more diligent and
ſelf denying, the more active and zealous in their places.</p>
            <p>2. The choice part of the Magiſtrates buſineſs is to be moſt
for God, in being moſt like God, whoſe ſubſtitute and Vice-Gerent
he is. What the Lord tenders moſt, ſhould be moſt
rendred by him. God begins ſtill at his Glory, in the <hi>matter</hi>
and <hi>means,</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>time</hi> of his Worſhip. The firſt
Table therefore ſhould be the Magiſtrates firſt care. <hi>Thoſe that

               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> 
               <hi>he will honour; but they that deſpiſe him, though

7. 6. with <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 11, 27. How little beholding is the Lord to
thoſe Rulers, that care more for their honour than for his,
that defend their Word more than his; that will not ſuffer
perſonal injuries, but regard not what affronts are put on
Chriſt! They that tender not his Name and Truth, his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Ordinances, are like to ſmart dearly for it, at laſt.
Can you think that thoſe perſons will ſpare you, that ſpare not
what is deareſt to God? Will they honour you that vilifie
God? Remember <hi>Eli's</hi> caſe, that you may repent, who have
made light of Chriſts great concernments! Did not <hi>Salomon</hi>
find it the beſt way to Wiſdom and Glory, to peace and plenty,
thus to begin with God? <hi>A Jove principium,</hi> was the great
Maxim, even of Heathen Schools, to the ſhame of moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
Is not Chriſts intereſt the beſt way to ſettle yours? Can
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114747:30"/>
you be ſafe when that miſcarries? The Lord awaken all our
Magiſtrates to mind this in earneſt. This <hi>Principium</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>dimidium totius,</hi> yea, <hi>dimidium plus toto.</hi> Will not the late
experiences of our Engliſh Worthies, with thoſe of the former
Champions of Chriſt, demonſtrate fully this? Was it not their
zeal for God that made them great before God and good men?
Conſult all Records, Hebrew and Greek, Latin and French,
German and Engliſh for proof. Our famous <hi>Alfred,</hi> our
conquering <hi>Edward</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, in the very heat of continual Warres
made it their chief work to preferre Chriſt in all, and to caſt all
their Crowns at his feet. Their glorifying of him ſo eminently,
made them truly glorious in their own and future ages. Such
a Whet will never prove a Let to any, from any true good.
Are not the ſubjects right, peace and ſafety, the proper gifts of
God? Can we finde out any better way of procuring or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
them, than by keeping cloſe to him, and being active
for him? Whilſt we cordially mind his intereſt, will not he
ſurely minde ours? If we forget him, can we look to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
of him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 11. If Magiſtrates muſt judge and puniſh of matters of
Religion, the Magiſtrate muſt ever be troubled with ſuch persons
and ſuch cauſes: and if after his conſcience be convinced, he
had no ſuch power, what horrors of conſcience is he like to
poſſeſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Magiſtrate is the Lords Shepherd,<note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 28.</note> as he cals <hi>Cyrus,</hi>

of warre againſt his Sovereigns enemies.<note place="margin">John 15.</note> He is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi>
the Father of his Country,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49. 23.</note> who cannot but be often taken up
in compoſing the differences of that great Family. He is the
Lords Gardiner, and will not think much to be ſtill troubled
with weeding work. He is a Nurſing father, and knows what
renewed troubles attend that employment. All his Titles of
honour mind him of duty and trouble. But his great comfort
is, that God himſelf takes the beſt ſhare thereof, in whoſe ſtead
he acts. To act for God, and with God, like God and through
God, is his honour and happineſs. Chriſt himſelf ſuffered
much more than all that comes to. But what if his conſcience
ſhould afterwards check him for miſtakes therein? The ſure
way to prevent horrors of conſcience,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> is to be diligent in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114747:31"/>
Lords work, that our reſpective Callings do challenge from us.

Retort the Query you may thus then;<note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 5.</note> What horrors of
conſcience ſhall that Magiſtrate feel, that hath minded himſelf
in neglecting God? that hath been zealous for Civil affairs,
but frozen to the Lords intereſt? that hath done much for the
world, but little for heaven? that hath been carefull of the
ſubjects bodies, but careleſs of their ſouls? that thought no

much for ſpiritual help?</p>
            <p>

Though worldly ſpirits will ſlight and abuſe the ſimplicity
thereof; yet ſpiritual hearts will admire and improve ſtill the

finde it experimentally to have a moſt quickning Spirit. Though
the ſuperficial Reader will finde its ſhell and bark to be hard

and tenderneſs of its kernell and marrow. Though deluded
Impoſtors will pervert it ſtill to the taking off the Magiſtrate

ſeparated from God, and his Truth, to give up

them up to a perverſe ſpirit, to break them into fractions and
factions, both in Church and State, even as he doth now by
ſad experience. Becauſe they would not be ſeparated from the

of ſo many Myriads into Phariſaiſm and Sadduciſm, followed
cloſe by the Monkiſh Eſſens, and the Politick Herodians, thoſe
State ſeparatiſts. The like befell the Chriſtian Churches in the

The <hi>Roman</hi> Antichriſt, to ſet up his own Traditional Liſt,

defects, inſufficiency and corruption. The Quaking
Libertines, their baſtard brood, hath done what they could

wholly denied the need and uſe thereof. But becauſe they loſt
credit thereby,<note place="margin">Plinius. Plutarch <hi>See</hi> Bellarm. Stapleton.</note> on a ſudden in all places, they agreed upon
the owning of it, at leaſt, verbally, that they might the better

Now that in words they profeſs to own the Scripture, how deal
they with it? Juſt as the Romaniſts, that give it as little credit
as they can. Both Originals, Hebrew and Greek, muſt be
ſlighted and ſlandered as corrupt; the Vulgar Tranſlation
exalted above them. Then there is no abſolute need of it,
they can live well enough without it, by Traditional and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical

Are not errours the diſeaſes of mens ſouls; and is there no

way to cure them, but by letting them alone? Your inſtance
from the Prelates is to little purpoſe, unleſs you intend to plead
their cauſe, or can demonſtrate the caſe in hand to be like
theirs. It's not our work to revive now that Controverſie,
which ſo many able pens have ſufficiently cleared from miſtakes.
Their Perſons we leave for account to their only Judge. Their
Miniſterial Office, though corrupted many waies, we can own
ſo farre as therein they owned Gods inſtitution, whilſt we ſever
from it all humane inventions and corruptions. Their Lordly
Pomp and Tyrannical carriage we heartily renounce, hoping
that all good men among them have done the like. Their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped
Juriſdiction and ſelf advancing Authority above their

if not cordial friendſhip, to the Popiſh Arminian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
which are now put into a more faſhionable garb, by

Truth prevailed at laſt, though after much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

followers of Truth, in this ſeaſon alſo, may obtain a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſucceſs, againſt the recruits which that old enemy hath
rallied again, under new Colours. Yet dare we not limit our
General Chriſt, in the time or manner of relieving us. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
our hour of Temptation is not yet over; we may haply
undergo yet longer the contradictions of many ſinners, as our
former Worthies did, in their oppoſing the Romiſh Invaſions.
Our incouragement is, that Truth will prevail to Gods honour
and to the ſhame of errour. It becomes therefore all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to be more zealous and faithfull in their ſeveral places,
for Truth againſt Errour. Magiſtrates and Miniſters being
Officers of note under the Lord of Hoaſts, ſhould be moſt
forward therein, as becomes their ſeveral Functions, that
Satans ſuggeſtions may be hindred, and the vain imaginations
of mens hearts: That darkneſs may be expelled thence, and
light ſet is ſtead thereof. That great God, who hath promiſed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114747:35"/>

               </note> that the Purchaſe of his Son may
be compleatly applied to all his Elect, according to the eternal

labours of his ſervants in ſubordination thereto, within their
ſeveral capacities. Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants of his, whether
Superiour or inferiours, whom their Maſter coming ſhall find
ſo doing. It concerns every one to begin at our own hearts,
that Satans ſuggeſtions may not be yielded to, but that Chriſt
may garriſon them effectually, againſt all the black Regiments
of hell. We muſt look therefore more watchfully to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of thoſe vain imaginations in our hearts, which are
ſtill acting againſt the Crown of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 5.</note> by correſponding
treacherouſly with the common enemy.<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 8.</note> We are naturally
darkneſs, and retain too much of it, at the beſt; the more
need have we to attend the light of his Truth and Grace, that
we being made light in the Lord, may walk as children of light.
The ſenſible experience of that gracious work will render us
more capable of furthering it in others. To effect ſuch a cure,
all impediments muſt be removed, former cauſes prevented,
and ſutable means uſed, as in Eccleſiaſticall, ſo in Political
relations, by the Lords peculiar ſervants, appointed to that

            <head>Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>IN the cloſe of our Queriſts Paper, we meet with a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi>
written with another hand, which was thought fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
here, that they might not miſs of their own, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of ſuppreſſing any part. It runs thus,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:114747:36"/>
The main end of the Propoſer in theſe modeſt Questions, is to
aſſert Chriſt to be the ſole Lord and Ruler in and over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
who obtained the ſame by vertue of his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
for to this end ſaith the Scripture, Chriſt died, roſe and
revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living, and
that every one might give an account unto God and Chriſt alone,
as their own Maſter, unto whom they ſtand or fall in judgement;
and are not in theſe things to be oppreſſed and brought before the
Judgement ſeats of men; for why ſhouldſt thou ſet at naught thy
brother in matters of his faith and Conſcience, and herein intrude
into the proper Office of Chriſt? ſince we are all to ſtand before the
Judgement ſeat of Chriſt, whether Governours or governed; and
with his Deciſion only, are capable of being declared, either in the
right, or in the wrong.</p>
            <p>This ſpecious Concluſion deſerves a few Animadverſions.</p>
            <p>1. He would inſinuate thereby, whoever be the Author, that
all this labour tends to the Vindication and advance of Chriſts
Prerogative; whereas their deſire, if obtained, would prove
moſt deſtructive thereto, as we have demonſtrated ſufficiently
in the preceding Anſwers.</p>
            <p>2. He propoſes his deſires ſo generally, for Univerſal Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in all matters of Worſhip, that the vileſt Blaſphemies,
the groſſeſt Idloatry, and moſt deſperate Hereſies are not to be
excluded from it.</p>
            <p>3. He would perſwade that the Scripture is altogether for it,
whereas it's as diametrally oppoſite thereto, as heaven is to hell,
as hath been cleared.</p>
            <p>4. He ſtrives to ſtrip the Magiſtrate of the beſt Jewel of his
Crown, and the chiefeſt part of his Authority, wherewith he
is entruſted by Chriſt, in his ſtead; the preſervation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of his Worſhip, according to his own written Word.</p>
            <p>5. He opens a gap thereby to the greateſt flood of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and wickedneſs, that ever can be imagined, to the ſwift and
deſperate overwhelming of Truth and Peace, both in Church
and State.</p>
            <p>6. He ſweetens this poyſoned Cup with a handfull of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
quotations, and plauſible expreſſions of Gods Word,
but miſerably wreſted and miſapplied, as will appear to the
Judicious peruſer thereof; for inſtance,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 9, 10.</note> the words of Scripture
he uſes, we find them in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114747:36"/>
as its moſt clear, by comparing them with the context and ſcope
of that Chapter, that there is no diſcourſe of the Magiſtrates
power there (ſufficiently cleared elſewhere) but of every
Chriſtians liberty in indifferent circumſtantials, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
about Jewiſh meats, drinks and daies, wherein he would
not have them to offend, nor take offence, by raſhneſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor remain unſetled in their conſcience about the ſame,
ſhewing that the Kingdom of God conſiſts not in meats, drinks,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note>
or any ſuch externals, but in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in
the holy Ghoſt. That therefore they ſhould uſe Chriſtian
wiſdom, tenderneſs and diligence towards each other, for their
mutual edification. There was then a ſpecial ground moving
thereto, becauſe the Jewiſh Worſhip having been ſo long in
force, and being but lately removed, many of the Chriſtian
converts, (the Jews eſpecially) thought themſelves bound ſtill
to the obſervance thereof, which offended others, who were
better informed. Therefore the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1, 2, 4.</note>(who became all
things to all in ſuch indifferent matters) did uſe much compll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and forbearance in this caſe towards weak Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Act. 18. 18.</note>
preſſing others to do the like,<note place="margin">Act. 21. 23, 24.</note> as in other places alſo, yea him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
made uſe ſometimes of thoſe Jewiſh Ceremonials, having
circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſhaven his head, made vows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to win
the more upon the Jews his Countrymen, who were ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly
incenſed againſt him for his leaving their way. Thus the
Ceremonial Rites were gradually to receive an <hi>honourable burial.</hi>
They had been <hi>Salutiferi</hi> and precious means of grace under
that Moſaical diſpenſation of the Lords gracious Covenant,
each of them holding forth ſomething of Chriſt, being the
bark, the ſhell and garment of his ſubſtantial grace, cloathed
therewith.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> They began to appear <hi>mortui,</hi> and expire after
Chriſts death,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 14.</note> having been nailed to his Croſs, as being a Law
of Typical Ordinances,<note place="margin">John 19. 30.</note> which were to end, at his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all things. Yet ſome time was required to ſatisfie the
Jewiſh converts therewith, before the total removal of them all.
Whence that famous Synod of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 25. 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> found it needfull to
indulge ſome of them for a while; yet when many Seducers
began to preſs the neceſſity of that Ceremonial Law, teaching
them to reſt thereon alſo for righteouſneſs, at <hi>Coloſſus</hi> in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi>
&amp;c. then did <hi>Paul</hi> appear expreſly againſt them in his
Epiſtles,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 11.</note> yea he reſiſted <hi>Peter</hi> to his face about it. That Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114747:37"/>
Synod alſo, proceeded formally againſt them, and ſo
ſetled the Chriſtian Worſhip,<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> allowing a ſolemn funeral to
thoſe Ceremonial Rites, which afterwards became <hi>Lethiferi</hi>
and deadly, in the abuſe thereof. The ſenſe then of this whole
fourteenth Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> being ſo clear, it's a groſs
perverting thereof, to perſwade thereby an univerſal Toleration
of all irreligion and baſeneſs, if it be but mantled with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of conſcience.</p>
            <p>7. Obſerve a cozening Paralogiſm, and falſe arguing run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through every vein of this cloſe, as of all the Queries;
concluding from a particular affirmative, to univerſal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
pleading for a Toleration of all things, in all perſons,
in point of Religion, becauſe ſome, in ſome Circumſtantials
were to be born with by private Chriſtians, and to forbear each
other in their judgement thereof.</p>
            <p>8. If any of theſe Arguments ſhould have any force to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Magiſtrates power, in ruling the externals of man by
Civil Laws and penalties, according to the clear Word of God
in the point of Worſhip, (which is the thing controverted
here, if any) it will be as effectual againſt every power of the
Magiſtrate, about the ſecond Table alſo, there being no evil
ſo great, but it hath been and may ſtill be diſguiſed, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Conſcience, witneſs the Ranting and Quaking crue of
<hi>Germany,</hi> in the former Century; and their diſciples now
among us, as <hi>James Nailer, George Fox,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratical
Office will be wholly taken away, and that grand Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of heaven, appointed ſo eminently for Gods honour
and mans good ſhall be enervated and nullified.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was peruſing of the forenamed Papers, I was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
to review a Book, Printed 1644. by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Charles Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
Intitled, <hi>The Sterming of Antichriſt in his two laſt and
ſtrongeſt Garriſons of Compulſion of Conſcience, and Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi>
and find theſe Queries to be extracted out of that Book,
at leaſt a full agreement therewith almoſt in every word, if not
altogether. Many Books of the like nature, as the <hi>Bloody
Tenent,</hi> and other Pamphlets, have been ſcattered up and down
theſe Nations within theſe twelve years, as the like were in
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> formerly: The point of whoſe Reaſons are
ſo unhappily bent, that if it prove any thing, it will prove the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114747:37"/>
ſubverſion of all Magiſtratical power. It's a Levelling princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of ſo ſad a conſequence, and the ground thereof ſo laid
upon a continued miſtake of Scripture and Reaſon, that it
nearly concerns all Chriſts friends, and all true Patriots to detect
and diſclaim the fallaciouſneſs thereof. As for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi>
piece; his ſecond part about Infant-Baptiſm was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
confuted, with all the Books of the like import, by
many choice pens. In 1654. <hi>Blake</hi> his Antagoniſt, printed
a full anſwer thereto, which was ſucceeded by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Marſhals</hi>
Vindication, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baxters,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Sydenhams,</hi> and others in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
as in <hi>Ireland</hi> by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Winter,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Worth,</hi> &amp;c. Who have
maintained this ſort of Chriſts Kingdom againſt all the aſſaults
of diſſenters. And for his firſt part about compulſion of
conſcience, it labors of the ſame miſtakes that we have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our Queriſt all along, beſides ſeveral ſelf-contradictions.
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Cobbet</hi> anſwered M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Blackwood</hi> and his conſorts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Infant-Baptiſm long ago to the full; and hath anſwered
all oppoſers of the Magiſtrates Power, in his late piece printed
1653. moſt ſubſtantially. When thoſe ſolid pieces of his
and others, about theſe points, are anſwered to the purpoſe,
diſſenters may be further heard. Till then, we ſhall have little
reaſon to regard, what ſhall be ſaid or written by any of
them in their ranewed cavils, touching the ſame, ſo fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuted
already. It's the fatal lot of Arguments mounted againſt
Truth in our late controverſies, eſpecially about the Magiſtrates
power; that either they are too weakly or too ſtrongly charged,
either ſaying nothing, or proving more then they would grant
themſelves: either they charge not to any purpoſe; or elſe
they over-charge, and break, doing miſchief to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>I have been perſwaded to publiſh theſe hints for a caution to
all in theſe ſlippery dayes, wherein ſo many profeſſors are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſlide into groſs errors before they be aware. My heart
cannot but bleed at the ſenſible review of our unchriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies
from the Will and Wayes of God. The woful diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods people, and the multiplied deluſions of ſeducers
among us, could not but move my pen after the moving of my
heart. The crouding of Quakers into theſe parts, eſpecially
into this<note n="*" place="margin">In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1656.</note> City, hath been a great occaſion of theſe lines. The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114747:38"/>
forenamed Quere clandeſtinely ſealed up and ſuperſcribed to
Colonel <hi>Henry Ingoldſbey,</hi> our Vigilant Governor, to diſſwade
him from that noble Work, whereto he found himſelf emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
obliged for Chriſt and the publike in the diſcharge of his
great Truſt here. The tumultuouſneſs of the Quaking rout
had ſeveral times diſturbed, both the Worſhipers of God, and
the publick Peace. They had enſnared many of our ſouldiers,
infected divers of our Citizens, gathered many diſciples in the
Garriſons and Country, and railed moſt vilely at the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Miniſters of Chriſt. They had ſpread multitudes of
Pamphlets, Libels and Papers, full of their ſad ſtuffe, and by
all poſſible ways labored to gather a ſtrong party, deſperatly
engaged to their way. What the drift and iſſue thereof might
prove, the Judicious might eaſily gueſs by ſuch demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Divers Papiſts among us began to like their way, finding
it ſo like to the Monkiſh courſe of their Friars; many ignorant
and unſtable ſouls were daily enſnared and endangered, publike
Out cries were made by their party againſt our faithful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and other Magiſtrates, eſpecially againſt the Perſons and
Office of the Goſpel Miniſters, as alſo againſt Chriſts Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
his Word, Sacraments, Prayers, Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They
moleſted us daily from ſeveral parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
Being turned out, they returned again with their old tricks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.
Our watchful Governor could not be quiet for them,
nor any of the Lords faithful ſervants, <hi>Francis Hogil,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Burrough John Perrot</hi> and Cornet <hi>Cock, Humphrey Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and <hi>William Ames, Barbary Blaydon,</hi> and <hi>Sarah Bennet,</hi>
with divers others of that Gang, have been ſo extreamly
troubleſome, that our Governor was forced to take the beſt
courſe he could for their conviction and others ſafety. I my
ſelf had ſpent divers hours, at divers ſeaſons, with the chief of
them, and peruſed their Papers and Books, full of abſurd and
vile Notions: No means attempted could do them any good.
Their ſugard ſtuffe was eaſily ſwallowed down, by ſuch whoſe
mind was ſeeking ſtill where to ſettle; their <hi>Circean</hi> cup pleaſed
diſtempered Palats. To take of the zeal off our Rulers, if they
could, the aforeſaid Queries were ſecretly diſperſed here,
the peruſal where of ſtirred up my Spirit to the detecting of that
cheat.</p>
            <p>I had alſo thought to have anſwered the Quakers Queries
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114747:38"/>
ſent me before, which they importunately preſſed in to their
uſual Rhetorick,<note place="margin">Prov. 26. 4, 5.</note> having an eye to that of the Wiſe man, of
anſwering a fool, effectually, though not in his way. But
finding the ſaid Queries to be the very ſame in ſubſtance, if not
<hi>verbatim,</hi> which as a common Babble, they had formerly been
ſent to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Eaton,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Baxter,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Farmer,</hi> and others by their
conſorts, already fully anſwered, I deſiſted not willing to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
ſo much precious time; The multiplicious Work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I am neceſſitated in this City, by my Miniſterial Call, affords
me not many hours of reſpite, and may ſufficiently Apologize
for any defect in this book, whether for matter, method, or
expreſſion; yet could not my heart reſt till it had breathed
forth its oppreſſing troubles in this weak manner, that all ſuch
who own the Lords honor and the Publike Weal, might have
this warning to awaken. The noiſe of a few deſpiſed creatures
were once inſtrumental to the ſaving of a famous State, by ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Capitol.<note place="margin">Tit. Liv. Flor.</note> The ſounding of Rams horns, by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
was inſtrumentally bleſſed from above,<note place="margin">Joſh. 6. 20.</note> to the
pulling down of <hi>Jericho's</hi> Walls:<note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Maximus Deus, et in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</hi>
A weak crooked tool in the Lords hand may ſerve his
turn, for the greateſt work at his pleaſere. If either by this or
any thing elſe any benefit accrew to Chriſts friends, let him
have the Glory, and forget not in thy beſt Addreſſes him,
whom the Lord hath made in any degree ſerviceable to thy
good. It's his hearts deſire to be made faithful to God and his
people that he may ſpend and be ſpent a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight in the finiſhing of
his courſe with joy. That Chriſt may be All in All things to
thee, is his longing deſire, and ſhall be ſtill his conſtant
prayer.</p>
