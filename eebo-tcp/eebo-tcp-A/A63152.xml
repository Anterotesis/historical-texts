         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, you will ſee by the Evidence that there hath been a Deſign and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy on foot for ſeveral Years to Aſſaſſinate the King's Perſon, and to have an Invaſion from <hi>France</hi> at that time by an Armed Force here to ſubdue this Kingdom. The Priſoner at the Bar about two Years ago had a Commiſſion ſent him from the late King <hi>James</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, which he accepted of: there were ſeveral other Commiſſions likewiſe ſent to the Priſoner, and he did in purſuance thereof appoint his ſeveral Officers, and liſted ſeveral Men for that purpoſe, and expended ſeveral Sums of Money for the retaining of them. That his Lieut. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel was to be one <hi>Brice Blair,</hi> and for his Major one <hi>Sclater:</hi> this <hi>Sclater,</hi> it ſeems, his Father had been a Clergy-man, and he did engage to bring in Men into his Troop that were Clergy-men, who refuſed to take the Oaths; one of his Captains was to be one <hi>Everard,</hi> another was to be one <hi>Richardſon,</hi> with ſeveral other Officers which he had engaged in the Deſign, with which he had appointed to make up his Regiment.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will hear further by the Witneſſes that about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, they having raiſed a conſiderable Number of Men that were ready here, there were ſeveral Meetings that were had between the Priſoner at the Bar, and ſeveral other Perſons, in order to ſend one over, in order to procure Force from <hi>France</hi> to invade this Kingdom. The firſt Meeting you will hear of, was at the Old King's Head Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in <hi>Leadenhall-ſtreet</hi>; there were preſent the Priſoner at the Bar, my Lord

                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> Pelling,</hi> Sir <hi>John Fenwick, Charnock,</hi> (who was lately executed) <hi>Porter,</hi> and one <hi>Cook,</hi> at that Meeting. You ſhall hear what the Debates were, and what was the Reſolution, and that was to ſend over <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock:</hi> ſeveral Debates there were among them who to ſend; at laſt it was reſolved to ſend over <hi>Charnock</hi> to <hi>France</hi> to propoſe to the late King <hi>James</hi> their Deſign, and to deſire of him to prevail with the French King to furniſh and ſend 8000 Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons; and impowered him to aſſure the late King <hi>James,</hi> that whenſoever he ſhould land with thoſe Forces, they would be ready to join him, and aſſiſt him with near 2000 Horſe; among them they undertook to do ſo much: accordingly this <hi>Charnock</hi> did undertake to go upon this Meſſage: About a Week after they were to meet again, for <hi>Charnock</hi> was unwilling to go on ſuch an Errand, without having an Aſſurance from them that they ſtill continued in their Reſolution taken up, for acquainting King <hi>James</hi> what they would do; and about a Week after they met at Mrs. <hi>Montjoy</hi>'s a Tavern, where were the Priſoner at the Bar, with thoſe of the ſame Company as before; and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know of them whether they did ſtill agree to what had been propoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on before, that ſo he might not go on this Errand, without very good Aſſurance that they did all agree to aſſure the late King <hi>James</hi> that they would aſſiſt him upon his Landing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they had but notice of his Landing, when and where he would land; and withal, they deſired that he would make haſte. And obſerve, Gentlemen, the time of this Meeting was <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, as ſoon as the King was gone to <hi>Flanders</hi>; and they thought this a very fit Opportunity when the King was gone, and the Forces drawn out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and very few Forces in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore a very proper Reaſon for the Invaſion to be made. Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> went over accordingly to <hi>France,</hi> and about a Month after returned again, and told them that he had acquainted the late King <hi>James</hi> with the Reſolution that had been taken here, and that the late King <hi>James</hi> told him that he thanked them for their Readineſs to aſſiſt him; but that at that time the French King could not ſpare any Men, ſo that at that time their Deſign could not be accompliſhed; therefore it was reſpited till laſt Winter, and laſt Winter you will hear their Deſign was renew'd again; and about <hi>January</hi> laſt, Sir <hi>George Berclay</hi> came over from <hi>France</hi> with ſeveral Troopers, pretending to be diſcharg'd; and they entred into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to Aſſaſſinate the King, and to prepare for an Invaſion; that was to be done firſt, to facilitate the Invaſion, which was immediately to follow upon it; and they thought they ſhould not have a good Aſſurance of Succeſs ſo long as the King lived: and I hope every Body will take notice how precious that Life is to be accounted of by us when the Succeſs of their Conſpiracy depended upon the taking that Life away.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, you will hear this Deſign of Aſſaſſinating the King, the Priſoner at the Bar was acquainted with, but did not approve of it, for he thought it would be a Diſſervice to the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Affairs; but he was at the Meeting with thoſe Conſpirators, <hi>Charnock</hi> and <hi>Berclay,</hi> and others, and got acquainted with it, as you will hear.</p>
               <p>You will hear further, that about <hi>January</hi> laſt, when the Invaſion was intended to be made, the Priſoner had frequent Meetings with this <hi>Blair</hi> his Lieut. Colonel, and other his Officers, to conſider how to prepare and be in a Readineſs; at that time <hi>Blair,</hi> and the Priſoner, and Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> met at a Place in <hi>Exchange-Alley,</hi> and there were Diſcourſes among them; and <hi>Blair</hi> ſaid there was a very conſiderable Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick ſent over to the late King <hi>James,</hi> and he would bring the laſt Orders from him; and Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> ſaid, he knew very well of it that it was ſo, that he ſhould have theſe Orders quickly. At another time this <hi>Blair</hi> and the Priſoner Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> met at <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, and from thence he took him in his Coach along with him, and there they had great Conſultations about the Affairs of his Regiment: and the Priſoner told him, that they muſt be good Husbands of their Money, for if this Invaſion ſhould miſcarry, he ſhould not have Money enough to carry on his Trade: That he would take care to mount many Officers that could do it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but many of them could not do it at their own Charge; and thoſe who could not do it, he would take care to do it for them. They had then a Diſcourſe of the <hi>Thoulon</hi>-Fleet coming about, and that it was thought proper not to ſtir nor make any Appearance till the <hi>Thoulon</hi>-Fleet came about: And the Priſoner ſaid, he would not put his Foot into the Stirrup till then, but would keep it private, leſt they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105154:5"/>
ſhould be ſeized; and that he would skulk about till every thing was in a Readineſs, and adviſed <hi>Blair</hi> to do ſo too. And you will hear it further proved, That about <hi>May</hi> laſt the Priſoner did pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> to this <hi>Blair,</hi> to reimburſe him what Money he had laid out on the Affairs of his Regiment; and it was in this manner, They had all heard that <hi>Parker</hi> was in the <hi>Tower</hi> for High Treaſon, and that he had made his Eſcape, to which the Priſoner at the Bar was privy, and that it had coſt 300 <hi>l.</hi> and that the Priſoner had laid down an hundred Pounds of it; but this was paid in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be paid him again, and was aſſured by one <hi>Johnſon</hi> a Prieſt, that he would ſee him paid, and accordingly one <hi>Piggott</hi> went over to <hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>Piggott</hi> had the 100 <hi>l.</hi> paid him again by the late King <hi>James,</hi> to repay Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>; but when he came back, <hi>Piggott</hi> thought fit to keep it, and Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> durſt not ask him for it, becauſe of the Advantage the other might take upon him, ſo did not dare inſiſt upon it. But when <hi>Blair</hi> preſs'd him for Money that he had laid out upon the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he told him that this <hi>Piggott</hi> had received an hundred Pounds, which he had laid down upon the account of <hi>Parker,</hi> and that he ought to pay it him, but had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſo to do; and therefore, ſays he, if you will prevail with this <hi>Johnſon</hi> the Prieſt, who was obliged to ſee me paid, to get this 100 Pound paid me accordingly; you ſhall have 20 of the 100 Pound: and thereupon <hi>Blair</hi> did prevail with <hi>Johnſon</hi> to aſſiſt in the getting this 100 Pound from <hi>Piggott,</hi> and then the 20 Pound was paid to <hi>Blair</hi> by <hi>Piggott,</hi> at the Deſire of Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and upon the Solicitation of <hi>Johnſon.</hi> Theſe Sums you will find were paid by Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> to Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> who was his Lieut. Colonel, and to whom he intruſted the Management of the Regiment in great meaſure.</p>

               <p>It is his Lordſhip's Pleaſure that I do deliver my Opinion; and it is, that no Man is bound to anſwer a Queſtion that tends to ſubject him to the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any Law. If you ask him whether he be a Deer-ſtealer, or a Vagabond, or guilty of Petit-larcenary, the Law will not force a Man to diſcover it againſt himſelf. Now for the purpoſe, whether he be a Popiſh Recuſant, if he were not trained up in that Religion, it is to ask him to accuſe himſelf of as great a Crime as you ſtand charged for: But if it were only that he were a Roman Catholick, there are very great Penalties and Forfeitures that he is liable to in his Eſtate, and perhaps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Confeſſion can't otherwiſe be proved againſt him. We muſt keep the Law even and ſteady between the Priſoner and the Witneſs. By the Law he is not bound to diſcover.</p>

Mr. <hi>Chernock</hi> made this Reply, I don't care to go on a fooliſh Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and therefore let me know what you promiſe to do.

I deſire to know if you have not done this? Pray Sir anſwer me to that: There is a God you muſt give an account to as well as I; Anſwer me if you have not writ theſe Lines to me?</p>

Says he, Come I will deſire you to go to our end of the Town, and take a Diſh of Meat with us; and I went up thither, and there was not a word ſpoken. Gentlemen, I am a Proteſtant, and they are Papiſts, and care not what they ſay: They think they merit Heaven by deſtroying Proteſtants by what they ſay, and they are not to be believed, that is the reaſon I put that Queſtion; and they are not VVitneſſes to be allowed, and for that I appeal to your Lordſhip; they think they merit Heaven by deſtroying Proteſtants. My Lord, They are not good VVitneſſes againſt Proteſtants, by 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.</p>

               <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> Night I came to ſee <hi>Blair,</hi> and his Wife was with him; and he was claſping his Hands, Groaning and Mourning in a miſerable condition, and I thought giving up the Ghoſt: He was in ſo miſerable a condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Priſon was very cold and no Air. I asked if he would drink a Glaſs of Brandy. He told me no. I underſtand, ſaid I, that you are going to Morrow to <hi>Hicks</hi>'s <hi>Hall</hi> to Witneſs againſt Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>: O, ſays he, Pray God direct us all; Life is Sweet. Says his Wife, he would never do it but to ſave his Life; he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience, and ſo ſaid he. Said I, you have the Character of an honeſt Gentleman, ever ſince I knew you; have a care you do not wrong your Conſcience. O, ſays he, that is the only thing, the only thing, or to that purpoſe, and ſhew'd all the Remorſe in the World. I ſpeak this Innocently, and with a great deal of Pity. This hath been communicated to one and another, and ſo I am ſent for.</p>

               <p>I believe, my Lord, Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> is a very ſettled Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England</hi> I have frequently diſcourſed with him upon it: I have a couple of Children that are his Nephews, on whoſe Account I am forced ſeveral times to wait upon him, and trouble him.

               <p>If theſe two Gentlemen, <hi>Blair</hi> and <hi>Porter,</hi> and none but theſe two; if they are Papiſts, they are not good Witneſſes againſt a Proteſtant, to prove him a Traytor, by 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. For that Statute ſays, He that is Indicted muſt be proved Attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which can't be by the Evidence of Papiſts; and that becauſe they do refuſe to take the Oaths of Allegiance required to be taken: And therefore I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your Lordſhip that you will be pleaſed to tender them the Oaths; for there is a Statute, 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. I deſire they may be tendred their Oaths.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir J. Friend.</speaker>
               <p>They are not ſubſtantial Witneſſes; for this is the Law, as I am informed. I only ſpeak as I did at firſt, before ever they were ſworn: I deſired to know when 'twas convenient for me to inſiſt upon this, before ever they were ſworn. I asked whether they were Papiſts; that they would not tell me, that was not allowed of; it was over-ruled by the Court. But there is ſuch a Statute, and my Witneſſes have ſaid that they are Papiſts; there lies a great deal upon it, my Lord; and I humbly beſeech your Lordſhip, I hope you will not take it amiſs that I do inſiſt upon it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Then Mr. Sollicitor General ſpoke to the Court and the Jury, to the Effect following:</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <p>I am of Counſel in this Cauſe for the King, againſt the Priſoner at the Bar; and it is my turn to Sum up the Evidence. The Priſoner cant ſay but he hath had a very fair Tryal, and has no Reaſon to complain, for all the reſt of it ſhall be alike. He and you may very well remember, that Perſons of the ſame Quality in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, have not had that fair Dealing; and though all things are very well
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105154:14"/>
now, yet Time was when it was not ſo: When Innocency was not a Safety for a Man; when not his Life, much leſs his Laws and Liberties were ſecure to him: Time was, when the Proteſtant Religion, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> (of which the Priſoner at the Bar, Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> ſays, he is and boaſts himſelf to be, and with very good Reaſon the beſt) Time was, I ſay, When that Religion was in Danger, and when that Popery (for which he reflects on the Witneſſes now) was like to Over-run us. And had not his Majeſty, with the Hazard of his Life, and great Expence Reſcued us, no body doubts, but that all in a very few Years, would have been made good upon us now. And it is a very melancholy Thing to conſider, That there ſhould be a ſort of People among us now, ſo in love with Popery and Slavery, as to have a Mind to bring it about again: And it is a very ungrateful Thing, that when his Majeſty with danger of his Life then, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times ſince, hath endeavoured to defend us, there ſhould be a Party of Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, who ſhould endeavour to invade his Country, and fall on his Subjects in his Abſence, in order to Subvert his Government. I will not accuſe particularly the Priſoner at the Bar, to have had a Hand in the Aſſaſſination: But very plain it is he knew of it. This, among others, is a very ungrateful thing; when another Perſon is engaged for my Defence, I ſhould contrive and deſign againſt his Life, and be for invading of him. If the Priſoner at the Bar be not Guilty of what he hath been accuſed, nothing of this relates to him: But if what hath been given in Evidence, be true of the Priſoner at the Bar, he is one of thoſe Perſons that hath done all that he can <hi>to ſubvert the Government and to effect the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt Evidence given in againſt him was by Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>; and he gives in Evidence that at the <hi>King's Head</hi> in <hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi> there was a meeting of ſeveral Perſons, among which the Priſoner at the Bar was one, and that, in order to conſider of the beſt means for the bringing back of the late K. <hi>James.</hi> They concluded at laſt the beſt means would be to ſend ſome body over to <hi>France</hi> to Invite K. <hi>James</hi> hither, and to intreat him to prevail with the French King to ſend over with him 1000 Horſe, a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>000 Dragoons, and 8000 Foot, and that he ſhould make what haſt he could to Land with them here; and to Incourage ſo to do, they promiſed their Aſſiſtance, and that they did not doubt to meet him with 2000 Horſe. The perſon pitched on for this Errand, was one <hi>Charnock,</hi> lately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted for High Treaſon. But upon this propoſition <hi>Charnock</hi> was very diffident, whether this was the effect of a ſober conſideration or not, and therefore would not undertake it till he had ſatisfaction that they ſtill continued of the ſame mind: And therefore another Meeting was propoſed and agreed upon of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that was to be at Mrs. <hi>Montjoy</hi>'s Tavern: There they all met again, and the Queſtion being put, Whether they were of the ſame Opinion or not; they did declare themſelves all to be of the ſame Opinion, that Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> ſhould go to <hi>France</hi> on the Meſſage agreed on at the <hi>Kings Head,</hi> and make as ſudden a Return back as he could to give them an Anſwer. Captain <hi>Porter</hi> tells you, that <hi>Charnock</hi> brought word that the French King could not then ſpare them that Force that they deſired. Hereupon it was put off, and their deſign was deferred till laſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then it was likely to take place very lately.</p>
               <p>The next is Cap. <hi>Blair,</hi> and he tells you 2 years ago Sr. <hi>John Friend</hi> ſhewed him a Commiſſion that he had received from the late K. <hi>James</hi> to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, of which he himſelf was to be Colonel. He tells you, it was Signed by K. <hi>James</hi> at the top, and Counterſigned by <hi>Melford</hi> at the bottom; and that he had a great many conſultations with him, and conſiderations about raiſing this Regiment; and that he was to be Lieutenant Colonel, and was to provide as many Officers as he could, and that he did provide ſeveral Officers, particularly Captain <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Captain <hi>Vernatti,</hi> one <hi>Cole,</hi> one <hi>Bertram</hi>; and he was to be a Lieutenant in one of the Troops. A great deal of the Evidence he gives againſt Sr. <hi>John Friend</hi> was out of his Own mouth, and that is as ſtrong an Evidence certainly as can be given. He doth for that purpoſe tell you that One <hi>Evans</hi> was to be one of the Captains of his Troop; that Colonel <hi>Sclater</hi> a man grown ſomewhat in Favour with Sr. <hi>John Friend</hi> Rival'd this <hi>Blair,</hi> that Sr. <hi>John Friend</hi> told him he would have Two Lieutenant Colonels, and this perſon ſhould be one, and that he took very Ill, and did Reſent it to Sr. <hi>John Friend,</hi> and therefore he told him he would make him a Captain of a Troop of Horſe that ſhould conſiſt of Non-ſwearing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He tells you likewiſe there were liſted ſeveral Men; but the particular
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105154:14"/>
Perſons he could not remember: But they were in the Papers he had given in to the Council. Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> told him Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> was to be another of his Captains of Horſe, and one Mr. <hi>Cole,</hi> another Captain; and to bring in ſeveral Men. He tells you he receiv'd from Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> ſome Summs of Money, and that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> having laid down 100 <hi>l.</hi> about the Eſcape of <hi>Parker</hi> out of the <hi>Tower</hi> (for which was laid down 300 <hi>l.</hi>) Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was to be reimburs'd this 100 <hi>l.</hi> from St. <hi>Germans</hi>; and that one Mr. <hi>Piggott</hi> had re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eiv'd it for Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> but refus'd to pay it to him; and that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was contented he ſhould have 20 <hi>l.</hi> out of that 100 <hi>l.</hi> provided he could get it of Mr. <hi>Piggott:</hi> But Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> not having ſo much Intereſt himſelf as to get the Money of Mr. <hi>Piggott,</hi> applies himſelf to one Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> alias <hi>Johnſon,</hi> by which means he got that 20 <hi>l.</hi> He tells you afterward, he was preſſing on Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> to have another 20 <hi>l.</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> was contented he ſhould have it, if he could get it of Mr. <hi>Piggott.</hi> Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> produceth a Letter that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> writ to him, and excuſeth himſelf, That Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> had not heard from him, but that he would meet him at ſuch a time at ſuch a Coffee-Houſe; in the Letter the Buſineſs of their Meeting was not expreſs'd: That he met accordingly, and there was Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Piggott,</hi> and 5 <hi>l.</hi> of the Second 20 <hi>l.</hi> was paid; this Second 20 <hi>l.</hi> was paid on Account of Charges Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> had been at, in Drinking with the Liſted Men to incourage them. There was another Letter that Sir <hi>John</hi> ſaid he writ to King <hi>James</hi>; he ſhewed him this Letter at Mr. <hi>Piggott</hi>'s Mother's Houſe. He told Sir <hi>John</hi> it was ſo very well Penn'd, he ſuſpected it was not Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>'s Penning, but Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi>'s: He tells you, That thereupon Sir <hi>John</hi> was very angry, that he ſuſpected him not to have penn'd that Letter. This ſhew'd the Intelligence; and that this Letter was upon the Inviting King <hi>James.</hi> He tells you likewiſe, That Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi> told him that he had Four Troops ready for that Service; and tells you alſo, he was to be one to ſerve in this Regiment under Sir <hi>John Friend:</hi> That Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> was to bring in a conſiderable Number of Men to him; and all this was to be put in Practice when the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet came about to join the <hi>Breſt</hi> Fleet: And likewiſe, when he was with him in his Coach, he ſaid they muſt act very warily, and be good Husbands; and that it had coſt him ſo much Money, that if the Fleet did not come quickly, he ſhould want Money to carry on his Trade. Theſe are poſitive Witneſſes againſt Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> as of his own Knowledge, and moſt of it from his own Mouth. Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> he tells you, was a good Proteſtant, and the two Witneſſes Roman Catholicks; but this is no Objection againſt their Evidence. It was never known before, but that a Roman Catholick may be a very honeſt Man, and a good Witneſs; though Sir <hi>John</hi> knows very well, that they are not very good otherwiſe; yet they may be allowed to be good Witneſſes: For thoſe that were Witneſſes againſt them that lately died, were ingaged in the ſame Deſign with them, which was to Aſſaſſinate the King; and certainly, if any thing could have taken off their Evidence, it ſhould have been that: But that was ſo far from making them no Witneſſes, that it ſtrengthned their Evidence. For though a Roman Catholick may be a very honeſt Man otherwiſe, it is more likely for him to ingage in ſuch a Deſign than any other Man; and Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> might not find enough of other Religions, than that of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for that Deſign; and ſo it is plain he ingaged with thoſe who were moſt likely to ingage in ſuch a Deſign. As to what Mr. <hi>Courtney</hi> tells you of Capt. <hi>Blair</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him in Priſon, he tells you that Diſcourſe did not go ſo far as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; but Mr. <hi>Courtney</hi> grafts upon it. Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> tells you he intruded into his Room, when he had given Order, That no one but his Wife ſhould be permitted to come in. You have heard the Evidence againſt the Priſoner, and if you believe what our Witneſſes have ſaid, Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> and Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> then certainly Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> is Guilty of all the Crimes charged in the Indictment: And I hope you will be ſo Juſt to your Prince, to your Country, and to your Friends, as to find him Guilty accordingly.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> one of the King's Council, ſpoke to the Court and the Jury to this Effect.</hi>

            <sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not think there is any thing neceſſary to be ſaid to the Court; and I think, hardly to the Jury: But (if poſſibly we may) to convince the Priſoner at the Bar, that he has not, nor ſhall have, any hard Meaſure; but that he is Guilty of the Crimes whereof he ſtands accuſed in the Indictment: And to ſhew you that there is no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105154:15"/>
Weight in his Defence, the Firſt Part of his Defence is from ſome Diſcourſe he would object againſt Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> in the Priſon of the Gate-Houſe. One Part of that Diſcourſe is upon his firſt coming into the Priſon, and then his Objection amounts to only this; That Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> when pumpt by ſome of the Priſoners, would not confeſs to them that he was ingaged in that horrid Deſign: But how empty that Objection is, I would leave to them who would judge whether a Man (newly taken into Priſon, and in Company with Perſons who would not have liked him, nay, may be, have deſtroyed him in Priſon for that very Confeſſion of his) were likely to own it.</p>
               <p>Another Diſcourſe was on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, the Day before he was to go to <hi>Hick</hi>'s-<hi>Hall,</hi> and then this Perſon intruded himſelf into his Chamber, when he had ordered that no Body ſhould be permitted to be let in; and he comes with a Cup of Brandy in his Hand, and good Advice, That he ſhould have a Care what he did; and then he ſaid Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> did expreſs ſome Reluctancy about the thing he was going upon, the next Day: If that were true (but he denies it) when going to depoſe a Truth againſt an old Friend and Companion, it was no more than what he did when he firſt came into Court, when he was going to depoſe a Truth, That he told Sir <hi>John</hi> he was very loath to depoſe that againſt him, which he was forced now to do.</p>
               <p>Another Part of his Evidence is, That he brings Witneſſes to Prove the Evidence againſt him was by Roman Catholicks, and he a very good Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> If that be true, all that can be gather'd from it is, That a Papiſt engaging in ſo black a Deſign, may be a very good Papiſt; but I am ſure you will all agree with me, that he was a very bad Proteſtant. But whether or no Papiſts may be Abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their Prieſts their falſe Swearing, I can't tell that, for I am not acquainted with their Religion; it may be they may; but I am ſure, the diſſervice they have done to the Popiſh Cauſe, after they had Served it ſo long, will be one of the laſt things they will ever Abſolve them of.</p>
               <p>Another thing he inſiſts on is this: He hath brought two or three Clergymen to Evidence for him that he was very cautious in talking Reflectingly againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that he was not, nor could not be in any Plot; and 'tis to be obſerved, that at all times, that That ſwims uppermoſt, and is moſt frequent in all Diſcourſes, that a Man is moſt engaged in: They ſay nothing introduced thoſe Diſcourſes, but that at all times he frankly declared he was not in any Plot, nor would not be one way or other; as the way that Weak Men and Children diſcover their being ingaged in a thing, is by their conſtantly diſcourſing upon it, and declaring that they would not be concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Another Particular he hath juſt offer'd at, is a Point of Law; but that dropped, and he waved it: He would have had it, That no Roman Catholick could be allowed as an Evidence againſt a Proteſtant. What weight there is in that, Gentlemen, I doubt not but the Court hath given you good Satisfaction in. I would do the Priſoner right; But I would have you conſider, That the Priſoner hath not only been Charged with a bare Conſpiracy; but that he was Ingaged in conſulting an Invaſion, in order to drive out His preſent Majeſty, and Depoſe him from the Crown, which is High-Treaſon by our Law, which way ſoever it be done; whether by a Stab, or Shot, or Levying War.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, I would take Account of the Conſultations held, wherein he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits he was preſent at the two Meetings, where both ſay he was preſent; he only differs in one Point from the Witneſſes: He ſays, Nothing was talked of at theſe Meetings, but general and indifferent things; but the Witneſſes have Sworn what the Diſcourſe was. There is one thing more, that is, Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Evidence; not that we produce it againſt the Priſoner, but to ſupport what was Sworn by Capt. <hi>Blair.</hi> And this is in order to ſatisfie the Court, That there is nothing ſaid againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, neither Maliciouſly nor out of any Envy; for Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> did acquaint Mr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> with the thing at leaſt Two Years ago, and confirmed it with this Circumſtance, That he was to be Capt. <hi>Blair</hi>'s Lieutenant, and Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> Swears the ſame thing. There is Concurrence of Evidence againſt the Priſoner, and great Levity in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: Therefore we leave it with you.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:105154:15"/>
               <hi>Then my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> Summed up the Evidence, to the Effect following.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen of the Jury,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, is Accuſed for High-Treaſon; and the Treaſon that is mentioned in the Indictment, is, Conſpiring, Compaſſing, and Imagining the Death of the King. To Prove this Conſpiring and Compaſſing the King's Death, there are two particular Overt-Acts mainly inſiſted upon; The One, The Agreeing to ſend Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> to perſwade the <hi>French</hi> King to ſend over Forces to Aſſiſt them, who were to furniſh other Forces to raiſe War within this Kingdom, in order to Depoſe the King. The other Overt-Act, Is having a Commiſſion for Procuring and Levying Men, to be ready, in order to Join with the <hi>French</hi> upon their Invaſion, and this for the Reſtitution of King <hi>James,</hi> and total Extirpation of King <hi>William.</hi> Theſe two, as I told you, are the two Overt-Acts that are mainly inſiſted upon; and to Prove him Guilty of theſe, there are two Witneſſes; One is Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> who ſpoke to the Firſt; The other is Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> who ſpoke to the Second. Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> tells you, about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi>June</hi> laſt, he and Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and others he mentioned, were at the <hi>Kings-Head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Leaden-hall-Street,</hi> and there they entred into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the Return of King <hi>James,</hi> and did conſider among themſelves which was the moſt Effectual way and means to have him Reſtored: Thereupon, it was Agreed among them, to ſend a Meſſenger to <hi>France</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> to deſire him to ſollicit the <hi>French</hi> King to furniſh him with 10000 Men to be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> 8000 Foot, 1000 Horſe, and 1000 Dragoons: And that they did agree when theſe Forces were ſent over, that they would be ready to meet and Join them with 2000 Horſe. The Meſſenger they Agreed to ſend, was with them at that very time, and that was Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> lately Tried and Executed. This being determined, <hi>Charnock</hi> makes ready to go on this Expedition; but before he went, it ſeems, he had a deſire to meet with the Company again, for a further Diſcourſe of this Matter, and ſee whether or no they did Perſevere in the Reſolution they formerly took. Thereupon there was another Meeting about a Week or Fourteen Days after, I can't tell which, and that was at Mrs. <hi>Montjoy</hi>'s, and there were Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> and others, of the ſame Company that were before at the <hi>King's-Head,</hi> and there they entred into the Debate of this Matter; the Queſtion was, Whether or no <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>France,</hi> as was formerly determined; and then it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that he ſhould go; and it ſeems, Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> ſaid he went in two or three Days afterward. And Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> tells you further, that Three Weeks or Five Weeks (ſometime afterward) Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> comes back, and Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was taken up upon the Riot, and did not ſee him upon his firſt Return, but afterwards he met with him and ſpoke to him, and asked him, What he had done, and what were the Effects of his Negotiation? He told him, he had done as he was directed; That he had been with King <hi>James,</hi> and that King <hi>James</hi> had ſpoken to the <hi>French</hi> King; but the Anſwer return'd was this, That the <hi>French</hi> King for that Year had Occaſion for his Forces to be otherwiſe employed, and could not ſpare them that Year. Capt. <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ask'd him, Whether he had been with the reſt? He told him, he had acquainted them with the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The next Evidence is Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> to the other part of the Indictment, which is for Raiſing of Men (not Levying of them) he having a Commiſſion from King <hi>James,</hi> for Ingaging of Men to be of his Regiment, of which he was to be Colonel himſelf, and to provide Officers. Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> tells you, Two or Three Years ago he was with Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and Sir <hi>John</hi> did produce a Commiſſion that he had from King <hi>James,</hi> to be a Colonel of a Regiment of Horſe that he was to raiſe. He was to raiſe them himſelf, and to appoint what Officers he thought fit: That he Read the Commiſſion, and it was Signed at the top <hi>James Rex,</hi> and Counter-ſigned <hi>Melford.</hi> Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> promiſed Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> he ſhould be Lieutenant Colonel of that Regiment; and told him, That he ſhould get as many Men as he could; That Mr. <hi>Vernatti</hi> was to be one of his Captains; That Captain <hi>Blair</hi> brought Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> to Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> to be his Firſt Captain: And that there was one Mr. <hi>Sclater,</hi> a Man in Favour with Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and he was to be another Lieutenant Colonel, as he told Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> ſaying, It is no matter if I have two Lieutenant-Colonels in my Regiment: At which, Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> took great Offence, and did expreſs as much to Sir <hi>John Friend.</hi> Thereupon, Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> told him it ſhould not be. I will, ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> make another Proviſion for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105154:16"/>
him; he ſhall be a Captain of a Troop of Non-Swearing Parſons, and that ſhould ſatisfie him. Beſides this, in order to raiſing of Men (no Men were Levied) and for Ingaging Men to contract to come in, and be of his Regiment, He tells you there was Expended a great deal of Money to Careſs them, and keep them together, and to carry on this Deſign. Whereupon Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> came to Sir <hi>John,</hi> and made Complaint that he wanted Money to carry on the Deſign. Upon this, Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> tells him, There is 100 <hi>l.</hi> due to me, which I ought to have upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe I laid down 100 <hi>l.</hi> in order to the facilitating the Eſcape of Col. <hi>Parker</hi> out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and there is one Mr. <hi>Piggott</hi> had Directions to Pay me that 100 <hi>l.</hi> but I can't get it of him; You ſhall have 20 <hi>l.</hi> of that 100 <hi>l.</hi> But how is this to be had? Why, there is one Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> alias <hi>Johnſon</hi> hath an Intereſt in this Mr. <hi>Piggott,</hi> to whom he made his Application, and thereupon 20 <hi>l.</hi> was Paid him about the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>July</hi> laſt. After this, Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> ſaid, he had Occaſion for ſome more Money ſome time after, about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and he was very Importunate with Sir <hi>John</hi> to obtain it from him: I will give you the manner how.</p>
               <p>It was out of the ſame Summ that he had the other 20 <hi>l.</hi> He writes to Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> a Letter, and Sir <hi>John</hi> returns this Anſwer, and that by a Letter under Sir <hi>John</hi>'s own Hand, and he knew it to be his own Hand: In the Contents of the Letter are that which is remarkable; the Letter bears Date ſome <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning, directed to Capt. <hi>Blair</hi>; the Letter was delivered at his own Houſe, and this was to meet him on <hi>Thurſday</hi> next, at <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> at the Hour of Twelve. Accordingly Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> comes to <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, where he doth meet Sir <hi>John,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> was there, and there he does receive ſome Money: So that now this Letter doth not depend for its Proof, barely upon his Hand, but upon the Contents, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Action thereupon; and this is a great Evidence, becauſe the Letter directs him to meet at <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Coffee-Houſe, and Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> does meet with Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> at that Place and Time; and that there was a Diſcourſe of the Deſign of the <hi>French</hi> Invaſion. He farther tells you, there was a Diſcourſe between him and Capt. <hi>Blair,</hi> How that Sir <hi>John</hi> did not at all ſcruple his being concerned, but did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenour of the Diſcourſe paſt, tell him, That he would not ſtir till ſuch time as the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet was come about; thinking that if he did, there would be danger of his being Apprehended: And therefore that he would ſculk about, and bid Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> ſhould do the ſame; a very great Argument that he continued ſtill of the ſame Mind; for this Diſcourſe related ſtill to the former Buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was to raiſe a Regiment of Horſe, in order to the Reſtauration of King <hi>James</hi>; and it alſo, hath Relation to the <hi>French</hi> Invaſion, which was expected on the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for about Two Years. There was a great Intimacy between this Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> and Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> and a great Truſt Sir <hi>John</hi> repoſed in him. And you are told of a Letter to King <hi>James:</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi> tells him, That he wrote that Letter himſelf. Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> ſays he read that Letter; and that it was ſo well penn'd, he believed Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> did pen it: Upon which, Sir <hi>John</hi> was angry. Then you have, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> called to be a Witneſs, to prove, That Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> told him he was to be Lieutenant-Colonel; and that before the Diſcovery of this Plot, and the Aſſaſſination, That Sir <hi>John</hi> did intimate ſomething of his Knowledge of it, That he heard of ſuch a thing, but did diſlike it; for he thought it would be the Ruine of King <hi>James</hi>'s Buſineſs. So that this, Gentlemen, is the Summ and Subſtance of the Evidence againſt the Priſoner:</p>
               <p>But now you are to conſider what Sir <hi>John</hi> can ſay on Behalf of himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He makes an Objection againſt the Credit of the Witneſſes; That they are not to be believed upon this Account, becauſe they are known to be Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. Their Conſciences indeed, as to Oaths, are ſomewhat large, eſpecially when they ſwear againſt Proteſtants: And therefore, ſays he, they are not to be allowed againſt Proteſtants as Witneſſes; at leaſt, their Credit is not ſufficient to induce a Jury to believe them. At Firſt he alledgeth, That there is a Statute that diſables them from being Witneſſes. There is no ſuch thing, nor is that at all a Diminution of the Credit of their Teſtimony: For, I muſt tell you, they are Legal Witneſſes: Though there are ſeveral Laws to puniſh them as Roman Catholicks; yet no Law that renders them Infamous, or Incredible Witneſſes, that I know of; for you muſt know, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that Papiſts are Chriſtians, and they do ſwear by the ſame Evangeliſts, as we do. And for that Objection, That they look upon us as Hereticks, and may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for ſwearing falſly: It hath been well obſerved by the King's Council, they would never obtain any Diſpenſation whatſoever, when by their Swearing, they do a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105154:16"/>
Papiſt Miſchief, ſo they are good Witneſſes as to their Credit and Competency. But then he inſiſts upon it, that <hi>Blair</hi> is not to be look'd upon as a Witneſs; and he tells you why, Firſt, That he had denied he knew any thing of the Plot: The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that was this; when he was in the Gate-houſe, there was News in the Flying Poſt or Poſt Boy, where it was alledged that <hi>Blair</hi> had confeſſed all; and that thereupon <hi>Blair</hi> did ſay he was innocent. You are to conſider the Weight of that Objection: Suppoſe he had ſaid ſo at that Juncture, and did own that he knew nothing at that time; by a Man's diſowning of a thing, becauſe he would not confeſs, or truſt thoſe Men with his Confeſſion, that therefore he is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved when he comes and ſwears it poſitively, that is no Argument. For now <hi>Blair</hi> is called to confront him, he tells you he did not ſay he knew nothing of a Plot, but denied being privy to, or being concerned in the Buſineſs of the Aſſaſſination, ſo that he did not deny wholly to be in the Plot, but in the Aſſaſſination. Then for the other Matter: On <hi>Friday</hi> Night laſt it ſeems this <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> coming to <hi>Blair</hi>'s Chamber, where <hi>Blair</hi> was, he takes notice to him of his Diſcovery; ſays he, you are to be a Witneſs to morrow againſt Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> at <hi>Hicks</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> I pray God direct you. He ſays, <hi>Blair</hi> ſeemed to be much troubled, that he took notice it was againſt his Conſcience; and that he and his Wife ſaid it was againſt his Conſcience. <hi>Blair</hi> denies that poſitively, and ſays he believed he came in to catch him. He farther tells you, that his Deſign was to keep himſelf free from all Company; and that he gave Order that none but his Wife might come to him; that this his coming in ſurprized him; that this Man ruſhed in upon him without his Conſent; that he did never ſay it was againſt his Conſcience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, you muſt conſider the Nature of the thing, that when a Man is to come the next Day to give an Evidence to the Grand Jury, it is not to be thought he ſhould be ſo unwiſe a Man as to tell another, it was to ſwear againſt his Conſcience. Therefore Gentlemen you are to conſider the Evidence that <hi>Blair</hi> hath given, and the Validity of it.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> doth inſiſt upon another Matter. Says he, I am a Proteſtant: Is it likely that I that am a Proteſtant ſhould Conſpire, Confederate, and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch an Invaſion againſt the King and Kingdom? And to prove that he is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, he hath called two or three Witneſſes that have known him ſome twenty Years, others many years; that have frequently been in his Company, and that tell you they did never know any time when he reflected againſt the Government: Nay, I think one of them ſays, he was in his Company when he did reprove ſuch Reflections. And then one that was his Chaplain in his Houſe is called, and he tells you that he read the Common-Prayers in his Houſe ſince the Revolution; that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was preſent while they prayed for the Preſent King and the Late Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and that he ſays he has been gone from him about five Years, and hath had very little Converſe with him ſince. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, he hath been in his Company divers times, and had ſeveral Diſcourſes with him, and that he ſhould ſay, that tho he could not conform to take the Oaths to the Preſent Government, yet he would live peaceably and quietly under it; and that one Expreſſion he had was this, <hi>If they catch me in the Corn, let them put me in the Pound.</hi> This is the Sum and Subſtance of his Defence; you are to conſider the Weight of that, and whether it is ſufficient to ballance the Evidence that hath been given for the King againſt the Priſoner. It is plain, tho he was a Proteſtant, he was no good Friend to the Government, nor could not take the Oaths to it. I have known a great many Men that go to Church, and are preſent at the Prayers, but whether they joyn with them or no, I know not. But now you are to conſider whether or no Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> being a Proteſtant, he would not be in a Plot becauſe he ſaid ſo, is ſuch an Argument as ſhall be ſufficient to make you disbelieve the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of this Evidence.</p>
               <p>Another thing he inſiſts on is a Matter of Law. In the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which hath been read, and doth contain ſeveral Species of Treaſon, giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what ſhall be Treaſon; One is, Compaſſing and Imagining the Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the King; the other is, the Levying of War. Now, ſays he, there was no War actually Levied. To this Objection I muſt tell you, If there be only a War to be Levied, a Conſpiracy to Levy War barely in it ſelf is not Treaſon: But if the Deſign and the Conſpiracy be either to Kill the King, or Depoſe the King, and the Way and Method propoſed to effect it is to Levy War, the Conſulting thereof to Levy a War is Treaſon, and a Treaſon which is mentioned in 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. for the Words of the Statute are, <hi>If any Perſon ſhall Conſpire, Imagine, or Compaſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105154:17"/>
the Deſtruction or Death of the King, ſuch Conspiracy or Imagination is Treaſon, if made out by any Overt-Act.</hi> Now becauſe a Man deſigns to do it by the means of a War, Agreeing and Conſulting to Levy a War in order to that Deſign, is <hi>High Treaſon.</hi> There is a Levying of War without Treaſon, not aiming at the Death of the King; for if a Number of Men appear in a Warlike manner, and this is not againſt the Perſon of the King, nor with a Deſign of his Death and Deſtruction, but for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reformation of the State, and to have better Laws, and to prevent thoſe Abuſes that they are offended at, this War now to be Levied not being to Compaſs or Deſign the Death of the King, this is not High Treaſon. But if the Purpoſe and Deſign be to Depoſe, or Deſtroy the King, and this to be by the means of a War, this is High Treaſon; and it is an Overt-Act: So that, that Objection he makes in point of Law, is nothing in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>You have heard the Evidence, what it is, and you are to conſider the weight of it, and the Circumſtances with which it is attended, to prove the Credibility and the Probability on one ſide and the other: And if you do not believe that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> was ſo concerned as you have heard the Witneſs Depoſe, then you are to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit Sir <hi>John Friend.</hi> But on the other ſide, If you do believe the Evidence againſt Sir <hi>John Friend,</hi> you are to find him Guilty by what the Evidence hath ſworn againſt him.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>John</hi> you were not Indicted for Levying War, but for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the Death of the King: And as for your Commiſſion to raiſe Men, you gave Money to <hi>Blair</hi> your Lieutenant-Colonel to give to the Men that were to be of your Regiment.</p>

The Crimes you are convicted of, are the greateſt a Man can commit. Murder and Robbery are Injuries but to private Perſons; but to contrive the Deſtruction of the King, is letting in Ruin upon Thouſands of People. For Robbery and Murder there may be ſomething pleaded for Juſtification, as for private Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to ſet, conſpire, and debate the Deſtruction of a Prince, the beſt of Men, the Father of his Country, no Man had ever any Colour of Excuſe for that. I would not add to your Unhappineſs; I am ſorry for the ſevere Judgment that you have brought upon your ſelves. All that remains for me to do, is, to pronounce on you the Sentence. And the Court doth award,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat You, and each of You, be carried to the Place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn on a Hurdle to the Place of Execution, and be there ſeverally Hanged, but cut down while you are alive; that your Privy Members be cut off; that your Bowels be taken out, and burnt before your Faces; that your Heads be ſever'd from your Bodies, and your Bodies be divided into four Quarters, and your Quarters to be at the King's Diſpoſe: And the Lord have Mercy on your Souls.</hi>
