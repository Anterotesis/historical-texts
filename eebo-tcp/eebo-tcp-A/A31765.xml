            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Charitable SAMARITAN
OR,
A Short and Impartial ACCOUNT of that
moſt Eminent, and Publick-Spirited Citizen,
Mr. THOMAS FIRMIN.</head>
            <head type="sub">In a Letter to a Perſon of Quality.</head>
            <p>I Have in Obedience to your Commands, endeavoured to give
the World ſome ſhort Account of our moſt excellent Friend late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Deceaſed, and to deal Ingenuouſly with you, tho' your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
have been always Sacred to me, I never in all my
Life Obey'd you with greater Alacrity. To do Juſtice to the Dead,
but eſpecially thoſe, who when living, were Ornaments of their
Country, is an Office of Gratitude, which is Authorized by
the practice of all Times, and Nations. And indeed 'tis highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
that the Memories of thoſe Perſons, that obliged not only
their own, but ſucceeding Generations, ſhould be Tranſmitted to
Futurity; for ſince the preſent Age is not able to pay the Debt, it
is fit that Poſterity that ſhares the Benefit of their Piety, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
ſhould be charged with part of it, and join in a common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
to the common Benefactors.</p>
            <p>I don't here pretend to enter into a <hi>detail</hi> of all the Particulars of
his Life, but only to Recount ſome paſſages of it that may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the preſent, and ſerviceable to future Ages. Thoſe <hi>Biographers,</hi>
that affect to clog their Narration with abundance of frivolous, idle,
impertinent Circumſtances, as they do no honour to the Deceaſed;
ſo they ſeem to have but a mean Opinion of their Reader, when
they take ſuch unneceſſary pains to Amuſe, inſtead of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
him. In the Delineation of a Life, as well as
in a Picture, ſeveral things ought to be thrown into the
Shade, and ſhould not be ſeen by a full Light, for this reaſon
I ſhall only conſider him in his General Character, leaving other
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42687:4"/>
Minure Circumſtances to be Recounted by thoſe that have either
more Leiſure upon their Hands, or a greater Inclination for that
way of Writing, and this I ſhall endeavour to perform in a plain
Stile, and the ſame ſimplicity with which he Lived.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Firmin</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Girdler, and Mercer, was one of the
moſt Signal Examples of Charity, Candour, Integrity, Juſtice, and
of all other Chriſtian, and Moral Virtues as this, or perhaps any other
Age of the World ever produced. He was Devout without Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Ill-nature, or Affectation; he was Charitable, without Oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Deſign; he conſidered himſelf as a Citizen of the whole
Univerſe, and took a ſingular Delight in Relieving the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and Oppreſſed. Tho he was as free from Infirmities, as moſt
Men, yet he had an unconquerable Averſion to that Spirit of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
which is now ſo predominant, and as it was with much
difficulty that he was induced to believe any ill Reports of his
Neighbour; ſo he never Propagated them upon the higheſt
Provocation. He adorn'd a Private Life with the Aſſiduity, and
Vigilance of a Publick Miniſter, and was ever purſuing what he
conceiv'd to be for the General Intereſt. If, as the Holy Writ
aſſures us, <hi>He that gives to the Poor lends to the Lord,</hi> he may juſtly
be ſaid to be one of the greateſt <hi>Uſarers</hi> in the World; (a name
which he abominated,) for he had them always in his Thoughts,
his Wiſhes, and his Endeavours. He ſupported their wants not
only by his private Munificence, which was extraordinary for
one of his Rank; but by recommending their Condition with the
greateſt Fervour to all his Friends. I know it has been impotently
objected againſt him by ſome Envious Perſons, That he was a Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by the Charities, which he Collected for the Needy. You, and
I, and all that had the happineſs to be Acquainted with him, know
well enough, that this Reproach is Ill-grounded.</p>
            <p>The Working-Houſe in <hi>Little-Britain,</hi> (of which, more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
that was begun and carried on chiefly at his Expence, and
that of his worthy Friends, who joyn'd with him in ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Deſign, was ſo far from turning to any Advantage, that it
proved a continual Charge to him; however, he who never conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own private loſs, when it came in competiton with a Publick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
ſtill kept it on to his Dying Day. But this Calumny may be
the better ſupported, ſince he ſhares it with ſo excellent a Perſon as
his Grace, the preſent Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who, when he
was only private Paſtor of a Pariſh-Church, Erected two Free-Schools,
and a Noble Library, and yet has been Traduced by ſome
Malicious Tongues, as if he had kept the greateſt part of thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralities,
of which he was the Collector, to his own private Uſes.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42687:4"/>
As I ſaid before, we that are his Friends may the better ſupport
this Injury done to him; ſince it affects ſo great a Prelate in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with himſelf. But what ſtation of Life, and Qualities of Mind,
can preſerve a Man from the aſſaults, and wounds of Envy, when
ſo diſintereſſed a Virtue as Charity, cannot place him above the reach
of Slander?</p>
            <p>In his private Dealings as a Tradeſ-man, no Man could be more
Religiouſly Exact, and tender then he was; he gave particular charge
to his Servants, that when ever there happened a difference in the
Accounts between him, and any of his Correſpondents, that they
ſhould always adjudge it in favour of the latter. He ſo cautiouſly
avoided the very ſuſpicion of Injuſtice, that he rather choſe to
wrong himſelf, than to make his Neighbour a ſufferer. He imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that his Servants in the hurry of Buſineſs might be apt to commit
ſome miſtakess through Inadvertency, or Forgetfulneſs, but it could
never enter into his Thoughts, that any one ſhould think it
worth their while to injure him, taking a Standard of the Integrity
of all Mankind, from that which he ſo nicely followed himſelf.</p>
            <p>He had obſerved with that rancour, and bitterneſs of Spirit,
People of different Parties in his time had all along labour'd to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
one another, and if the Trade of Calumniating, he ſaid, could be
ſo ſucceſsfully, and generally carried on in ſo Inlightened an Age
as this is, and in ſo ſmall a Spot of Ground as <hi>England,</hi> when by
the Invention of Printing it is ſo eaſie a thing to find out, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover
the Truth: He thought a Man in common Diſcretion
ſhould not be too forward to paſs a rigid Cenſure upon ſeveral of
thoſe Perſons, who in the Writings of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Authors, are Branded for Hereticks, and loaded with ſuch
execrable, and horrid Crimes, that Humane Nature one would
hope could never be capable of. What helped to confirm him in
this Opinion, is a famous Paſſage in <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Hiſtorian, who <hi>L.</hi>
2. <hi>C.</hi> 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ingenuouſly tells the Reader, That it was a common Cuſtom
with the Biſhops to Accuſe thoſe Perſons who were turned out of
their places, to pronounce them to be Impious, and the like, without
giving themſelves the trouble to juſtifie the Particulars of that Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they charged them with. Thus we have a frank Confeſſion of what
was commonly Practiſed in thoſe Ages of the Church, and whoever
doubts whether the ſame Methods were not carried on afterwards, let
him but read what a Monſtrous Account the Popiſh Writers have given
of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and the <hi>Lollards,</hi> as they call'd them; how hideouſly the
Monks have blackned thoſe Princes that were not in their Intereſts;
what abominable Stories the Jeſuits have reported of <hi>Luther,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42687:5"/>
               <hi>Calvin;</hi> let him, I ſay, but turn over <hi>Sanders</hi>'s <hi>History of the
Reformation,</hi> the Catalogues of <hi>Bale,</hi> and <hi>Pits, Fox</hi>'s Martyrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
to come down to our own times, <hi>White</hi>'s Centuries of Scandalous
Divines, <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Gangrena,</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Mercuries</hi> in the late Civil
Wars, the <hi>Querela Cantabrigienſis;</hi> the Hiſtories of <hi>F. Maimbourg,</hi>
and <hi>Varillas; the Packets of Advice,</hi> and <hi>the Obſervators; the Scotch Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Eloquence,</hi> and the Anſwer to it, with a Million of other Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
Pamphlets, and Secret Hiſtories; and if this don't convince
him, I don't know what will.</p>
            <p>He was a hearty Aſſertor of the Liberties of his Native Country,
and looked with Indignation, and Contempt on thoſe Citizens, who
in a ſtrain of Flattery, ſcarcely to be matched in the ſervile. Reigns of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> moſt humbly Addreſſed King <hi>Charles</hi> II. that
he would be graciouſly pleaſed to put Chains and Fetters on them,
and thus proſtituted thoſe Rights and Immunities, which their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
had taken ſuch care to Tranſmit ſafely to a moſt unworthy
Generation. He thought that the perpetual Bellowing of <hi>Paſſive
Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance,</hi> from the Pulpits, did not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to fix theſe Slaviſh Impreſſions upon People's minds: Admit
theſe Doctrines were as certain as any in the New-Teſtament, why
ſhould they, as it were in preference to the reſt, be everlaſtingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
to all Congregations? Or where was the Policy, to tell the
King, and his Officers, that they might ſtrip the People of all they
poſſeſs'd in the World, and yet they were in Conſcience bound not
lift up a finger againſt them? What Man of ſenſe that deſires to
keep his Wife honeſt, would be always ratling in her Ear, <q>Pawn
my Plate, and injure my Bed, as often as thou wilt, for my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
teaches me to bear all patiently.</q> Princes are naturally ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of Power, and don't need Inſtructors to tell them, that if they
pleaſe, they may Govern their Subjects Deſpotically, and then
quote them Texts of Scripture for it. But he often uſed to ſay,
As long as Deaneries, and good Preferments, were to be got by
Preaching this abſurd ſtuff, ſo long the Church wou'd ſtand by it; but
that if ever the Court came to put matters home to theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Gentlemen, and pinch the Retailers of this monſtrous Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
they would as certainly leave it in the lurch, as they would a
ſtarving Curacy in the Hundreds, for a rich Parſonage in a better Air.
The event has confirmed the truth of what he ſaid, for no ſooner did
K. <hi>James,</hi> and his Prieſts, begin to pull one of their Tythe-Pigs by,
the Ear, but all the Pulpits from the <hi>Landſ-end,</hi> to <hi>Berwick</hi> upon
<hi>Tweed,</hi> rung of Perſecution, and Tyranny; and ſince His preſent
Majeſty's acceſſion to the Crown, the Laity has had the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42687:5"/>
of ſeeing their Teachers face about, and declare for the quite
contrary Doctrine, or at leaſt reſtrain it; except a few, whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the real belief of a Principle early received, or the ſhame
of being thought Turn-Coats, or Obſtinacy, or Intereſt, and other
By-ends, have hindred from taking the Oaths to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>What was remarkable in a Perſon of his Private Condition, who
had not the advantage of a Learned Education, or of an ample Fortune
and Wealth to Support him, he was honoured with the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the moſt Illuſtrious Men that this Age has produced. This he
obtained by the Simplicity of his Manners, the Uniformity of his Life,
by his Judgment, naturally Solid, and well Determin'd, and his
active Genius that was capable of the greateſt Undertakings. Not
to mention ſeveral worthy Citizens of the moſt diſtinguiſh'd Rank,
he was particularly Eſteemd by the equally Learned, and Pious, Dr.
<hi>Wilkins,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chester;</hi> by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> the great
Reſtorer of Natural, and Chriſtian Philoſophy; by that Eminent
Oracle of the Law, Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> and (what will be the
moſt laſting Elogy to our Friend, that I, or any other Hand can give
him) he was happy in the Friendſhip of the moſt Excellent Prelate,
that ever filled the Archiepiſcopal Chair, the Incomparable Dr.
<hi>Tillotſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having preſumed to mention that great Name, which will be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
to all Poſterity, in ſo worthleſs a Paper as this is, I hope, Sir,
you'l give me leave to make a ſhort Digreſſion. You know, the
Arch-Biſhop has been Maliciouſly Repreſented in ſome Libels, as a
Betrayer of the Church, and an Enemy to the Chriſtian Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
when he was advanced to that Dignity, which he the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
of any of his Function, he was pleaſed to ſuffer a Viſit now
and then from his old Acquaintance. Mr. <hi>Firmin.</hi> All the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
World I believe is ſatisfied, that Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> was far from being
a Socinian. His own Works ſufficiently teſtifie it, to the everlaſting
Infamy of thoſe that laid it to his Charge; and yet an innocent
Correſpondence with a Perſon, whoſe Unhappineſs, and not Fault
it was, to Diſſent from us in ſome diſputed Points, muſt be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the blackeſt Sin imaginable, as if it were impoſſible to ſhew
common Civilities to our Neighbour without being of his Opinion.
Even the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by virtue of its Infalliblity, has
the beſt right to Preſcribe its Sons what Company to keep, has not
been able to influence ſeveral of its Worthy Members from paying a
due deference to conſpicuous Merit, tho' they found it lodg'd in an
Enemy. Father <hi>Paul</hi> thought it no Scandal to him to paſs his vacant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42687:6"/>
Hours in Sir <hi>Henry Wooton,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bedel's</hi> Company, tho' they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed
from him in matters of Religion. Our Country-man, Mr.
<hi>Hobbes</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who was no Friend to the Papacy, all the World
knows, was ſingularly honoured by <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> and <hi>F. Merſenne.</hi> The
Learned <hi>Malpigius</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> never ſcrupled to keep a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the Gentlemen of our Royal Society, tho' in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
they paſs for Hereticks. Nay, before the late War, the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who cannot be ſuſpected of favouring Proteſtants, uſed to
give Annual Penſions to Learned Men of all Countries, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as for inſtance, to Monſieur <hi>Huygens, Spanheim, Groevius,</hi> and
<hi>Iſaac Voſſius.</hi> Converſation muſt be confined to very narrow bounds
indeed, if it be a Sin to have any Commerce with thoſe that don't
come up exactly to our Sentiments in every Point. But this ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Objection has been chiefly made by two ſowr, moroſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of our Nation; one of them an abdicated Dean, who has
been already chaſtiſed for his Inſolence by another Hand; the other
is the famous Adverſary of Dr. <hi>Sh—k,</hi> who, the truth on't is,
deſerves none of the civileſt uſage, but in a Subject that required the
greateſt Sobriety of Stile he has vented his Eury in a wayſo boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and unpreſidented, <hi>(nam etiam ſunt Belli jura)</hi> that
if a Syſtem of Scurrility were to be compiled, I know not
where the Materials are, to be ſo plentifully found as in his Writings.
If the generality of the Divines were of this brutal, and ſavage
Temper, (as Heaven be praiſed they are not) were a Man to expreſs
a ſteddy, incurable, unrelenting Hatred, he could not call it by a
properer Term, than that of <hi>Odium Theologicum,</hi> after the ſame
manner as the Pious Proviſion which both <hi>Regulars,</hi> and <hi>Seeulars</hi> take
in Popiſh Countries, not to injure their frail Bodies with bad
Liquor, has made the beſt ſort of Wine to be commonly called, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Theologicum;</hi> and one might have reaſon on his ſide to apply to
ſuch Incendiaries the following paſſage out of the Preface to the
fifth Edition of Father <hi>Simon</hi>'s Critical Hiſtory in <hi>French. Il y a long
temps qu'en a remarque que les Theologiens ſont gens ſans pitie, &amp; quils ne
donnent jamais coup de dent ſans emporter la piece.</hi> I purpoſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to Tranſlate it into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe, as to the general the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is falſe.</p>
            <p>I may venture to ſay, That no Age, and perhaps no Nation in the
World has propuced a Man of a more uſeful, more Diſintereſſed,
and extended Charity, ſince the Apoſtolic al times. He made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and employed all his Intereſt (which was very conſidetable,)
to relieve the Neceſſities of the <hi>Poor;</hi> under which Denomination,
I don't comprehend thoſe ſturdy, abandon'd Vagrants, thoſe lazy
Counterfeits, and unprofitable Vermin; that to the eternal Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42687:6"/>
of our Laws, and Government, are ſuffered to peſter our Streets
and Highways, and fill all places with their impudent Clamours.
But real Objects of Compaſſion, ſuch as Orphans, and Widows, and
Houſe-keepers, that by unforeſeen, and unavoidable Accidents,
were reduced to Poverty. He looked upon us to be none of the
ableſt Politicians in the World, who living in a County natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Productive of the beſt Commodities, having ſo much waſt
Ground to imploy idle Hands; and the Sea on every ſide of us
that lies as much neglected, ſting up all theſe advantages that our
Situation, and Soil, have conſpired to beſtow upon us; and tho we
pretend to give Laws to all <hi>Europe,</hi> yet are content to pay an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Tribute of <hi>700000l. per Annum,</hi> to a parcel of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
inſolent Vagabonds at home. He was of Opinion, that if the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Sum was thrown into a Common Stock, and Working-Houſes
Erected in all the conſiderable Market-Towns in the Kingdom, we
ſhould in a few Years find our Poor leſs burthenſom to us than now
they are; at leaſt the Republick would derive this benefit from it,
that tho the Contributions for them continued in the preſent State,
yet an effectual ſtop would be put to the reigning Vice of Pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Stealing: Beſides that, by this means, he ſaid, we ſhould
ſoon clear our Roads, and Streets of thoſe troubleſom People; we
ſhould breed a Healthful Generation of able Bodied Men, fit for the
Plow, and Sea-ſervice, and diſarm our Beggars of the only tollerable
Excuſe they have for ſuch a Profligate Life, viz. 'That they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Work, if any one would imploy them. Therefore to ſet a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Example to the reſt of the Nation, he not only contributed what he
thought proper for ſuch a Deſign out of his own Purſe, but enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as many of his Acquaintance as he could, to Erect a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe
in <hi>Little-Britain;</hi> and tho the Manufactures that were
wrought there, fell conſiderably ſhort of anſwering the Expence
of the Undertakers were yearly at, yet it produced this good effect,
that it conſtantly imployed abundance of Neceſſitous Perſons all the
year round, who muſt otherwiſe have betaken themſelves to a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
habit of Life, or elſe proved burthenſom to the reſpective
Pariſhes where they lived. I have dwelt the longer upon this
Article, becauſe, I am in hopes, that ſo generous, and
ſo freſh a Preſident, will prevail with our Patriots to cure
their Country of this lingring Diſtemper, that has ſo long
annoy'd it; eſpecially at this Conjuncture, when the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of <hi>England</hi> ſeems to be animated with a new Spirit, when
we have a Victorious Monarch at the Head of the Government who
is willing to rectifie all the Abuſes, and Diſorders of our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42687:7"/>
and to put in Execution whatever his faithful. Senators adviſe
him to; when the <hi>Royal Fiſhery,</hi> that will employ ſo many hands,
has already made ſuch conſiderable Advances; and laſtly, when
upon the Disbanding of our Land-Forces, we ſhall find our ſelves
obliged to make ſome ſort of Proviſion for the Soldiers, that they
who behaved themſelves ſo gallantly in <hi>Flanders,</hi> may not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
for want of Employment, tobetake themſelves to indirect
courſes to prevent Starving.</p>
            <p>As for that other Branch of Chriſtian Charity, which relates to
Men, as they unhappily differ from us in Points of Religion, it
ſhin'd in every action of his Life, and indeed was interwoven with
his Nature. He rightly judged, that nothing has given greater
Scandal to the Jews, nor ſo ſenſibly wounded our Religion among
<hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> nor furniſhed the <hi>Papists</hi> with a more
Popular Objection? that in ſhort, nothing has been, more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
made a pretence, even for Atheiſm, and Infidelity, than our
unnatural Diviſions, and Animoſities, 'Tis indeed certain, that
our Controverſies about Religion, as we have aukwardly managed
them, have at laſt brought even Religion it ſelf into Diſputet
among ſuch, whoſe weaker Judgments have not been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the plain, and unqueſtionable way to Heaven in ſo great a
Miſt, as theſe Bigots have moſt unſeaſonably raiſed. What
renders the Scene more ſurprizing, thoſe very Perſons, whoſe
duty it is to be Meſſengers of Peace, and to recommend it both by
their Example, and Preaching, have rather ſounded an Alarm to
our contentious Spirits, than a Retreat, or Parly; ſo that by the
diſtemper'd heat of theſe indiſcreet Chymiſts, the Life and Spirit of
Chriſtianity, I mean, the Practiſe of it, has been ſo much rarified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
airy Notions, and Speculations, that the inward Strength, and
Vitals of it have been quite conſum'd, and exhauſted.</p>
            <p>A Friend of mine happened to be once in his Company, when a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
that had lived ſeveral Years in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> ask'd him, <hi>What he
thought of the Mahometans, and Pagans, who, according to his Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Poſſeſſed at leaſt the better half of the Globe.</hi> He made no difficulty to
own, that as he ſhould always prefer to be guilty of a well meaning
Error, than raſhly ſubſcribe to a doubtful Truth, that carried great
Rigours, and Severities along with it; ſo he hoped, that the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Knowledge which all Men have of God, was capable either to
procure them Eternal Felicity, or at leaſt to preſerve them from Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
if wanting other means to be better Inſtructed, they lived up
to the plain, and eaſie Dictates of Reaſon: Upon which Head, give
me leave, Sir, to to add a few Words of my own. 'Tis certain,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42687:7"/>
that the Fathers of the Church, before they engaged in the warm
Diſputes with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> did not talk of the Celebrated Heroes
of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> as Men that were Sentenc'd to everlaſting Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Caſaubon</hi> has proved it at large, in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of his Book
againſt Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> and the famous Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe le
Vayer,</hi> in his Book concerning the Virtue of the Heathens, has
juſtified by adundance of Paſſages, that ſeveral of the Fathers, and
School-Divines, (the latter of which, generally ſpeaking, were
not Men of the greateſt Charity,) have Taught, that the Pagans,
that lived Virtuous Lives, were not excluded from Salvation. <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius,</hi>
who has been accuſed for a Man of too much warmth,
maintained the ſame Opinion. Nay, the Jews themſelves, who
were ſo jealous formerly, to be thought the only People of God,
and had ſo deſpicable an Opinion of all the World beſides, make
no ſcruple now to own, that a Man may arrive to Happineſs, by
the bare unaſſiſted Religion of Nature, as the Learned, Dr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi>
in his Account of them, has ſhown.</p>
            <p>He always looked upon <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> to be the Birth-Right
of every Chriſtian, and that every Government was obliged in
point of Intereſt, as well as bound by the common Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
to indulge it; provided, it maintained nothing that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Good-Manners, and the Peace of the Civil Society. I have been
told what paſt in a Converſation between him, and an eminent
Divine of this City, in the Year, 1683. when by the Artifices of the
Miniſtry at the Court, the Church Party were made the Tools to
carry on an unnatural Perſecution againſt the Diſſenters. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what I tell you, Doctor,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>You'l all of you live to Repent of
this Inhumane, and unpolitick Uſage of your Proteſtant Brethren. I know
what Pretences you have for it, but they are unjuſt, and weak, Do you
think theſe poor People would Meet in Corners, and that under perpetual
apprehenſions of being dragg'd to Jayl, and torn in pieces by Proceſſes from
Doctors Commons? Do ye think they'd ſacrifice their Eaſe, their Liberty,
and (as the World goes,) their Reputation too, for the ſake of a peeviſh
humour, that marks them out for Suffering, if not for Ruine, unleſs they
were convinced in the Sincerity of their Hearts, that their way of Worſhip
was right? I don't ſpeak of their Teachers, for whatever Intereſt they may
be preſumed to Cultivate, the People I am ſure can have none: If they
are in an Error, 'tis certain, they are miſtaken in good earneſt: Nay I'm
perſwaded, that thoſe that are Educated iu the worſt, and falſeſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
do heartily believe them to be true.</hi> Hence I infer, added he, that
no Man ought to be inſulted upon this ſcore, and the example of
ſo many People, that Err in the ſimplicity of their Conſciences,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42687:8"/>
ought to inſpire us with ſome tenderneſs towards thoſe, whom we
imagine to be miſtaken. Beſides that, it is a barbarous Soleciſm in
any State, to force their Natives to ſeek Refuge in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
becauſe they can't believe all that is Preſcrib'd to them, which
it is not in a Man's Power to do, I have an Argument, continued
he, ſtill behind, which, tho it may look like a Paradox at firſt, yet
I believe, will bring you over to my Party, when you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
it; I affirm then, that it is the intereſt of the Eſtabliſhed
Clergy, that the Diſſenters ſhould be Tolerated; we find into what
abominable Diſorders the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fell when ſhe Reigned
Lady Paramount, in theſe Weſtern parts of the World, without any
one to oppoſe her; and what happened to one Church, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to another; for the ſame Cauſes produce the ſame Effects.
'Tis certain, that the Reformers obliged her to Retrench ſeveral no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Abuſes, and to them is owing all that improvement in Arts,
and Sciences, which the Eccleſiaſticks of that Communion have
made ſince: In <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Catholicks live
intermixt with the Proteſtants, and conſequently the Prieſts have a
Thouſand Spies upon all their Actions, that they are forced to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
in their own Defence, like People upon a Frontier, and to live in
ſome <hi>Deco<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3+ letters">
                     <desc>•••…</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> whereas the quite contrary is to be ſeen in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and <hi>Italy;</hi> there the Clergy live among a parcel of ſtupid, implicit
Blockheads, that take all they ſay, for Oracles, have no Enemy to
remind them of ſtanding upon their Guard, fear no Reproaches,
and apprehend no Rivals, ſo 'tis no wonder if they are as debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as ignorant, I know, concluded he, 'tis commonly wiſhed, that
all People were of one mind in matters of Religion; but in caſe it
were practicable, I very much queſtion whether it would be for
your Intereſt, <hi>Doctor,</hi> that if it ſhould be ſo. I am ſo well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the infirmities, and weakneſs of Mankind, that I believe a
ſtate of Lazineſs and Security would be infinitely more prejudicial
to the World, than a ſtate of perpetual Diſcord, though that too
is attended with ſeveral inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>His Converſation was Eaſy, Pleaſant, Familiar, but always inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive;
it was ſeaſon'd with that agreeable Salt which gives a
Life to all Diſcourſe, but had no Bitterneſs, no Gall mixt with it.
He endeavor'd fairly and candidly to convince thoſe that diſſented
from him in their Opinions, but never affected the modern way of
Uſurping upon their Reaſon, much leſs did he pretend to ſilence
them with an <hi>Ipſe Dixit;</hi> and indeed, a Man that tells me my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
are ill grounded and irrational, without condeſcending to
refute them by calm and ſober Arguments, calls me Fool or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42687:8"/>
with only a little more Solemnity: Yet theſe are the common Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
in Religious Diſputes of moſt People to one another, who talk
much of right Reaſon, and always mean their own, and make their
private imaginations the Standard of General Truth. He never Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf or the Company, at the expence of other People, and next
to his own Reputation, which was Sacred to him, he cheriſh'd
and ſupported that of his Neighbour. He was ſo far from making
the Calamities and Misfortunes of any Man the ſubject of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
though he chanc'd to be never ſo inveterate an Enemy
to him, that were it proper, I cou'd produce inſtances of ſeveral
Citizens, that have repreſented him as an Atheiſt, and loaded him
with the moſt Injurious, and cruel Reproaches, and yet when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their own ill Management, or the common viciſſitude that
attends Human Affairs, they have been reduced to Wants, he has
viſited them in in a moſt obliging manner, and generouſly relieved
them.</p>
            <p>As he was conſider'd in the World, as one that had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
intereſt in Perſons of the moſt eminent Quality, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that a perpetual Application was made to him, and that his
Gates were crowded by Supplicants of all ſorts. If any favour was
asked him, he was ſlow to promiſe, as diffident what ſucceſs he
might meet with in the affair, or unwilling to be too troubleſome
to his Friends; but when he had once engaged his Word to any one,
nothing cou'd be ſo Aſſiduous, ſo Indefatigable, and if I may be
allow'd the expreſſion, nothing ſo importunate. He was naturally
Maſter of a very perſwaſive Talent of Speaking, and cou'd deliver
himſelf Properly, and Pertinently, upon any Occaſion: But tho'
his Modeſty wou'd never permit him to be a good Solicitor for
himſelf, yet when he undertook to Proſecute the Rights of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
when he appear'd in behalf of indigent Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
he exerted himſelf with unuſual Vigour and Force, and
ſeldom fail'd of gaining his Point. That Honourable Character,
which <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> beſtows upon <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> viz. That
when he eſpouſed any Friend's Cauſe, he purſued it with ſo much
generous Zeal and Warmth, <hi>Ut non mandatam, ſed ſuam rem agere
videretur,</hi> ſeems to have been revived in him: He never paid the
leſs reſpect to Virtue, for being Unfortunate; on the other hand,
he took a Noble Pride in relieving and aſſiſting the Afflicted; even
thoſe that were betrayed to Poverty by their own Extravagancies
or Indiſcretions, participated ſome ſhare of his Charity, but always
of his pious Advice, which he thought would make a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon the party, and be better regarded, when it came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42687:9"/>
with ſome Benevolence. To juſtifie this Aſſertion,
you know, Sir, I am able to cite abundance of ſingular Examples,
if there were occaſion for it, but having tied my ſelf to give only
a general Character of our Friend, I cannot, nor is it neceſſary, to
deſcend to particulars.</p>
            <p>Tho', as I have already Obſerved, his Charity was of ſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Character, that it reach'd to Perſons of all Communions, and
Perſwaſions, yet he cou'd never think of Popery, without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Horror and Deteſtation; and indeed, I never in all my Life,
heard him mention it, all Candour and Gentleneſs as he was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a viſible Emotion and Reſentment. He ſaid, he cou'd forgive
their Prieſts, for affecting a Dominion over the People, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Penny of their Credulity; that this was natural enough,
and might eaſily be accounted for, Ambition and Covetouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two Vices that have their Spring from within, of which Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks
are as well capable, as the Laity; but then he added,
that he cou'd never be reconciled to their inhumane Cruelty, in
perſecuting all that diſſented from them, and to that no leſs abſurd,
than abominable Idolatry and Polytheiſm, which was ſo notoriouſly
viſible in their Worſhip.</p>
            <p>As to the former, he uſed to ſay, that it argued ſo Cowardly, ſo
Puſillanimous a Spirit, that it betrayed ſo violent a diſtruſt of the
Merits of the Cauſe, that it ſo directly combated all the principles
of our Holy Religion, and indeed, all the common impreſſions of
Humanity, that where ever he found any Church abandoning it
ſelf to ſuch Black and execrable Methods, for his part he was
ſatisfied it had arrrived to the higheſt pitch of Corruption, and
would look no farther: That ſuch a procedure might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
excuſable in the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, which like a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Prince, was Born with Teeth and Nails, cou'd Scratch
and Bite in the Cradle, and fire Towns, and cut Throats before
it was a Twelve Month Old; whoſe Inſtitutor was a Bloody Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
Wretch, bred up in the Trade of Rapine and Plunder, a
Monſter compounded of Enthuſiaſm, Luſt, and Cruelty, who left it
as the only Legacy to his Followers, to propagate their Belief by the
Sword; ſo this, he ſaid, if it cou'd not be juſtified, yet no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cou'd be expected from theſe barbarous Proſelite-Makers, who
punctually proved their Maſter's Will, and took out Letters of

the occaſion, at leaſt the pretence, of all that Blood-ſhed and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,
which has been acted in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> World for ſeveral
Ages; that the Profeſſors of it, whom formerly their Enemies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42687:9"/>
cou'd not but admire for the ſweetneſs of their Diſpoſition,
their Mutual Love, forbearance and condeſcention towards
one another, ſhou'd now ſet up for Cannibals, and prey upon
their own kind, nay, to inflame their reckoning, ſhould have
the impudence to pretend a Commiſſion from their Maſter for
doing all this, was the moſt unaccountable Prodigy in the world
to him, and which (to our diſgrace, be it ſpoken) cou'd not
be matched in all the Annals of Paganiſm. Even among the
<hi>Druids,</hi> the higheſt Puniſhment they inflicted upon Offenders,
was to prohibit them from aſſiſting at any of their
Sacred Rites.<note n="*" place="margin">

for as the World has been ſince brought about, the Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nder
of the Church is now degenerated into a Squib, and
where it is not inforced by the ſecular Arm, carries no
mighty Terror with it. The Gentlemen of the Black Robe, will
perhaps ſay, that this is wicked Doctrine, but I wonder where
the Impiety lies, to affirm that the Devil is not ſo much in the

the Blackamoor, Idolatry is no better nor worſe than Idolatry,
and will be ſo to the end of the Chapter. If we look into
their Rituals, and judge of their Belief by their Practice, we
ſhall find that they pay to a whole Almanack full of Saints of
their own making, the ſame Ceremonies, in the very ſame
words, accompanied with the ſame Proſtrations, as they do to
God Almighty. They directly offer their Prayers, make Vows,

that Pray thus by Proxy, ſhou'd not manage every thing

            <p>He was for a plain intelligible Theology, ſuch as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

for ſome time, till the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Converts, but
eſpecially the Philoſophers, for different ends Debauch'd it
with Ceremonies, and Muffled it up in Myſtery. And ſince
Religion was Calculated for reaſonable Creatures, he thought,
that Conviction and not Authority ought to influence Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
for this Reaſon, he looked upon thoſe Men to have
no ſmall ſhare of Vanity, Lazineſs, or Weakneſs in their
Compoſition, that ſuffer themſelves tamely to be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by magnificent Souuds, and numerous Citations. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in
<hi>Solon</hi>'s Life, tell us, That that famous Legiſlator inſerted a Verſe
into <hi>Homer,</hi> to prove, That the Iſland of <hi>Salamis</hi> belonged
of right to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and who knows, what ſtrange Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
have been made in the Eccleſiaſtical Monuments by Men,
that valued the Intereſt of their Party, more then the Truth;
eſpecially, if we conſider, that before the invention of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng,

fell into few hands, and might eaſily be ſuppreſt or corrupt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted;
to which Temptation, I cou'd heartily wiſh, thoſe we
call the pureſt Ages of the Church, had never been expoſed.
An unintelligible, or abſur'd Propoſition, is to be never the
more reſpected for its having travel'd far, or wearing the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Badge of Antiquity. That former Ages were ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
cautious and honeſt, as neither to be impoſed upon
themſelves, nor ſuffer any Errors to be tranſmitted to their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42687:10"/>
Poſterity, is a Metaphyſical Contemplation, with which ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious

theſe matters. with more impartiality and care.</p>
            <p>This naturally leads me to that part of his Character, which
I confeſs, I would conceal from the reſt of the World, if it
lay in my Power, as it does not, ſince it is no Secret to thoſe
that knew him; but as I have pretended to give an impartial
Account of our Friend, I find my ſelf obliged to take ſome
notice of it before I conclude. He was then (and I wiſh
once more I cou'd conceal it) he was not ſo Orthodox, as I
cou'd have wiſhed he had been, in his Opinion about the
Holy Trinity, and the ſatisfaction of our Saviour, according
to the common Explications. I don't pretend in the leaſt to
Vindicate him in either, only give me leave to add, that as few
Men in the World have been without their Errors, (I cou'd
inſtance, if I pleas'd, in ſome of the beſt and learnedeſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church) ſo I think a charitable Conſtruction
ought to be given of them, where the Perſon miſtaking, was
of no Obſtinate, refractory Temper, but ſhow'd in the whole
Tenour of his Life, that he aim'd at nothing more than to
find out the Truth, ſo that if he miſt it in the purſuit, it ſhould
only be aſcribed to humane Imbecillity, from which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Men are not exempt. It ought to be conſider'd too, that
when he firſt appear'd in the World, he found the Nation
involved in a Bloody Civil War, and the Church divided by
ſeveral Schiſms, as the ſtate was diſtracted by different Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Laity at that time looked upon themſelves to be ill
uſed by the Leaders of both Churches, who did not ſeem to
contend for the purity of Religion, ſo much as they did
who ſhould have the Rod in their hands, to jerk the poor
People that were under their Power, and as it is natural for
Men to run out of one extream into another, they imagin'd
a cheat put upon them, even where there was no reaſon to
ſuſpect one. He was naturally inquiſitive, and devoted as much
time to Reading, as a life ſo taken up as his, but generally
employ'd in the ſervice of others, would well permit. He
had obſerved how inconſiſtent with themſelves, and how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

the Ancient Books, they are Written in the Margin, and not
in the Text, and generally in a later Hand: That as ſeveral

not probable St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> read the Words ſo, and yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſhould never employ them againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> of his Time;
and therefore that learned Critick, not without good grounds,
ſuppoſes that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> adapted the Words of the 8th. Verſe,
<hi>Et hi tres unum ſunt</hi> (for ſo the Vulgar Latin reads it,) to the
Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; and 'tis certain that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
frequently cites ſeveral Paſſages out of the Bible, with the
ſame aſſurance as if he had cited the very expreſs Words:
That however it came about, the ſame variety of Reading is to
be found in ſeveral other Texts; as for example, the third Verſe

c.</hi> 16. and <hi>Socrates, l. 7. Hiſt. Eccleſ. c.</hi> 32. read it <hi>Omnis Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

Verſe of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> the Word <hi>God</hi> is not in the <hi>Alexandrine</hi> MS.
nor in two of <hi>Beza,</hi> nor in five others mention'd in the <hi>Oxon.</hi>
Edition, nor in the <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreter: That in the Epiſtle to
the the <hi>Romans, c. 9. v.</hi> 5. Chriſt is called <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi>
whereas St. <hi>Cyprian, l. 2. adverſus Judaeos,</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> upon the
Second Pſalm omit the Word <hi>Deus,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſeems to
have read it ſo: That likewiſe in the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,
c</hi> 3. 16. where we read it <hi>God made manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> the
ſame Word is left out in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> Verſion, which

it is not ſo much to be aſcribed to the negligence of

ſome Perſons that endeavoured to

That the old Controverſies between

fooliſh, ſhameful ſquabling between themſelves, were brought
to Bed at laſt of a ſet of obſcure Articles, couch'd under none
of the moſt intelligible Terms, which the ſtupid People were
to receive with the ſame Veneration, as if they had dropt down
from Heaven: That there were ſuch viſible Adulterations of
the Works of the Primitive Authors, of which <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles
will be a laſting Inſtance, and the Trade of the <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Fraudes,</hi> ſo
univerſally carried on in the firſt and beſt Ages, of which the
<hi>Sybilline</hi> Oracles are Teſtimonies ſufficient, that it was not ſafe
to depend too much upon any Authorities: That laſtly, If our
Salvation ſo intirely depended upon the Belief of this Doctrine,
which gives ſo great a ſhock to unaſſiſted Natural Reaſon, it
ſeems highly agreeable to the Juſtice and Wiſdom of God, that
he wou'd have deliver'd it in plainer and more expreſs Terms,
ſince now both Parties pretend to juſtifie themſelves equally
out of the Bible; and (to Inſtance in no other Paſſage) the
<hi>Arians</hi> as well as <hi>Homoonſians</hi> ſupport their Hypothaſis out of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I have thus briefly run over ſome of thoſe Reaſons which
determin'd our Friend to this Heterodox Opinion, for ſo with
the reſt of the World I am oblig'd to call it; and I hope I
need make no Apology to my Reader, (I am ſure I need make
none to you, who know me ſo well) for thus publickly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

them down; for tho' they appear'd convincing and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to him, or at leaſt kept him from pronouncing <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>'s
againſt thoſe that cou'd not come up to the Rigours of
the <hi>Quicunque vult,</hi> they may carry no great weight with any
one elſe. For my part, I who have known the World long enough
to entertain no very honourable Notion of Synods and Councils,
where Men of Deſign, and ſuch there will always be, carry'd
with them the ſame Paſſions and Animoſities, that we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
in our Senates and Civil Aſſemblies, without their Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
take the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity upon Content,
ſuch as I find it in the New Teſtament, and never trouble my
Head about the <hi>Modus</hi> or different Explications with which the
<hi>Scabies diſputandi</hi> has (to give it no worſe a word) ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus'd
the Chriſtian World. Had theſe pack'd, and as they
were manag'd,<note place="margin">Gaſpar Scioppius.</note> uſeleſs Meetings of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
(for I am of a late Grammarians Mind
who not unjuſtly defin'd the Repreſentative
Church to be <hi>Mandra, ſeu grex jumentorum, ſive aſinorum)</hi> inſtead
of buſying their Thoughts about Creed-making, employ'd the
Authority they uſurp'd, to promote the real practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
it had been much happier for themſelves, and for us
that ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>I have the leſs to ſay to the latter Point, I mean the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of our Bleſſed Saviour, becauſe our Friend was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
to the Term, in the moderate ſenſe of well-pleaſedneſs
long before his Death, which, to the Grief of all that knew
him, and the loſs of his Country in general, happen'd on the
<hi>20th.</hi> of this Inſtant <hi>December,</hi> after two Days Sickneſs. He
wou'd indeed often argue, how a vicarious Puniſhment cou'd
poſſibly conſiſt with the Divine Juſtice or Mercy; and how
any Redemption cou'd be neceſſary to atone for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
whom Millions had never heard of, and no one had
ever commiſſion'd to tranſact for him. As for Sacrifices, about
which 'tis left to every Man's liberty to think as he pleaſes,
ſince it is no Article of our Faith, he cou'd never be induced to
believe them to be of Divine Inſtitution; but being uſed by all
the Neighbouring Nations, to have been indulg'd the <hi>Jews</hi> (as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42687:14"/>
the Kingly Government was afterwards) upon the account of
their ſtubborn obſtinate Temper, which was much delighted
with Pomp and Shew. In this particular, he has ſeveral of the
moſt Learned Men of this Age concurring with him; and if I
may be allow'd to interpoſe my own Opinion, I think Dr.
<hi>Spencer,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Le Clark</hi> have put it beyond any manner
of Diſpute, that not only Sacrifices (which, but eſpecially
thoſe of the Expiatory kind,<note place="margin">The Pagans had a groſs Notion, that their Gods, whom they looked upon to be little better than Corporeal, were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Nido<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">

been invented by a Superſtitious or deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prieſthood) but moſt of the other Rites
and Ceremonies that we meet with in the
Jewiſh Oeconomy, were practis'd firſt by
their Neighbours, and after they were
purged of their Idolatrous droſs, tolerated
in that ſtiff-necked People.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I am arriv'd to the Concluſion of this tedious
Letter, which if it does not wholly anſwer Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
I hope you'll impute it to the hurry and diſorder I was
in at the time of writing it. I wiſh you had impoſed your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
upon ſome abler Perſon, whoſe manner of managing the
Subject, might have born ſome proportion to the Dignity of it:
For to ſay the Truth, Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> was a moſt excellent Member
of our Commonwealth, who bent all his Studies, Labours, and
Inclinations to ſerve and advance the Publick Good. He had
his Infirmities as has been ſhewn, but they ought never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
to his prejudice, ſince he had ſo many Vertues of
the firſt magnitude to over-balance them. Let it never be ſaid,
that he who treated all Mankind, with univerſal Charity, when
alive, ſhould not be treated with the ſame Charity himſelf now
he is in the Grave.</p>
