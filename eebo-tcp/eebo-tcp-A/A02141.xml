            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I liue still, &amp; I liue to display their villanies, which, gentlemen you shal see set down in most ample maner in this small treatise, but heere by the way, giue me leaue to answere an obiection, that some inferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, which was, that I shewed no eloquent phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, nor fine figuratiue conueiance in my first booke as I had done in other of my workes, to which I reply that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a certaine decorum is to bee kept in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing, and not to applie a high stile in a base subiect beside the facultie is so odious, and the men so seruile and slauish minded, that I should dishonor that high misterie of eloquence, and derogate from the dignitie of our English toonge, eyther to employ any figure or bestow one choyce English word vpon such disdained rakehels as those Conny-catchers. Therefore humbly I craue pardon, and desire I may write basely of such base wretches, who liue onely to liue dishonestly. For they seeke the spoyle and ruine of all, and like droanes eate away what others labor for. I haue set downe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other laws vntoucht in the first, as their Vincents law, a notable coosenage at bowles, when certain idle companions stand and make bettes, being compacted
<pb facs="tcp:6152:4"/>
with the bowlers, who looke like honest minded citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, either to win or loose, as their watch-worde shall appoint, then the Prigger or Horsestealer, with all his ginnes belonging to his trade, and theyr subtill caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels to amend the statute, next the curbing law, which some call but too basely hookers, who eyther diue in at windows, or else with a hook, which they call a curb doe fetch out whatsoeuer, either apparell, linnen, or wollen, that be left abroad. Beside I can set downe the subtiltie of the blacke Art, which is picking of lockes, a coosenage as preiudiciall as any of the rest, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Lift, which is he that stealeth any parcels, and stily taketh them away. This (Gentlemen) haue I searcht out for your commodities, that I might lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the world, the villanie of these coosening cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, who are not onely abhorred of men, but hated of God, liuing idlely to themselues, &amp; odiously to the worlde, they be those foolish children that Salomon speakes of, that feedes themselues fatte with iniquitie, those vntamed heifers, that will not breake the yoke of labor, but get their liuinges by the painfull thrift of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hands. I cannot better compare them, then vnto Vipers, who while they liue are hated &amp; shunned of all men as most preiudiciall creatures, they feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hemlocke and Aconiton, and such fatall &amp; impoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned herbs, but the learned apothecaries takes them, cuts off their heades, and after they be imbowelled of their flesh, they make the most pretious Mithridate: so these Conny-catchers, Foists, Nips, Priggars, &amp; Lifts, while they liue are most improfitable members of the common-wealth: they glut themselues as Vipers vpon the most lothsome, and detestable sinnes, seeking after folly with greedinesse, neuer doing any thing that is good, till they be trust vp at Tiburn: and then is a most wholsome Mithridate made ofthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for by their deaths
<pb facs="tcp:6152:5"/>
others are forewarned for falling into the like enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And as the Gangrena is a disease incurable by the censure of the Chirurgians, vnlesse the member where it is fixt be cut off: so this vntoward generation of loose Libertines, can by no wholsome counsailes, nor aduised perswasions be disswaded from their lothsom kind of life, till by death they be fatally, and finally cut off from the common-wealth, whereof spake <hi>Ouid</hi> well in his Metamorphosis.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Sith then this cursed crue, these Machauilians, that neither care for God nor deuill, but set with the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures gaine, and ease, their <hi>summum bonum</hi> cannot be called to anie honest course of liuing: if the honorable and worshipfull of this land looke into their liues, and cut off such vpstarting suckars that consume the sap from the roote of the Tree: they shall neither loose their reward in heauen, nor passe ouer anie day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there wil not be many faithful praiers of the poore, exhibited for their prosperous successe and welfare: so deepely are these monstrous cooseners hated in the common-wealth. Thus Gentlemen I haue discouered in briefe, what I meane to prosecute at large: though not eloquently, yet so effectually, that if you be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together careleffe, it may redownd to your commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: forewarned, forearmed: burnt children dread the fire, and such as neither counsaile, nor other mens harmes may make to beware, are worthie to liue long, and still by the losse. But hoping these secrets I haue set abroach, and my labours I haue taken in searching out those base villanies, shall not be onely taken with thankes, but applied with care: I take my leaue with this farewell. God either confound, or conuerr such base minded Cooseners.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the effecting of this base villany of Prigging or horse stealing, ther must of necessity be two at the least, and that is the Priggar and the Martar. The Priggar is he that steales the horse, and the Martar is he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues him, and chops and chaungeth him away in any Faire, Mart, or other place where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good vent for horses is: and their methode is thus.
<pb facs="tcp:6152:6"/>
The Priggar if he be a Launce man, that is, one that is already horst, then he hath more followers with him, and they ride like Gentlemen, and commonly in the fourme of Drouers, &amp; so comming into pasture grounds or inclosures, as if they ment to suruey for Cattle, doe take an especiall and perfect view where Prankers or horses be, that are of worth, and whether they be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meld or no that is whether they haue horselocks or no, then lie they houering about till fit oportunity serue, and in the night they take him or them away, and are skilfull in the blacke Art, for picking open the tramels or sockes, and so make hast til they be out of those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Now if the Priggars steale a horse in Yorkeshire, commonly they haue vent for him in Surrey, Kent, or Sussex, and their Martars that receiue them at his hand, chops them away in some blind Faires after they haue kept them a moneth or two, till the hue and cry be ceast and past ouer. Now if their horse be of any great valure and sore sought after, and so branded or eare markt, that they can hardlie sell him without extreame daunger, either they brand him with a crosse brand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the former, or take away his eare mark, and so keep him at hard meat til he be hole, or else sell him in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall or Wales, if he be in Cumberland, Lincoln-shire, Northfolke or Suffolke, but this is if the horse bée of great valour and worthy the kéeping: Marry if he bee onely coloured and without brands, they will straight spotte him by sundry pollicies, and in a blacke horse, marke saddle spots, or starre him in the forehead and change his taile, which secretes Iomit least I shoulde giue too great a light to other to practise such lewd villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But againe to our Launce men Priggars, who as before I said, cry with the Lapwing farthest from their nest and from their place of residence, where there most abode is, furthest from thence they steal their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and then in another quarter as farre of they make sale of them by the Martars meanes, without it be som
<pb facs="tcp:6152:6"/>
base Priggar that steales of méere necessity, and beside is a Trailer. The Trailer is one that goeth on foote, but meanely attired like some plaine gran of the Countrey, walking in a paire of bootes without spurres, or else without bootes, hauing a long staffe on his necke, and a blacke buckram bag at his backe, like some poore Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that had some writing in it, and there he hath his saddle, bridle and spurs, stirhops and stirhop leathers, so quaintly and artificially made that it may bee put in the slop of a mans hose, for his saddle is made without any tree, yet hath both cantle &amp; boulsters, only wrought artificially of cloth and bombast, with foulds to wrap vp in a short roome, his stirhops are made with vices and gins that one may put them in a paire of gloues, and so are his spurres, and then a little white leather headstal and raines with a small Scotish brake or snaffle, all so feately formde, that as I said before they may be put in a buckram bag. Now this Trailer he bestrides the horse which he priggeth, and saddles and bridles him as orderly as if he were his own, and then carries him far from the place of his bréede, and there sels him. Oh will some man say, it is easier to steale a horse then to sell him, considering that her Maiesty and the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priuy Counsaile, hath in the last Act of Parliament made a strikt Statute for horse stealing, and the sale of horses, whose Prouiso is this: That no man may buy a horse vntould, nor the toule be taken without lawfull witnesses, that the party that selleth the horse is the true owner of him, vppon their oath and special knowledge, and that who buieth a horse without this certificate or proofe, shall be within the natue of Fellony, as well as the party that stealeth him. To this I aunswere that there is no Act, Statute, nor Lawe so strickt conueyed, but there be straight found starting holes to auoide it, as in this. The Priggar when he hath stollen a horse and hath agreede with his Martar, or with any other his confederate, or with any honest person to sell the horse,
<pb facs="tcp:6152:7"/>
bringeth to the touler, which they call the rifler two ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men eyther apparelled like citizens, or plain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey yeomen, and they not onely affirm, but offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that they know the horse to be his, vpon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per knowledge, although perhaps they neuer saw man nor horse before, and these periurd knaurs be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly old knightes of the post, that are soisted off from be ing taken for bale at the kings bench, or other places, and seeing for open periuries they are refused, there they take that course of life, and are wrongly called Querries, but it were necessarie and verie much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the common-wealth, that such base roagues should be lookt into, and be punisht as well with the pillorie, as the other with the halter. And thus haue I reuealed the nature of Priggars, or horse-stealers briefly, which if it may profit, I haue my desire, but that I may recreate your mindes with a pleasant historie, marke the sequeale.</p>

Dealing thus with his horse, after a quarter of a yeere, that all hurly burly was past for the horse, hée
<pb facs="tcp:6152:7"/>
came riding to <hi>Tenro</hi> to the market, and there offered him to be sold, the Gentleman that lost the horse, was there present, and looking on him with other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, likte him passing well, and commended him: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he bet the prise of him, bargained, &amp; bought him: and so when he was tould, and that the horsestea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler clap him good lucke: Well my friend quoth the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I promise thée I like the horse the better, in that once I lost one as like him as might be, but that mine wanted these saddle spots, and this starre in the forehead. It may be so sir, said the Priggar, and so the Gentleman and he parted: the next day after, he caused a letter to be made, and sent the Gentleman word that he had his horse againe that he lost, onely he had giuen him a mark or two, and for that he was wel rewarded, hauing twentie marke for his labour. The gentleman hearing how he was coosened by a horse-stealer, and not onely robd, but mockt, let it passe till he might conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently méete with him to reuenge it. It fortuned not long after, that this lanceman Priggar was brought to <hi>Tenro</hi> Gayle for some such matter, and indeede it was about a Mare that he had stolne: but as knaues haue friends, especially when they are well monied, he found diuers that spake for him, and who saide it was the first fault: and the party plaintife gaue but slender euidence against him, so that the iudge spake fauourably in hys behalfe: the gentleman as then sat in the bench, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde the Priggars countenance, howe hee had stolne his horse and mockt him, remembred hee had the letter in his pocket that he sent him, and therefore rising vp, spake in his behalf, and highly commended the man, and desired the iudges for one fault he might not be cast away, and besides, may it please you (quoth hee) I had this morning a certificate of his honestie and good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour sent me, and with that he deliuered them the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the iudge and the rest of the bench smiled at this conceite, and askt the fellow if he neuer stoll a horse

from that Gentleman: no quoth the Priggar, I knew him not: your honors mistakes me, said the gentleman he did but borrow a blacke horse of me, and markt him with a stare in the forehead, and askt twenty marke of me for his labour, and so discourst the whole matter: whereupon the quest went vpon him, and condemned him: and so the Priggar went to heauen in a string, as many of his facultie had done before.</p>

I knowe it well, saies the Uerser: haue with you for a pottle of burnt Secke, and so to it they go, as before in my first part I describe it vnto you: the poore Marchant the simple honest Connie, calling the Card<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well the Uerser lost, and at last they reueale the pollicie to the Conny, who wondered at the strange deuise, and solemnly swore it was impossible for him ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loose, or the other to winne: As thus they sat drinking the Setter shewed him diuers trickes at Cardes, to passe away the time, because theyr Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle staied ouer long, who at last, attiered like a Seruing-man, came and thrust open the doore, and saide, maisters by your leaue, I looke for a grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound that hath broken my slip, &amp; is run into this house.

In faith saies the marchant, I dare play with him, as long as fiue shillinges last, and so much I will venter: with that the Barnacle drew out a purse with some thrée or foure pence in it, and to this game they go, with vie and reuie till the Barnacle had lost all his money, then hee blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the name of God mightily, and laide his sword and his cloke to pawne to the good man of the house, and borrowed money of it, to the value of some xx. shillings.

Connies mouth cleane for trobling his purse, with any of those crowns, yea he so handled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt, that of nine pound he had in his purse, these thrée base Conny-catchers left him neuer a penny, although he was sore nipt on the head, with this hard Fortune, yet he brookt it with patience, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle suspected that his Countrey man the Setter had sifted him out of his money, and therefore druncke to him friendly, and tooke his leaue without smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them at all, and went quiet though discontent to his lodging. The Conny-catchers they shard the purchase, and went singing home as winners doe that haue leaue and leisure to laugh at the spoile of such wealthie and honest marchants. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, the cony chanced to come to my chamber to visit me for old acquaintance, where he found a book of Cony-catching new come out of the presse which when he had smilde at, for the strangenesse of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: at last he began to reade it, and there saw how simplie hee was made a conny, and stript of hys crownes: with that he fetcht a great sigh, and sayd: sir, if I had séene this booke but two dayes since, it had saued me nine pound in my purse, and then hée rehearst the whole discourse, howe kindly hee was made a conny. Thus you may sée that these base conny-catchers spare not their owne acquaintance nor familiar friends: but like Uultures seek to pray vpon them, and like the Harpie, infectes that house wherein they harbour: so odious is their base and detestable kind of coosenage, that the very Nips, the cut-purses I meane, desire to smoake them, and haue them in as great contempt, as they themselues are despised of others: holding the conny-catcher for their inferiour: for say the Nips I disdaine to vse

my occupation against any friend, or so drawe a purse from him that I am familiarly acquainted with: whereas the conny-catcher praieth moste vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his countreymen and friendes, and at the first hand comes with a smiling face to embrace that man, whome presently he meanes to spoyle and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. Againe, the Nip vseth his knife, and if he sée a Boung lie faire, strikes the stroke, and venters his necke for it if he be taken, which is a certaine point (say they) of resolution, though in the basest degree: but the conny-catcher, like a coward keepes himself within compasse of lawe, as the picture of a faint hearted coosener: like a fawning curre wagges hys tayle vppon him, hee meanes most deadly to bite. then let this be a caueat for all men, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to take héede of such preiudiciall pesants: who like wormes in a nut eat the kernell, wherein they are bred, and are so venemous minded, that like the Uiper they desparage whomsoeuer they light on: I know I shall haue many braues vttered against me for this inuectiue: but so I may profit my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen I will hazard my selfe against their déepest villanies: and therefore sléeping neuer a whit the worse for their brauado, I commit such enemies of the flourishing Estate of England, to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iustices who I hope will looke into the loose life of bad, base, and dishonest caterpillers.</p>

At this his fellow lookes out and smiles, making this reply.

               <p>IT fortuned of late that a Courber &amp; his Warpe went walking in the dead of the night to spy out some window open for their purpose, &amp; by chance same by a Noble mans house about London and saw the windowe of the porters lodge open, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in, spyed fatte snappings and bad his Warpe watch carefully for there would be purchase, &amp; with that took his Courb and thrust it into the chamber, and the Porter lying in his bed was a wake &amp; sawe all, and so was his bedfellow that was yeoman of the wine seller, the Porter stole out of his bed to marke what would be doone, and the firste snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Courber light on, was his Liuerye coate, as he was drawing it to the windowe, the Porter easilye lifted it off and so the Courber drew his hook in vaine, the whilste his bedfellow stole out of the chamber and raysed vptwo or thrée more and went about to take them, but still the rogue he plyed his busines and lighted on a gowne that he vsed to sit in in the Porters lodge, and warily drew it, but when it came at the windowe, the Porter drew it off so lightly that the hooker perceiued it not: then when he saw his Courbe would take no holde, he swore and chafte and tolde the Warp he had holde of two good snappes and yet mist them both and that the fault was in his Courb, then he fell to sharping and hammering of the hook to make it kéep better hold, and in againe he thrusts it and lightes vpon a paire of buffe hose, but when he had drawen them to the windowe the Porter tooke them off againe, which made the Courber almost mad, &amp; swore he thought the deuill was abrode to night he had such hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
<pb facs="tcp:6152:25"/>
naye sayes the yeeman of the seller, there is thrée abroade, and we are come to setche you and your hookes to hell so they apprehended these base rogues &amp; carried them into the Porters lodge and made that their prison. In the morning a crue of Gentlemen in the house, satte for Iudges (in that they would not trouble their Lord with such filthy Caterpillers) and by them they were found guiltie, and condemned to abide forty blowes a peece with a bastinado, which they had sollempnly paide, and so went away without any further damage.</p>
