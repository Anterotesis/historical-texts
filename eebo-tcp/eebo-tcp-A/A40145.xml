            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Concerning ſuch as have forbidden Preaching or Teaching in the Name of <hi>JESUS,</hi> and ſuch as are aſhamed to confeſs Him before Men, and call not on the Name of the <hi>LORD,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HERE you may ſee who, and what they were, that forbad the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to Preach or Teach, or Speak in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith of ſuch that are aſhamed to Confeſs Him before Men; And what Judgments come upon thoſe Families, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Nations, that do not call upon the Name of the <hi>Lord:</hi> And they that do not call upon the Name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and know Him not, are ſuch as devoureth <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Elect and Beloved of God. <hi>And yet the Lord poureth out of his Spirit upon all Fleſh,</hi> that with the Spirit they may know God, and call upon his Name, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> and their Prieſts ſaid unto the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and threatned them, <hi>That ye Speak henceforth to no Man in this Name</hi> Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.17. And they ſaid again (in Verſe 18.) to the <hi>Apoſtles, That they ſhould not Teach in the Name of</hi> Jeſus. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 5.28. they again ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould not Teach in the Name of</hi> Jeſus, [mark] <hi>not to Teach in the Name of</hi> Jeſus. And in Verſe 40. they ſaid again to the Apoſtles, <hi>That they ſhould not Speak in the Name of</hi> Jeſus, [mark] <hi>not ſo much as to Speak in the Name of</hi> Jeſus. And yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid, <hi>With the Heart Man Believeth, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation. And if thou Confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that God hath raiſed him up from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were the greateſt outward Profeſſors, agreed, <hi>That if any Man did Confeſs that he was the Chriſt, they ſhould be put out of their Synagogue,</hi> John 9.22. <hi>And many of the Chief Rulers Believed on him, but becauſe of the Phariſees, they did not Confeſs him,</hi> namely Chriſt, <hi>leſt they ſhould be put out of their Synagogue,</hi> John 12.42. So here were them that did Believe, both Rulers and others in Chriſt, but they were afraid to Confeſs Chriſt, leſt they ſhould be Excommunicated, or put out of their Synagogues. And Chriſt ſaith unto his Diſciples, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall Confeſs Me before Men, him will I Confeſs alſo before My Father which is in Heaven: But whoſoever ſhall Deny Me before Men, him will I alſo Deny before My Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 10.32, 33. and Luke 12.8. So here you may ſee they that do Confeſs Chriſt before Men, are Confeſſed by Him before His Father, and they that Deny Him before Men, Chriſt will Deny before His Father.</p>
            <p>And <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every Spirit that Confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh is of God, and every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that Confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh is not of God</hi>: So here you may ſee that it is the good Spirit of God that doth Confeſs his Son to be come in the Fleſh, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.2, 3. Here you may ſee the two Spirits, that which is of God, and that which is not of God, the good Spirit, and the bad Spirit. And, <hi>Who Confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh, is a Deceiver and an Antichriſt,</hi> and ſo not in the Spirit of God nor Chriſt, 2 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prove your own ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. And ſo if they have not the Spirit of Chriſt, and if He be not in them, then they are Reprobates, and ſo none of Chriſt's.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Coloſſians, Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory, And they Warned every Man, and Taught every Man in all Wiſdom, that they might preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> So then Chriſt muſt be in His People, and they muſt be in Him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27, 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Chriſt before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſeth a good Confeſſion,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.13. This was before His Perſecutor, ſo muſt all the Followers of the Lamb Confeſs Him before Men to the Glory of God the Father, and not be aſhamed of <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Life, Light and Salvation, Redeemer, Mediator, Prophet, Biſhop, Shepherd, Leader, Counſellor, Way and Door to God, and the Author and Finiſher of their Faith, and Heavenly Rock and Foundation, and the Captain of their Salvation, and not to be aſhamed to meet in His Name, who hath all Power in Heaven and in Earth given to Him, leſt He be aſhamed of you before His Holy Angels, and His Father which is in Heaven: And therefore in His Light, Spirit, Grace, Truth and Faith, ſee and hold Chriſt your Head, who Bruiſeth the Serpents Head, and Reconcileth you to God, in whom you and all Nations are Bleſſed, and have Reſt and Peace, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pour out Thy Fury upon the Heathen that know Thee not, and upon the Families that call not upon Thy Name, for they have Eaten up</hi> Jacob, <hi>and Devoured him, and Conſumed him, and bave made his Habitation deſolate,</hi> Jer. 10.25. Theſe were the Perſecutors of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pour out Thy Wrath upon the Heathen that have not known Thee, and upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that have not called upon Thy Name, for they have Devoured</hi> Jacob, <hi>and laid waſte his Dwelling Place,</hi> Pſal. 79.6, 7. Theſe were the Perſecutors of God's Elect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet God ſetteth the Poor on High from Affliction, and maketh him Families like a Flock,</hi> Pſal. 107.41.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And God ſetteth the Solitary in Families, and bringeth out thoſe which are bound with Chains: But the Rebellious Dwell in a Dry Land. Pſalm</hi> 68.6.</p>
