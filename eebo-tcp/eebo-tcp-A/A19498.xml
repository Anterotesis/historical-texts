         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE, <hi>DAVID,</hi> LORD OF SCONE, <hi>ONE OF HIS MAIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> most Honorable Priuy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in this Kingdome.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord; when I dedicated to the Earle of Dunbar, of good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, my Treatise of the <hi>Anatomy of a Christian,</hi> I was then of purpose to haue presented to your L. this <hi>Holy Alphabet for Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Scholars;</hi> but could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it till now. Ye liued together in his Maiesties most honourable seruice, like a paire of faithfull friends; <hi>louing and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in your liues,</hi> and shall not be diuided in your deaths for me. As my other Treatise went forth for a witnesse of my fauour without flattery toward him (for the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Epistle was printed after his death) so will I that this stand as a testimonie of my loue toward your L. partly for that which yee are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partly for that which I hope yee shall be: <hi>Ille enim veraciter amat amicum, qui Deum amat in amico; aut quia est in illo, aut vt sit in illo.</hi> For he doth truely loue his friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who loueth God in his friend: that is, eyther for the good which is in him; or else, that the good which he wants may be in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9460:3"/>There are many in this age, with whom Satan hath coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, as <hi>Nahash</hi> the Ammonit would haue done with the Israelites of Iabesh Golead, vpon this condition, That he put out their right eies. These men haue an eye to see, and a tong to speake of that, which is euill in another; but none to se<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is good: compared properly by <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> to venemous flyes; who passing by the part that is whole, light vpon that which is sore, and make it worse then they sound it. For mine owne part, I neuer mind to be one of these. If I should praise you for the good which ye want, I knowe I should neyther please you nor prosite you; your vnder stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being more solid, then that shadowes in stead of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, can content you: neyther yet also, on the other hand, will I so looke vnto that, which ye want, that I passe by the good which ye haue; vnder hope also that this shall make you better.</p>
            <p>There are none who knowe your L. but haue marked an affection toward Religion so indiuert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ble, that no man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded, durst euer attempt to alter it: which in this declining age deserues no small commendation. A heart in like maner toward execution of iustice, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> inslexible, that ye haue preferred the lawe to the loue of men, who otherway haue bin most deere vnto you: for the which howsoeuer yee haue beene misliked of many; yet haue you proued a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruant to your Master in most difficill times: for <hi>By iustice the Throne is established.</hi> Your naturall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in discerning betweene right and wrong, may iustly be admired: specially sith your education hath not been by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of artes, in the Academie; but by practise of them in the Palace: where unto yee could also hardly haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if yee had not learned vnden such a King, as is not onely a patterns of vertue himselfe; but a solid Thealog and Philosopher, euer discussing to his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiques of that which is good and euill, both in Religion, manners, and policie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9460:3"/>But my Lord; howsoeuer these be good things, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy commendation, yet haue they need to be strengthenea with better: for all gifts, were they neuer so excellent, if they be not crowned with godlinesse, may well increase conuiction; but can render no consolation in the day of trouble. This is it therefore which now I haue to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto your L. that yee growe in knowledge and in the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ: whereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these common reasons that should stirre vp cuerie Christian; there are three which more particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke you vnto it.</p>
            <p>The first is, that GOD by your first generation hath brought you forth a man of honour in this earth: for in regard of naturall descent, your honourable Father, the Lorde of <hi>Baluaird,</hi> was a brother of the Earle of <hi>Tullibardin;</hi> whose house is as a noble stocke, from which hath sprung out, like branches, exceeding many honourable Families, all of the name of <hi>Murray,</hi> and hath continued in this Lande these fifteene hundreth yeares.</p>
            <p>Your Mother, a <hi>Grahame,</hi> daughter of the right Noble Earle of <hi>Montrose;</hi> whose house hath continued with honour since the beginning of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Your Mothers mother, a <hi>Keith,</hi> daughter to the right noble Earle <hi>Mershell;</hi> whose House and Family being long before honourable in this Kingdome, was sixe hundreth years agoe decorated with the Office of the <hi>Marshalship</hi> of Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their vertue and valour in batteil; where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> they continue vnto this day among the chiefest Peeres of the Realme. Your Fathers Mother, a <hi>Lyndsay,</hi> daughter to the right noble Lord, the Lord <hi>Lyndsay;</hi> whose Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e not inferiour to many in honour, may aboue many most iustly he commended for their earnest z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ale, and sincerr affection toward the aduancement of true Religion.</p>
            <p>All these should greatly increase your care, that ye be no
<pb facs="tcp:9460:4"/>
found lesse honourable in Christ, then ye are in this world: For this world properly is compared to a Stage-play, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in oftentimes Nobles are clad in beggars garments, and the beggar takes on the habite of a King; but when the guise is ended, and the maskes remoued, then euery one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be that which he is: and the man of base estate was not so much comforted with his temporall representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an honourable man, as he is now grieued to see hee was but honourable in sport and shew, not in effect. Yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such are there in the world, who goe in the state of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men, but shall be found in the end vessels of dishonour, To be honourable in both, is rare; yet such as may be obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by godlinesse: for godlinesse hath the promise both of this life, and of the life to come.</p>
            <p>The second reason; Ye haue serued his Maiestie, these eight and thirtie yeares: not as a Domestique onely; but as a Counceller and Officer of estate also: and that with so constant an affection, that ye haue not spared to incurre the displeasure and malecontentment of any whatsoeuer; so be it ye might procure pleasure and contentment to your Master. My Lord; at yee haue learned to serue most faithfully a King on earth, and for good seruice haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the recompence of his Princely liberality: so thinke with your selfe how greatly ye shall be conuinced, if ye doe not learne to serue the King of heauen; whose wage to his seruants doth as farre exceed any thing yee haue, as the heauens are aboue the earth.</p>
            <p>The third is; Ye are now striken in yeares, your Almond tree is flourished: these fiftie and eight yeares hath God spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, and not taken you away in your ignorances and sinnes, as he hath done many others, both at your right hand, and at the left. My Lord; the patience of God is called long, but his mercy euerlasting: the vse of his mercy toward his owne, is to beare with them, till they be deliuered into the hands of his mercie: then are they out of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<pb facs="tcp:9460:4"/>
for his mercy endures for euer: and whom once he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues, he neuer casts away again. But wo is to the wicked: for they abuse Gods patience, to fulfill the measure of their iniquity; heaping vp wrath to themselues by the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of sinnes, as it were in a treasure against the day of wrath. Thus as the Fish of Iorden goe sprinkling and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the streame thereof, till at length they fall into the Loch or salt Sea of Sodome, where they die: so are all the wicked, abusing Gods patience, carried on by their deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleasures of sin, to a miserable end. For where in their young yeares they will not repent, in their olde age custome of sinne so confirmes them in euill, that they cannot repent; no more then a Leopard can change his spots, or a Blacke Moore his colour.

               </gap>may perceiue that God his long pattence, whereby he spares a man, is not a blessing, if mercy to pardon sins past, and grace to renne for the time to come, doe not follow it: yea, rather, <hi>quo diutius expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> districtius iudicabit;</hi> the longer he tarie and spare, the sharper will he strike when he comes. Let this waken in your L. a care to redeeme the time, and a resolution to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the residue of your few yeares vnto the Lord your God.</p>
            <p>For which cause it shall not be vnprofitable your L. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member these counsels: first, that ye examine diligently your by-gon life; <hi>No man knowes the things of a man, but the spirit of a man:</hi> this will tell you more of your selfe, then all the world can tell you. In this examination spare not your selfe, if you would haue God to spare you: iudge your selfe, accuse your selfe, correct your selfe, and GOD shall not iudge you. Remember when yee come to iudgement, there will be none to stand against you, if it be not your owne sinnes: so long therfore as you haue time, fall vpon them, fight with them, and doe all that ye can to vndoe them.</p>
            <p>Where, if your L. would know how is it that a man may
<pb facs="tcp:9460:5"/>
vndoe the euill which he hath done; The answer is, that two manner of waies ye may doe it: first, if with good <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> ye recount your by-gon sinnes in the bitternesse of your heart; mourning for them euer when ye thinke vpon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with the eyes of faith looke to him, who being righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, died for our sinnes: sending vp strong supplications to God, that by the merit of Christs death your sinnes may be buried in the graue, and haue neuer place to stand against you in iudgement. If they be such as may be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nded by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, faile not to do it, after the manner of good <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus:</hi> if they be not of that nature, mend them by doing the contrarie good. This is that holie reuenge which the Apostle commends as a not able effect of repentance, That we should be reuenged of our by-gon euils, by doing the good which we know is most contrarie vnto them.</p>
            <p>This being done for annulling of your by-gon sinnes; let your next care be to rectifie your life for the time to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Salomon</hi> saies, The end of a thing is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. His meaning is of good things: for euill men waxe worse and worse; but an elect man by grace makes his latter end better then his beginning; and they who are planted in the Courts of the Lords house, flourish and bring forth fruit, euen in their olde daies.</p>
            <p>And here againe I recommend to your L. a three fold duetie. First, remember how manie are the obligation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvherein ye stand bound to the Lord your God: thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that question of godlie <hi>Dauid; What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?</hi> Take an answer for it, out of these vvords of <hi>Salomon; My sonne giue me thine heart.</hi> Euerie morning offer vnto the Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitias cordis, &amp; oris tui;</hi> the first fruits of your heart and mouth: thinke vpon nothing before yee thinke on him; speake of nothing till first yee speake vnto him; be feruent and continuall in prayer. <hi>Si non semper precamur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per debemus habere paratum precantis affectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>f
<pb facs="tcp:9460:5"/>
we be not alway praying, we should alway haue readie a heart disposed to pray. The vessels of mercy should smell of mercie; and the Temples of God should neuer want the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of God: giue to the Lord both the thankes, and the seruice of all the good ye haue receiued from him. Many giue him verball thankes for his benefites, acknowledging themselues debitors to him for the good which they haue; who will not serue him with his owne benefites. Let these men know, that their thanks are not acceptable to him.</p>
            <p>The second point of your care, I would haue entended to the poore and needy: as ye haue receiued mercy from God, or looke to get it, shew mercy for Gods sake to such as are vnder you. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, The mercies of the wicked are crueltie; but the mercies of a righteous man extend euen toward his beast: how much more then will he be mercifull to his Christian brother? Remember what comfort <hi>Iob</hi> found in the day of his trouble, arising from this, <hi>That he</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 31.</note> 
               <hi>restrained not the poore of their desire, and caused not the eyes of the widdow to faile: that he did not eate his morsels alone, but the fatherlesse eat thereof: that he saw none perish for want of clothing, nor suffered the poore to be without a couering: that the loynes of the poore blessed him, because hee was warmed with the fleece of his sheepe.</hi> It is a great grace, where a man, not onely sets his owne heart to praise God; but hyreth the heart and tongue of others to praise God with him, and for him: therfore <hi>To do good and to distribute forget not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
               <hi>for with such sacrifices God is pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with these, thinke it a peece of your honour to honor the seruants of the Lord. <hi>Beautifull,</hi> saith <hi>Esay, are the feet of those, who bring the glad tidings of peace:</hi> If their feet be beautifull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what should their face be? Looke not to their weakenesse; but for their Master and their message sake, esteeme them alwayesarorthy to be welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And sith they pray vnto God for your L. be loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<pb facs="tcp:9460:6"/>
them in their reasonable requests to you; remembring that reason which <hi>Ambrose</hi> vsed to <hi>Theodose</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: <hi>Si dignus non sum qui à te audiar, nec etiam dignus qui pro te à deo exaudiar;</hi> If I be not worthy that I should be heard of thee when I speake vnto thee, farre lesse am I worthy that I should be heard of God, when I speake to him for thee.</p>
            <p>The third is, that ye haue a continuall care of your selfe. Nature can teach you to care for those things which are yours: but it is grace must learne you to care for your selfe. Satan is a restlesse tempter; but yet so subtill, that he can frame his temptations according to the ages and states of men: he tempts not children as he doth young men; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tempts hee young men as hee doth the aged; neyther tempts he the aged as he doth any of the other two. Hee tempts children with folly, and playes with them, as the Prouerb is, at the belly blinde; seeking no more of that age, but that it be passed ouer with foolish and friuolous things. Young men againe he tempts to wickednesse, many wayes, by the fury of their inordinate concupiscence: these are called by the Apostle, <hi>The noysome lusts of youth.</hi> Aged men most commonly he tempts them with couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and excessiue cares of the vvorld. <hi>Omnia in homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne cùmsenescunt vitia, sola iuuenescit auaritia:</hi> When all other sinnes waxe olde and feeble in a man, onely coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse waxeth young, and increaseth her strength.

vsing this world as if ye vsed it not. What-euer your actions be about it, set your affections vpon better things; knowing, as saith the Apostle, that the shape and figure of this world goes away. It is vvisedome to forsake this vvorld vvith our vvill, before we be forced to forsake it against our vvill: to leaue it euen when we do possesse it. <hi>Abraham</hi> liued not so long as did many of his fathers; yet when he died, it is said of him that he died full of dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he desired no mo.

acknowledgeth to be the way of truth, adding these protestations: that he had chosen it; his hart cleaned to it; and he would continue in it.</p>
                  <p>In this Verse, we haue first to see what is this way of lying, that we may vnderstand the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his petition.

                  <p>And vnto this deceit of sinne <hi>Dauid</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth<note place="margin">The deceitfull way of sinne is within euery man by nature.</note> himselfe subiect with the rest; for why? he would not pray the Lord to take that away from him, which were not in him. <hi>In nobis est, &amp; interius manet via iniquitatis, ideo<expan>

without a teacher or counseller, to follow them in it. <hi>Ideoque quia vulnus grande ac vetus est, &amp; diu serpens, perfectioris medicinae remedia deposcit.</hi> And therefore, because it is a great wound &amp; an old, it requires the remedie of more perfect medicine, then the wit or power of man is able to affoord: which <hi>Dauid</hi> vvell knowing, beseecheth God of his mercie to take away this euill from him.</p>

                     <hi>And grant mee graciously thy law.</hi>] Hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones<note place="margin">The law of God, the way of truth in three respects.</note> the law of God, to the way of lying. First, because it is the onely rule of all truth, both in religion and manners: that which is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">1.</note> to it, is but a lye, vvhich shall deceiue men. Secondly, it destroyes, and shall at length vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<note place="margin">2.</note> destroy all contrary errors. As the rodde of <hi>Aaron,</hi> deuoured the rods of the Enchaunters: so the word, which is the rodde of the mouth of<note place="margin">☞</note> God, shall in the end, eate vp and consume all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes whatsoeuer. Thirdly, according to the<note place="margin">3.</note> sentence of this vvord, so shall it be vnto euerie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9460:48"/>
man; it deceiues none. Men shall find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it is true: he who walkes in a way condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word, shall come to a miserable end. And on the contrary, it cannot be but well vvith them who liue according to this rule; <hi>Non est</hi>

                  <p>But had not <hi>Dauid</hi> the law already? No doubt<note place="margin">Then haue we learned Gods law, when it is written in the table of our hart.</note> he wanted not the booke of the law. Hee heard it, he read it, he professed it: yea, some-way hee vnderstood it. What then is it hee craues? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the law might be so imprinted in his hart, that it might abolish that naturall vanitie, and deceit of sinne, which carried him to the offence of God. A necessary petition for these dayes: vvherin the knowledge of the word is exceeding<note place="margin">A warning to the professors of this age.</note> great; but the zeale, spirituall life, and feeling of the harts of men is not answerable vnto it.

But certainly, vvhen they thinke they haue it, they want it; so long as it is not printed in the table of their hart, to frame their motions, affections and actions conformable to it.

For first, he sought mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to forgiue his sinnes: then he sought mercy, to comfort him in his troubles: now hee seekes mercy, to liue and sinne no more.

                  <p>IN this verse are two things; a complaint of the malice of his enemies, &amp; a protestation of<note place="margin">Malice of the wicked is insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable against the godly.</note> his constant affection toward the word of God. In the first he complains, they had not only troubled him, but almost consumed him: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious cruelty of the wicked is insatiable, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quenched: nay, not by death; for euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death they rent both the name and the bodies of godly men. <hi>Dauid</hi> was not thus farre deliuered<note place="margin">They rent both their names and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies after they are dead.</note> into his enemies hands; but he complaines, that their malice almost had vndone him. We mark it for this end, that we may know it is Gods great prouidence, that at any time we liue among the wicked, and are not consumed by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we marke here the great weakenesse and infirmity of Gods children, who oftentimes<note place="margin">It is mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity to be cast down with tentations co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from men more then those that come from God.</note> are more discouraged w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> those tentations which come immediatly from men, then with those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which com immediatly from God; in the one they stand strong; in the other they faint and are ouercome. Surely because wee are in a great parte carnall, therefore is it, that the want of mans comfort and countenance commoues vs. If we were as we should be, or as <hi>Nazianzen</hi>

If it be otherwise, that we consume and faint for the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of men, all this weakenesse proceeds from our vnregenerate nature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we marke here the Lords dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Why God will haue his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren brought very low by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> in his manner of working with his children; who not onely suffers them to be troubled, but brought so lowe by trouble, that in their owne sense they are almost consumed.

                  <p>According to our sense, there is a time wherin
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:9460:150"/>
God worketh not: whereof proceedes in the<note place="margin">God is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall working vertue, euen when we think he is resting.</note> godlie the like of these complaints; <hi>Arise Lord, why sleepest thou? How long wilt thou forget?</hi> It is true, in himselfe hee is a continuall working vertue; but wee, beeing ignorant of the waies whereby he walkes to his owne end, think some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that hee is not working, because hee is not executing: although euen then, when wee so thinke, hee be most busily working a way, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his owne determinate conclusion.</p>
                  <p>But how is this, that hee prescribeth a time to<note place="margin">How Dauid prescribes a time to the Lord.</note> the Lord? Is not this to fall into that fault, which is reprooued, Psalme 78? <hi>They limited the Holie one of Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For answere of this; GOD hath made some promises with a time, declaring to his children when hee would performe them. So hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">Some promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses made with a time when they shall be performed.</note> to free <hi>Abrahams</hi> seede, from the Egyptian persecution, after foure hundred yeeres; as hee did: for it was no lesse between the beginning of that persecution in <hi>Ismael</hi> mocking <hi>Isaac,</hi> &amp; the deliuerance from it, in <hi>Pharao</hi> oppressing <hi>Israel</hi> with burdens.</p>
                  <p>Again, he promised to bring <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Babel</hi> after seauenty yeers: and therfore the godly, who thought very long for expiring of that date, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earnestly, that God would haue mercy on <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> because the appointed time was come. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, he promised to send <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the true deliuerer of his people, at that time when the Scepter shold
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:9460:150"/>
depart from <hi>Israel:</hi> and therefore at that time, <hi>Simeon</hi> waited for the consolation, and his eyes saw the saluation, of God.</p>
                  <p>Other promises againe hee makes without a<note place="margin">Some without a time.</note> time; that is, not telling when he will performe them. He put <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark; but told him not when hee would bring him out: and hee taried a yeere and a day, waiting Gods time with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He sent <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> into Egypt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding them to tarie there, till he told them: they inquired not how long; neither did hee tell them: Learning vs, when God layes a crosse on vs, not to capitulate with him, concerning the time of our deliuerance; but patiently to beare it,<note place="margin">In these wee should haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience waiting till Gods time come.</note> till his time come. It was <hi>Sauls</hi> ouer-hastiness; he taried for <hi>Samuel</hi> seauen daies, but would tarie no longer. And it was the blasphemous speech of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> Why should I attend any longer?</p>
                  <p>Let vs not dishonour the Lord, by prescribing a time to him. If he should alway tell vs the time of our deliuerance, the praise of our patience should be the lesse, and our prayer the colder: but when hee conceales the time, and wee with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">☜</note> wait vpon it; we giue good proofe of our faith and patience, and finde our deliuerance the sweeter when it comes.</p>
                  <p>Yet in publick troubles of the Church, when<note place="margin">When the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may vse this reason in their prayer, The time is come.</note> the pride of the enemie is become great, and the cup of the Amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>For they haue destroyed thy law.</hi>] It is a great proofe of true godlinesse, when we are more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased<note place="margin">Offences done against God, should grieue vs more then our owne iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> with offences done against the Lord our GOD, then with such as are done against our selues.

                  <p>In the second verse of this Section, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,<note place="margin">Godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue no enemies, but such as are enemies to God.</note> that the proud would oppresse him: now he complaineth, that they destroyed the law of God.

                  <p>And as for the great good we get by mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">2.

vpon the right obiects, moderate, in due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, it causes a zeale which is holy and spirituall: otherwise, if our loue be inordinate, it begets a carnall or inordinate zeale. Sometime the zeale is not vpon the right obiect; and then it may be great, but it cannot be good: such is the zeale of Heretiques, who compasse Sea and Land to<note place="margin">☞</note> make one of their owne profession. Sometime againe the zeale is on the right obiect, not in the due measure: eyther too colde, which is remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or too hote, which is superstition.

                     <note place="margin">An appellation from men to God.</note> from men vnto God. The meaning of it is: O Lorde, I finde that among men equity is not regarded: euen they, who vpon earth are thy Deputies, who should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the right, and punish the wrong; by them the cause of innocent men many a time is borne downe: wherefore Lord, I beseech thee (who art the righteous ludge of the world) pleade my cause against them.</p>
                  <p>Wherein, first wee haue a comfort for them<note place="margin">To be vsed of them who are wronged by men.</note> who are oppressed by the vnrighteousnesse of men: they are taught here by <hi>Dauids</hi> example, to appeale to God, and call him to be Iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and their oppressors. Many a time good men faint &amp; fall down euen in a good cause for a while, because they trust in their cause, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to seeke the Lords protection.</p>
                  <p>And againe, here is a warning for all men in the world; specially for Iudges, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belongs<note place="margin">A warning to Iudges.</note> the cognition of other mens causes: that they take heede what they doe; seeing as <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> said to his Deputies, <hi>The iudgement is the Lords:</hi>

And therefore it were good for them, not so much to look vnto such as are vnder them, with whom they may do (as they think) in the matter of right and wrong at their pleasure, without controlement; as to look vnto him who is aboue them, &amp; whose iudgement they themselues must vndergo, both in their persons and actions.</p>

All the<note place="margin">Esa. 40.</note> Nations of the earth are but like the droppe of a<note place="margin">Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the greatnesse of our sinnes.</note> bucket, or as a graine of sand, compared with his Maiestie: what art thou then, that thou shouldst magnifie thy deedes aboue his rich mercie; as if thy sinnes were so great, that his mercie could not compasse them? Onely doe not abuse his mercy; neyther turne thou his grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse: but if thou vnfeinedly repent, then doe thou also stedfastly beleeue, that thy sinnes, were they neuer so great, shall easily be swallowed vp<note place="margin">☜</note> by his infinite mercies. As the Ocean, when it flowes, couers sands and rockes, and all, that they are not seene: so, where the floud of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions breaks out, how easily doth it ouerflow and couer all thy transgressions? This is the meditation of the Apostle; that where before he<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> had beene many manner of wayes sinfull and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:9460:183"/>
ignorant, a blasphemer, an oppressor, a persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet the grace of our Lord had beene excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundant toward him: where sinne had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, grace had superabounded, to ouer flow and couer it. And in this he stands for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all that will beleeue, that they should neuer distrust Gods great mercies for the greatnesse of their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>The other Epithet he giues them, is, That they<note place="margin">The mercies of God are called tender, &amp; why.</note> are tender mercies; because the Lord is easie to be intreated: for he is slowe vnto wrath, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to shew mercy. S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, that the wisdom<note place="margin">Iam. 3.</note> which is from aboue is gentle, peaceable, easie to be intreated. If his grace in his children make them gentle, and easie to be intreated; what shall we thinke of him selfe? Sith he will haue such pitie<note place="margin">☞</note> in vs poore creatures, that seauenty times seauen times in the day hee will haue vs to forgiue the offences of our brethren; O what pitie &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion abounds in himselfe!

So that by this one grace, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle cals a most excellent grace, all other graces of the spirit will come to be tried. That faith which workes not by loue, is no faith: &amp; that obedience w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> flowes not from faith, is no obedience. Loue is the balance of the Sanctuary, wherein euery thing is weighed which is offered vnto God: let vs therefore couet this most excellent grace.</p>
                  <p>That this comfort may be made the more sure<note place="margin">Two things to trie if we haue loue or not.</note> vnto vs, let vs consider these two infallible tokens of our loue: the first is, the loue of Gods law; the next is the loue of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>The law of God hath in it a certaine pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">1. He that loues God cannot but loue his law, fith it is a pourtrait of his image.</note> of his image. What he is in himselfe, he hath declared in his lawe: &amp; therefore such as knowe him and loue him, cannot but loue his law. <hi>If any man loue me,</hi> said the Lord Iesus, <hi>he will keepe my commandements. Dauid</hi> ioynes these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the 16. Psalme; hee protests that God
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:9460:194"/>
was the portion of his inheritance: and againe in the III. verse of this Psalme, That he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Testimonies of God as an heritage for euer. Alas, that foolish man should think to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne these two; pretending to loue God, when he shewes himselfe a plaine contemner of his word.</p>
                  <p>The other marke, whereby Gods loue is try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">2. He that loues God cannot but loue his Saints.</note> is the loue of his Saints: <hi>By this shall yee bee knowne to be my Disciples, if yee loue one another. He that loueth not his brother whom he hath scene;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 1. Ioh. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>how can hee loue God whom hee hath not seene?</hi> Man was made to the image of God: Can he be a louer of God, who loues not man made to the image of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> many times hath protested that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God dearely; but he proues it by this, That he loued the lawe of God, and the Saints of God: <hi>I am companion</hi> (said hee) <hi>to all them that feare thee,</hi> ver. 63. And againe, <hi>My loue extends not to thee; but for thy sake my delight is in thy Saints, and excellent ones vpon earth.</hi>

This is a common thing to men in the state of nature, that of small gifts they conceiue a great pride: but grace, as it giues vnto man more excellent gifts then nature can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord; so it teacheth him to looke vnto that which he wants, that he be not puft vp by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that which he hath: but, forgetting it, is carried in all humility of his heart, to pray for that which he wants.</p>
