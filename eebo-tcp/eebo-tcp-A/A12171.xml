            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

need above all others to carie grace in their hearts, that so having made peace with God, they may bee fit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with men. And having by faith in Christ disarmed death before they dye, they may sacrifice their lives with the more courage and comfort: which to neglect being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eternity, is not valour but desperate madnesse, because in
<pb facs="tcp:2554:3"/>
this businesse as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versights of war, there is no place for a second repentance, the first er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror being unrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In evills above the strength of man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile and his patience to endure, there God hath planted the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of feare, which might stirre us up to avoyd the danger by flying to him in Christ who being our friend it is no matter who is
<pb facs="tcp:2554:4"/>
our enemy: wee may be killed, but cannot be hurt; so safe it is to be under his command that hath command over Death, Hell, Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all that wee most feare. Yet such is our nature that by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with danger, wee grow by degrees insensibly to be harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against it, and to looke no further then death, as if to die were onely to give up the

ghost, and then an end of all. And hereupon it is that they that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the warres are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken to be men not most religious. The more respect those of that profession de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that have learned upon what tearmes to live and dye, that are sure of a better life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they leave this, that have layd up their life in Christ; Amongst whom (right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)

            <p>I may seeme to some unbefitting to offer a discourse of a bruised

<pb facs="tcp:2554:6"/>
fountaine of strength with the meanest. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VID was a valiant man, yet upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his oft failings and recoveries, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came towards God as a weaned child. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of mind to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and greatnesse of spirit against his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may well stand together, for the way to bee above all other things, is to submit to God first.

God knowes that as wee are prone to sinne, so when conscience is throughly
<pb facs="tcp:2554:15"/>
awaked, wee are as prone to despaire for sinne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would have us know that hee setteth himselfe in the Covenant of grace to triumph in CHRIST over the greatest evills and enemies we feare, and that his thoughts are not as our thoughts are, that he is God <note place="margin">Es. 5. 8.</note> and not man, that there is heights, and depths, and <note place="margin">Hos. 11. 9.</note> breadths of mercy in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 18.</note> all the depths of our sin and misery; that wee should never bee in such a forlorne condition, wherein there should be ground of despaire, considering our sinnes bee the sins of men, his mercy the mercy of an infinite GOD.
<pb facs="tcp:2554:15"/>
But though it be a truth clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the Sunne beames, that a broken hearted sinner ought to embrace mercy so strongly enforced: yet there is no truth that the heart shutteth it selfe more against, then this, especially in sense of misery, when the soule is fittest for mercy, untill the Holy spirit sprinkleth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with the blood of Christ, and sheddeth his love into the heart, that so the blood of Christ in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may cry lowder then the guilt of sinne; for onely Gods Spirit can raise the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with comfort above guilt; because he is only grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the conscience. Men
<pb facs="tcp:2554:16"/>
may speake comfort, but it is Christs Spirit that can onely comfort. Peace is the fruit of the lips, but yet created to bee <note place="margin">Es. 57. 19</note> so. No creature can take off wrath from the conscience, but he that set it on, though all the prevailing arguments be used that can bee brought forth, till the Holy Ghost ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perswadeth by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine kinde of rhetoricke, which ought to raise up our hearts to him who is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of his people, that he would seale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our soules. Now God dealing with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as understanding creatures, the manner which he useth in this powerfull worke upon their consciences, is by way of

friendly entercourse, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, and perswasion, and discovery of his love in Christ, and Christs gracious inclination thus even to the <note place="margin">Loquitur Deus ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And therefore because hee is pleased by such like motives to enter into the heart, and settle a peace there, we ought with reverence to regard all such sanctified helpes, and among the rest this of making use of this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble description of Christ by God the Father, in going boldly in all necessities to the throne of grace. But wee must know this comfort is onely the portion of those that give up themselves to Christs
<pb facs="tcp:2554:17"/>
government, that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all things to be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of by him. For here we see in this Scripture both joyned together, mercy to bruised reedes, and yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment prevailing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees over corruptions. Christ so favoureth weake ones, as that he frameth their soules to a better condition then they are in. Neither can it be otherwise, but that a soule looking for mercy should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it selfe at the same time to be guided. Those relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of husband, head, shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, &amp;c. imply not onely meeknesse and mercy, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment likewise. When we become Christ ans to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb facs="tcp:2554:17"/>
we live not exempt from all service, but onely wee change our Lord. Therefore if any in an ill course of life snatch comforts before they are reached out unto them, let them know they doe it at their owne perills. It is as if some ignorant man should come into an Apothecaries shop stored with varietie of medicines of all sorts, &amp; shold take what comes next to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, poyson perhaps in stead of Physicke. There is no word of comfort in the whole booke of God intended for such <hi>as regard iniquity in their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note> 
               <hi>hearts,</hi> though they doe not act it in their lives. Their onely comfort is that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="tcp:2554:18"/>
of damnation is not executed, and thereupon there is yet opportunity of safer thoughts and resolutions, otherwise they stand not onely convicted, but condemned by the Word, and Christ <hi>that rideth on the White horse</hi> will spend all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 2.</note> upon them, and wound them to death. If any shall blesse himselfe in an ill way, Gods wrath shall burne to hell against such. There is no more comfort to bee expected from Christ, then there is care to please him. Otherwise to make him an abetter of a lawlesse and loose life, is to transforme him into a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, nay into the likenesse of
<pb facs="tcp:2554:18"/>
him whose workes hee came to destroy, which is the most detestable Idolatry of all. One way whereby the Spirit of Christ prevaileth in his, is to preserve them from such thoughts; yet wee see people will frame a divinity to themselves, pleasing to the flesh, sutable to their own ends, which being vaine in the substance, will prove like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vaine in the fruit, and as a building upon the sand.</p>
            <p>The maine scope of all, is, to allure us to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs milde, safe, wise, victorious government, and to leave men naked of all pretences, why they will not have Christ to rule over
<pb facs="tcp:2554:19"/>
them, when we see salvation not onely strongly wrought, but sweetly dispensed by him. His government is not for his owne pleasure, but for our good. We are saved by a way of love, that love might be kindled by this way in us to God againe, because this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection melteth the soule, and mouldeth it to all dutie and acceptable manner of performance of dutie. It is love in duties that God regards more then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselves. This is the true and Euangelicall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition arising from Christs love to us, and our love to him againe; and not to feare to come to him as if wee were
<pb facs="tcp:2554:19"/>
to take an Elephant by the tooth. It is almost a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mistake, to think that God delights in slavish feares, when as the fruits of Christs Kingdome are peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, for from this mistake come weake, slavish, superstitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
            <p>Two things trouble the peace of Christians verie much, their weaknesses han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">1. 2.</note> upon them, and feare of holding out for time to come. A remedy against both is in this Text, for Christ is set out here as a milde Saviour to weake ones; and for time to come, his powerfull care and love is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:2554:20"/>
interrupted, untill hee bring forth judgement to victory. And thereupon it is that both the meanes of salvation and grace wrought by meanes, and glory the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of grace, come all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one name of the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME of GOD so oft; because whom by meanes he brings to grace, he will by grace bring to glory.</p>
            <p>This maketh the thoughts of the latter Iudgement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto us, that he who is then to be our Iudge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but judge for them who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

but as firme as our state in Christ is secure and glorious, what manner of men should we be?</p>
            <p>If I had gone about to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect writing in a high straine, I should have missed of mine end, and crossed the argument in hand. For shall we that are servants quench those weake sparkes which our Lord himselfe is pleased to cherish?

               <hi>servant, &amp;c.</hi> CHRIST was GODS servant in the greatest piece of service that ever was; a chosen, and a choice servant: hee did and suffered all by commission from the Father: Wherein we may see the sweet love of GOD to us, that counts the work of our salvation by Christ his greatest service. And that he will put his onely beloved Son to that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He might well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe <hi>[Behold]</hi> to raise up our thoughts to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pitch of attention and admiration. In time of temptation, misgiving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2554:28"/>
consciences looke so much to the present trouble they are in, that they need bee rouzed up to behold him in whom they may finde rest for their distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed soules: In temptations it is safest to behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but CHRIST, the true <hi>brazen Serpent, the true Lambe of God that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinnes of the World:</hi> this saving object hath a speciall influence of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort into the soule, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we looke not onely on CHRIST, but upon the Fathers authority and love in him. For in all that CHRIST did and suffered as Mediator, wee must see
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2554:28"/>
GOD <hi>in him reconciling the World unto himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a support to our Faith is this; That GOD the Father, the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by our sinnes, is so <hi>well pleased</hi> with the worke of Redemption? And what a comfort is this, that seeing GODS love resteth on CHRIST, as well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in him; we may gather that hee is as well pleased with us, if we be in Christ. For his love resteth in whole CHRIST, in <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall, as well as <hi>Christ</hi> naturall, because hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him and us with one love. Let us therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace CHRIST, and in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2554:29"/>
him GODS love, and build our faith safely on such a Saviour, that is furnished with so high a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>See here (for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) a sweet agreement of all three persons: The Father giveth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission to <hi>Christ:</hi> The Spirit fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth, and sanctifieth to it: CHRIST himselfe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth the office of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. Our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is founded upon the joynt agreement of all three persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>

            <p>First, the condition of those that CHRIST had to deale withall. 1, They
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2554:30"/>
were <hi>bruised Reedes.</hi> 2, <hi>smoaking Flax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, CHRISTS <note place="margin">2.</note> carriage towards them he <hi>brake not</hi> the bruised Reed, nor <hi>quenched</hi> the smoaking Flax: where more is meant, them spoken; sor hee will not onely not breake the bruised Reed, nor quench &amp;c.

            <p>Thirdly, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie and progresse of <note place="margin">3.</note> this his tender care, <hi>untill Iudgement come to victory,</hi> that is, untill the sanctified frame of grace begunne in their hearts, be brought to that perfection, that it prevaileth over all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site

corruption. For the first, the condition of <note place="margin">1.</note> men, whom hee was to deale withall, is that <note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Christ had to deale with.</note> they were bruised Reeds, and smoaking Flax, not Trees, but Reeds; and not whole but bruised Reeds. The Church is compared to weake things; to a <hi>Dove</hi> amongst the fowles; to a <hi>Vine</hi> amongst the Plants; to <note place="margin">The Church likened to weake things.</note> 
               <hi>Sheepe</hi> amongst the beasts; to a <hi>Woman,</hi> which is the <hi>weaker vessell:</hi> and here GODS Children are compared to <hi>bruised Reeds,</hi> and <hi>smoaking Flax.</hi> And first we will speake of them as they are brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2554:31"/>
Reeds, and then as smoaking flax. They are bruised reeds before their conversion, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times after: Before Conversion all (except such as being bred up in the Church, GOD hath delighted to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe gracious vnto from their Child-hood) yet in different degrees, as GOD seeth meete; and as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in regard of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, parts, manner of life, &amp;c. so GODS intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of imployment for the time to come: for usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hee empties such of themselves, and makes them nothing, before hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2554:31"/>
will use them in any great services.</p>
            <p>This bruised reed is a <note place="margin">Bruised Reed wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:2554:32"/>
though hee dareth not claime any present inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of mercy. This sparke of hope being opposed by doubtings, and feares rising from Corruption, maketh him, as smoaking flax, so that both these together, A bruised reed and smoaking flax, make up the state of a poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed man, such an one, our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Poore in spirit,</hi> Math. 5. who seeth a want, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all seeth himselfe indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divine Iustice, &amp; no meanes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy is stirred up to hunger, &amp; thirst after it.</p>
            <p>This bruising is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before conuersion, <note place="margin">1. Why brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, 1. Before conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that so the spirit may make way for it selfe into the heart, by <hi>levelling all proud high thoughts,</hi> and that wee may understand our selves to be, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are by nature: we love to wander from our selves, and to be strangers at home, till GOD brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us by one Crosse, or other, and then wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke our selves, and come home to our selves with the Prodigall.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2554:33"/>
A marvellous hard thing it is, to bring a dull, and a shifting heart to cry with feeling for mercy. Our hearts (like malefactors) untill they be beaten from all shifts, never cry for the mercy of the Iudge. Againe, this bruising ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us set a high price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2.</note> CHRIST, the Gospell is the Gospell indeed then, then the fig-leaves of morality will doe us no good: and it maketh us more thankefull, and from <note place="margin">3.</note> thankefulnesse more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in our lives; For what maketh many so cold, and <note place="margin">4.</note> barren, but that bruising for sinne never indeered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2554:33"/>
Gods Grace unto them. Likewise this dealing of <note place="margin">5.</note> God doth establish us the more in his wayes, having had knockes and bruisings in our owne wayes. This is the cause oft, of relapses, &amp; apostasies, because men never smarted for sinne at the first, they were not long enough under the lash of the Law. Hence this inferiour work of the Spirit, in <hi>bringing downe high thoughts,</hi> is necessary before conversion. And for the most part, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit to further the worke of conviction, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth some afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which sanctified, hath a healing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2554:34"/>
purging power.</p>
            <p>Nay, after Conversion <note place="margin">2. After conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> wee neede bruising, that reedes may know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">1.</note> to be reedes, &amp; not Oakes; Even Reedes need bruising by reason of the remainder of pride in our nature, and to let us see, that we live by mercy, and that weaker Christians <note place="margin">2.</note> may not be too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, when they see stronger shaken and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> was brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, when he <hi>wept bitterly;</hi> This Reed, til he met with this bruise, had more wind in him, then pith. <hi>Though all forsake thee, I will not,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat 26.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:2554:34"/>
The people of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. The Heroicall deeds of those great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies comfort the Church not so much, as their falls and bruises doe.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> was brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, until he came to a free <note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> confession without <hi>guile</hi> of spirit: nay, his sorrowes did rise in his owne fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, unto the exquisite paine of <hi>breaking of bones,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> 
               <hi>Psalm.</hi> 51. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isai. 38. 13.</note> complaines, that God had <hi>broken his bones as a Lion.</hi> Thus the Chosen vessell S. <hi>Paul</hi> needed the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> of Satan to buffet him, lest hee should bee lifted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2554:35"/>
up above measure.</p>
            <p>Hence wee learne, that wee must not passe too harsh judgment upon our selves, or others, when God doth exercise us with bruising upon bruising; There must bee a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to our head Christ, who was bruised for us; <note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> that wee may know how much wee are bound unto him. Profane spirits igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Gods wayes in bringing his children to Heaven, censure broken hearted Christians for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate persons, when as GOD is about a gratious good worke with them. It is no easie matter to bring
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2554:35"/>
a man from Nature to Grace, and from Grace to Glory; so unyeelding, and untractable are our hearts.</p>
            <p>The second point is, <note place="margin">2, Point.</note> 
               <hi>That Christ will not breake the bruised Reed;</hi> Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, though they put their Patients to much paine, yet they will not destroy nature, but raise it up by degrees; Surgeons will launce and cut, but not dismember; A mother that hath a sicke, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Child, will not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cast it away; and shall there bee more mercy in the streame, then in the spring? shall wee thinke
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2554:36"/>
there is more mercy in our selves, then in GOD, who planteth the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mercy in us? But for further declaration of Christs mercy to all brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Reedes: Consider the comfortable relations hee hath taken upon him of <hi>Husband, Shepherd, Brother,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> &amp;c. which hee will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge to the utmost; for shall others by his grace fulfill what hee calleth them unto, and not he that out of his love hath taken upon him these relations, so throughly founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fathers assignement, and his owne voluntary undertaking? Consider
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2554:36"/>
his borrowed Names from the mildest Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as <hi>Lambe, Henne,</hi> &amp;c. to shew his tender care: Consider his very name <hi>Iesus,</hi> a <hi>Saviour,</hi> give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him by GOD himselfe: Consider his Office, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his name; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is that he should <hi>heale the broken hearted,</hi> Esay. 61. 1.

will make up in us all the breaches sinne and Satan have made, hee <hi>bindes up the broaken hearted,</hi> and as a mother tendreth most the most diseased, and weakest childe; so doth CHRIST most mercifully incline to the weakest: and likewise putteth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct into the weakest things to rely upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing stronger than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for support. The Vine stayeth it selfe upon the Elme: and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est creatures have oft the strongest shelters. The consciousnesse of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches weaknesse makes her willing to leane on her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2554:41"/>
beloved, and to hide her selfe under his wing.</p>
            <p>But how shall we know <note place="margin">Object.</note> whether wee are such as those that may expect mercy?</p>
            <p>By bruising here is not <note place="margin">Answ.</note> meant those that are brought low onely by crosles, but such as by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are brought to see their sinne, which bruiseth most of all. When conscience is under the guilt of sinne, then every judgement brings a report of GODS anger to the soule, and all lesser troubles runne into this great trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for sinne: As all corrupt humours runne to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2554:41"/>
the diseased, and bruised part of the body: And as every Creditor falls upon the Debtor, when hee is once arrested; so when conscience is once awaked all former sinnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent crosses joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make the bruise the more painfull: Now he that is thus bruised will be content with nothing, but w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> mercy fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that hath bruised him, <hi>he hath wounded, and he must heale.</hi> 2. Againe, a man truly bruised, judgeth sinne the greatest evill, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God the greatest good. 3. Hee had rather heare of mercy, than of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2554:42"/>
kingdome. 4. Hee hath meane conceits of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and thinketh hee is not worth the earth hee treads on. 5. Towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he is not censorious, as being taken up at home, but is full of sympathy and compassion to those that are under GODS hand, 6. He thinketh those that walke in the comforts of GODS Spirit the happiest men of the world. 7. He <hi>trembleth at the word of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isa. 66.</note> 
               <hi>God,</hi> and honoureth the very <hi>feet of those</hi> blessed <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> instruments <hi>that bring peace</hi> unto him. 8. Hee is more taken up with the inward exercises of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2554:42"/>
heart, than with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and yet carefull to use all sanctifyed meanes to convey comfort.</p>
            <p>But how shall we come to have this temper? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, we must conceive of bruising either as a state <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Meanes of bruising.</note> into which God bringeth us, or as a duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us: both are here meant, we must joyn with GOD in bruising of our selves; when hee humbles us let us humble our selves, and not stand out against him, for then hee will redouble his strokes; and let us justifie CHRIST in all his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, knowing that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2554:43"/>
all his dealing towards us is to cause us to returne into our owne hearts; his work in bruising, tendeth to our worke in bruising our selves. Let us lament our owne untowardnesse, and say, Lord, what an heart have I, that needs all this, that none of this could bee spared? Wee must lay siege to the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our owne hearts, and aggravate sinne all we can: wee must looke on CHRIST, who was brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for us, looke on him whom wee have pierced with our sinnes. But all directions will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, unlesse GOD by his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2554:43"/>
Spirit convinceth us deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, setting our sinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and driving us to a stand. Then we wil make out for mercy. Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will breed contrition, and this humiliation. Therefore desire GOD, that hee would bring a cleere and a strong light into all the corners of our soules, and accompany it with a spirit of power to lay our hearts low.</p>
            <p>A set measure of brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selves, cannot be prescribed, yet it must be so farre, as we may prize CHRIST above all, and see that a Saviour must be had: And secondly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2554:44"/>
we reform that which is amisse, though it be to the cutting off our right hand, or pulling out our right eye. There is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous slighting of the worke of humiliation; some alledging this for a pretence for their overly dealing with their owne hearts, that CHRIST will not breake the bruised Reed; But such must know that every sudden terrour and short griefe is not that which makes us brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Reeds; not a little hanging downe our heads <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 5.</note> like a Bulrush, but a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts to such a griefe, as will make sinne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2554:44"/>
more odious unto us, than punishment. Vntill we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an holy violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: else favouring our selves, we make work for GOD to bruise us, and for sharpe repentance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. It is dangerous (I confesse) in some cases with some spirits, to press too much, and too long this bruising; because they may die under the wound and burthen, before they be raised up againe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good in mixt as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies to mingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that every soule may have its due portion. But if wee lay this for a ground, that there is more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2554:45"/>
mercy in CHRIST, than sinne in us, there can be no danger in through dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It is better to goe bruised to heaven, than sound to Hell. Therefore let us not take off our selves too soone, nor pull off the plaister, before the cure be wrought, but keep our selves under this work till sinne bee the sowrest, and CHRIST the sweetest of all things. And when GODS hand is upon us in any kinde, it is good to divert our sorrow, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, to the root of all, which is sin: let our griefe runne most in that channell, that as sin bred
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2554:45"/>
griefe, so griefe may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume sinne.</p>
            <p>But are we not bruised <note place="margin">Quest.</note> unlesse wee grieve more for sinne, than we doe for punishment?</p>
            <p>Sometimes our griefe, <note place="margin">Answ.</note> from outward grievances may lye heavier upon the soule, than griefe for Gods displeasure; because in such cases the griefe workes upon the whole man, both outward and inward, and hath nothing to stay it, but a little sparke of faith: which by reason of the violent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the grievance is suspended in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of it: and this is most
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2554:46"/>
felt in sudden distresses which come upon the soule as a torrent or land flood, and especially in bodily distempers, which by reason of the sympathy betweene the soule and the body, worke upon the soule so farre, as they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not onely the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but often the naturall acts. Hereupon S. <hi>Iames</hi> wisheth in affliction to pray, our selves, but in case of sicknesse to <hi>send for the Elders;</hi> that may, as <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 14.</note> those in the Gospell, offer up the sick person to GOD in their prayers, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to present their owne case. Hereupon GOD ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth

of such a plea fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sharpnesse and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the grievance, as in <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 6. &amp;c. the <note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note> Lord knoweth whereof we are made. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. he <note place="margin">Ps. 103. 14.</note> remembreth wee are but dust, that our strength is not the strength of steele.

GOD will not quench the smoaking flax, or wieke, but will blow it up till it flameth. In smoaking flax there is but a little light, &amp; that weake, as being not able to flame, and this little mixed with smoake. The observations hence are first, That in GODS Children, especially in their first conversio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is but a little measure of grace, and that little mixt with much corruption, which as smoake is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. Secondly, that <hi>Christ</hi> will not quench this smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Flax.</p>
            <p>For the first. <hi>Grace is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Observ.</note> 
               <hi>little at the first.</hi> There are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2554:49"/>
severall Ages in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, some Babes, some young men: Grace is as <hi>a graine of Mustard-seed.</hi> Nothing so little as grace at first, and nothing more glorious afterward: things of greatest perfection are longest in comming to their growth. Man, the perfectest creature, comes to perfection by little and little; Worthlesse things, as Mushromes, and the like, like <hi>Ionas Gourd,</hi> soon spring up, and soone va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. A new creature is the most excellent frame in all the world, therefore it groweth up by degrees. Wosee in Nature, that a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2554:50"/>
mighty Oake riseth of an Akorne. It is with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian as it was with Christ, who sprang out of the dead stocke of <hi>Iesse,</hi> out of <hi>Davids</hi> family, when it <note place="margin">Jsa. 53. 2.</note> was at the lowest, but hee grew up higher than the heavens. It is not with the trees of righteousnesse, as it was with the trees of Paradise, which were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all perfect at the first. The seeds of all the creatures in this goodly frame of the world, were hid in the Chaos, in that confused Mass at the first, out of which GOD did command all creatures to arise; in the small seeds of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2554:50"/>
plants lye hid both bulke and branches, bud and fruit. In a few principles lye hid all comfortable conclusions of holy truth. All those glorious fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes of zeale and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Saints, had their beginning from a few sparkes.</p>
            <p>Let us not therefore be discouraged at the small beginnings of Grace, but looke on our selves, as <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to bee blamelesse; and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.</note> 
               <hi>without spot.</hi> Let us onely look on our imperfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to inforce further strife to perfection, and to keepe us in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Otherwise, in case of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2554:51"/>
discouragement, we must consider our selves, as CHRIST doth, who looks on us, as such as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to fit for himselfe. CHRIST valueth us by what we shall bee, and by that we are elected unto. Wee call a little Plant a Tree, because it is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to be so. <hi>Who is hee that despiseth the day of little things? Zach.</hi> 4. CHRIST would not have us despise little things.</p>
            <p>The glorious Angells disdaine not attendance on little ones: little in their owne eyes, and little in the eyes of the world. Grace, though little in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2554:51"/>
quantity, yet is much in vigour and worth.</p>
            <p>It is CHRIST that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the worth of little and meane places and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>Bethlem the least,</hi> and yet not the least; the least in it selfe, not the least in respect CHRIST was born there. The <hi>second Temple</hi> came short of the outward magnificence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: yet more glorious than the first, because CHRIST came into it. The Lord of the Temple came in to his owne Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The pupill of the eye is very little, yet seeth a great part of the heaven at once. A pearle, though
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2554:52"/>
little, yet is of much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme. Nothing in the world of so good use, as the least dram of graces.</p>

            <p>The ground of this mixture is, that we carie about us a double prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, Grace and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The end of it is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

            <p>Our spirituall fire, is like our ordinary fire here below (mixt.)

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2554:54"/>
different judgements of themselves, looking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time at the work of grace, sometimes at the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of corruption; and when they look upon that, then they think they have no grace: though they love CHRIST in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and children; yet dare not challenge so neer acquaintance as to be his.

            </p>

way, and breed them up in positive grounds, and other things wil be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of credit with them. It is not amisse to conceale their wants, to excuse some failings, to commend their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, to cherish their towardnesse, to remove all rubs out of their way, to helpe them every way to beare the yoake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with greater ease, to bring them in love with God and his service, lest they distaste it before they know it. For the most part we see CHRIST planteth in young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners a love, which we call
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2554:59"/>
               <hi>the first love,</hi> to cary them through their profession with more delight, and doth not expose them to crosses, before they have gathered strength, as wee breed up young plants, and fence them from the weather, untill they bee well rooted. Mercy to others should move us to deny our selves in our lawfull liberties often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in case of offence of weake ones, it is the <hi>little ones that are offended.</hi> The weakest are aptest to think themselves despised, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee should bee most carefull to give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:2554:59"/>
It were a good strife amongst Christians, one to labour to give no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the other to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to take none. The best men are severe to themselves, tender over others.</p>
            <p>Yet people should not tyre and weare out the patience of others: Nor should the weaker so farre exact moderation from others, as to beare out themselves upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, and so to rest in their owne infirmities, with danger to their own soules, and scandall to the Church. The Church suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth much from weake

ones, therefore wee may challenge liberty to deale with them, as mildly, so oftentimes directly. The scope of true love, is to make the party better, which by concealment of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes is hindred: with some a spirit of meeknesse prevaileth most, but with some a rod. Some must be <hi>pulled out of the fire</hi> with violence, and they will <hi>blesse God for us in the day of their visitation.</hi> Wee see our Saviour multiplyes <note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> woe upon woe, when hee was to deale with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Hypocrites; For Hypocrites doe neede stronger conviction than
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2554:60"/>
grosse sinners, because their will is naught, and thereupon usually their conversion is violent. An hard knot must have an answerable wedge, else in a cruell pity wee betray their soules. A sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe sometimes is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearle, and <hi>a sweet balme.</hi> The wounds of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sinners will not bee healed with sweet words. The Holy Ghost came as well in <hi>fiery tongues,</hi> as in the likenesse of a <hi>Dove,</hi> and the same holy Spirit will vouchsafe a spirit of prudence and discretion, (which is the salt to season all our words and actions)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2554:61"/>
And such wisedome will teach us <hi>to speake a word in season</hi> both to the weary and likewise to the secure soule. And indeed he had need have <hi>the tongue of the learned</hi> that shall either raise up, or cast downe: But in this place I speake of mildness towards those that are weake, and are sensible of it: These wee must bring on gently, and <hi>drive softly,</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> did his <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 14.</note> Cattell, according to the pace, and as his children were able to endure.</p>
            <p>Weake Christians are like glasses which are hurt with the least violent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, otherwise if gently
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2554:61"/>
handled will continue a long time. <hi>This honour</hi> of gentle use we are to <hi>give to the weaker vessells,</hi> by which we shall both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, and likewise make them usefull to the Church and our selves.</p>
            <p>In uncleane bodies if all ill humours be purged out, you shall purge life and all away. Therefore though GOD saith, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 9. that <hi>he will fine them as silver is fined.</hi> Yet <hi>Esay</hi> 48. 10. he saith, <hi>He hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, but not as silver,</hi> that is, so exactly as that no drosse remaineth, for hee hath respect to our weaknesse. Perfect refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

is for another world, for the world of the <hi>soules of perfect men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divines had need to <note place="margin">Vse for Ministers.</note> take heed therefore how they deale with these in divers particulars: as first, let them be carefull they straine not things too hie, making those generall and necessary evidences of grace which agree not to the experience of many a good Christian, and lay salvation and damnation upon those things that are not fit to beare so great a waight, whereupon men are groundlesly cast down lower by them, than they can hastily be raised up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2554:62"/>
by themselves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Ambassadors of so gentle a Saviour should not bee over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly, setting up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the hearts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where CHRIST alone should sit as in his owne Temple. How carefull was Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in cases of conscience not to lay a snare upon any weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science!</p>
            <p>They should take heed likewise that they hide not <note place="margin">2 Darke speches.</note> their meaning in darke speeches, speaking in the clouds. Truth feareth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and desireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as cleerely
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2554:63"/>
to bee laid open to the view of all: When it is most naked, it is most lovely and powerfull.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Saviour as he tooke our nature upon him, so he took upon him our familiar manner of speech, which was part of his voluntary abasement. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a profound man, yet became as <hi>a nurse</hi> to the weaker sort. <note place="margin">1 Thes. 2. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That spirit of mercy that was in CHRIST should move his servants to bee content to abase themselves for the good of the meanest. What made the <hi>Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven suffer violence</hi> after

And here likewise there <note place="margin">A caveat.</note> needs a caveat. Mercy doth not rob us of our right judgement, as that we should take smoaking firebrands for smoaking flax: none will claime mercy more of others, than those whose portion is due severity. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance lukewarmnesse, nor too much indulgence to those that need quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Cold diseases must have hot remedies. It made for the just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Church of <hi>Ephesus, that it could not beare them which are evill.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 2.</note> We should so beare with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2554:68"/>
others, as wee discover withall a dislike of evill. Our Saviour CHRIST would not forbeare sharp reproofe, where hee saw dangerous infirmities, in his most beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. It bringeth under a curse <hi>to doe the worke of the Lord negligently:</hi> Even where it is a worke of just severity: As when it is sheathing the sword in the bowels of the enemy. And those whom we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be betraid by their worst enemies their sinnes wil have just cause to curse us another day.</p>
            <p>It is hard to preserve just bounds of mercy and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2554:69"/>
severity, without a spirit above our owne: which we ought to desire to bee led withall, in all things. That <hi>wisedome which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with prudence</hi> will <note place="margin">Pro. 8. 12.</note> guide us in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, without which virtue is not virtue, truth not truth: the rule and the case must bee laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for if there be not a narrow insight, seeming likenesse in conditions wil be the breeder of errours in our opinions of them. Those fiery, tempestuous, and dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ctive spirits in Popery, that seeke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Religion by cruelty, shew that they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2554:69"/>
are strangers to that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which maketh men gentle, peaceable, and ready to shew that mercy they have felt before, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. It is a way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, as agreeable to CHRIST, so likewise to mans nature, to prevaile by some forbearance and moderation.</p>
            <p>And yet oft wee see a false spirit in those that call for moderation, it is but to carry their owne projects with the greater strength; and if they prove of the prevailing hand, they will hardly shew that moderation to others,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2554:70"/>
they now call for from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And there is a proud kind of moderation like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when men will take upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to censure either party, as if they were wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than both, though if the spirit be right, a looker on may see more than those that are in conflict.</p>
            <p>So in the censures of the Church, it is more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">2. For the Church in censures.</note> to the Spirit of CHRIST to incline to the milder part; and not to <note place="margin">

purity of those censures, whereby the light of the Church is kept bright. That power that is given to the Church, is given for edification, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2554:71"/>
from GOD. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is a beam of Gods Majesty, and prevaileth most where there is least mixture of that which is mans. It requireth more than ordinary wisedome to manage it aright. This string must not bee too much strained up, nor too much let loose. Iustice is an harmonicall thing. Herbs hot or cold beyond a certaine degree kill. We see even contrary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments preserved in one body by a wise contempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Iustice in rigour is oft extreame injustice, where some considerable circumstances should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2554:71"/>
to moderation, and the reckoning wil be easier for bending rather to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration than rigor.</p>
            <p>Insolent cariage toward miserable persons, if hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, is unseemly in any who look for mercy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Misery should bee a Loadstone of mercy, not a footstoole for Pride to trample on.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it falleth out that those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are most injurious by way wardnesse and harsh censures, herein dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and discouraging the endeavours of Superiours for publike good.

Here, Love should have a mantle to cast upon lesser errors of those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us. Oft-times the poore man is the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor by unjust clamours: we should labour to give the best interpretations to the actions of Governours, that the nature of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will possibly beare.</p>

In the last place, there is some thing for private <note place="margin">4.

            <p n="3">3 Amongst the things <note place="margin">Censuring and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that are to be taken heede of, there is amongst pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians a bold u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation of censure, not considering their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:2554:74"/>
There is therefore in these iudging times good ground of <hi>S.

            <p>A holy ayme in things of a middle nature, makes the judgements of men, although seemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, yet not so much blameable. Christ, for the good aymes hee seeth in us, over-looketh any ill in

            <p>Men must not bee too <note place="margin">2. <hi>For weaknesses</hi> Nemo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osus qui non malevolus.</note> curious in prying into the weaknesses of others; we should labor rather to see what they have that is <hi>for eternitie,</hi> to incline our heart to love them, then into that weaknesse which the Spirit of GOD will <hi>in time</hi> consume, to estrange us: some thinke it strength of grace to endure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the weaker, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the strongest are readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to beare with the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the weake, Where most holinesse is, there is most moderation, where it may be without
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2554:75"/>
prejudice of pietie to God and the good of others, wee see in Christ a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous temper of absolute holinesse, with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this Text. What had become of our Salvation if he had stood upon termes and not stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thus low, unto us! We need not affect to be more holy then <hi>Christ,</hi> it is no flatterie to doe as he doth, so it bee to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghost is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to dwell in smoakie offensive soules, Oh that, that spirit would breath into our Spirits the like mercifull disposition? We

indure the bitternesse of Wormwood, and other distastfull plants, &amp; herbs, onely because wee have some experience of some wholsome qualitie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and why should we reject men of usefull parts, and graces, onely for some harshnesse of disposition, which as it is offensive to us, so grieveth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>Grace whilest wee live here is in soules, which as they are unperfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, so they dwell in bodies subject to severall humours, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the soule sometimes to excesse in one passion,

               <hi>Bucer</hi> was a deepe, and a moderate Divine. Vpon long experience resolved to refuse none, in whom hee saw <hi>(aliquid Christi)</hi> something of Christ.</p>
            <p>The best Christians in this state of imperfection, are like Gold that is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too light, which needs some graines of allowance to make it passe.

this is of Nature, this of Grace. All is not ill in a bad action, or good in a good action. There is gold in oare, which God and his Spirit in us can distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish. A carnall mans hart is like a dungeon, wherein is nothing to be seene but horrour and confusion: this light maketh us judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and humble, upon clearer sight of Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and our owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes: and maketh us able to discerne of the worke of the Spirit in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, so farre as a man is spirituall, so far is light <note place="margin">5</note> delightfull unto him, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2554:88"/>
willing to see any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, that he may reform, and any further service discovered that hee may performe: because he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hateth ill and loveth good: if hee goeth against light discovered, hee will soone bee reclaimed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause light hath a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly party within him. Whereupon, at a little sight of his errour, hee is soone counsellable, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his intendment to kill <hi>Nabal,</hi> and <hi>blesseth God</hi> afterwards when hee is stopped in an ill way.</p>
            <p>In a carnal man the light breakes in upon him, but he labours to shut the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2554:88"/>
hee hath no delight to <hi>

                  </gap>ome to the light.</hi> It is impossible before the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace hath subdued the hart, but that it should sin against the light, either by resisting of it, or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it prisoner under base lusts, burying it as it were in the earth; or perverting of it, and so making it an agent and factour for the flesh, in searching out ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to plead for it, or abusing that little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of light they have, to keep out a greater, higher, and more heavenly light, and so at length make that light they have, a mislea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding guide to utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2554:89"/>
And the reason is that it hath no friend within, the soule is in a contrary frame, and light alwayes hindreth that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full peace that men are willing to speake to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whence we see it oft inrage men the more: as the Sunne in the Spring breedeth agui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

check. Spirituall light is distinct, it seeth spirituall good, with application to our selves; but common light is confused, and lets sin lye quiet. Where fire is in any degree, it will fight against the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>: GOD hath put irreconciliable hatred betweene <hi>light</hi> and <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> at first, so betweene good and ill, <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Grace will never joyne with sinne, no more than fire with water. Fire will mingle with no contrary, but preserveth its owne purity, and is never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted as other Elements are. Therefore those that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2554:90"/>
plead and plot for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the flesh, shew themselves strangers from the life of God. Vpon this strife gracious men oft co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that they have no grace, but they contradict themselves in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: as if a man that seeth, should complaine he cannot see, or complain that he is asleepe, when the very complaint sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from a displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, sheweth that there is something in him opposite to sinne. Can a dead man complaine? Some things, though bad in themselves, yet disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good; as smoake dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2554:90"/>
some fire. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in the body shews strength of Nature. Some infirmities discover more good than some seeming beautifull actions; excesse of passion in opposing evil, (though not to bee justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet sheweth a better spirit, than a calme tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when there is just cause of being moved. Better it is, that the water should runne something muddily, than not at all. <hi>Iob</hi> had more grace in his distempers, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his friends in their seeming wise ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Actions soiled with some weaknesses, are more accepted than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall

performances.</p>
            <p>Fire, where it is <note place="margin">6.</note> in the least measure, is in some degree active; so the least measure of grace is working, as springing from the Spirit of GOD, which from the working nature of it, is compared to fire. Nay, in sinnes, when there seemeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing active, but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet there is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie principle, which breaks the force of sinne, so that it is not <hi>out of measure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> as in those that are carnall.</p>
            <p>Fire maketh metalls <note place="margin">7.</note> pliable and malliable, so doth Grace, where
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2554:91"/>
it is begunne, it worketh the heart to bee plyable and ready for all good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. Vntractable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits shew that they are not so much as smoaking flax.</p>
            <p>Fire turneth all, as <note place="margin">8.</note> much as it can, to fire; so grace maketh a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious use even of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and civill things, &amp; doth spiritualize them, what another man doth onely civilly, a gracious man will doe holily.</p>
            <p>Sparkes by nature <note place="margin">9.</note> flye. upwards: so the spirit of Grace carrieth the soule Heaven-ward, and setteth before us holy and heavenly aimes, as it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2554:92"/>
was kindled from heaven, so it caries us back to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The part followeth the whole: Fire mounteth upward, so every spark to its owne element. Where the aime and bent of the soule is God-wards, there is grace though opposed. The least measure of it is holy desires springing <note place="margin">Desires.</note> from faith and love, for we cannot desire any thing which we doe not beleeve first to be, and the desire of it issues from love. Hence desires are counted a part of the thing desired in some measure, but then they must bee, First, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for constancy shews
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2554:92"/>
that they are supernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall, and not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: Secondly, they must bee caried to spirituall things, as to beleeve, to love GOD, &amp;c. not out of a speciall exigent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if now they had grace, they thinke they might escape some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but as a loving heart is caried to the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for some-excellency in it selfe: And thirdly, with desire there is griefe when it is hindred, which stirres up to prayer: <hi>Oh that my wayes were so direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>

            <p>Fire worketh it selfe (if it hath any matter to feed on) into a larger compass, and mounteth higher and higher, and the higher it riseth, the purer is the flame: So where true grace is, it groweth in measure and purity.

            <p>Some thinke, when <note place="margin">4.</note> they beginne once to bee troubled with the smoake of corruption more than
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2554:96"/>
they were before, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are worse than they were. It is true, that corruptions appeare now more than before, but they are lesse. For first, <note place="margin">1.</note> sinne the more it is seene, the more it is hated, and thereupon is the lesse. Moats are in a roome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun shines, but they then onely appeare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Contraries, <note place="margin">2.</note> the nearer they are one to another, the sharper is the conflict betwixt them: now of all enemies the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the flesh are nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest one to another, being both in the soule of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, and in all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2554:97"/>
faculties of the soule, and in every action that sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth from those faculties, and therefore it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the soule (the seat of this battell) thus divided in it selfe, be as smoaking Flax.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the more grace, the more spirituall life, <note place="margin">3.</note> and the more spirituall life, the more antipathy to the contrary, whence none are so sensible of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as those that have the most living soules.</p>
            <p>And fourthly, when <note place="margin">4.</note> men give themselves to carnall liberties, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, as not being bounded and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2554:97"/>
tyed up. But when once grace suppresseth their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and licentious excesses, then the flesh boyleth, (as disdaining to be confined) yet they are better now than they were before. That matter which yeelds smoake, was in the Torch before it was ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but it is not offensive till the Torch beginnes to burne. Let such know, that if the smoake bee once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to them, it is a signe that there is light. It is better to injoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of light, though with smoake, than to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the darke.</p>
            <p>Neither is smoake so
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2554:98"/>
offensive, as light is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us, it yeelding an evidence of truth of grace in the heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though it be comber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in the conflict, yet it is comfortable in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. It is better, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption should offend us now, than by giving way to it to redeeme a little peace with losse of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort afterwards. Let such therefore as are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and oddes with their corruptions, looke upon this Text, as their portion of comfort.</p>
            <p>Here is an use of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement <note place="margin">Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to duty, That CHRIST will not quench
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2554:98"/>
the smoaking flax, but blow it up. Some are loath to performe good duties, because they feele their hearts rebelling, and duties come off unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. Wee should not avoid good actions for the infirmities cleaving unto them: CHRIST looketh more at the good in them that hee meaneth to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, than the ill in them that he meaneth to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. A sicke man though in eating he something in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the disease, yet he will eate, that nature may get strength against the disease: So though sin cleaveth to what we doe,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2554:99"/>
yet let us doe it, since wee have to deal with so good a Lord, and the more strife we meet withall, the more acceptance: <hi>Christ</hi> loveth to tast of the good fruits that come from us, although they will alwaies rellish of the old stock.</p>
            <p>A Christian complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hee cannot pray; O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> am troubled with so many distracting thoughts, and never more than now. But hath he put into thine heart a desire to pray? he will heare the desires of his; owne Spirit in thee. Rom. 8. 26. <hi>Wee know not what to pray as we ought,</hi> (nor doe any thing else as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2554:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wee ought) <hi>but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, with unexpressible sighes and grones,</hi> which are not hid from GOD. <hi>My groanings</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 38. 9.</note> 
               <hi>are not hid from thee;</hi> GOD can picke sense out of a confused prayer. These desires cry louder in his eares, than thy sinnes. Sometimes a Christian hath such confused thoughts, hee can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but as a childe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, O Father, not able to shew what it needs, as <hi>Moses</hi> at the <hi>Red sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These stirrings of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit touch the bowels of GOD, and melt him into compassion towards us,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2554:100"/>
when they come from the spirit of adoption, and from a striving to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Oh but is it possible <note place="margin">Object.</note> (thinketh the misgiving heart) that so holy a GOD shold accept such a praier? Yes, hee will accept that <note place="margin">Answ.</note> which is his owne, and pardon that which is ours. <hi>Ionas prayed in the Whales belly,</hi> being burdened with the guilt of sin, yet GOD heareth him: Let not therefore infirmities dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> taketh away this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Cap. 5. 17.</p>
            <p>Some might object, If I were as holy as <hi>Elias,</hi> then my prayers might be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2554:100"/>
regarded: But (saith he) <hi>Elias was a man of like pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to us,</hi> he had his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as we; For doe we think that GOD heard him because he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault? No surely. But looke we to the promises. Psal. 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will heare thee.</hi> Matt. 7. 7. <hi>Aske and ye shall receive,</hi> and such like: GOD accepteth our prayers though weake, first, because wee are his <note place="margin">Why first God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth of weake Prayers. 2.</note> owne children, they come from his owne Spirit.

mediation, and hee takes them, and <hi>mingleth them with</hi> his own <hi>odours.</hi> There <note place="margin">Revel. 8.</note> is never a holy sigh, never a teare we shed, lost. And as every Grace increaseth by exercise of it selfe, so doth the grace of prayer; by prayer wee learne to pray. So likewise wee should take heed of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of discouragement in all other holy duties, since we have so gracious a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

               <hi>the marke.</hi> Let us not bee cruell to our selves, when CHRIST, is thus gracious.</p>
            <p>There is a certain meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit, whereby <note place="margin">The effect of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation.</note> we yeeld thankes, to God for any ability at all, and rest quiet with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Grace received, seeing it is GODS good pleasure it should bee so, who giveth the <hi>will and the deed;</hi> yet so, as we rest not from further endeavours. But, when upon faithfull endeavor we come short

Since thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee into thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be thine of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wilt thou cast me off for these infirmities, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> as they displease thee, so are they the griefe of my owne heart?</p>
            <p>Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what hath bin spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (with some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> little additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) it wil not be difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that case which some <note place="margin">A case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to duty.</note> require helpe in, namely, whether we ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme duties, our hearts being altogether indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For satisfaction, we must know, I, our hearts of themselves doe linger after liberty, &amp; are hardly brought under the yoake
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2554:103"/>
of duty: &amp; the more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall the duty is, the more is their unto wardnes. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> getteth ground for the most part, in every neglect, it is as in rowing against the tyde, one stroke neglected will not be gained in three, and therefore it is good to keepe our hearts close to duty, and not to he a rken unto the excuses they are ready to frame.</p>
            <p>In the setting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, God strengthneth his <note place="margin">2.</note> owne partie that hee hath in us: wee finde a warme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, and increase of strength, the Spirit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with us, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2554:103"/>
us up by degrees, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it leaveth us as it were in heaven.

            <p>Obedience is most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, when there is nothing <note place="margin">3.</note> else to sweeten the action, although the <hi>sacrifice</hi> bee imperfect, yet the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> with w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it is offred, hath acceptance. 4.

present it hath of comber. Feeling and freenesse of spirit is oft reserued untill duty be discharged: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward followeth worke. In and after dutie, wee finde that experience of Gods presence, which without obedience wee may long wait for, and yet go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. This hindreth not the Spirits freedome in <hi>blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon our soules <hi>when it listeth.</hi> For wee speake onely of such a state of soule, as is becalmed, and must row (as it were) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame.

            <p>Yet in these duties that require as well the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Caution.</note> as the soule, there may bee a cessation till stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth be repaired: whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting doth not lett but fit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

yeelds us comfort also in desolate conditions, as contagious sicknesses, and the like, wherein wee are more immediately under Gods hand. Then Christ hath a throne of Mercy at our beds side, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers our teares and our groanes. And to come to the matter we are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.

into questions. Therefore it was not enough for his goodnesse to leave us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>pretious promises,</hi> but he giveth us seales to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then us: and what though we are not so prepared as we should, yet let us pray as <hi>Hezekias</hi> did, <hi>The Lord</hi>

This should cary us through all duties, with much chearefulnesse, That if we hate our corruptions

Yet GODS chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren never sinne with full will, because there is a contrary Law of the minde, whereby the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of sinne is broken, which alwaies hath some secret working against the Law of sinne. Yet there may bee so much will in a sinfull action, as may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully waste our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort afterward, and keepe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2554:111"/>
us long upon the racke of a disquieted Conscience, GOD in his fatherly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation suspending the sense of his love. So much as we give way to our wils in sinning, in such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of distance we set our selves from comfort.

Such must give a sharp sentence against them <note place="margin">Answ.</note> selves, and yet cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon GODS mercy in CHRIST, as at their <note place="margin">The way to recover our lost peace.</note> first conversion. And now they had need to claspe about CHRIST the faster, as they see more need in themselves, and let them remember the mildnesse of CHRIST here, that will not quench the smoaking flaxe. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wee see that after a deepe humiliation, Christ speakes more peace, then before, to witnesse the truth of this reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because he knowes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans enterprizes in casting
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2554:112"/>
downe such lower; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such are most aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in themselves, and are ashamed to looke Christ in the face, by reason of their unkindnesse. We see GOD did not onely pardon <hi>David,</hi> but after much bruising, gave him wise <hi>Salomon</hi> to succeed him in the Kingdome. We see in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that the Church after she had beene humbled, (for her slighting of Christ) Christ sweetly entertaines her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and falleth into commendation of her Beauty, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. We must know for our comfort, that CHRIST was not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2554:112"/>
annointed to this great worke of the Mediatour for lesser sinnes onely, but for the greatest, if there be but a sparke of true faith to lay hold on him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there bee any brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Reed, let him not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himselfe, when <hi>Christ</hi> doth not except him; <hi>Come unto me all ye, that are weary, and heavy laden, &amp;c.</hi> Why should we not make use of so gracious a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; we are onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore poore, because wee know not our riches in CHRIST. In time of temptation rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve CHRIST, then the Devill, beleeve truth from

               <hi>Truth</hi> it selfe, hearken not to a lyar, an enemy, and a murtherer.</p>
            <p>Since CHRIST is thus comfortably set out unto us, let us not beleeve Sarans representations of him. When we are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in conscience for our sinnes, his manner is then to present him to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted soule as a most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Iudge armed with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice against us. But then let us present him to our soules, as thus offered to our view by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as holding out a Scepter of mercy, and spreading his armes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. When we thinke
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2554:113"/>
of <hi>Ioseph, Daniel, Iohn</hi> the Evangelist, &amp;c. we frame conceipts of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light as of milde &amp; sweet persons, much more when we thinke of CHRIST, wee should conceive of him as a mirrour of all meekness. If the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all flowers were in one, how sweet must that flower needs be? In CHRIST all perfections of mercy and love meete, how great then must that mercy be that lodgeth in so gracious a heart? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever tendernesse is scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in, husband, father, brother, head, all is but a beame from him, it is in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2554:114"/>
him in the most eminent manner. We are weake, but we are his; we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but yet carry his Image vpon us. A father lookes not so much at the blemishes of his child, as at his owne nature in him; so Christ findes matter of love from that which is his owne in us. Hee sees his owne nature in us, wee are diseased, but yet his members; who ever neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his owne members because they were sicke or weake: none ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his owne flesh. Can the head forget the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Can CHRIST forget himselfe? we are his fulnesse as he is ours. He
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2554:114"/>
was Love it selfe clothed with mans nature, which hee united so neere to himselfe, that hee might communicate his goodnes the more freely unto us. And tooke not our nature when it was at the best, but when it was abased, with all naturall and common infirmities it was subiect unto. Let us therefore abhorre all suspicious thoughts, as either cast in, or cherished by that damned spirit, who as he laboured to divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Father and the Sonne by jealousies, <hi>If thou beest the Sonne of</hi>

is to divide betwixt the Sonne and us, by bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding misperswasions in us of CHRIST, as if there were not such tender love in him to such as we are. It was his art from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to discredit God with man, by calling Gods love into question, with our first Father <hi>Adam:</hi> his successe then makes him ready at that weapon still.</p>
            <p>But for all this, I feele <note place="margin">Object.</note> not CHRIST so to me (saith the smoaking flaxe) but rather the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he seemeth to be an enemy unto me, I see and feele evidences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his

            <p>CHRIST may act <note place="margin">Answ.</note> the part of an enemy a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, but it is to make way for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own part of mercy in a more seasonable time; hee cannot hold in his bowells long, he seemeth to wrastle with us, as with <hi>Iacob,</hi> but hee supplyes us with hidden strength, at length to get the better.

answer tending to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, calling her dogge, as being without the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; yet she would not be so beaten off; for shee considered the end of his comming. As his Father was never neerer him in strength to support him, then when he was furthest off in sense of favour to comfort him; So CHRIST is never neerer us in power to uphold us, then when he seemeth most to hide his presence from us. The influence of the Sun of righteousnesse pierceth deeper then his light. In such cases, whatsoever CHRISTS present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

is towards us, let us oppose his nature and office against it, hee cannot deny himselfe, he cannot but discharge the office his Father hath laid upon him.

degree sensible: he might have given thee up to hardnes, security, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse of heart, of all spirituall judgements the greatest. Hee that dyed for his enemies, will hee refuse those the desire of whose soule is towards him? hee that by his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers desires us to bee reconciled, will hee put us off when wee earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke it at his hand? No, doutblesse, when hee prevents us by kindling holy desires in us, hee is ready to meete us in his owne wayes. When the Prodigall set himselfe to returne to his father, his

            <p>The sighes of a bruised heart, carry in them some report, as of our affection to CHRIST, so of his care to us. The eyes of our soules cannot be towards him, but that he hath cast a gracious looke upon us first; The least love wee have to him, is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

As Christ did in his example what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hee gives us in charge to doe, so he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his owne person whatsoever hee calleth us to suffer, that he might the better learne to relieve and pitty us in our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. In his desertion in the Garden, and upon the Crosse, he was content to want that unspeakable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace in the presence of his father, both to beare the wrath of the Lord for a time for us, and likewise to know the better how to comfort us in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test extremities; GOD seeth it fit we should taste
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2554:120"/>
of that cup of which his Sonne dranke so deepe, that we should feele a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle what sinne is, and what his Sonnes love was; but our comfort is, that <hi>Christ</hi> dranke the dreggs of the cup for us, and will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour us, that our spirits utterly faile not under that little taste of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure which wee may feele. He became not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man, but a curse, a man of sorrowes for us. Hee was broken, that wee should not be broken; he was troubled, that wee should not be desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled: he became a curse, that wee should not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2554:120"/>
be accursed. Whatsoever may bee wished for in an all-sufficient Comforter is all to be found in Christ. 1, Authoritie, from the Father all power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him: 2, Strength in himselfe, as having his name <hi>The mighty GOD:</hi>

            <p>Wee are now to take notice of diuers sorts of men that offend deeply against this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full disposition of Christ: As, 1. Such as goe on in ill
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2554:121"/>
courses of life upon this conceit, as if it were in vaine to goe to CHRIST their lives have beene so ill; when as so soone, as wee looke to heaven, all incouragements are ready to meet us, and draw us forward. Amongst others this is one allurement, that CHRIST is ready to welcome us, and leade us further. None are damned in the Church, but those that will. Such as either enforce upon themselves hard conceits of CHRIST, that they may have some shew of reason to fetch contentment from other things: as that <hi>unprofitable</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:2554:121"/>
               <hi>servant,</hi> that would needs take up a conceit, that his Master was <hi>a hard man;</hi> hereby to flatter himselfe in his unfruitfull courses, in not improving that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which he had.</p>

Such as take up a hope of their owne, that Christ will suffer them to walke in the wayes to hell, &amp; yet bring them to heaven: whereas all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sort should draw us nearer to Christ, else it is a lying comfort, eyther in it selfe, or in our application of it.</p>
            <p>And 3. those that will east water themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those sparkes, which Christ labours to kindle

in them; because they will not be troubled with the light of them.</p>

But the judgement of a spirituall man, so far forth as he is spirituall shal sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, because it is agreeable to the nature of things: as things are in themselves,

There is a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a good mans judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to things as they are in themselves, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the difference, or agreement put by GOD in things, so doth his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment differ or agree.</p>
            <p>Truth is truth, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror error, and that which is unlawfull, is unlawfull whether men thinke so or no. GOD hath put an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall difference betwixt light and darknesse, good and ill, which no creatures conceipt can alter, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2554:146"/>
therefore no mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the measure of things further then it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to truth stamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things themselves by GOD. Hereupon because a wise mans judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the truth of things, a wise man may in some sense bee said to bee the measure of things; and the judgement of one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise man, to bee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before a thousand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Such men usually are immoveable as the Sun in its course, because they thinke, and speake, and live by rule. <hi>A Iosuah and his house will serve God</hi> whatsoever others doe,

and will run a course con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the world, because their judgements leads them a contrary way. Hence it is that Sathan hath a spite at the eye of the soule, the judgement, to put out that by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and false reason, for he cannot rule in any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till either hee hath taken away or perverted judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he is <hi>a Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and ruleth in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the understanding.

               </gap> in the stomach be not good, that in the liver cannot be good: so if there bee errour in the judgement it marres the whole practice, as an error in the foundation doth the building: GOD will have no <hi>blind sacrifices,</hi> no <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable services,</hi> but will have us to <hi>love him with all our minde,</hi> that is, with our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2554:149"/>
understanding part, as well as <hi>with all our hearts,</hi> that is, the affecting part of the soule.</p>
            <p>This order of Christs government by judgment, is agreeable unto the soule, and GOD delighteth to preserve the manner of working peculiar unto man, that is, to doe what he doth out of judgemente as grace supposeth nature as founded upon it, so the frame of grace preserveth the frame of nature in man. And therfore Christ bringeth all that is good in the soule through judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that so sweetly that many out of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2554:149"/>
error thinke, that that good which is in them and issueth from them, is from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, &amp; not from the powerfull worke of grace. As in evill the devill so subtlely leadeth us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the streame of our owne nature, that men thinke that Sathan had no hand in their sinne: but here a mistake is with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle perill, because wee are il of ourselves, &amp; the devil doth but promote what ill he findeth in us. But there are no seeds of supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goodnesse at all in us, GOD findeth nothing in us but enmity, onely hee hath ingraven this in our
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2554:150"/>
nature to incline in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to that which we judge to be good. Now when he shall cleerly discover what is good in particular, wee are caried to it, and when convincingly he shal discover that which is ill, we abhorre it as freely as we imbraced it before.</p>
            <p>From whence we may know when we worke as we should doe or no, that is, when we doe what we doe, out of inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when we fall not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because we are so bred, or because such; or such whom we respect doe so; or because wee will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2554:150"/>
a side, so making religion a faction: but out of judgement, when what wee doe that is good, wee first judge it in our selves so to be: and what wee abstaine from that is ill, we first judge it to bee ill from an inward judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A sound Christian as hee injoyeth <hi>the better part,</hi> so hath first made <hi>choice</hi> of it with <hi>Mary, he establisheth all his thoughts by counsell.</hi> GOD indeed useth carnall men to very good service, but w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out a thorow altering, &amp; convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their judgements. He worketh by them, but not in them, therefore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2554:151"/>
they doe neither approve the good they doe, nor hate the evill they abstaine from.</p>
            <p>The 2 branch, is that <note place="margin">2. Branch.</note> wheresoever true wisdom and judgement is, there Christ sets up his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because where wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, it directs us not only to understand, but to order our waies aright; where <hi>Christ</hi> by his Spirit as a <hi>Prophet teacheth,</hi> he like wise as a <hi>King</hi> by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit subdueth the heart to obedience of what is taught. This is that <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which is promised of GOD, when not onely the braine, but the heart it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2554:151"/>
selfe is taught. When men doe not onely know what they should doe, but are taught the very doing of it, they are not only taught that they should love, feare, and obey, but they are taught, love it selfe, and feare, and obedience it selfe. CHRIST sets up his chaire in the very heart and alters the frame of that, and makes his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects good, together with teaching of them to bee good. Other Princes can make good Lawes, but they cannot <hi>write them in their</hi> peoples <hi>hearts.</hi> This is CHRISTS Prerogative; He infuseth into his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2554:152"/>
his owne Spirit, <hi>upon him there doth not onely rest the spirit of wisedome and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Esay 11. 2, 3</note> 
               <hi>understanding,</hi> but likewise <hi>the spirit of the feare of the Lord.</hi> The knowledge which wee have of him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe is a <hi>transforming</hi> knowledge. The same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that inlighteneth the mind, inspireth gracious inclinations into the will and affections, and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth strength into the whole man. As a gracious man judgeth as he should, so he affecteth and doth as hee judgeth, his life is a commentary of his inward man; there is a sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt GODS
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2554:152"/>
truth, his judgment, and his whole conversation. The heart of a Christian is like <hi>Ierusalem</hi> when it was at the best, a City compact <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 3.</note> within it selfe; where are <hi>set up the thrones of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Iudgement should have a throne in the heart of every Christian. Not that judgement alone will work a change, there must be grace to alter the bent and sway of the will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will yeeld to bee wrought upon by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; GOD hath so joyned these together as that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer he doth savingly shine upon the understanding, he giveth a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2554:153"/>
soft and plyable heart, for without a worke upon the hart by the Spirit of God, it will follow its owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to that which it affecteth whatsoever the judgement shall say to the contrary: there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt an unsanctified hart and a sanctified judgment. For the heart unaltered will not give leave to the judgement, coldly and so berly to conclude what is best, as the sick man whilst his aguish distemper cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth his taste, he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desirous to please that, then to hearken what the Physitian shall speake.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2554:153"/>
judgment hath not power over it selfe, where the wil is unsubdued, for the will and affections bribe it to give sentence for them when any profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shall come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with that which the judgement in generall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall thinke to be good, and therefore it is for the most part in the power of the heart, what the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing shall judge and determine in particular things. Where grace hath brought the heart under, there unruly passions doe not cast such a mist before the understanding but that in particular it seeth
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2554:154"/>
that which is best; and base respects, springing from selfe-love doe not alter the case and byas the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a contrary way, but that which is good in it selfe, shall be good unto us, although it crosse our particular worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests.</p>
            <p>The right conceiving of this hath an influence into <note place="margin">Vse.</note> practice, which hath drawne me to a more full explanation: this will teach us the right method of godlinesse, to begin with judgement, and then to begge of GOD toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with illumination, holy inclinations of our

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2554:180"/>
and the fruits of it, of the excellency of a Christians calling, of the short and uncertaine time of this life: how little good all those things that steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our hearts, will doe us ere long; and how it shall bee for ever with us thereafter as we spend this little time well, or ill, &amp;c. the more we give way for such consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to sink into our hearts, the more we shall rise neerer to that state of soule which wee shall enjoy in Heaven.

arraigneth them, giveth sentence against them, and bindeth them over to the latter judgement of the great day.

For can we think that corruption w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the elder in us, and sathan the strong man, that keepeth many holds in us, will yeeld possession quietly: No, there is not so much as a thought of goodnesse discovered by him, but he joyneth with corruption to kill it in the birth. And as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> cruelty was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially against the male
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:2554:201"/>
children; so Sathans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is especially against the most religious and manly resolutions.</p>
            <p>This then wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to expect, that wheresoever Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, there will be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: when Christ was borne all <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was troubled; so when Christ is borne in any man, the soule is in an uproare, and all because the heart is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to yeeld up it selfe to Christ to rule it.</p>
            <p>Wheresoever Christ commeth, he breedeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, not only I, between man and himselfe, but 2, betweene man and man,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:2554:201"/>
and 3, betweene Church and Church: Of which disturbance Christ is no more the cause, they Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke is of trouble in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered body, of which noysome humors are the proper cause, for the end of Physicke is the peace of humors. But Christ think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it fit that the thoughts of mens hearts should bee discovered: and hee is as well for the <hi>falling,</hi> as the <hi>rising of many in Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the desperate mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men is layd open, that they had rather bee under the guidance of their owne lusts, and by consequent of Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

to their endlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, then put their feet into Christs setters, and their neckes under his yoake; whereas indeed Christs service is the only true libertie, his yoake an easie yoake, his burden but as the burden of wings to a bird, that maketh her flie the higher. Sathans go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is rather a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage then a government, unto which Christ giveth up those that shake off his owne, for then hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Sathan and his factors power over them, since they will not <hi>receive the</hi>

Those that take the most liberty to sinne, are the most perfect slaves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most voluntarie slaves, the will in everie thing is either the best or the worst, the further men goe on in a wilfull course, the deeper they sincke in rebellion; and the more they crosse CHRIST, doing what they will, the more they shall one day suffer what they would not. In the meane time they are prisoners in their owne soules, bound over in their consciences to the judgement of him after
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2554:203"/>
death, whose judgement they would none of in their lives. And is it not equall that they should feele him a severe Iudge to condemne them, whom they would not have a milde Iudge to rule them.</p>
            <p>For Conclusion and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall application of all that hath beene spoken, unto our selves. We see the conflicting, but yet sure and hopefull state of Gods people.

but he that will not sight. Therefore, when any base fainting seizeth upon us, let us lay the blame where it is to bee layd. Wee see here what wee may looke for from heaven. O beloved it is a comfortable thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of CHRIST aright, to know what love, mercy, strength we have layed up for us in the brest of CHRIST. A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Physitian (we say) is halfe the cure; Let us not suffer Sathan to transforme Christ unto us, to bee otherwise then he is to those that are his.

overcame God himself (as it were) by beleeving the pardon of all our sinnes; notwithstanding the guilt of our owne consciences, and his absolute justice. Now having beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailers with GOD, what shall stand against us if we can learne to make use of our faith?</p>
            <p>O what a confusion is this to Sathan, that hee should labour to blow out a poore sparke, and yet should not bee able to quench it; that a <hi>graine of Mustard seed</hi> should bee stronger then the <hi>gates of Hell;</hi> that it should be able <hi>to remove mountaines</hi> of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions

and temptations cast up by Sathan and our rebellious hearts between GOD and us. <hi>Abimelech</hi> could not indure that it should bee said a <hi>Woman</hi>

            <p>Since there is such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, where there is a little truth of grace, that it will be so victorious, Let us oft try what: GOD hath wrought in us, search our good, as well as our ill, and be thankfull to GOD for the least measure of

grace, more then for any outward thing, it wil be of more use and comfort then al this world which passeth away &amp; comes to nothing.

of his errors, but the cause being GODS, and his aymes being holy, to promote the truth, and being a mighty man in prayer, and strong in faith, GOD by him kindled that fire, which all the world shall never bee able to quench.
