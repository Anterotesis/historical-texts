         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT the first impression hereof, the time prefixed by the
Parliament, for the Cities taking of this Covenant,
being almost elapsed, &amp; my immature conceptions not
ready for the birth, yet importunity like an overhasty Midwife,
would needs deliver me of it: whereupon I presumed that it
would have perished in the birth, or have found no better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
than a misshapen Embryon: but beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
it hath been accepted of, approved, and (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand)
given satisfaction to many, and was now this second
time put unto the Presse before I knew of it: Had the Stationer
given me but some few dayes warning, I would according to my
poore abilities have added something for the enlargement of it:
but presuming yet that some abler Person may happily undertake
the worke: in the interim this is once againe sent abroad, that
so the Ignorant may be informed of the weightinesse of avow,
and Covenant: that the doubtfull may be resolved concerning
the Lawfulnesse of this in hand; and that all may be excited to
the carefull performance of what they binde themselves to here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:

to frame, and propose this present <hi>Covenant</hi>
to be taken by all the well-affected Subjects
of this Kingdome (as I conceive) are especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
two.</p>
            <p>1. By reason of Gods hand which lies so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
heavie upon us in this present Judgement of the devouring
Svvord, which being one of the greatest outward miseries
which can befall a people, shewes that their sinnes are grown
to a great ripenesse, and that gentler Physick will not serve
turne to purge out their strong corruptions: whereupon
after the godly examples of the pious and renowned Kings
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> they have pitched upon this course as a speciall
meanes to pacifie Gods vvrath by a generall Covenanting
with God to indeavour a Reformation of our hearts, and
lives.</p>
            <p>2. Observing the incessant and indefatigable Plots of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Enemies of God, and his Cause, either by open violence, or
secret fraud to oppresse, or undermine the Power and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Religion, and to introduce <hi>Popery</hi> instead thereof:
They have therefore thought fit by this <hi>Covenant,</hi> to lay a
stronger engagement upon every one to detect and discover,
and oppose whatsoever may tend to the prejudice of the one,
or to the furtherance of the other: but withall consider<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41457:3"/>
that the major part of those which are to enter into it
either for want of Information may scruple some part of it,
or doe it <hi>aubitante conscientiâ,</hi> with a doubting Conscience,
which will make it a sinne to them) or through inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratenesse
may doe it hand over head, without understanding,
or a just prepondering of the strong engagement which they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lay upon themselves hereby, which will make them to
breake it as lightly, as they undertooke it rashly. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
therefore for the Information of the one, and
ballasting of the other in these few ensuing Lines to
shew the severall sorts of Covenants, and the requisites of a
Lawfull <hi>Covenant,</hi> and by the Application of this present
to those Rules, to prove the lawfullnesse of it: as also by
shewing the great ingagement that a sacred Vow, layes upon
the Conscience of the undertakers of it, to deterre all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a giddy taking, or a rash and inconsiderate breaking
of the same.</p>
            <p>Vowes and Covenants are of 2. sorts <list>

            <p>A sinnefull Covenant is a bond whereby wee ingage our

Jewes, 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. who bound themselves under an Oath
of execration, that they would neither eate, nor drinke, till
they had killed <hi>Paul.</hi>

            <p>A Civill Covenant is a bond whereby we ingage our selves

and <hi>Abimelech, 21. Gen.</hi> 27. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A Religious Covenant is a bond whereby we engage our
selves to God,<note place="margin">Sacrum.</note> to yeeld obedience to Him in those things
which are agreeable to his will, 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 10, 10 Ezr. 3. 10.

            <p>And this Religious Covenant is either <list>

            <p>A Universall Religious Covenant is a bond of all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41457:3"/>
vvhereby they engage themselves to the service of God
in abstaining from sinne, and indeavouring to keep all his
Commandements: this <hi>Covenant</hi> is made by all in <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
and renevved so often as vvee come to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the
Lords Supper. A singular Religious Covenant is a bond
vvherein some one Person for some speciall cause doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
himselfe to God.</p>
            <p>And it is either <list>
                  <item>Absolute, and perpetuall.</item>
                  <item>Conditionall, and Temporary.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>An absolute perpetuall Covenant is a bond whereby wee
engage our selves, absolutely to God, and during the whole
terme of our lives, from which wee can never bee released:
such was that of <hi>David 119. Psal.</hi> 106. I have sworne and
I vvill performe it, that I will keep thy righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
A Conditionall and Temporary Covenant is a bond
vvhereby we engage our selves, upon some condition, and for
a certaine time onely, vvhich being expired, or the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unperformed vve are freed from the same: vvhereof wee
have examples, 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 11. v. 18. Act.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>A mixt Covenant vvhich is partly Religious,<note place="margin">Mixtum</note> and partly
civill, is a bond whereby vve engage our selves both to God
and men: Such is this Covenant now appointed to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into: and such was that 2 <hi>King. 11. 17. Iehoiada</hi> made
a Covenant betvveen the Lord and the King: and the King,
and the People, that they should bee the Lords People: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen
the King also and the People: thus having conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the severall sorts of Covenants, I shall come in the next
place to collect such requisites, and ingredients, as are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the constitution of a Lavvfull Covenant, that so by
examining this present Covenant thereby, wee may more
cleerely be convinced of the lawfulnesse of the same.</p>
            <p>Which Ingredients are especially these:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the Subject matter of it be lawfull, or else it's no
Covenant,<note place="margin">De Lic<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> but a conspiracy, and they which enter into it
are like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> brethren in evill, or like those wicked
Jewes, vvhich bound themselves by an Oath, and a curse
that they would neither eate, nor drinke till they had killed
<hi>Paul, 23. Act.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41457:4"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Neither is it sufficient that the matter of it be lawfull, but
it must be knowne also to be so by those which enter into it,
at the time when they undertake it: for as in an Oath wee
must sweare in truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the matter of it must be true: so
in Judgement also, <hi>i. e.</hi> knowing it to bee true, 4. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. or
else we are guilty of perjury: so in vowes, and Covenants
which are sometimes accompanied with an Oath, we must be
well informed of the lawfulnes of the matter thereof, or else
we make our selves guilty before God: and that of <hi>Sol<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mon</hi>
may be applyed to such persons, 20 <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. It's a snare for a
man to devoure holy things, and after the vow to enquire.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. It's also further required, that they which enter into a
Covenant should before hand, and at their entrance into it,
fully resolve with themselves to the uttermost of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to observe and keep the same, and that in every part, and
branch of it: whereunto tends that advice of <hi>Solomon, 5 Ec.
cles. 4, 5. When thou vowest a vow deferre not to pay it, for God</hi>
hath no pleasure in fooles. Pay therefore that which thou hast
vowed? <hi>Better it is that thou shouldest not vow, then that thou
sholdest vow and not pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30. Num.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. It must be of things within our povver: or else to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our selves by a vow to impossibilities,<note place="margin">De possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilibus.</note> what is it but to
prophane the sacred name of God? and bring downe his
curse upon us: this was the sinne of those after the floud
which covenanted among themselves, to build a Tower
which should reach up to Heaven: a thing impossible, if
God had not confounded their Language: and it was also
an aggravation of their sinne, who vovved that they would
neither eat, nor drinke till they had killed <hi>Paul:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of their power, made their vovv the more unlawfull
unto them.</p>
            <p>5. The Persons which bind themselves by a vow, must be <hi>sui
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Juris,</hi> such as have power of their owne heads; and bee not
under the jurisdiction of another, or else they must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to take along with them the consent of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
if they meane to free themselves from sinne: a Maide
in her Fathers House, or a woman that hath an Husband
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41457:4"/>
may not vow without the consent of their superiors, 30. <hi>Nu.
3.</hi> &amp;c. the Reason is because they are not at their own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall,
and therefore not able to performe their vowes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the approbation of another, <hi>verse</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Having thus shewed the severall sorts of Covenants, and
what is required to make a lawfull one; I shall now come to
apply this present Covenant to these rules, and thereby not
only vindicate it from all unlawfulnes, but also shew the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse,
if not necessity of it, at such a time as this is; for
which end I shall take it in sunder, and cleere the lawfulnesse
of it in each branch, that so it may appeare to be free from
just exception in the subject matter of it, which is the first
thing required in a lawfull Covenant.</p>
            <p>First, in the first part of it we professe our hearty sorrow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for our owne, and the Nationall sins, which have deserved
the Calamaties and judgements which now lie upon us, and
that our intention is by Gods grace to endeavour the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of our owne wayes: which clause is so cleere
that I presume that every Christian at the first vievv, will
not onely see a lawfulnesse, but a necessity of the same: for
in Gods judgements wee may read our sins, in the generality,
and greatnesse of the one; the generality and greatnesse of
the other, and in that day (when Gods hand lies heavie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Nation) doth the Lord God call to weeping and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and to baldesse, <hi>&amp;c. 22. Isa.</hi> 12, Wherein wee see that
same thing which is undertaken in this Covenant, imposed
as a duty by God himselfe, who doth not onely require a
sence of, and sorrow for our sins, but a resolute endeavour of
Reformation also; <hi>wash you, make you cleane, take away tbe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
of your workes, from before mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isay</hi> 16. Or else
our humiliation is but hanging downe our heads like a bull
rush for a day, 58. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. meere mocking of God, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our owne soules.</p>
            <p>2. That we doe abhorre and detest the late vvicked, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
treacherous designe, and that we never gave, or will give, or
assent to the execution thereof: but will according to our
power and vocation oppose and resist the same, and all other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41457:5"/>
of the like nature: this branch no one may take which hath
in any measure been privie to the said Plot, till they have
first unburthened their Conscience, by acknowledgeing
what they have been privie to, and craving pardon for the
same; otherwise they devote themselves to the curse of God,
who will be a swift witnesse against such perjured Persons:
and whose flying role will enter into their Houses, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
therein, and consume them with the timber thereof,
and stones thereof, 5 <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. But for such persons as are free
from the guilt of so foule a blot, they not only may, but
ought to professe their detestation of so horrid a Plot, as in
the execution must necessarily have tended to the death and
ruine of so many Innocents: and had the Plotters obtained
their ends; would without all question have ended in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And therein in the Fatall peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of Religion, Lawes, Liberties and all future free <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
also; as the Commission granted to them, will cleerly
evidence and evince.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. That in case any other like designe shal come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
we will make such timely discovery, as may best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the preventing of it: By like <hi>Designe</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
such as are destructive or prejudiciall to the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi>
Citie or Kingdome, as this former would have been:
and this no one that is friend to any of these, or to himselfe
in them can refuse to promise. Some of the very Heathen
from the light, and Principles of Nature it selfe, have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to survive their Countries Liberty: and shall not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
put to their helping hands, to wrest the Liberty of
their Religion from the attempts of Papists: the Liberties
of the <hi>Parliament</hi> from the Complotters of their ruine, and
the Liberties of the City, and Kingdome fromthe Power of
Tyrannicall Oppressours, which is all that wee promise to
doe when we engage our selves to a timely discovery of the
like designes? The Kingdome is a Ship: the Parliament our
Steeres men: the Citie the principall Cabbin: and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the precio us Fraught wherewith God hath laden our
Ship, and he is a Traitour to all these which shall refuse to
tye himselfe to indeavour their preservation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41457:5"/>
4. That we do in our Consciences beleive that the Forces
raised by the two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> are raised and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for their just Defence: and for the Defence of the true
Protestant Religion, and Liberties of the Subject against the
Forces raised by the King: by the beliefe here spoken of (as
I conceive) wee are not to understand such a Faith, as is
grounded upon indubitable &amp; infallible Principles, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Articles of our Religion: but only such a credence
as is grounded upon probable Arguments, and Reasons,
which first working upon our Judgements doe afterwards
convince our Consciences to believe the same. Now that we
have sufficient reason thus to believe, let us but a little call
to mind the Plot of bringing up the Army out of the <hi>North:</hi>
The attempt made against the five Members: the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of the King from his faithfull Councell: the active
instruments which have been imployed into forraigne
parts to provide Armes, Ammunition, and Commanders,
the bringing of them over from time to time, their designe:
to seize upon many of the strong Holds of the Kingdome:
the putting of the Armes into the hands of untrusty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of <hi>Array:</hi> the Arming of the Papists contrary to
Law: the correspondence held with the Scottish, and Irish
Papists, and Rebells: the indeavour to raise a party in this
City to seize upon the Persons of some principall Members
of Parliament and City: and the late Plot as bad, if not
worse then all the rest if by Gods mercy it had not been
strangled in the birth: these are sufficient Arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
us to believe that it was but high time for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to raise Forces, and to continue them for their just
Defence: Againe consider also the setting up of Masses in
<hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Oxford:</hi> the many Jesuites, Priests, and J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Papists that are in the Adverse Armies, whose Romish
Plots are only to advance the Catholique Cause, and ruine
our Religion. Besides the granting of so many Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for <hi>Array;</hi> which were so destructive to the Subjects
Liberty: the pillaging and plundering of the Houses and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of the best Subjects, and burning of their Habitations,
and we cannot but be convinced, it was high time to raise
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41457:6"/>
and it is just to continue these forces for the defence of the
true Protestant Religion, and the liberties of the Subject,
and hereupon vve doe declare, vow and covenant, that wee
will according to our power and vocation, assist these For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thus raised and continued by both Houses of Parliament
against the forces raised by the King without their consent:
If we be upon the former grounds, or the like once convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that these forces are justly raised and continued for the
ends aforesaid, then it will necessarily follow that wee are
bound in Conscience to be aiding and assisting to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our power and vocation, <hi>i. e.</hi> with our persons, if
we be fit, and have a calling thereunto, or with our purses
according to our abilities if we be not set to serve in person:
and with our advice and prayers also for their good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
and he is no true friend either to Parliament, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Liberties, that upon information shall refuse to make
this Vow: Besides, it is but high time that men should by
such a sacred Bond bee quickned unto this assistance in
these times, wherein so many grow wearie of the worke,
and by withdrawing their persons and purses from assisting
do much endanger the Cause of God.</p>
            <p>5. That vve will likewise assist all other persons that shall
take this <hi>Oath</hi> in what they shall doe in pursuance thereof,
neither can this be justly scrupled, for if we enter into this
Covenant our selves, and in pursuance of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in it, vve shall stand in need of the assistance of others:
As we shall desire, so wee cannot but thinke our selves much
injured if wee find not assistance from them, and then the
Law of requitall doth require, that when occasion is offered
we shall not withdravv our help from them also: besides, by
this Union among our selves, the common Cause of God,
and the Kingdome will bee much strengthned, and every
undertaker in it will be much encouraged when they see so
many by so strong a Bond to be engaged to their help. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
it cannot bee conceived but that this Covenant will
excite &amp; provoke the hatred of the adverse Party against the
undertakers of it exceedingly, whereof we had late experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> so much hated and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
under the Name of Covenanters, and therefore wee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41457:6"/>
have need to tye our selves to mutuall assistance for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
support against the Odium and rage of the Adversary.</p>
            <p>6. That wee will not directly or indirectly adhere unto,
nor shall willingly assist the forces raised by the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
the consent of both Houses of Parliament. Herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
is made against equivocation, &amp; those cunning tricks
and evasions which many find out to cosen both themselves
and others, as when a man will not send himselfe, but will
suffer his wife, or children, or other friends to doe it, as hath
been the practice of many hundreds in severall parts of the
Kingdome, who themselves have lent Money, or sent an
Horse to the Parliament, but have suffered their Wives or
Sons to send twice so much to the King, that so by comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with both, they might escape the displeasure of either,
Besides many who (living in some places have been ashamed
to owne the supporting of the Kings forces, yet under hand
they have contributed much to them: but now its required
that neither directly nor indirectly wee bee aiding to them,
and yet because many whose hearts are upright with God
and his Cause, live under the power, or fall into the hands
of the barbarous and bloudy Cavaliers, so that the not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
to them, may endanger their lives, liberties, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
therefore is that word put in, that we shall not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
assist, but only in the cases aforementioned: And if we
do but seriously consider the aime and drift of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
evidently discovered to all that are not wilfully blind,
and their wayes and manner of prosecuting the same, wee
may easily conclude that they are enemies to God and his
Gospell, and to the Parliament, and their Liberties, to the
Kingdome and its lawes, who will vvillingly be assistant to
them. And thus I have briefly run over this Covenant in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
branch of it, and thereby endeavoured to prove the
lawfulnesse of it in the subject matter: I shall now proceed
to examine it by the other rules required in a lawfull Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that so I may fully vindicate it from all hesitation.</p>
            <p>The second thing required is, that it bee knowne to bee
lawfull at the time of the taking of it, for which end the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
hath long since caused it to bee published in Print,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41457:7"/>
that so all men might see it, and have time fully to informe
themselves of the lawfulnesse of it; And in case that any
doubts should arise, they might repaire to those which are
fit and able to resolve them, that so no scruple might remain
at their taking of it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it must be with a purpose of keeping it, and ill
may hee faire that shall make this Covenant with any other
purpose whatsoever: for if it be lawfull, as is proved before,
and that thereupon we engage our selves by it, it must needs
argue a prophane and Atheisticall heart in any that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
for sinister ends to take it, and yet purpose afterwards
to break it; and what doe they therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but pray for a curse
upon themselves, whilst invocating the sacred name of God
to be a witnesse of their sincerity in making this Vow, yet
withall they resolve that he shall dispense with them in their
future breaches of it; and how will such dissemblers be able
to answer it at the dreadfull day, when the secrets of all
hearts shall be disclosed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it must be of things within our power, and so is
this Covenant in all the branches of it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the persons that enter into it are either such as
have power of their owne heads, or that have the consent
of their Superiours: and therefore having all the Ingredients
that are required to make up a lawfull Covenant and Vow,
it must necessarily follow that it is lavvfull: but let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
further consider whether there be not a kind of necessity
also that this, or the like Covenant should be entred into at
such a time as this, which I conceive will fully appeare if we
consider.</p>
            <p>First, That there is no readier nor more effectuall way to
pacifie the displeasure of God and to procure a removall of
these judgements which lye so heavy upon us then by sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
for our sins acknowledging God Justice, and vowing
a R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>formation this <hi>Isa, Hezekiah Iosiah,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> knew,
and therefore had recourse to this meanes, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they found sucessefull.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will appeare to be necessary if we doe but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the restlesse attempts of the adversaries to corrupt and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41457:7"/>
seduce incautious persons, to their owne, and others ruine,
they have had their emis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aries, and instruments in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and town, to propose the specious baits of honours Offices,
Riches, Favour, Friends, &amp; what not? that so they may invei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
the simple by working upon every humor, to betray both
Church, and Common-wealth into their power and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it cannot but be necessary that by the sacred bond of a
Vow, we should be fortified against such inticements.</p>
            <p>If wee doe but consider the pronesse that is in our natures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to be seduced, and led aside by such importunate sollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and strong provocations to evill, especially vvhen they
come, backed with large promises, and great hopes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
wee must needs confesse it necessary, that at such a
time provision of a remedy, should be made against such as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults,
and there can be no better found out then a solemne
Covenant, whereby vve are to engage our selves before the
searcher of all hearts, to stop our eares against such <hi>Syrens</hi>
songs which would enchant us, to rush upon our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and to prefer selfe-ends before the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of Church and State.</p>
            <p>It cannot be imagined that this late Plot is as yet fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
but that there still remaine many persons undete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vvhich have their hands deeply in it.</p>
            <p>And therfore this Covenant is necessary that so such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
out of a deep sence of that great guilt, which they pluck
upon themselves, in case they sweare falsly therein, may be
brought to an acknowledgem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt and confession, of what
they know about it, and to crave pardon for the same, before
they enter into this Covenant, vvhich would bee a great
meanes to prevent much mischiefe that may otherwise
ensue, in case it remaine undiscovered.</p>
            <p>It cannot bee doubted but that many both in this City,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
and in other parts of the Kingdome have either openly, or
secretly; sent Money, Plate, Armes, or other necessaries to
the adverse Forces; whereby they have been much strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and this uncivill Civill and unnaturall Warre hath bin
much fomented, and therefore it is but necessary that every
one should disavow his contribution of such assistance for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41457:8"/>
the time to come, that so by withdrawing the fewell, this
fire of contention may the sooner be extinguished.</p>
            <p>It is evident that this war continuing longer, then was at
first expected, the spirits of many well affected Persons are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> much cooled, and deadned in the prosecution of the worke,
whence it comes to passe that they withdraw their persons
from the service, and close their purses from contributing
to it, whereby the cause of God and the Kingdome lies a
bleeding almost to death, and therefore it is but need that we
should be all quickned to prosecute it, with more zeale and
fervour, and not by our remissenes basely to betray so good
a Cause, which if not upheld, will certainely turne to the
ruine of our selves, Religion and all.</p>
            <p>Thus having cleered these two principall points, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the lawfulnesse and necessity of this Covenant, I shall
briefly in the last place, indeavour to answer such Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as are usually made against it, which are especially
these.</p>
            <p>We are bound by our Oath of Allegiance and the late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
to defend the Kings person, honour,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and estate, and
how then can we enter into this Covenant?</p>
            <p>This Covenant ties us not to any thing that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
unto them.<note place="margin">Ans.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By it wee are bound to assist the Parliament forces,<note place="margin">Obj<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> against
the forces raised by the King, unto which his person is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
and in assisting against his Forces, his person may be
indangered.</p>
            <p>Severall Petitions have been tendred to his Majesty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
his person from their Company,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> and thereby to secure
it from danger: if notwithstanding the same, hee shall suffer
himself to be over-ruled by evill Counsellors the guilt will
lie upon those which have seduced him; it's necessary for
the Parliament, to raise forces for the apprehending of those
Traytors against his Majesty and the Kingdome, which are
protected against Justice, and who are so strong that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Ministers of Justice cannot lay hold upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
bring them to a Legall Tryall, and therefore, as is usuall in
cases of Rebellion, an Army is sent against them, which the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41457:8"/>
King himself ought to assist, and not endanger his person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the other.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the King commands me to assist his forces, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
mee to bee aiding to the other, and I am bound to obey
him.</p>
            <p>The King is to be considered under a double notion or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
either as a King, or as a man; as a King he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
nothing, but vvhat the Law commands, and then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Subject is bound to obey him therein; but as he is a man
his Judgement may bee corrupted, and his passions may
mislead him, so that hee may command that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
both to himselfe and the Kingdome; and herein
he is the best Subject that disobeyes him. The <hi>Amalekite</hi>
that said that he killed <hi>Saul,</hi> at his own command, was just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put to death by <hi>David</hi> as a Traytor for that fact, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.
15, 16. And if a King in his passion shall proffer violence to
a mans person, or command another to doe it, I am bound
by the Law of nature to defend my selfe against him, and it's
no breach of my Oath of Allegeance to doe it.</p>
            <p>But taking up of Armes against the King,<note place="margin">Object.</note> hath been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
cryed dovvne by the godly and Learned.</p>
            <p>1. Here is no taking up of Arms against the King,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but against
his evill Counsellours, who have imbittered his spirit against
his great and faithfull Counsell, and doe still captivate his
person amongst them. And till such bee brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne
punishment, wee can never enjoy either Religion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Families, or Estates in safety.</p>
            <p>2. Many Learned Divines have affirmed, and sufficiently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
proved both by the Law of God, Nature, and Nations, that
if a King turne Tyrant, and oppresse his Subjects in their
Religion, Lawes; or Liberties, it is Lawfull for them <hi>vim vi
repellere,</hi> as was done by the Netherlanders, and Protestants
in <hi>France:</hi> neither was it condemned in Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by
our <hi>English</hi> Divines, when she sent auxiliary Forces to both
those places, to assist them against their owne Kings: and did
not King <hi>Charles</hi> also send a Navie for the reliefe of <hi>Rochell</hi>
when the poore Protestants were besieged therein, by their
owne King: and hath hee not also declared the Scots to bee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41457:9"/>
his good and faithfull Subjects though they took up Armes
to defend their Religion, and Liberties against oppression.</p>
            <p>In this Covenant we binde our selves to assist all others, in
what they shall doe in pursuance thereof:</p>
            <p>What if they doe any unlawfull Act in the pursuance of it?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the pursuance thereof doth necessarily imply,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that it
must be done lawfully, and therefore that Word was inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the late Protestation, &amp; must be understood here also.</p>
            <p>But how will it appeare that it is lawfull for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to raise Forces without,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> much lesse against the Kings
consent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> This question is so fully, and largely discussed, and the
thing proved to be lawfull both in case of Law,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> in his third part, and by diverse of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
in their Answers to Dr. <hi>Ferne,</hi> that I shall referre the
Reader to seeke for satisfaction there, where it may be had
abundantly, if they come with unballanced Judgements and
shut not their eyes against that light which shineth therein.</p>
            <p>Thus these usuall objections being answered, I shall adde
only thus much, that if there be any which have not already
enter'd into this Covenant, seeing the lawfullnes and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of it by this which hath been premised, they will no
longer deferre to doe it, but speedily undertake, with all
cheerefulnesse and alacrity, as the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> did in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's</hi>
time, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 14, 15. and not onely so, but that
they will indeavour also to draw as many as possibly they
can to doe the like.</p>
            <p>The worke is great and needs many hands to help it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</p>
            <q>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus.</q>
            <p>The Enemies are vigilant and active to disunite us, they
cast in many bones of Division: therefore we have need by
this Covenant to cement our selves together, or else wee are
