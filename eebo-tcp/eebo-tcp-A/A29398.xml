            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF A GREAT ENGAGEMENT Which hapned between the <hi>Engliſh Squadron,</hi> under the Command of Vice-Admiral <hi>HERBERT,</hi> and the whole <hi>French Fleet,</hi> near the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on the <hi>Firſt</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1689.</head>
            <head>With Allowance.</head>
            <p>HIS Majeſty's Naval Forces having taken the Seas, under the Command of Vice-Admiral <hi>Herbert;</hi> In order to Curb the Inſults of the <hi>French,</hi> and to hinder their Attempts upon the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> After ſeveral Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Enterprizes, and ſuppreſſing the <hi>French-Capers</hi> and <hi>Privateers,</hi> reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral Prizes they had taken, and were carrying into their Harbours, Braving the Naval Forces of the <hi>French-King,</hi> with a ſmall number of Ships in his chief Harbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And reſolute to proſecute the Glorious War againſt the Diſturbers of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> underſtanding the <hi>French</hi> were gotten to Sea under the favour of the Night, and contrary Winds that hindred ours for ſtanding in or bearing up with them, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting they made for <hi>Ireland,</hi> they ſtood to that Coaſt to prevent their landing any Forces to Diſtreſs the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> On the Firſt of <hi>May</hi> Inſtant, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got ſight of them lying in the Bay of <hi>Bantree</hi> in the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> near the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and Reſolving forthwith to enter the Bay and attacque them, the Wind unluckily Chopt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and blew hard at <hi>Weſt North-weſt,</hi> ſo that we could not but with abundance of Difficulty turn into the Bay.</p>
            <p>But reſolving by any means to get in to them, with Nine of our Ships, the Admiral himſelf leading them, they advance; which the <hi>French</hi> perceiving, with full Sail before the Wind, they make up and meet us: The <hi>French</hi> Fleet conſiſted of Twenty Nine Sail of Men of War, beſides Tenders; Ours but Nineteen in the whole, whereof Five on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could fully come up to Engage. Our Admiral had immediately Seven of their beſt Ships upon his Quarter, and the <hi>French</hi> Admiral lying on the other Broad-ſide of him, but notwithſtanding the Inequality, our brave Admiral never ſtirr'd off the Quarter Deck, Encouraging his Men both by his Orders and Example; the reſt of our Ships that could come up Charging them Board to Board, diſcharging their Broad-ſides, Grapling, and couragiouſly Fighting on the Decks, thundring in their Vollies of Small Shot, Killing their Men in great numbers, and renting their Ships, Maſts, and Rigging, thereby very much diſabling them, continuing reſolutely Engaged till Night parted them. And although the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> much inferiour in Number, and wanting the Weather-gage which greatly hindred them, did not gain the Advantage they otherwiſe might undoubtedly have had; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting that might reſtify their continued Gallantry and Bravary, and to ſhew the <hi>French</hi> that they are not to diſpute with them the Soveraignty of the Ocean. As to particulars of the Loſs on either ſide we are wanting, however it is reported on all hands the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have not loſt one Veſſel; yet under the favour of the Engagement, the <hi>French</hi> having Landed a few Men retreated, diſpairing (notwithſtanding the advantage of their Number) of any anſwerable Succeſs: Though our Admiral reſolves to ſtick cloſe to them, and in a little time we doubt not (under God) to make good the Juſtice of our Cauſe, and pull down the Pride of that Antichriſtian Monarch, who has ſo long diſturb'd the Peace of the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
