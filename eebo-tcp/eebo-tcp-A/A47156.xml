            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

these Gentiles did the things of the Law, and knew God, was that of
Christ, for 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How could they do the things of the Law, but by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature of Christ, seeing without him men can do no good thing!

How could they be without excuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

given them, sufficient, whereby to perform their obedience, which
is only Christ, for an insufficient principle had been a sufficient excuse
for them. 4. How did some of them perfect the Law, and judged the
circumsion and was Jews inwardly and had praise of God, if not by
Christ. 5. How could they clearly see the invisible things of God,
but by Christ the Son, seeing it is said, none knows the Father, but the
Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he to <hi>whom the Son reveals him,</hi> and though these invisible things
are clearly seen in or through the things that are made yet not without

his invisible power and Godhead in these things.</p>

Christ and his Spirit in the true Believers, doth not oppose nor make

from himself upon his innocent Son, or take vengeance upon
the Son of his love, or could that be an answering of divine
Justice, so to take vengeance on the innocent, and let the guilty go
free, with their sins past, present and to come; and then, if all be

then how can God in justice execute wrath or revenge on any

And then what manifest contradiction is it for this man to confess to
his intercession, his ever living to make intercession for them that come

Christ to have satisfied is in their stead, and removed it out of God's

               <p>And further, as to that death that came over <hi>Adam</hi> in that day he
transgressed, it was not the sentence of eternal wrath and destruction,
given and fulfilled by God, but a death from that innocent life and
communion which he had with God before, as the fruit of his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
which God foretold, and threatned them with before, not as
from an obligation upon God presently to take full revenge on man, or
to cut him off for ever the same day he transgressed; for that he did
not, neither was his divine justice such an obligation upon him as to
limit him from shewing mercy or forgiveness (on repentance) and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

supposed; for he said I am a just God, and Saviour, and besides me
there is no Saviour: and in his mercy and love to lost man in general,
he both promised and gave a seed to bruise the Serpents head, and to be
a ransom, attonement, and most acceptable and satisfactory sacrifice as

unto which they were sealed by the holy spirit; which redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
was a freedom, recovery or purchase from all iniquity (which

See, Reader, how erroneously he hath excluded the work of God and
Christ from within, as to the ransoming or freeing of man from sin,
and making him righteous, and so bringing him into unity, peace, favour
and friendship with God, which is the true sense of redemption, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and reconciliation, which are not effected, nor obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

suffering and example without had a tendency thereto) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

sanctified and justified, how ever tke Devil and his Agents endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to exclude, and invalidate the inward operations of God, Christ,
or his Spirit.</p>
