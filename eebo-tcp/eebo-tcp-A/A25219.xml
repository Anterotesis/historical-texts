            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Great Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE could wish your Majesty had a Window in our Breasts, through which you might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern how our Souls Embrace your Royal Clemency with the highest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and yet with the profoundest Veneration.</p>
            <p>For we look upon our selves truly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted from a hotter Climate, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seated under the temperate Zone of your Majesty's most mild and gentle Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where instead of the scorching Beams of Severity, which had almost calcined us to Ashes, we now feel the cool Breezes of your Majesty's Favour to revive and refresh us.</p>
            <p>Really Sir, though we pretend not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny refin'd Intellectuals, nor presume to Philosophise upon the Mysteries of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither to pry into the Mysteries of State; which things as they are far above, so they belong not to us at all, yet we make some small Pretence to the Sense of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31324:4"/>
Feeling; whatever our Dullness may be, yet we can easily distinguish between a Wound and a Plaister; and know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the smart Lashes of some of our Fellow-Subjects, and the healing Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of our Sovereign.</p>
            <p>We now, (Dear Sir) silently wait for some happy juncture to give your Majesty such essential Proofs of our Loyalty, and the Sincerity of this our humble Address; as may demonstrate that the greatest things, we have been able to express or promise in this poor Paper is the least thing we shall chearfully perform for your Majesty's ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Go on (Great Sir) in this your Royal Line, (that is) your own proper Way and Method of Grace and Clemency, that the World may be more fully and further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that you are the best as well as the greatest, and therefore the greatest, because the best of Princes, that so if there should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any Seeds of Disloyalty in any of your Subjects, this transcendent Goodness of yours may mortifie and kill them, or if any Sparks of Duty should be almost smother'd in well-meaning, though mistaken Minds, such sovereign Grace may awaken and revive them, which above all Regalia's, will most gloriously adorn your Majesty's Imperial Throne and Diadem.</p>
