         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſtroke of Gods wrath for

Therefore his appropriate and ſpeciall Antidote is
<hi>Seria paenitentia, &amp; converſio ad Deum:</hi> unfained and

Let me therefore be an humble ſuitor, that

This action as it would be honourable to your

there would appeare a moſt admirable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

effect thereof. And till this be performed,
what other wayes ſoever wee ſhall follow, wee ſhall

            <p>Let not Gentlemen and rich Citizens by flying
(unleſſe they likewiſe flie from their ſinnes) thinke
to eſcape Scotfree. So long as they carry their ſinne
with them, the Lord will find them out, and his hand
will reach them whereſoever they are.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There ſhould (in my opinion) be provided a place
of Sepulture for the bodies eſpecially of ſuch as die
by the Sicknes, ſome good diſtance from the Citie
and Suburbs. The burying of infected bodies in
Churches, Church-yards, and namely in <hi>Paules</hi>
Church-yard, where the chiefe Magiſtrates of the
Citie, and many other Citizens meete weekly to
heare Sermons, muſt needs be not onely inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
but very dangerous for ſpreading the contagion,
and poiſoning the whole Citie. For all men that
have the leaſt inſight in Philoſophy know that from
the dead corps, by force of the Sunne, certaine va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
or exhalations are elevated, which partake of
the nature of thoſe bodies, and doe undoubtedly
taint, corrupt, and poyſon the aire with their ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
For this principall cauſe, in moſt well ordered
Cities of forrein Countries, there is a common place
of Buriall appointed a good diſtance from the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Citie. And till this may be procured for
our Citie, I wiſh that ſtraight charge be given, that
<pb facs="tcp:4192:4"/>
all dead corpſes be layd a convenient depth in the
ground, and not one coffin heaped upon another,
and they layd ſo neare the top of the earth as (it is to
be feared) they now are.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It were neceſſarie the place of Buriall ſhould be

draw the vapours from it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Let care be had, that the ſtreets, eſpecially the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
lanes and allies, be kept from annoyance of
dung-hilles, vaults or houſes of office, the common
ſewers and chanels be well purged and ſcowred, the
dung-farmers tyed to their ſtint of time in Winter,
and not ſuffered (unleſſe urgent neceſſitie require)
to perfume the ſtreets all Summer long, eſpecially
in this time of contagion. Let not the carkaſſes of
horſes, dogs, cats, &amp;c. lye rotting and poyſoning
the ayre (as they have done) in More and Finsburie
fields, and elſewhere round about the Citie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Let the Pipes layd from the new River be often

            <p>Concourſe of people to Stage-playes, Wakes or

ſcattered both in Citie and Countrie.</p>
            <p>Let the Bells in Cities and Townes be rung often,

is purified.</p>
            <p>Touching our regiment and diet, repletion and
inanition (as two dangerous extremities) are heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

which are of eaſie digeſtion and apt to breed good
juice.</p>
            <p>The blankets, matreſſes, flockbeds, and all bed-clothes
of the infected, are to be burned, alſo leather
garments, becauſe they hold the infection very long.

            <p>It is not good to be abroad in the ayre, early in the

               <p>My opinion is, that theſe Placents of Arſenicke

It is evident that Arſenicke being a confeſſed poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. de Temp cap.</note>

of topicall and outward remedies, eſpecially, if they
