            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THou hast here the Beginning and End of a Discourse, concerning Government; what Fate has otherwise disposed of the Papers that should have filled up the middle, and were more than all the rest, 'tis not worth while to tell thee. These, which remain, I hope, are sufficient to establish the Throne of our great Restorer, Our present King <hi>William</hi>; to make good his Title, in the Consent of the People, which being the only one, of all lawful Governments, he has more fully and clearly than any Prince in <hi>Christendom.</hi> And to justifie to the World, the People of <hi>England,</hi> whose love of their just and natural Rights,
<pb facs="tcp:96077:3"/>
with their Resolution to preserve them, saved the Nation, when it was on the very brink of Slavery and Ruine. If these Papers have that evidence, I flatter my self, is to be found in them, there will be no great miss of those which are lost, and my Reader may be satisfied without them. For I imagine I shall have neither the time, nor inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repeat my Pains, and fill up the wanting part of my Answer, by tracing Sir <hi>Robert</hi> again, through all the Windings and Obscurities which are to be met with in the several Branches of his wonderful Systeme. The King, and Body of the Nation, have since so throughly confuted his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that, I suppose, no Body hereafter will have either the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to appear against our common Safety, and be again an Advocate for Slavery; or the Weakness to be deceived with Contradictions dressed up in a popular Stile, and well turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:96077:3"/>
Periods. For if any one will be at the Pains himself, in those Parts which are here untouched, to strip Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Discourses of the Flourish of doubtful Expressions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce his Words to direct, positive, intelligible Propositions, and then compare them one with another, he will quickly be satisfied, there was never so much glib Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense put together in well sounding <hi>English.</hi> If he think it not worth while, to examine his Works all through, let him make an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that Part where he treats of Usurpation; and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can, with all his Skill, make Sir <hi>Robert</hi> intelligible, and consistent with himself, or common sense. I should not speak so plainly of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, long since past answering, had not the Pulpit, of late Years, publickly owned his Doctrine, and made it the Currant Divinity of the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es. 'Tis necessary those Men,
<pb facs="tcp:96077:4"/>
who, taking on them to be Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have so dangerously mis-led o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, should be openly shewed of what Authority their Patriarch, whom they have followed, is, or ought to be; that so they may either recant what, upon so ill Grounds, they have vented, or justifie his Opinions. For I should not have writ against Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> or taken the pains to shew his Mistakes, Inconsistencies, and want of (what he so much boasts of, and pretends wholly to build on) Scripture-Proofs, were there not Men amongst us, who, by crying up his Books, and espousing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, save me from the Reproach or writing against a dead Adversary. They have been so zealous in this Point, that if I have done him any wrong, I cannot hope they should spare me. I wish, where they have done the Truth and the Publick wrong, (there being scarce a greater mischief to Prince and People, than
<pb facs="tcp:96077:4"/>
the propagating wrong Notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Government) they would be as ready to redress it. And that all times might not have reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the <hi>Drum Ecclesiastick.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, concerned really for Truth, undertake the Confutation of my <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I promise him either to recant my mistake, upon fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; or to answer his difficulties. But he must remember two Things: <hi>First,</hi> That cavilling here and there, at some Expression, or little Incident of my Discourse, is not an Answer to my Book. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I shall not take Railing for Arguments, nor think either of these worth my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Though I shall always look on my self as bound to give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any one, who shall appear to be conscientiously scrupulous in the point, and shall shew any just Grounds for his Scruples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96077:5"/>I have nothing more, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise the Reader, that

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. SLavery is so vile and miserable an Estate of Man, and so directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the generous temper and courage of our Nation; that 'tis hardly to be conceived, that an <hi>Englishman,</hi> much less a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> should plead for't. And truly I should have taken this as any other Treatise, which would perswade all Men, that they are Slaves and ought to be so; for such an other exercise of Wit, as was his who writ the Encomium of <hi>Nero,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for a serious Discourse meant in earnest, had not the gravity of the Title and Epistle, the Picture in the Front of Sr. <hi>Rbts,</hi> Book, and the applause that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, required me to believe that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Publisher were both in earnest, I therefore took the <hi>Patriarcha</hi> of Sr. <hi>R. Filmer</hi> into my hands with all the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and read it through with all the attention due to a Treatise, that made such a noise at it's coming abroad, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96077:7"/>
but confess my self mightily surprised, that in a Book which was to provide Chains for all mankind, I should find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Rope of Sand useful perhaps to such whose skill and business it is to raise a dust, and would blind the People the better to mislead them, but is not of any force to draw those into Bondage, who have their Eyes open and so much Sense about them, as to consider that Chains are but an ill wearing, how much care soever hath been taken to file and polish them.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. If any one think I take too much liberty in speaking so freely of a Man who is the great Champion of absolute Power, and the Idol of those who worship it; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to make this small allowance for once, to one, who even after the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Roberts</hi> Book, cannot but think himself as the Laws allow him a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and I know no fault it is to do so, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less any one better skill'd in the Fate of it than I, should have it revealed to him, that this Treatise which has lain dormant so long, was when it appeared in the World to carry by strength of its Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all Liberty out of it, and that from thence forth our Authors short model was to be the pattern in the Mount and the perfect Standard of Politics for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96077:7"/>
future. His System lies in a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass 'tis no more but this,
<q>
                     <p>That all Government is absolute Monarchy, and the ground he builds on is this,</p>
                     <p>That no Man is born free?</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Since there have been a generation of Men sprung up in the World that would flatter Princes with an Opinion that they have a Divine Right to absolute Power, let the Laws by which they are constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and are to govern, and the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under which they enter upon their Authority, be what they will, and their engagements to observe them never so well ratified by solemn Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, they have denied Mankind a Right, to natural Freedom, whereby they have not only as much as in them lies expos'd all Subjects to the utmost Misery of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppression, but have also so unsettled the Titles, and shaken the Thrones of Princes. (For they too, by these Men's Doctrin, except only one, are all born Slaves, and by divine Right are Subjects to <hi>Adams</hi> right Heir) as if they had design'd to make War upon all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and subvert the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Human Society.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96077:8"/>4. However we must believe them upon their own bare words, when they tell us we are all born Slaves and there is no remedy for it, we must continue so; Life and Thraldom we entered into together, and can never be quit of the one, till we part with the other, though I do not find Scripture or Reason any where say so, however these Men would perswade us that Divine Authority hath subjected us to the unlimited Will of another. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable State of Mankind, and that which they have not had wit enough to find out till this latter Age. For however Sr. <hi>Rob. Filmer</hi> seems to condemn the Novelty of the contrary Opinion, <hi>Patr. p.</hi> 3. yet I believe it will be hard for him to find any other Age or Country of the World, but this which have asserted Monarchy to be <hi>Iure Divino.</hi> And he confesses <hi>Patr. p.</hi> 4. That <hi>Heyward, Blackwood, Barclay and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have bravely vindicated the Right of Kings in most Points,</hi> never thought of this, <hi>but with one Consent admitted the Natural Liberty and Equality of Mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By whom this Doctrine came at first to be broach'd and brought in fashion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, and what sad Effects it gave rise to, I leave to <hi>Historians</hi> to relate or the Memory of those who were Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries with <hi>Sibthorp</hi> and <hi>Manwering</hi> to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96077:8"/>
recolect my business at present, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider what Sr. <hi>R. F.</hi> who is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have carried this Argument far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest, and is supposed to have brought it to perfection, has said in it; For from him every one who would be as fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as <hi>French</hi> was at Court, has learned and runs away with this short System of Politics, <hi>viz.</hi> Men are not born free, and therefore could never have the liberty to choose either Governors or Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Princes have their Power Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and by Divine Right, for Slaves could never have a right to Compact or Consent; <hi>Adam</hi> was an absolute Monarch, and so are all Princes ever since.</p>

               <p n="6">6. SIR <hi>R. F</hi>'s great Position is, that <hi>Men are not naturally free,</hi> this is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which his absolute Monarchy stands, and from which it erects it self to an height that it's Power is above every Power, <hi>Caput inter nubila,</hi> so high above all earthly and human Things, that thought can scarce reach it, that Promises and Oaths which tye the infinite Deity, cannot confine it. But if this Foundation fails, all his Fabric falls with it, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments must be left again to the old way of being made by contrivance and the consent of Men (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) making use of their reason to unite together into Society. To prove this grand Position of his, he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>Men are born in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Parents,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free. And this Authority of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, he calls <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> p. 12, 14. <hi>Fatherly Authority, Right of Fatherhood,</hi> p. 12, 20. one would have thought he would in the beginning of such a Work as this, on which was to depend the Authority of Princes and the Obedience of Subjects, have told us expresly what that Fatherly Authority is, have defined it, though not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96077:9"/>
limited it, because in some other Treatises of his, he tells us 'tis unlimited, and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable, he should at least have given us such an account of it, <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96077:10"/>
us the Story as he thinks fit of this strange kind of domineering Phantom, called the <hi>Fatherhood,</hi> which whoever could catch presently got Empire and unlimited ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power. He assures us how this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi> began in <hi>Adam,</hi> continued it's course, and kept the World in order all the time of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> till the Flood, got out of the Arch with <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, made and supported all the Kings of the Earth till the Captivity of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then the poor <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi> was under hatches till <hi>God by giving the Israelites Kings, Re-established the Ancient and prime Right of the lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in paternal Government.</hi> This is his business from <hi>p.</hi> 12 to 19. And then obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating an Objection, and clearing a Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or two with one half reason, <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>to confirm the Natural Right of Regal Power,</hi> he ends the first Chapter. I hope 'tis no Injury to call an half Quotation an half Reason, for God says, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> but our Author contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with half, leaves out <hi>thy Mother</hi> quite, as little serviceable to his purpose, but of that more in an other place.</p>
               <p n="7">7 I do not think our Author so little skill'd in the way of Writing Discourses of this Nature, nor so careless of the Point in hand, that he by oversight commits the fault that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96077:10"/>
he himself in his <hi>Anarchy of a mix'd Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, p.</hi> 239. Objects to Mr. <hi>Hunton</hi> in these words. <hi>Where first I charge the</hi> A <hi>that he hath not given us any Definition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> or Discripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Monarchy in general, for by the Rules of Method,</hi> he should have first defin'd. And by the like Rule of Method Sr. <hi>Rob.</hi> should have told us, what his <hi>Fatherhood</hi> or <hi>Fatherly Authority</hi> is before he had told us, in whom it was to be found and talked so much of it. But perhaps Sr. <hi>Rob.</hi> found that this <hi>Fatherly Authority,</hi> this Power of Fathers and of Kings, for he makes them both the same, <hi>p.</hi> 24. would make a very odd and frightful Figure, and very disagreeing, with what either Children imagin of their Parents, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Kings, if he should have given us the whole d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aught together in that Gigantic Form, he had Painted it in his own Phancy, and therefore like a wary Physician, when he would have his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent swallow some harsh or <hi>Corrosive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi> he mingles it with a large quantity of that, which may delute it; that the scatter'd Parts may go down with less feeling and cause less Aversion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let us then endeavour to find what account he gives us of this <hi>Fatherly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> as it lies scatter'd in the several Parts of his Writings. And first as it was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96077:11"/>
vested in <hi>Adam,</hi> he says <hi>not only Adam, but the succeeding Patriarchs, had by Right of Fatherhood, Royal Authority over their Children,</hi> p. 12. <hi>This Lordship which Adam by Command had over the whole World, and by right descending from him, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs did injoy; was as large and ample as the Absolute Dominion of any Monarch, which hath been since the Creation.</hi> p. 13. <hi>Dominion of Life and Death; making War and concluding Peace,</hi> p. 13. <hi>Adam and the Patriarchs had Absolute Power of Life and Death,</hi> p. 35. <hi>Kings in the right of Parents, succeed to the Exercise of supream jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> p. 19. <hi>As Kingly Power is by the Law of God, so it hath no inferior Law to Limit it,</hi> Adam was Lord of all, p. 40. <hi>The Father of a Family governs by no other Law, then by his own will,</hi> p. 78. <hi>The Superiority of Princes is above Laws,</hi> p. 79. <hi>The unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited jurisdiction of Kings, is so amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by Samuel.</hi> p. 80. <hi>Kings are above the Laws. p.</hi> 93. And to this purpose see a great deal more which our A—delivers in <hi>Bodins</hi>'s words. <hi>It is certain that all Laws, Priviledges and Grants of Princes have no Force, but during their Life; if they be not ratified by the express Consent or by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Prince following especially Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</hi> O. p. 279. <hi>The reason why Laws have been also made by Kings, was this;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96077:11"/>
when Kings were either busied with Wars, or distracted with Public Cares, so that every private Man, could not have Acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ss to their Persons, to learn their Wills and Pleasure, then were Laws of necessity invented, that so every particular Subject, might find his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Pleasure Decypher'd unto him in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Laws.</hi> p. 92. <hi>In a Monarchy, the King must by necessity be above the Laws,</hi> p. 100. <hi>A perfect Kingdom is that, wherein the King Rules all things according to his own Will,</hi> p. 100. <hi>Neither Common nor Statute Laws, are or can be any Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that General Power, which Kings have over their People by right of Fatherhood,</hi> p. 115. <hi>Adam was the Father, King and Lord over his Family, a Son, a Subject and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or Slave, were one and the same thing at first. The Father had Power to dispose or sell his Children or Servants, whence we find that at the first reckoning up of Goods in Scripture, the Man-servant and the Maid-servant, are numbred among the Possessions, and substance of the Owner, as other Goods were.</hi> O pref. <hi>God also hath given to the Father a Right or Liberty, to alien his Power over his Children; to any other whence we find the Sale and Gift of Children, to have been much in use, in in the Beginning of the World, when Men had their Servants for a Possession and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as well as other Goods, whereupon

               <p n="9">9. I have been fain to trouble by Reader, with these several Quotations in our <hi>A—s</hi> own words, that in them might be seen his own Discription, of his <hi>Fatherly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as it lies scatter'd up and down in his Writings, which he supposes was first vested in <hi>Adam,</hi> and by Right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all Princes ever since. This <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Authority</hi> then or <hi>Right of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> in our A—s sence is a Divine unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Right of Sovereignty, whereby a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or a Prince, hath an Absolute Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unlimited and unlimitable Power, over the Lives, Libertys, and Estates of his Children or Subjects, so that he may take or alienate their Estates, sell, castrate, or use their Persons as he pleases, they being all his slaves, and he Lord and Proprietor of every thing, and his unbounded Will their Law.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Our A— having placed such a mighty Power in <hi>Adam,</hi> and upon that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96077:12"/>
supposition, founded all Government, and all Power of Princes, it is reasonable to expect, that he should have proved this with Arguments clear and evident, suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the weightiness of the Cause. That since Men had nothing else left them; they might in slavery had such undeniable Proofs of its necessity, that heir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences might be convinced, and oblige them to submit peaceably to that Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion, which their Governors had a Right to Exercise over them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this; what good could our A— do, or pretend to do, by erecting such an unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Power, but flatter the Natural Vanity and Ambition of Men, too apt of its self to grow and increase, with the Possession of any Power? And by perswading those, who by the consent of their fellow Men are advanced to great, but limited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, that by that Part which is given them, they have a Right to all that was not so, and therefore may do what they please, because they have Authority to do more then others, and so tempt them to do what is neither for their own, nor the good of those under their Care, whereby great mischeifs cannot but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

his Mighty Absolute Monarchy, I expected that in his <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> this his main suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition would have been proved and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, with all that evidence of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that such a Fundamental Tenet required, and that this on which the great stress of the business depends, would have been made out with reasons sufficient to justifie the confidence, with which it was assumed. But in all that Treatise, I could find very little tending that way; the thing is there so taken for granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proof, that I could scarce believe my self, when upon attentive Reading that Treatise, I found there so mighty a Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, rais'd upon the bare supposition of this Foundation; for it is scarce credible, that in a Discourse where he pretends to confute, the <hi>Erroneous Principle</hi> of Mans <hi>Natural Freedom,</hi> he does it by a bare sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Adams Authority,</hi> without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any Proof for that <hi>Authority.</hi> Indeed he confidently says, that <hi>Adam had Royal Authority.</hi> p. 12, and 13. <hi>Absolute Lordship and Dominion of life and death,</hi> p. 13. <hi>An Vniversal Monarchy,</hi> p. 33. <hi>Absolute Power of life and death,</hi> p. 35. He is very frequent in such Assertions, but what is strange in all his whole <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> I find not one pretence of a reason, to Establish this his great Foundation of Government; not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96077:13"/>
any thing that looks like an Argument, but these words; <hi>To confirm this Natural Right of Regal Power, we find in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that the Law which injoyns Obedience to Kings, is delivered in the Terms, Honour thy Father, as if all Power were Originally in the Father.</hi> And why may I not add as well, that in the Decalogue, the Law that injoyns obedience to Queens, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Terms of <hi>Honour thy Mother,</hi> as if all Power were Originally in the Mother? The Argument as Sr. <hi>Rob.</hi> puts it, will hold as well for one as tother, but of this more in its due place.</p>
               <p n="12">12. All that I take notice of here, is that this is all our A— says in this first, or any of the following Chapters, to prove the <hi>Absolute Power of Adam,</hi> which is his great Principle, and yet as if he had there settled it upon sure Demonstration, he begins his 2<hi>d.</hi> Chapter with these words, <hi>by Confering these Proofs and Reasons, drawn from the Authority of the Scripture.</hi> Where those <hi>Proofs and Reasons</hi> for <hi>Adams</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, are, bateing that of <hi>Honour thy Father</hi> above mentioned, I confess, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find unless what he says, <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>In these words we have an evident Confession,</hi> viz. <hi>of Belarmin, that Creation made Man Prince of his Posterity,</hi> must be taken for Proofs and Reasons drawn from Scripture, or for

any sort of Proofs at all: though from thence by a new way of inference i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the words, immediately following. <hi>And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> he concludes) <hi>the Royal Authority of Adam,</hi> sufficiently settled in him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If he has in that Chapter, or any where in the whole Treatise, given any other Proofs of <hi>Adams Royal Authority,</hi> other then by often repeating it, which among some Men goes for Argument, I desire any body for him to shew me the Place and Page, that I may be convinced of my mistake, and acknowledge my oversight. If no such Arguments are to be found, I beseech those Men, who have so much cryed up this Book, to consider whether they do not give the World cause to suspect, that 'tis not the Force of Reason and Argument, that makes them for Absolute Monarchy, but some other by interest, and therefore are resolved to applaud any Author, that writes in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this Doctrin, whether he support it with reason or no. But I hope they do not expect that rational and indifferent Men should be brought over to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, because this their great Dr. of it, in a Discourse made on purpose, to set up the <hi>Absolute Monarchical Power of Adam,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Natural Freedom</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, has said so little to prove it, from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96077:14"/>
whence it is rather naturally to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that there is little to be said.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But that I might omit no care to inform my self in our <hi>A—s</hi> full Sense, I consulted his <hi>Observations on Aristotle, Hobs, &amp;c.</hi> To see whether in disputing with others he made use of any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for this his Darling Tenet of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> since in his Treatise of the <hi>Natural Power of Kings,</hi> he had been so sparing of them: And in his Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s <hi>Leviathan</hi> I think he has put in short, all those Arguments for it together, which in his Writings I find him any where to make use of, his Words are these. <hi>If God Created only Adam, and of a piece of him made the Woman, and if by Generation from them two, as parts of them all Mankind be propagated: If also God gave to</hi> Adam <hi>not only the Dominion over the Woman and the Children that should Issue from them, but also over the whole Earth to subdue it, and over all the Creatures on it, so that as long as</hi> Adam <hi>lived, no Man could claim or enjoy any thing but by Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Assignation or Permission from him, I wonder,</hi> &amp;c. O. 165. Here we have the Sum of all his Arguments, for <hi>Adams So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> and against <hi>Natural Freedom,</hi> which I find up and down in his other Treatises, which are these following, <hi>Gods

               <p n="15">15. SIR <hi>Rob.</hi> in his Preface to his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Politics tells us, <hi>A Natural Freedom of Mankind cannot be supposed without the denial of the Creation of</hi> Adam; but how <hi>Adams</hi> being Created, which was nothing but his receiving a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately from Omnipotency, and the hand of God, gave <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over any thing, I cannot see, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently understand how a <hi>Supposition of natural Freedom is a denial of</hi> Adams <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and would be glad any body else (since our <hi>A</hi>— did not vouchsafe us the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) would make it out for him: for I find no difficulty to suppose the <hi>Freedom of Mankind,</hi> though I have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the <hi>Creation of Adam</hi>; He was Created or began to exist by Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

Power, without the Intervention of Parents or the pre existence of any of the same Species to beget him, when it pleased God he should, and so did the Lyon, the King of Beasts before him, by the same Creating Power of God, and if bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence by that Power, and in that way, will give Dominion without any more adoe, our <hi>A</hi>— by this Argument will make the Lion have as good a Title to it as he, and certainly the Ancienter. No! for <hi>Adam</hi> had his Title <hi>by the appointment of God,</hi> says our <hi>A</hi>— in another place. Then bare <hi>Creation</hi> gave him not Dominion, and one might have <hi>supposed Mankind Free</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>denying the Creation of Adam,</hi> since 'twas Gods <hi>Appointment</hi> made him Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But let us see how he puts <hi>his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and this <hi>Appointment</hi> together. <hi>By the appointment of God,</hi> says Sir <hi>Rbt. as soon as</hi> Adam <hi>was Created he was Monarch of the World, though he had no Subjects, for though there could not be actual Government till there were Subjects, yet by the Right of Nature it was due to</hi> Adam <hi>to be Governour of his Posterity, though not in act, yet at least in habit,</hi> Adam <hi>was a King from his Creation,</hi> I wish he had told us here what he meant <hi>by Gods appointment.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Providence orders, or the Law of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96077:16"/>
Nature directs, or positive Revelation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, may be said to be <hi>by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but I suppose it cannot be meant here in the first Sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> by providence; because that would be to say no more, but that <hi>as soon as Adam was Created</hi> he was <hi>de facto</hi> Monarch, because <hi>by Right of Nature it was due to</hi> Adam, <hi>to be Governour of his Posterity.</hi> But he could not <hi>de facto</hi> be by providence Constituted the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World at a time, when there was actually no Government, no Subjects to be governed, which our <hi>A</hi>— here confesses. <hi>Monarch of the World</hi> is also differently used by our Author, for sometimes he means by it a Proprietor of all the World exclusive of the rest of Mankind, and thus he does in the same page of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before cited, <hi>Adam</hi> says he <hi>being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Multiply and People the Earth and to subdue it, and having Dominion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him over all Creatures, was thereby the Monarch of the whole World, none of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity had any Right to possess any thing but by his Grant or Permission or by Succession from him,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Let us understand then by <hi>Monarch</hi> Proprietor <hi>of the World,</hi> and by <hi>Appointment</hi> Gods actual Donation, and revealed positive Grant made to <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. as we see Sir <hi>Robt.</hi> himself does in this parallel place, and then his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96077:16"/>
will stand thus, <hi>by the positive Grant of God; As soon as</hi> Adam <hi>was Created, he was Proprietor of the World, because by the Right of Nature it was due to</hi> Adam <hi>to be Governour of his Posterity,</hi> in which way of arguing there are two manifest False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. <hi>First,</hi> it is false that God made that Grant to <hi>Adam,</hi> as soon as he was Created, since though it stands in the Text immediately after his Creation, yet it is plain it could not be spoken to <hi>Adam</hi> till after <hi>Eve</hi> was made and brought to him, and how then could he be <hi>Monarch by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment as soon as Created,</hi> especially since he calls, if I mistake not, that which Gods says to <hi>Eve,</hi> 3 <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. <hi>The original Grant of Government,</hi> which not being till after the fall, when <hi>Adam</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, at least in time and very much, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in condition, from his <hi>Creation,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see, how our <hi>A</hi> can say in this Sense, that <hi>by Gods appointment as soon as</hi> Adam <hi>was Created he was Monarch of the World. Secondly,</hi> were it true that Gods actual Donation <hi>appointed</hi> Adam <hi>Monarch of the World as soon as he was Created,</hi> yet the Reason here given for it would not prove it, but it would always be a false Inference that God by a positive Donation <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Adam <hi>Monarch of the World, because by Right of Nature it was due to</hi> Adam <hi>to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96077:17"/>
be Governour of his Posterity</hi>; for having given him the Right of Government by Nature, there was no need of a positive Donation, at least it will never be a proof of such a Donation.</p>
               <p n="17">17. On the other side the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter will not be much mended, if we understand <hi>by Gods appointment</hi> the Law of Nature (though it be a pretty ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh Expression for it, in this place) and <hi>by Monarch of the World,</hi> Sovereign Ruler of Mankind; for then the Sentence under consideration must run thus. <hi>By the Law of Nature, as soon as</hi> Adam <hi>was Created he was Governour of Mankind, for by Right of Nature it was due to</hi> Adam <hi>to be Governour of his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which amounts to this, he was <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour by Right of Nature,</hi> because he was <hi>Governour by Right of Nature</hi>; But supposing we should grant that a Man is <hi>by Nature Governour</hi> of his Children, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> could not hereby <hi>be Monarch as soon as Created,</hi> for this Right of Nature being founded in his being their Father, how <hi>Adam</hi> could have a <hi>Natural Right</hi> to be <hi>Governour</hi> before he was a Father, by which only he had that <hi>Right,</hi> is, methinks, hard to conceive unless he will have him to be a Father before he was a Father, and to have a Title before he had it.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96077:17"/>18. To this foreseen Objection, our <hi>A</hi>— answers very logically, <hi>he was Governour in Habit and not in Act</hi>: A very pretty way of being a Governour without Government, a Father without Children, and a King without Subjects. And thus Sir <hi>Robt.</hi> was an Author before he writ his Book, not <hi>in Act</hi> 'tis true, but <hi>in Habit,</hi> for when he had once Publish'd, it was due to him <hi>by the Right of Nature,</hi> to be an Author as much as it was <hi>to Adam to be Governour of his Children</hi> when he had begot them; And if to be such a <hi>Monarch of the World,</hi> an absolute Monarch <hi>in Habit but not in Act</hi> will serve the turn: I should not much envy it to any of Sir <hi>Robts.</hi> Friends that he thought fit graciously to bestow it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though even this of <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Habit,</hi> if it signified any thing but our <hi>A—'s</hi> skill in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, be not to his purpose in this place; for the question is not here about <hi>Adams</hi> actual Exercise of Government, but actually having a Title to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Government says our <hi>A</hi>— was <hi>due to</hi> Adam <hi>by the Right of Nature,</hi> what is this Right of Nature, a Right Fathers have over their Children by begetting them, <hi>Generatione jus acquiritur parentibus in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beros,</hi> says our <hi>A</hi>— out of <hi>Grotius, O.</hi> 223. The right then follows the begetting as arising from it, so that according to this way of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96077:18"/>
reasoning or distinguishing of our <hi>A—, Adam</hi> as soon as he was Created, had a Title only <hi>in Habit and not in Act,</hi> which in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish is he had actually no Title at all.</p>
               <p n="19">19. To speak less Learnedly and more Intelligibly, one may say of <hi>Adam</hi> he was in a possibility of being <hi>Governour,</hi> since it was possible he might beget Children and thereby acquire that Right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be it what it will to govern them that accrues from thence, but what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection this has with <hi>Adams Creation</hi> to make him say, that <hi>as soon as he was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he was Monarch of the World</hi>; for it may be as well said of <hi>Noah,</hi> that as soon as he was born he was Monarch of the World, since he was in possibility; which in our <hi>A—s</hi> Sense is enough to make a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, <hi>a Monarch in Habit,</hi> to out live all Mankind but his own Posterity, I say what such necessary Connection there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Adams Creation</hi> and his <hi>Right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; so that a <hi>Natural Freedom of Mankind cannot be suppos'd without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the Creation of</hi> Adam, I confess for my part I do not see. Nor how those words <hi>by the appointment, &amp;c.</hi> O. 254. however explain'd, can be put together to make any tollerable Sense at least to Establish this Position, with which they end, <hi>viz. Adam was a King from his Creation,</hi> a King says
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96077:18"/>
our <hi>A— not in Act but in Habit,</hi> i. e. actually no King at all.</p>
               <p n="20">20. I fear I have tired my Readers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by dwelling longer on this passage then the weightiness of any Argument in it, seems to require: but I have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably been ingag'd in it by our <hi>A—s</hi> way of Writing, who hudling several Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together, and that in doubtful and general terms makes such a medly and confusion, that it is impossible to shew his Mistakes without examining the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senses, wherein his Words may be taken, and without seeing how in any of these various Meanings, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist together, and have any Truth in them; for in this present passage before us, how can any one argue against this Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, that <hi>Adam was a King from his Creation,</hi> unless one examin whether the Words <hi>from his Creation,</hi> be to be taken as they may for the time of the Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Government as the foregoing words import, <hi>as soon as he was Created he was Monarch,</hi> or for the cause of it, as he says, p. 11. <hi>Creation made Man Prince of his Posterity.</hi> How farther can one judge of the truth of his being thus King, till one has examined whether King be to be taken, as the words in the beginning of this passage would perswade, on supposition of his <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96077:19"/>
Dominion,</hi> which was by Gods positive Grant, <hi>Monarch of the World by Appointment</hi>; or <hi>King</hi> on Supposition of his <hi>Fatherly Power</hi> over his Off spring which was by Nature, <hi>due by the Right of Nature,</hi> whether I say King be to be taken in both, or one only of these two Senses or in neither of them, but only this, that Creation made him Prince in a way different from both the other; for though this assertion, that <hi>Adam was King from his Creation</hi> be true, in no Sense yet it stands here as an evident conclusion drawn from the preceding words, though in truth it be but a bare assertion joyn'd to other assertions of the same kind, which confidently put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in words of undetermined and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious meaning, look like a sort of arguing, when there is indeed neither Proof nor Connection: A way very familiar with our <hi>A</hi>— of which having given the Reader a taste, here, I shall as much as the Argument will permit me, avoid touching on hereafter, and should not have done it here, were it not to let the World see how Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Matter and Suppositions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proofs put handsomly together in good Words and a plausible Stile, are apt to pass for strong Reason and good Sense, till they come to be look'd into with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96077:20"/>
Grant or Permission, or by Succession from him, the Earth, saith the Psalmist, hath he given to the Children of Men, which shew the Title comes from Fatherhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Before I examin this Argument, and the Text on which it is founded, it is necessary to desire the Reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that our <hi>A</hi>— according to his usual Method, begins in one Sense, and concludes in another, he begins here with <hi>Adams</hi> Propriety, or <hi>Private Dominion,</hi> by <hi>Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and his conclusion is, <hi>which shew the Title comes from Fatherhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. But let us see the Argument, the words of the Text are these; <hi>And God Blessed them, and God said unto them, be Fruitful and Multiply and Replenish the Earth end Subdue it, and have Dominion over the Fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over every Living thing that moveth upon the Earth,</hi> 1 Gen. 28. from whence our A— concludes, <hi>that Adam having here Dominion given him over all Creatures, was thereby the Monarch of the whole World</hi>; whereby must be meant, that either this Grant of God, gave <hi>Adam</hi> Property, or as our <hi>A</hi>— calls it, <hi>Private Dominion</hi> over the Earth, and all inferior or irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and so consequently, that he was thereby <hi>Monarch,</hi> or 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> that it gave him Rule and Dominion over all Earthly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96077:20"/>
Creatures whatsoever, and thereby over his Children, and so he was <hi>Monarch</hi>; for as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has properly worded it, <hi>Adam was made General Lord of all things,</hi> one may very clearly understand him, that he means nothing to be granted to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> here but Property, and therefore he says not one word of <hi>Adams Monarchy.</hi> But our <hi>A</hi>— says, <hi>Adam was hereby Monarch of the World,</hi> which properly speaking, signifies Sovereign Ruler of all the Men in the World, and so <hi>Adam</hi> by this Grant, must be constituted such a Ruler. If our <hi>A</hi>— means otherwise, he might with much clearness, have said, that <hi>Adam was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Proprietor of the whole World.</hi> But he begs your Pardon in that Point, clear, destinct Speaking, not serving every where to his purpose, you must not expect it in him, as in Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> or other such Writers.</p>
               <p n="24">24. In opposition therefore to our <hi>A—s</hi> Doctrin, that <hi>Adam was Monarch of the whole World,</hi> founded on this Place, I shall shew.</p>

In the 26<hi>th Verse</hi> where God declares his intention to give this Dominion, it is plain he meant, that he would make a Species of Creatures, that should have Dominion over the other Species of this Terrestrial Globe, the words are, <hi>and God said let us make Man in our Image after our Likeness, and let them have Dominion over the Fish,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They</hi> then were to have Dominion. Who? even those who were to have the <hi>Image</hi> of God, the Individuals of that Species of <hi>Man</hi> that he was going to make, for that <hi>Them</hi> should signifie <hi>Adam</hi> singly, exclusive of the rest, that should be in the World with him, is against both Scripture and all Reason: And it cannot possibly be made Sense, if <hi>Man</hi> in the former part of the <hi>Verse</hi> do not signifie the same with <hi>Them</hi> in the latter, only <hi>Man</hi> there, as is usual, is taken for the Species, and <hi>them</hi> the individuals of that Spceies, and we have a Reason in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96077:25"/>
the very Text; for God makes him <hi>in his own Image after his own Likeness,</hi> makes him an intellectual Creature and so capable of <hi>Dominion</hi>; for wherein soever else the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God</hi> consisted, the Intellectual Nature was certainly a part of it, and belong'd to the whole Species, and enabled them to have <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Inferior Creatures, and therefore <hi>David</hi> says in the 8<hi>th Psalm</hi> above cited, <hi>thou hast made him little lower then the Angels, thou hast made him to have Dominion,</hi> 'tis not of <hi>Adam</hi> King <hi>David</hi> speaks here, for <hi>Verse</hi> 4.

between</hi> Noah <hi>and his Sons, which Mr.</hi> Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>will have to be granted to them,</hi> 9 Gen. 2. <hi>the Text doth not warrant it,</hi> what <hi>warrant</hi> our <hi>A</hi>— would have when the plain express words of Scripture, not capable of another meaning, will not satisfie him, who pretends to build wholly on Scripture is not easy to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine. The Text says, <hi>God Blessed Noah and his Sons, &amp; said unto them,</hi> i e. as our <hi>A</hi>— would have it <hi>unto him, for</hi> saith he, <hi>although the Sons are there mentioned with Noah in the Blessing, yet it may best be understood, with a Subordination or Benediction in Succession,</hi> O. 211. That indeed is <hi>best,</hi> for our <hi>A</hi>— to be understood, which best serves to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but that truly <hi>may best be understood</hi> by any body else, which best agrees with the plain construction of the words, and arises from the obvious meaning of the place, and then <hi>with Subordination</hi> and <hi>in Succession,</hi> will not <hi>be best understood,</hi> in a Grant of God, where he himself put them not, nor mentions any such Limitation. But yet, our <hi>A</hi>— has reasons, why it <hi>may best be understood so. The Blessing,</hi> says he, in the following words, <hi>might truly be fulfilled, if the Sons either under or after their Father, enjoy'd a Private Dominion, O.</hi> 211. which is to say, that a Grant whose express words give a joynt Title in present; for the Text says into your hands they are delivered,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96077:26"/>
                  <hi>may best be understood with a Subordination</hi> or in <hi>Succession,</hi> because 'tis possible, that <hi>in Subordination,</hi> or <hi>Succession</hi> it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, which is all one as to say, that a Grant of any thing in present possession, <hi>may best be understood</hi> of reversion; because 'tis possible one may live to enjoy it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. If the Grant be indeed to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Sons, who is so kind as to let his Children enjoy it presently in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with him, one may truly say as to the event, one will be as good as the other; but it can never be true, that what the express Words grants in possession and in common, <hi>may best be understood,</hi> to be in reversion. The summ of all his reasoning amounts to this. God did not give to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> the World in common with their Father, because 'twas possible they might enjoy it under, or after him, a very good sort of Argument, against an express Text of Scripture; But God must not be believed, though he speaks it himself, when he says he does any thing, which will not confist with Sr. <hi>Robt's.</hi> Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</p>
               <p n="33">33. For 'tis plain, however he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them, That part of this <hi>Benediction,</hi> as he would have it <hi>in Succession,</hi> must needs be meant to the Sons, and not to <hi>Noah</hi> himself at all, <hi>Be Fruitful and Multiply and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96077:27"/>
Replenish the Earth,</hi> says God, in this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, this part of the Benediction as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the sequel concerned not <hi>Noah</hi> himself at all; for we read not of any Children he had after the Flood, and in the following Chapter, where his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is reckon'd up, there is no mention of any, and so this <hi>Benediction in Succession,</hi> was not to take place, till 350 Years after, and to save our <hi>A—s</hi> imaginary <hi>Monarchy,</hi> the Peopleing of the World, must be defer'd 350 Years; for this part of the <hi>Benediction</hi> cannot be understood with <hi>Subordination,</hi> unless our <hi>A</hi>— will say, that they must ask leave of their Father <hi>Noah,</hi> to lye with their Wives. But in this one point our <hi>A</hi>— is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to himself in all his Discourses, he takes only care there should be Monarchs in the World, but very little that there should be People, and indeed his way of Government is not the way to People the World; For how much Absolute Monarchy helps to fulfil this great and primary Blessing of God Almighty, <hi>be Fruitful and Multiply and Replenish the Earth,</hi> which contains in it the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too of Arts and Siences, and the conveniences of Life, may be seen in those large and rich Countries, which are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under the <hi>Turkish</hi> Govermnent, where are not now to be found 1/3, nay in many,

if not most parts of them 1/30, perhaps I might say not 1/100 of the People, that were formerly, as will easily appear to any one, who will compare the Accounts we have of it at this time, with Ancient History, but this by the by.</p>
               <p n="34">34. The other Parts of this <hi>Benediction</hi> of Grant, are so expressed that they must needs be understood, to belong to <hi>Noahs</hi> Sons, not <hi>with a Subordination</hi> or in <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> but as far forth and equally as to <hi>Noah</hi> himself. <hi>The fear of you, and the dread of you,</hi> says God, <hi>shall be upon every Beast, &amp;c.</hi> Will any Body, but our <hi>A</hi>— say, that the Creatures feared and stood in awe of <hi>Noah</hi> only, and not of his Sons without his leave, or till after his death; And the following words <hi>into your hands they are delivered,</hi> are they to be understood as our <hi>A</hi>— says, if your Father please, or they shall be deliver'd into your hands hereafter. If this be to argue from Scripture, I know not what may not be proved by it, and I can scarce see how much this differs from that <hi>Fiction and Phansy,</hi> or how much a surer Foundation it will prove then the Opinions of <hi>Philosophers and Poets,</hi> which our <hi>A</hi>— so much condemns in his Preface.</p>

The Prejudices of our own ill grounded Opinions, however by us cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Probable,</hi> cannot Authorize us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Scripture contrary to the direct and plain meaning of the Words; I grant, 'tis not probable that <hi>Adams private Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was</hi> here <hi>Abrogated,</hi> because it is more then improbable, for it will ever be proved that ever <hi>Adam</hi> had any such <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Dominion</hi>: and since parallel places of Scripture are most probable to make us know, how they <hi>may be best understood,</hi> there needs but the comparing this Blessing here to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons after the Floud, with that to <hi>Adam</hi> after the Creation, 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. to assure any one that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> no such <hi>Private Dominion.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Probable,</hi> I confess, that <hi>Noah</hi> should have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96077:28"/>
the same Title, the same Property and Dominion after the Floud, that <hi>Adam</hi> had before it. But since <hi>Private Dominion</hi> cannot consist with the Blessing and Grant God gave to him and his Sons in Common, 'tis a sufficient Reason to conclude that <hi>Adam</hi> had none, especially since in the Donation made to him, there is no words that express it, or do in the least favour it; And then let my Reader Judge whether <hi>it may best be understood,</hi> when in the one place there is not one word for it, not to say, what has been above proved, that the Text it self proves the contrary, and in the other, the Words and Sense are directly against it.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96077:29"/>
that in all this Blessing to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, could see nothing but <hi>only</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment of Commons. For as to <hi>Dominion</hi> which our <hi>A</hi>— thinks omitted, <hi>the fear of you and the dread of you,</hi> says God, <hi>shall be upon every Beast,</hi> which I suppose, expresses the <hi>Dominion,</hi> or Superiority was designed Man over the living Creatures, as fully as may be, for in that fear and dread, seems cheifly to consist what was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> over the inferior Animals, who as Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a Monarch as he was, could not make bold with a Lark or a Rabbit to satisfie his hunger, and had the Herbs but in common with the Beasts, as is plain from 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 9. and 30. In the next place, 'tis manifest that in this Blessing to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, Property is not only given in clear words, but in a larger extent then it was to <hi>Adam. Into your hands they are given,</hi> says God, to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, which words if they give not Property, nay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in Possession, 'twill be hard to find words that can, since there is not a way to express a Mans being possessed of any thing more Natural, nor more certain then to say, it is <hi>delivered into his hands.</hi> And verse 3<hi>d</hi> to shew that they had then given them the utmost Property Man is capable of, which is to have a right to destroy any thing by using it, <hi>every moving thing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96077:30"/>
that Liveth,</hi> saith God, <hi>shall be Meat for you,</hi> which was not allowed to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Charter. This our <hi>A</hi>— calls <hi>a Liberty of using them for Food, and only an Enlargment of Commons,</hi> but <hi>no alteration of Property, O.</hi> 211. What other Property Man can have in the Creatures, but the <hi>Liberty of using them,</hi> is hard to be understood. So that if the first Blessing as our <hi>A</hi>— says, <hi>gave Adam Dominion over the Creatures,</hi> and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons gave them <hi>such a Liberty to use them,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> had not; it must needs give them something that <hi>Adam</hi> with all his Sovereignty, wanted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that one would be apt to take for a greater Property; for certainly he has no Absolute Dominion over even the Brutal Part of the Creatures, and the Property he has in them, is very narrow and scanty, who cannot make that use of them, which is permitted to another; should any one, who is Absolute Lord of a Country, have bidden our <hi>A— Subdue the Earth,</hi> and given him Dominion over the Creatures in it, but not have permitted him to have taken a Kid or a Lamb out of the flock, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his hunger, I guess, he would scarce have thought himself Lord or Proprietor of that Land, or the Cattel on it, but would have found the difference between <hi>having Dominion,</hi> which a Shepherd may have,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96077:30"/>
and having full Property as an owner, so that had it been his own <hi>Case,</hi> Sr. <hi>Rob.</hi> I believe would have thought here was an <hi>Alteration,</hi> nay an Enlarging of <hi>Property,</hi> and that <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children had by this Grant, not only Property given them, but such a Property given them in the Creatures, as <hi>Adam</hi> had not, for however in respect of one another, Men may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have Propriety in their distinct por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Creatures, yet in respect of God the maker of Heaven and Earth, who is sole Lord and Proprietor of the whole World, Mans Propriety in the Creatures, is nothing but that <hi>Liberty to use them,</hi> which God has permitted, and so mans Property may be altered and Enlarged as we see it was here, after the Flood, when other uses of them are allowed, which before were not; from all which I suppose, it is clear that neither <hi>Adam</hi> nor <hi>Noah,</hi> had any <hi>Private Dominion,</hi> any Property in the Creatures, exclusive of his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they should successively grow up into need of them, and come to be able to make use of them.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Thus we have examined our <hi>A—s</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for <hi>Adams Monarchy,</hi> founded on the Blessing Pronounced, 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I think 'tis impossible for any sober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to find any else but the setting of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind

This lies so obvious in the plain words, that any one but our <hi>A</hi>—, would have thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have shewn, how these words that seem'd to say the quite contrary, gave <hi>Adam Monarchical Absolute Power</hi> over other Men, or the <hi>Sole Propriety</hi> in all the Creatures, and me thinks in a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this moment, and that whereon he Builds all that follows, he should have done something more then barely cite words which apparently make against him, For, I confess, I cannot see any thing in them, tending to <hi>Adams Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Private Dominion,</hi> but quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And I the less deplore the dulness of my apprehension herein, since I find the Apostle seems to have as little notion of any such <hi>Private Dominion of Adam</hi> as I, when he says, God <hi>gives us all things richly to enjoy,</hi> which he could not do, if it were all given away already, to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Monarchs his Heirs and Successors. To conclude, this Text is so far from proving <hi>Adam</hi> Sole Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that on the contrary, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96077:31"/>
of the Original Community of all things amongst the Sons of Men, which appearing from this Donation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>od, as well as other places of Scripture, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of <hi>Adam,</hi> built upon his <hi>Private Dominion,</hi> must fall, not having any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to support it.</p>
               <p n="41">41. But yet if after all, any one will needs have it so, that by this Donation of God <hi>Adam</hi> was made sole Proprietor of the whole Earth, what will this be to his Sovereignty, and how will it appear that <hi>Propriety</hi> in Land gives a Man Power over the Life of another, or how will the Poffession even of the whole Earth give any one a Sovereign Arbitrary Authority over the Persons of Men; The most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing to be said, is, that he that is Proprietor of the whole World may deny all the rest of Mankind Food, and so at his Pleasure starve them, if they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Sovereignty and obey his Will. If this were true, it would be a good Argument to prove that there was never any such <hi>Property,</hi> that God never gave any such <hi>Private Dominion,</hi> since it is more reasonable to think that God who bid Mankind increase and multiply, should rather himself give them all a Right to make use of the Food and Raiment and other Conveniences of Life, the Materials
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96077:32"/>
whereof he had so plentifully provided for them, then to make them depend upon the Will of a Man for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, who should have Power to destroy them all when he pleased, and who being no better then other Men, was in Succession likelyer by want and the dependance of a scanty Fortune, to tye them to hard Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then by liberal Allowance of the Conveniences of Life promote the great Design of God, <hi>Increase</hi> and <hi>Multiply,</hi> he that doubts this, let him look into the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarchies of the World, and see what becomes of the Conveniences of Life and the Multitudes of People.</p>
               <p n="42">42. But we know God hath not left one Man so to the Mercy of another, that he may starve him if he please, God the Lord and Father of all has given no one of his Children such a Property in his peculiar Portion of the things of this World, but that he has given his needy Brother a Right in the Surplussage of his Goods, so that it cannot justly be denyed him when his pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing wants call for it. And therefore no Man could ever have a just Power over the Life of another by Right of Property in Land or Possessions, since 'twould always be a Sin in any Man of Estate to let his Brother perish for want of affording him Relief out of his Plenty;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96077:32"/>
For as <hi>Iustice</hi> gives every Man a Title to the product of his honest Industry, and the fair Acquisitions of his Ancestors des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to him, so <hi>Charity</hi> gives every Man a Title to so much out of anothers Plenty as will keep him from extream want, where he has no means to subsist otherwise; And a Man can no more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make use of anothers necessity, to force him to become his Vassal by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that Relief, God requires him to afford to the wants of his Brother, then he that has more strength can seize upon a weaker, master him to his Obedience, and with a Dagger at his Throat offer him Death or Slavery.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Should any one make so perverse an use of Gods Blessings powred on him with a liberal Hand, should any one be Cruel and Uncharitable to that extremity, yet all this would not prove that Propriety in Land, even in this Case, gave any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Persons of Men, but only that Compact might; since the Authority of the Rich Proprietor and the Subjection of the Needy Beggar began not from the Possession of the Lord, but the Consent of the poor Man who prefer'd being his Subject to starving. And the Man he thus submits to, can pretend to no more Power over him then he has consented to, upon

Compact, upon this ground a Mans having his Stores filled in a time of Scarcity, having Money in his Pocket, being in a Vessel at Sea, being able to Swim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may as well be the Foundation of Rule and Dominion, as being Possessor of all the Land in the World, any of these being sufficient to enable me to save a Mans Life who would perish if such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance were denyed him; And any thing by this Rule that may be an occasion of working upon anothers necessity to save his Life or any thing dear to him, at the rate of his Freedom may be made a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Sovereignty as well as Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; From all which it is clear that tho God should have given <hi>Adam Private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> yet that <hi>Private Dominion</hi> could give him no <hi>Sovereignty</hi>; But we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sufficiently proved that God gave him no <hi>Private Dominion.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96077:34"/>
Force of the Text in hand. The words are the Curse of God upon the Woman, for having been the first and forwardest in the Disobedience, and if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the occasion of what God says here to our first Parents, that he was Denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Judgment, and declaring his Wrath against them both, for their Disobedience, we cannot suppose that this was the time, wherein God was granting <hi>Adam</hi> Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and Priviledges, investing him with Dignity and Authority, Elevating him to Dominion and Monarchy; For though as a helper in the Temptation, as well as a Partner in the Transgression, <hi>Eve</hi> was laid below him, and so he had accidentally a Superiority over her, for her greater Punishment, yet he too had his share in the fall, as well as the sin, and was laid lower, as may be seen in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verses, and 'twould be hard to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin that God in the same Breath, should make him Universal <hi>Monarch</hi> over all Mankind, and a day labourer for his Life.

this be <hi>the Original Grant of Government,</hi> as our <hi>A</hi>— tells us, and <hi>Adam</hi> was now made Monarch, whatever Sr. <hi>Rob.</hi> would have him, 'tis plain, God made him but a very poor Monarch, such an one, as our <hi>A</hi>— himself would have counted it no great Priviledge to be, God sets him to work for his living, and seems rather to give him a Spade into his hand, to Subdue the Earth, then a Scepter to Rule over its Inhabitants. <hi>In the Sweat of thy Face, thou shalt eat thy Bread,</hi> says God to him <hi>ver.</hi> 19. This was unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, may it perhaps be answered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was yet without Subjects, and had no Body to work for him, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards living as he did above 900 Years, he might have People enough, whom he might command to work for him; no says God, not only whilst thou art without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help, save thy Wife, but as long as thou livest, shalt thou live by thy Labour. <hi>In the Sweat of thy Face, shalt thou eat thy Bread, till thou return unto the Ground, for out of it wast thou taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return, v.</hi> 19. It will perhaps be answered again, in Favour of our <hi>A</hi>—, that these Words are not spoken Personally to <hi>Adam,</hi> but in him, as their Representative to all Mankind, this being a Curse upon Mankind, because of the fall.</p>

we will take them as they were directed in particular to her, or in her, as a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative to all other Women, they will at most concern the Female Sex only, and import no more but that subjection they should ordinarily be in to their Husbands, but there is here no more Law to oblige a Woman to such a Subjection, if the Circumstances either of her Condition or Contract with her Husband should exempt her from it, then there is that she should bring forth her Children in Sorrow and Pain, if there could be found a Remedy for it, which is also a part of the same Curse upon her, for the whole Verse runs thus, <hi>unto the Woman he said, I will greatly Multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; In sorrow thou shall bring forth Children, and thy desire shall be to thy Husband, and he shall rule over thee.</hi> 'Twould I think have been a hard matter for any Body, but our <hi>A</hi>— to have found out a Grant of <hi>Monarchical Government to Adam</hi> in these Words, which were neither spoke to, nor of him, neither will any one, I suppose, by these Words, think the weaker Sex, as by a Law so Subjected to the Curse contained in them, that 'tis their duty, not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid it.

Pains, God threatens her here with, or that either of our Queens <hi>Mary</hi> or <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had they Married any of their Subjects had been by this Text, put into a Political Subjection to him, or that he thereby should have had <hi>Monarchical Rule</hi> over her, God in this Text, gives not that I see any Authority to <hi>Adam</hi> over <hi>Eve,</hi> or Men over their Wives, but only foretels what should be the Womans Lot, how by his Providence he would order it so, that she should be Subject to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as we see that generally the Laws of Mankind and Customs of Nations, have ordered it so, and there is, I grant, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Nature for it.</p>
               <p n="48">48.

               <p>But if these words here spoke to <hi>Eve</hi> must needs be understood as a Law to bind her and all other Women to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, it can be no other Subjection then what every Wife owes her Husband, and then if this be the <hi>Original Grant of Government</hi> and the <hi>Foundation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchial Power,</hi> there will be as many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs as there are Husbands: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these words give any Power to <hi>Adam,</hi>

This I am sure: If our <hi>A</hi>— will have this Text to be a <hi>Grant, the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grant of Government,</hi> political Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he ought to have proved it by some better Arguments then by barely Saying, that <hi>thy desire shall be unto thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> was a Law whereby <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>all that should come of her,</hi> were subjected to the Absolute Monarchical Power of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and his Heirs. <hi>Thy desire shall be to thy Husband,</hi> is too doubtful an Expression, of whose signification Interpreters are not agreed, to build so confidently on, and in a Matter of such moment and so great and general Concernment; But our <hi>A</hi>— according to his way of Writing, having once named the Text, concludes presently without any more ado, that the meaning is, as he would have it, let the Words <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> be but found in the Text or Margent, and it immediately signifies the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96077:37"/>
Duty of a Subject to his Prince, and the Relation is changed, and though God says <hi>Husband,</hi> Sr. <hi>Robt.</hi> will have it <hi>King, Adam</hi> has presently <hi>Absolute Monarchial Power</hi> over <hi>Eve,</hi> and not only <hi>Eve</hi> but <hi>all that should come of her,</hi> though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture says not a word of it, nor our <hi>A</hi>— a word to prove it. But <hi>Adam</hi> must for all that be an Absolute Monarch, and so to the end of the Chapter quite down to <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. And here I leave my Reader to consider whether my bare Saying, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering any Reasons to evince it, that this Text gave not <hi>Adam</hi> that <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarchial Power,</hi> our <hi>A</hi>— supposes, be not as sufficient to destroy that Power as his bare Assertion is to Establish it, since the Text mentions neither <hi>Prince</hi> nor <hi>People,</hi> speaks nothing of <hi>Absolute</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchial Power,</hi> but the Subjection of <hi>Eve,</hi> a Wife to her <hi>Husband.</hi> And he that would treat our <hi>A</hi>— so, although he would make a short and sufficient answer to the greatest part of the Grounds he proceeds on, and abundantly confute them by barely denying; It being a sufficient answer to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions without proof to deny them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving a Reason, and therefore should I have said nothing but barely deny'd that by this Text <hi>the Supream Power was setled and founded by God himself, in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96077:37"/>
the Fatherhood, Limited to Monarchy,</hi> and <hi>that to Adams Person and Heirs,</hi> all which our <hi>A</hi>— notably concludes from these Words, as may be seen in the same Page <hi>O.</hi> 244. and desired any sober Man, to have read the Text, and considered to whom and on what occasion it was spoken, he would no doubt have wondered how our <hi>A</hi>—found out <hi>Monarchical Absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> in it, had he not had an exceeding good Faculty to find it himself, where he could not shew it others; And thus we have examined the two places of Scripture, all that I remember our <hi>A</hi>— brings to prove <hi>Adams Sovereignty,</hi> that <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which he says, <hi>it was Gods Ordinance should be unlimitted in Adam, and as large as all the Acts of his Will. O.</hi> 254, viz. 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. and 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. one whereof signifies only the Subjection of the inferior Ranks of Creatures to Mankind, and the other the Subjection that is due from a Wife to her Husband, both far enough from that which Subjects owe the Governors of Political Societies.</p>

And in the same page. <hi>This Subjection of Children being the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Regal Authority,</hi> &amp;c. This being as one would think by his so frequent mentioning it the main basis of all his Frame, we may well expect clear and evident Reason for it, since he lays it down as a position necessary to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that <hi>every Man that is born is so far from being Free, that by his very Birth he becomes a Subject of him that begets him,</hi> O. 156. So that <hi>Adam</hi> being the only Man Created, and all ever since being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96077:38"/>
no body has been born free: If we ask how <hi>Adam</hi> comes by this Power over his Children, he tells us here 'tis by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting them: And so again, <hi>O.</hi> 223. <hi>This natural Dominion of</hi> Adam, says he, <hi>may be proved out of</hi> Grotius <hi>himself, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that</hi> generatione jus acquiritur paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="51">51. <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us not here how far this <hi>jus in liberos,</hi> this Power of Parents over their Children extends, but our <hi>A</hi>— al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very clear in the point assures us, 'tis <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> and like that of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarchs over their Slaves, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power of Life and Death: He that should demand of him how, or for what Reason, it is, that begetting a Child gives the Father such an Absolute Power over him, will find him answer nothing, we are to take his word for this as well as several other things, and by that the Laws of Nature and the Constitutions of Government must stand and fall; Had he been an Absolute Monarch, this way of talking might have suited well enough, <hi>pro ratione voluntas,</hi> may there be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But 'tis but an ill way of pleading for

Absolute Monarchy, and Sr. <hi>Robts.</hi> bare Sayings will scarce Establish it, one slaves Opinion without proof is not of weight enough to dispose of the Liberty and Fortunes of all Mankind; If all Men are not as I think they are naturally equal, I'm sure all Slaves are, and then I may without presumption oppose my single Opinion to his, and be as confident that my Saying, that begetting of Children makes them not Slaves to their Fathers, sets all Mankind Free, as his affirming the contrary makes them all Slaves. But that this position, which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all their Doctrin, who would have Monarchy to be <hi>Iure divino,</hi> may have all fair play, let us hear what reasons others give for it, since our <hi>A</hi>— offers none.</p>
               <p n="52">52. The Argument, I have heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make use of, to prove that Fathers by begetting them, come by an Absolute Power over their Children is this; That <hi>Fathers have a Power over the Lives of their Children, because they give them Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is the only proof it is capable of, since there can be no reason, why naturally one Man should have any claim or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Right over that in another, which was never his, which he bestowed not, but was received from the bounty of another. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. I answer that every one
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96077:39"/>
who gives an other any thing, has not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thereby a Right to take it away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; But 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. they who say the <hi>Father</hi> gives Life to his Children, are so dazled with the thoughts of Monarchy that they do not, as they ought, remember God who is <hi>the Author and giver of Life, 'tis in him alone we live, move and have our Being.</hi> How can he be thought to give Life to another that knows not wherein his own Life consists, Philosophers are at a loss about it after their most diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; And Anatomists after their whole Lives and Studies spent in dissections and diligent examining the Bodies of Men, confess their Ignorance in the Structure and Use of Many parts of Mans Body, and in that Operation wherein Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the whole; And doth the rude Plough Man or the more Ignorant Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Frame or Fashion such an admirable Engine as this is, and then put Life and Sense into it; can any Mansay, he formed the parts that are necessary to the Life of his Child, or can he suppose himself to give the Life, and yet not know what Subject is fit to receive it, nor what Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Organs are necessary for its Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Preservation?</p>
               <p n="53">53. To give Life to that which has yet no being is to Frame and make a living

Creature, fashion the parts and mould and suit them to their uses, and having proportion'd and fitted them together to put into them a living Soul. He that could do this might indeed have some pretence to destroy his own Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But is there any one so bold, that dares thus far Arrogate to himself the Incomprehensible Works of the Almighty? who alone did at first and continues still to make a live Soul, he alone can breath in the Breath of Life. If any one thinks himself an Artist at this, let him number up the parts of his Childs Body which he hath made, tell me their Uses and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and when the living and rational Soul began to Inhabit, this curious Structure when Sense began, and how this Engine he has framed Thinks and Reasons; If he made it, let him when it is out of order mend it, at least tell wherein the defects lie? <hi>shall he that made the Eye not see,</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist, Psalm.</hi> 94. 9. See these Mens Vanities: The structure of one part is sufficient to convince us of an All wise Contriver, and he has so visible a claim to us as his Workmanship, that one of the ordinary Apellations of God in Scripture is, <hi>God our Maker</hi> and <hi>the Lord our Maker.</hi> And therefore though our <hi>A</hi>— for the magnifying his <hi>Fatherhood</hi> be

pleased to say, <hi>O.</hi> 159. <hi>That even the Power which God himself exerciseth over Mankind is by Right of Fatherhood,</hi> yet this Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is such an one as utterly excludes all pretence of Title in earthly Parents; for he is <hi>King</hi> because he is indeed Maker of us all, which no Parents can pretend to be of their Children.</p>
               <p n="54">54. But had Men Skill and Power to make their Children, 'tis not so slight a piece of Wormanship, that it can be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined they could make them without designing it, what Father of a thousand when he begets a Child thinks farther then the satisfying his present Appetite, God in his infinite Wisdom has put strong desires of Copulation into the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, thereby to continue the race of Mankind, which he doth most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without the intention, and often against the Consent and Will of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter. And indeed those who desire and design Children, are but the occasions of their being, and when they design and wish to beget them, do little more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their making then <hi>Deucalion</hi> and his Wife in the Fable did towards the making of Mankind, by throwing Pebles over their Heads.</p>

But grant that the Parents made their Children, gave them Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that hence there followed an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power. This would give the <hi>Father</hi> but a joynt Dominion with the <hi>Mother</hi> over them; for no body can deny but that the Woman hath an equal share, if not the greater, as nourishing the Child a long time in her own Body out of her own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. There it is fashion'd, and from her it receives the Materials and Principles of its Constitution; And it is so hard to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin the rational Soul should presently Inhabit the yet unformed Embrio, as soon as the Father has done his part in the Act of Generation, that if it must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to derive any thing from the Parents, it must certainly owe most to the Mother: But be that as it will, the Mother cannot be denied an equal share in begetting of the Child, and so the Absolute Authority of the <hi>Father</hi> will not arise from hence, our <hi>A</hi>— indeed is of another mind; for he says, <hi>We know that God at the Creation gave the Sovereignty to the Man over the Woman, as being the Nobler and Principal Agent in Generation,</hi> O. 172. I remember not this in my Bible, and when the place is brought where God <hi>at the Creation</hi> gave the Sovereignty to Man over the Woman, and that for this Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <hi>he is the Nobler and Principal Agent in Generation,</hi> it will be time enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and answer it: But it is no new thing for our <hi>A</hi>— to tell us his own Phancies for certain and divine Truths, though there be often a great deal of difference between his and divine Revelations; for God in the Scripture says, <hi>his Father and his Mother that begot him.</hi>

They who alledge the Practice of Mankind, for <hi>exposing or selling</hi> their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as a Proof of their Power over them, are with Sr. <hi>Robt.</hi> happy Arguers and cannot but recommend their Opinion by founding it on the most shameful Action and most unnatural Murder, humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of. The dens of Lions and Nurseries of Wolves know no such Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as this; These Savage Inhabitants of the Desart obey God and Nature, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender and careful of their Off-spring; They will Hunt, Watch, Fight and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Starve for the Preservation of their Young, never part with them, never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them till they are able to shift for themselves; And is it the priviledge of Man alone to act more contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then the Wild and most Untamed Part of the Creation? Doth God forbid us under the severest Penalty, that of Death, to take away the Life of any Man,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96077:42"/>
a Stranger, and upon Provocation? and does he permit us to destroy those he has given us the Charge and Care of, and by the dictates of Nature and Reason as well as his reveal'd Command, requires us to preserve? He has in all the parts of the Creation taken a peculiar care to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and continue the several Species of Creatures, and makes the Individuals act so strongly to this end, that they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neglect their own private good for it, and seem to forget that general Rule which Nature teaches all things of self Preservation and the Preservation of their Young, as the strongest Principle in them over rules the Constitution of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Natures; Thus we see when their Young stand in need of it, the timerous come Valiant, the Feirce and Savage Kind, and the Ravenous Tender and Liberal.</p>

Thus far can the busie mind of Man, carry him to a Brutality below the level of Beasts; when he quits his reason, which places him almost equal to Angels, nor can it be otherwise in a Creature, whose thoughts are more then the Sands, and wider then the Ocean, where fancy and passion must needs run him into strange courses, if reason, which is the only Star and Compass, be not that he Steers by; the imagination is always restless and suggests variety of thoughts, and the will, reason being laid aside, is ready for every
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96077:43"/>
extravagant project; And in this State, he that goes farthest out of the way, is thought fittest to lead, and is sure of most followers; And when Fashion hath once Established, what Folly or Craft began, Custom makes it Sacred, and 'twill be thought impudence or madness, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict or question it. He that will impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially survey the World, will find so much of the Religion, Government and Manners of the Nations of the World, brought in, and continued by these means, that he will have but little Reverence for the Practices, which are in Fashion amongst Men, and will have reason to think, that the Woods and Forests, where the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional untaught Inhabitants keep right by following nature, are fitter to give us Rules, then Cities and Palaces, where those that call themselves civil and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, go out of their way, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Example.</p>

Let it be, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power, that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them, if this proves a right to do so, we may by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96077:43"/>
of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have their Principal Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of nature, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the increase of Mankind, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the Species in the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and the distinction of Families, with the security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto.</p>
               <p n="60">60. In confirmation of this Natural Authority of the Father, our <hi>A</hi>— brings a Lame Proof, from the positive command of God in Scripture; His Words are, <hi>to confirm the natural Right of Regal Power, we find in the Decalogue, that the Law which injoyns Obedience to Kings, is delivered in the Term, Honour thy Father,</hi> p. 23. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as many confefs, that Government only in the Abstract, is the Ordinance of God, they are not able to prove any such Ordinance in the Scripture, but only in the Fatherly Power, and therefore we find the Commandment that injoyns Obedience, to Superiors, given in the Terms, Honour thy Father; so that not only the Power and Right of Government, but the Form of the Power Governing, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son having the Power, are all the Ordinances of God. The first Father had not only simply Power, but Power Monarchical, as he was Father immediately from God, O.</hi> 254. To the same purpose, the same Law is

cited by our <hi>A</hi>— in several other places, and just after the same Fashion, that is, <hi>and Mother,</hi> as Apocriphal Words, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways left out; a great Argument of our <hi>A—s</hi> ingenuity, and the goodness of his Cause, which required in its Defender, Zeal to a degree of warmth, able to warp the Sacred Rule of the Word of God, to make it comply with his present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, a way of proceeding, not unusual to those, who imbrace not truths, because Reason and Revelation offers them, but espouse Tenets and Parties, for ends dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Truth, and then resolve at any rate to defend them; And so do with the Words and Sense of Authors, they would fit to their purpose, just as <hi>Procustes</hi> did with his guests, top or stretch them, as may best fit them to the size of their Notions, and they always prove like those, so served, deformed and useless.</p>
               <p n="61">61. For had our <hi>A</hi>— set down this command without Garbling, as God gave it, and joyned <hi>Mother</hi> to Father, every Reader would have seen, that it had made directly against him, and that it was so far from Establishing the <hi>Monarchical Power of the Father,</hi> that it set up the <hi>Mother</hi> equal with him, and injoyn'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was due in common, to both Father and Mother; for that is the

One would wonder then how our <hi>A</hi>— infers from the 5<hi>th</hi> Commandment, that all <hi>Power was Originally in the Father.</hi> How he finds <hi>Monarchical Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, settled and fixed by the Commandment, Honour thy Father</hi> and thy Mother; If all the honour due by the Commandments, be it what it will, be the only right of the <hi>Father,</hi> because he, as our <hi>A</hi>— says, <hi>has the Sovereignty over the Woman, as being the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and Principal Agent in Generation,</hi> why did God afterwards all along joyn the <hi>Mother</hi> with him, to share in this honour, can the Father by this Sovereignty of his discharge the Child from Paying this <hi>Honour</hi> to his <hi>Mother.</hi> The Scripture gave no such License to the Jews, and yet there were often Breaches wide enough betwixt Husband and Wife, even to divorce and seperation, and I think no Body will say, a Child may withhold honour from his Mother, or as the Scripture Terms it, <hi>set light by her,</hi> though his Father should command him to do so, no more then the Mother could dispense with him, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to <hi>Honour</hi> his Father, whereby 'tis plain, that this command of God, gives the Father no Sovereignty, no Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</p>
               <p n="63">63. I agree with our <hi>A</hi>—, that the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to this <hi>Honour,</hi> is vested in the Parents

by nature, and is a right which accrews to them, by their having begotten their Children, and God by many positive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations has confirm'd it to them, I also allow our <hi>A—s</hi> Rule, <hi>that in Grants and Gifts, that have their Original from God and Nature, as the Power of the Father,</hi> let me add and <hi>Mother,</hi> for whom God hath joyned together, let no Man put a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>no inferior Power of Men can limit, nor make any Law of Prescription against them, O.</hi> 158. So that the Mother having by this Law of God, a right to Honour from her Children, which is not Subject to the Will of her Husband, we see this <hi>Absolute Monarchical Power of the Father,</hi> can neither be founded on it, nor consist with it; And he has a Power very far from <hi>Monarchical,</hi> very far from that Absoluteness our <hi>A</hi>— contends for, when another has over his Subjects the same Power he hath, and by the same Title, and therefore he cannot forebear saying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that <hi>he cannot see how any Mans Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren can be free from Subjection to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, p.</hi> 12. which in common Speech, I think signifies <hi>Mother</hi> as well as <hi>Father,</hi> or if <hi>Parents</hi> here signifies only <hi>Father,</hi> 'tis the first time I ever yet knew it to do so, and by such an use of Words, one may say any thing.</p>
               <p n="64">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:96077:46"/>64. By our <hi>A—s</hi> Doctrin, the Father having Absolute jurisdiction over his Children, has also the same over their Issue, and the consequence is good, were it true, that the Father had such a Power, and yet I ask our <hi>A</hi>— whether the Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Sovereignty, could discharge the Grand-Child from Paying to his Father, the honour due to him by the 5<hi>th</hi> Commandment; If the Grand-Father, hath by <hi>right of Fatherhood,</hi> Sole Sovereign Power in him, and by <hi>Honour thy Father</hi> be commanded, that Obedience which is due to the Sovereign, 'tis certain the Grand-Father might dispence with the Grand-Sons Honouring his Father, which since 'tis evident in common Sense, he cannot 'tis evident <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> cannot mean an Absolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to a Sovereign Power, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else. The right therefore which Parents have by nature, and which is confirmed to them by the 5<hi>th</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be that Political Dominion, which our <hi>A</hi>— would derive from it, for that being in every civil Society, Supream somewhere, can discharge any Subject, from any Political Obedience, to any one of his fellow Subjects. But what Law of the Magistrate, can give a Child liberty, not to <hi>Honour his Father and Mother</hi>; 'tis an eternal Law, annex'd purely to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96077:47"/>
the relation of Parents and Children, and so contains nothing of the Magistrates Power in it, nor is Subjected to it.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Our <hi>A</hi>— says, <hi>God hath given to a Father, a right or liberty to Alien his Power over his Children to any other, O:</hi> 155. I doubt whether he can <hi>Alien,</hi> wholly the right of <hi>Honour</hi> that is due from them; But be that as it will, this I am sure, he cannot <hi>Alien,</hi> and retain the same Power, if therefore the Magistrates Sovereignty, be as our <hi>A</hi>— would have it, <hi>nothing but the Authority of a Supream Father, p.</hi> 23. 'tis unavoidable, that if the Magistrate hath all this Paternal Right as he must have, if <hi>Fatherhood</hi> be the Fountain of all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then the Subjects though Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, can have no Power over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, no right to honour from them; for it cannot be all in anothers hands, and a part remain with them, so that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our <hi>A—s</hi> own Doctrin, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> cannot possibly be understood of Political Subjection and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, since the Laws both in the Old and New Testament, that commanded Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Honour and obey their Parents,</hi> were given to such, whose Fathers were under such Government, and fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with them in Political Societies, and to have bid them <hi>Honour and obey their Parents</hi> in our <hi>A—s</hi> Sense, had been to bid them be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96077:47"/>
Subjects to those, who had no Title to it, the right to Obedience from Subjects, being all vested in another, and instead of teaching Obedience, this had been to foment Sedition, by setting up Powers that were not; If therefore this command, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> concern Political Dominion, it directly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws our <hi>A—s</hi> Monarchy, since it being to be paid by every Child to his Father, even in Society, every Father must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily have Political Dominion, and there will be as many Sovereigns, as there are Fathers, besides that the Mother too hath her Title, which destroys the Sovereignty of one Supream Monarch. But if <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> mean something distinct from Political Power, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily it must, it is besides our <hi>A—s</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and serves nothing to his purpose.</p>
               <p n="66">66. <hi>The Law that enjoyns Obedience to Kings is delivered,</hi> says our A—, <hi>in the Terms, Honour thy Father, as if all Power were Originally in the Father, O.</hi> 254. And that Law is also delivered, say I, in the Terms, <hi>Honour thy Mother,</hi> as if all Power were Originally in the Mother, I appeal whether the Argument be not as good on one side as the other, <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> being joyned all along in the Old and New Testament, where Honour or Obedience is injoyn'd Children, again
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96077:48"/>
our <hi>A</hi>— tell us, <hi>O.</hi> 254. <hi>that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Honour thy Father gives the right to govern, and makes the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Monarchical.</hi> To which I answer, that, if by <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> be meant Obedience to the Political Power of the Magistrate, it concerns not any duty we owe to our Natural Fathers who are Subjects, because they by our <hi>A—s</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, are divested of all that Power, it being placed wholly in the Prince, and so being equally Subjects and Slaves with their Children, can have no right by that Title, to any such <hi>Honour or Obedience</hi> as contains in it Political Subjection; If <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother</hi> signifies the duty we owe our Natural Parents, as by our Saviours Interpretation, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 4. and all the other mention'd places, 'tis plain it does, then it cannot concern Political Obedience, but a duty that is owing to Persons, who have no Title to Sovereignty, nor any Political Authority, as Magistrates over Subjects, for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a private Father, and a Title to Obedience, due to the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, are things inconsistent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this command, which must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend the Persons of our Natural Fathers, must mean a duty we owe them distinct from our Obedience to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96077:48"/>
and from which the most Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power of Princes cannot absolve us, what this duty is, we shall in its due place examin.</p>
               <p n="67">67. And thus we have at last got through all that in our <hi>A</hi>— looks like an Argument for that <hi>Absolute unlimited Sovereginty</hi> described, Sect. 8. which he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses in <hi>Adam</hi> so that Mankind ever since have all been born <hi>slaves,</hi> without any Title to Freedom; But if <hi>Creation</hi> which gave nothing but a Being, <hi>made</hi> not <hi>Adam Prince of his Posterity</hi>; If <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 1. 28. was not constituted Lord of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, nor had a <hi>Private Dominion</hi> given him exclusive of his Children, but only a Right and Power over the Earth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creatures in common with the Children of Men; If also <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. God gave not any Political Power to <hi>Adam</hi> over his Wife and Children, but only Subjected <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> as a punishment, or foretold the Subjection of the weaker Sex, in the ordering the common concernments of their Families, but gave not thereby to <hi>Adam,</hi> as to the Husband Power of Life and Death, which necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Magistrate; if Fathers by begetting their Children acquire no such Power over them, and if the command <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother,</hi> give it not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96077:49"/>
but only enjoyns a duty owing to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents equally, whether Subjects or not, and to the <hi>Mother</hi> as well as the <hi>Father</hi>; If all this be so as I think, by what has been said, is very evident, then Man hás a <hi>Natural Freedom,</hi> notwithstanding all our <hi>A</hi>— confidently says to the contrary, since all that share in the same common Nature, Faculties and Powers are in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equal, and ought to partake in the same common Rights and Priviledges, till the manifest appointment of God, who is <hi>Lord over all Blessed for ever,</hi> can be produced to shew any Particular Persons Supremacy, or a Mans own Consent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects him to a Superior. This is so plain that our <hi>A</hi>— confesses, that Sr. <hi>Iohn Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Blacwood and Barclay the great vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators of the Right of Kings,</hi> could not deny it, but <hi>admit with one consent the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty and Equality of Mankind,</hi> for a Truth unquestionable. And our <hi>A</hi>— hath been so far from producing any thing, that may make good his great Position, that <hi>Adam was Absolute Monarch,</hi> and so <hi>Men are not Naturally free,</hi> that even his own Proofs make against him, so that to use is own way of Arguing. <hi>This first erroneous Principle failing, the whole Fabrick of this vast engine</hi> of Absolute Power and Tyranny, <hi>drops down of it self,</hi> and there

needs no more to be said in answer to all that he builds upon, so false and frail a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>

But to save others the pains, were there any need, he is not sparing himself to shew by his own contradictions, the weakness of his own Doctrins, <hi>Adams</hi> Absolute and Sole Dominion is that which he is every where full of, and all along builds on, and yet he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>that as Adam was Lord of his Children, so his Children under him had a Command and Power over their own Children.</hi> The unlimited and undivided Sovereginty of <hi>Adams Fatherhood,</hi> by our <hi>A—s</hi> computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, stood but a little while, only during the first Generation, but as soon as he had Grand-Children, Sr. <hi>Rob.</hi> could give but a very ill account of it, <hi>Adam</hi> as Father of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96077:50"/>
yet they are Absolute over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the same Title, no says our <hi>A—, Adams Children under him, had Power over their own Children, but still with Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the the first Parent.</hi> A good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction that sounds well, and 'tis pitty it signifies nothing, nor can be reconciled with our <hi>A—s</hi> Words, I readily grant that supposing <hi>Adams Absolute Power</hi> over his Posterity, any of his Children might have from him a delegated, and so a <hi>Subordinate</hi> Power, over a part or all the rest; But that cannot be the Power our <hi>A</hi>— speaks of here, it is not a Power by Grant and Commission, but the Natural Paternal Power, he supposes a Father to have over his Children; for 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, he says as <hi>Adam was Lord of his Children, so his Children under him, had a Power over their own Children</hi>; They were then Lords over their own Children after the same manner, and by the same Title that <hi>Adam</hi> was, <hi>i. e.</hi> by right of Generation, by right of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi>; 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 'tis plain he means the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power of Fathers, because he limits it to be only <hi>over their own Children,</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated Power, has no such limitation, as only over their own Children, it might be over others, as well as their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, If it were a delegated Power, it must appear in Scripture, but there is no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96077:50"/>
ground in Scripture to affirm that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children, had any other Power over theirs, then what they naturally had as Fathers.</p>
               <p n="69">69. But that he means here Paternal Power, and no other, is past doubt from the Inference he makes in those words immediately following, <hi>I see not then how the Children of</hi> Adam <hi>or of any Man else can be free from Subjection to their Parents,</hi> whereby it appears that the <hi>Power</hi> on one side and the <hi>Subjection</hi> on the other, our <hi>A</hi>— here speaks of, is that <hi>Natural Power</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> between Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for that which every Mans Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren owed could be no other, and that our <hi>A</hi>— always affirms to be absolute and unlimited. This natural <hi>Power</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents over their Children, <hi>Adam</hi> had over his Posterity, says our <hi>A</hi>—, and this <hi>Power</hi> of Parents over their Children, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had over theirs in his Life time, says our <hi>A</hi>— also; so that <hi>Adam</hi> by a natural Right of Father, had an absolute, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power over all his Posterity, and at the same time his Children had by the same Right absolute unlimited Power over theirs, here then are two absolute unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Powers existing together, which I would have any body reconcile one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or to common Sense; for the <hi>Salvo,</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:96077:51"/>
he has put in of <hi>Subordination,</hi> makes it more absurd: To have one <hi>Absolute, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,</hi> nay <hi>Vnlimitable Power</hi> in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to another, is so manifest a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that nothing can be more, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam is Absolute Prince with the Vnlimited Authority of Fatherhood over all his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; All his Posterity are then absolutely his Subjects, and, as our <hi>A</hi>— says, his <hi>Slaves,</hi> Children and Grand Children are equally in this State of Subjection and Slavery, and yet says our <hi>A—, the Children of</hi> Adam <hi>have paternal,</hi> i. e. Absolute, Unlimited <hi>Power over their own Children,</hi> which in plain <hi>English</hi> is, they are Slaves and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Princes at the same time, and in the same Government, and one part of the Subjects have an Absolute Unlimited Power over the other by the natural Right of Parentage.</p>
               <p n="70">70. If any one will suppose in favour of our <hi>A</hi>— that he here meant that Parents who are in Subjection themselves to the Absolute Authority of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have yet some Power over their Children: I confess he is something near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the truth, but he will not at all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by help our <hi>A</hi>—; for he no where speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Paternal Power, but as an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Unlimited Authority, cannot be suppos'd to understand any thing else
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96077:51"/>
here, unless he himself had limited it and shewed how far it reach'd: And that he means here paternal Authority in that large Extent is plain from the immediate following words; <hi>This Subjection of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being,</hi> says he, <hi>the Fountain of all Regal Authority,</hi> p. 12. <hi>The Subjection,</hi> then that in the former Line, he says, <hi>every Man is in to his Parents,</hi> and consequently what <hi>Adam's</hi> Grand Children were in to their Parents, was that which was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all <hi>Regal Authority, i. e.</hi> According to our <hi>A—s Absolute, Vnlimitable</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thus <hi>Adams</hi>

                  </gap> Children had <hi>Regal Authority</hi> over their Children, whilst they themselves were Subjects to their Father, and Fellow Subjects with their Children; But let him mean as he pleases, 'tis plain he allows <hi>Adams Children to have Paternal Power,</hi> p. 12. as all other Fathers to have <hi>Paternal Power over their Children,</hi> O. 156. From whence one of these two things will necessarily follow, that, either <hi>Adams</hi> Children even in his life time, had, and so all other Fathers have, as he Phrases it, <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>By Right of Fatherhood Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their Children,</hi> or else, that <hi>Adam by Right of Fatherhood had not Royal Authority:</hi> For it must be that <hi>Paternal Power</hi> does, or does not, give <hi>Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to them that have it: If it does
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96077:52"/>
not, then <hi>Adam</hi> could not be Sovereign by this Title, nor any body else, and then there is an end of all our <hi>A</hi>'s Politics at once; If it does give <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> then every one that has <hi>Paternal Power</hi> has <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> and then by our <hi>A—s</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Government, there will be as many Kings as there are Fathers.</p>
               <p n="71">71. And thus what a Monarchy he hath set up, let him and his Disciples consider, Princes certainly will have great Reason to thank him for these new Politics, which set up as many Absolute Kings in every Country as there are Fathers of Children, and yet who can blame our <hi>A</hi>— for it, it lying unavoidably in the way of one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing upon our <hi>A—s</hi> Principles; For having placed an <hi>Absolute Power</hi> in <hi>Fathers by Right of Begetting,</hi> he could not easily resolve how much of this Power belong'd to a Son over the Children he had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; And so it fell out to be a very hard matter to give all the Power, as he does, to <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet allow a part in his Life time to his Children, when they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and which he knew not well how to deny them, this makes him so doubtful in his Expressions, and so uncertain where to place this Absolute Natural Power, which he calls Fatherhood; sometimes, <hi>Adam</hi> alone has it all, as <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>O.</hi> 244, 245. <hi>&amp; pref.</hi>

All Kings either are, or are to be, reputed the next Heirs to those first Proginetors, who were at first the natural Parents of the whole People,</hi> p. 19. <hi>There cannot be any multitude of Men whatsoever, but that in it, consider'd by it self, there is one Man amongst them, that in nature hath a right to be the King of all the rest, as being the next Heir to Adam, O.</hi> 253. Here in these places <hi>Inheritance</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:96077:58"/>
is the only way he allows of, conveying Monarchical Power to Princes, <hi>O.</hi> 155. <hi>All Power on Earth is either derived or usurped from the Fatherly Power,</hi> O. 158. <hi>All Kings that now are, or ever were, are or were either Fathers of their People, or the Heirs of such Fathers or Usurpers of the right of such Fathers, O.</hi> 253. And here he makes <hi>Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> the only ways whereby Kings come by this Original Power; But yet he tells us, <hi>this Fatherly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as it was of its self Hereditary, so it was alienable by Patent, and seizable by an Vsurper, O.</hi> 190. So then here Inheritance, Grant or Usurpation will convey it; And last of all, which is most admirable he he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 100. <hi>It skils not which way Kings come by their Power, whether by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Donation, Succession, or by any other means, for it is still the manner of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="85">85. In both these Rights, there being supposed an exclusion of all other Men, it must be upon some reason peculiar to <hi>Adam,</hi> that they must both be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:96077:61"/>That of his <hi>Property</hi> our <hi>A</hi>— supposes, to arise from Gods immediate <hi>Donation, Gen.</hi> 1. 28. and that of <hi>Fatherhood,</hi> from the Act of <hi>Begetting</hi> now in all Inheritance, if the Heir succeed not to the reason, upon which his Fathers Right was founded, he cannot succeed to the Right which followed from it; For Example, <hi>Adam</hi> had a Right of Property in the Creatures, upon the <hi>Donation</hi> and <hi>Grant</hi> of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who was Lord and Proprietor of them all, let this be so as our <hi>A</hi>— tells us, yet upon his death, his Heir can have no Title to them, no such right of <hi>Property</hi> in them, unless the same reason, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>Donation,</hi> vested a right in the <hi>Heir</hi> too; for if <hi>Adam</hi> could have had no Property in, nor use of, the Creatures without this positive <hi>Donation</hi> from God, and this <hi>Donation,</hi> were only Personally to <hi>Adam,</hi> his <hi>Heir</hi> could have no right by it, but upon his death, it must revert to God the Lord and Owner again; for positive Grants give no Title farther then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words convey it, and by which only it is held, and thus, if as our <hi>A</hi>— himself contends, that <hi>Donation, Gen.</hi> 1. 28. were made only to <hi>Adam,</hi> personally his Heir could not succeed to his Property in the Creatures, and if it were a Donation to any but <hi>Adam,</hi> let it be shewn, that it
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96077:62"/>
was to his Heir in our <hi>A—s</hi> Sense, <hi>i.e.</hi> to one of his Children exclusive of all the rest.</p>
               <p n="86">86. But not to follow our <hi>A</hi>— too far out of the way, the plain of the Case is this, God having made Man, and Planted in him, as in all other Animals, a strong desire of self Preservation, and furnished the World with things fit for Food and Rayment, and other necessaries of Life, Subservient to his design, that Man should live and abide for some time upon the the Face of the Earth, and not that so curious and wonderful a piece of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship by its own negligence, or want of necessaries, should perish again, presently after a few moments continuance: God, I say, having made Man and the World, thus spoke to him, (that is) directed him by his Senses and Reason, as he did the inferior Animals by their Sense, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct which he had placed in them to that purpose, to the use of those things, which were serviceable for his subsistence, and gave him the means of his <hi>Preservation,</hi> and therefore I doubt not, but before these words were pronounced, 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 29. If they must be understood Litterally to have been spoken, or without any such Verbal <hi>Donation,</hi> Man had a right to a Use of the Creatures, by the Will and Grant of God, for the desire, strong
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96077:62"/>
desire of Preserving his Life and Being, having been Planted in him, as a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Action by God himself, Reason, <hi>which was the voice of God in him,</hi> could not but teach him and assure him, that pursuing that natural Inclination he had to preserve his Being, he followed the Will of his Maker, and therefore had a right to make use of those Creatures, which by his Reason or Senses he could discover, would be serviceable thereunto, and thus Mans <hi>Property</hi> in the Creatures, was founded upon the right he had, to make use of those things that were necessary, or useful to his being.</p>
               <p n="87">87. This being the Reason and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Adams Property,</hi> gave the same Title, on the same Ground, to all his Children, not only after his death, but in his life time, so that here was no Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his <hi>Heir</hi> above his other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which could exclude them from an equal right, to the use of the inferior Creatures, for the comfortable Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Beings. Which is all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> Man hath in them, and so <hi>Adams</hi> Sovereignty built on <hi>Property,</hi> or as our <hi>A</hi>— calls it, <hi>Private Dominion</hi> comes to nothing. Every Man had a right to the Creatures, by the same Title <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>viz.</hi> by the right every one had to take
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96077:63"/>
care of, and provide for, their Subsistance, and thus Men had a right in common, <hi>Adams</hi> Children in common with him. But if any one had began, and made himself a Property in any particular thing, (which how he, or any one else, could do, shall be shewn in another place) that thing, that possession, if he dispos'd not otherwise of it by his positive Grant, desc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nded Naturally to his Children, and they had a right to succeed to it, and possess it.</p>
               <p n="88">88. It might reasonably be asked here, how come Children by this right of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing, before any other, the Properties of their Parents upon their Decease, for it being Personally the Parents, when they dye, without actually Transferring their Right to another, why does it not return again to the commmon Stock of Mankind? 'Twill perhaps be answered, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent hath disposed of it to the Children Common Practice, we see indeed does so dispose of it, but we cannot say, that it is the common consent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for that hath never been asked, nor Actually given, and if common tacit Consent had Establish'd it, it would make but a positive and not natural Right of Children, to Inherit the Goods of their Parents: But where the Practice is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96077:63"/>
'tis reasonable to think the Cause is natural. The ground then I think to be this; The first and strongest desire God Planted in Men, and wrought into the very Principle of their nature, being that of self Preservation, is the Foundation of a right to the Creatures for their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular support, and use of each individual Person himself. But next to this, God Planted in Men a strong desire also of Propagating their Kind, and continuing themselves in their posterity, and this gives Children a Title, to share in the <hi>Property</hi> of their Parents, and a Right to Inherit their Possessions, Men are not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of what they have meerly for themselves, their Children have a Title to part of it, and have their Kind of Right joyn'd with their Parent's, in the Possession which comes to be wholly theirs, when death having put an end to their Parents use of it, hath taken them from their Possessions, and this we call Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Men being by a like Obligation, bound to preserve what they have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as to preserve themselves, their issue come to have a Right in the Goods they are possessed of. And that Children have such a Right is plain from the Laws of God, and that Men are convinced, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have such a Right, is Evident from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96077:64"/>
the Law of the Land, both which Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Parents to provide for their Children.</p>
               <p n="89">89. For Children being by the course of nature, born weak, and unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themselves, they have by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God himself, who hath thus ordered the course of nature, a right to be nourish'd and maintained by their Parents, nay a right not only to a bare Subsistance, but to the conveniences and comforts of Life, as far as the conditions of their Parents can afford it; And hence it comes, that when their Parents leave the World, and so the care due to their Children ceases, the effects of it are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend as far as possibly they can, and the Provisions they have made in their Life time, are understood to be intended as nature requires they should, for their Children, whom after themselves, they are bound to provide for, though the dying Parents, by express Words, declare nothing about them, nature appoints the the descent of their Property to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who thus come to have a Title, and natural Right of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nheritance to their Fathers Goods, which the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot pretend to.</p>
               <p n="90">90. Were it not for this right of being nourished, and maintained by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which God and nature has given to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96077:64"/>
Children and obliged Parents to, as a duty, it would, be reasonable, that the Father should Inherit the Estate of his Son, and be prefer'd in the Inheritance before his Grand Child, for to the Grand Father, there is due a long Score of care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences laid out upon the Breeding and Education of his Son, which one would think in Justice ought to be paid, but that having been done in Obedience to the same Law, whereby he received Nourishment and Education from his own Parents, this Score of Education received from a Mans Father, is paid by taking care and providing for his own Children (is paid I say, as much as is requir'd of payment by alteration of Property, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less present necessity of the Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a return of Goods for their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Support and Subsistance, for we are not now speaking of that reverence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, respect and honour that is always due from Children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but of possessions and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Life valuable by Money;) But yet this debt to the Children, does not quite cancel the Score due to the Father, but only is made by nature preferable to it; For the debt a Man owes his Father, takes place and gives the Father a Right to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Sons Goods, where for want of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96077:65"/>
Issue, the Right of Children doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itle. And therefore a Man having a Right to be maintain'd by his Children where he needs it, and to injoy also the comforts of Life from them, when the necessary provision due to them and their Children will afford it, if his Son dye without Issue, the Father has a right in nature to possess his Goods, and Inherit his Estate (whatever the Municipal Laws of some Countries may absurdly direct otherwise,) and so again his Children and their Issue from him, or for want of such his Father and his Issue; But where no such are to be found, <hi>i. e.</hi> no Kindred there we see the possessions of a Private Man, revert to the community, and so in Politic Societies come into the hands of the public Magistrate, but in the State of nature become again perfectly common, no body having a right to Inherit them, nor can any one have a Property in them, otherwise then in other things common by nature, of which I shall speak in its due place.</p>
               <p n="91">91. I have been the larger, in shewing upon what ground Children have a Right to succeed to the Possession of their Fathers Properties, not only because by it, it will appear, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had a Property (a Titular insignificant useless Property;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96077:65"/>
for it could be no better, for he was bound to nourish and maintain his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Posterity out of it) in the whole Earth and its Product, yet all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren coming to have by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Right of Inheritance a joynt Title, and Right of Property in it after his death, it could convey no right of Sovereignty to any one of his Posterity over the rest, since every one having a right of Inheritance to his portion, they might enjoy their Inheritance, or any part of it in common, or share it, or some parts of it, by Division, as it best liked them, but no one could pretend to the whole Inheritance, or any Sovereignty supposed to accompany it, since a right of Inheritance gave every one of the rest, as well as any one, a Title to share in the Goods of his Father. Not only upon this account, I say, have I been so particular in examining the reason of Childrens Inheriting the Property of their Fathers, but also because it will give us farther Light in the Inheritance of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which in Countries where their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Municipal Laws give the whole Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Land entirely to the first Born, and Descent of Power has gone so to Men by this Custom, some have been apt to be deceived into an Opinion, that there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96077:66"/>
was a Natural or Divine Right of Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture to both <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and that the Inheritance of both <hi>Rule</hi> over Men and Property in things, sprang from the same Original, and were to descend by the same Rules.</p>
               <p n="92">92. Property, whose Original is from the Right a Man has to use any of the inferior Creatures, for the subsistance and comfort of his Life, is for the benefit and sole advantage of the Proprietor, so that he may even destroy the thing, that he has Property in by his use of it, where need requires; But Government being for the Preservation of every Mans Right and Property, by Preserving him from the Violence or Injury of others, is for the good of the Governed; For the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate Sword, being for a <hi>Terror to evil Doers,</hi> and by that Terror to inforce Men to observe the positive Laws of the Society, made conformable to the Laws of Nature, for the Public good, <hi>i. e.</hi> the good of every particular Member of that Society, as far as by common Rules, it can be provided for; the Sword is not given the Magistrate for his own good alone.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Children therefore, as has been shew'd, by the dependance they have on their Parents for Subsistance, have a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96077:66"/>
Right of Inheritance to their Fathers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, as that which belongs to them for their Proper good and behoof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are fitly termed Goods, wherein the first Born has not a sole or peculiar Right by any Law of God and Nature. His, and his Brethrens, being equally foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on that Right they had to mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, support and comfort from their Parents, and on nothing else; But Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being for the benefit of the Governed, and not the sole advantage of the Governors (but only for theirs with the rest, as they make a part of that Politic Body, each of whose Parts and Members are taken care of, and directed in their peculiar Function for the good of the whole, by the Laws of the Society,) cannot be Inherited by the same Title, that Children have to the Goods of their Fathers. The Right a Son has to be maintained and provided with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries and conveniences of Life out of his Fathers Stock, gives him a Right to succeed to his Fathers <hi>Property</hi> for his own good, but this can give him no Right to succeed also to the <hi>Rule,</hi> which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had over other Men; all that a Child has Right to claim from his Fathers is Nourishment and Education, and the things nature furnishes for the support of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96077:67"/>
Life, but he has no Right to demand <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> from him: He can subsist and receive from him the Portion of good things, aud advantages of Education na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally due to him, without <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi>; That (if his Father hath any) was vested in him, for the good and behoof of others, and therefore the Son cannot Claim or Inherit it by a Title, which is founded wholy on his own private good and advantage.</p>
               <p n="94">94. We must know how the first Ruler, from whom any one claims came by his Authority, upon what ground any one has <hi>Empire,</hi> what his Title is to it, before we can know who has a right to succeed him in it, and inherit it from him; If the Agreement and Consent of Men first gave a Scepter into any ones hand, or put a Crown on his Head, that also must direct its descent and conveyance; for the same Authority, that made the first a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Ruler,</hi> must make the Second too, and so give Right of Succession; And in this Case Inheritance or Primogeniture, can in its self have no Right, no pretence, to it, any farther then that Consent, which Established the Form of the Government, hath so settled the Succession; and thus we see the Succession of Crowns, in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries places it on different Heads,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96077:67"/>
and he comes by right of Succession, to be a Prince in one place, who would be a Subject in another.</p>
               <p n="95">95. If God, by his positive Grant and revealed Declaration, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>st gave <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> to any Man, he that will Claim by that Title, must have the same positive Grant of God for his Succession; for if that has not directed the Course of its descent and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance down to others, no body can succeed to this Title of the first Ruler, and hereto Children have no right of Inheritance; and Primogeniture can lay no Claim, unless God the Author of this Constitution hath so ordained it. Thus we see the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of <hi>Sauls</hi> Family, who received his Crown from the immediate Appointment of God, ended with his Reign; And <hi>David</hi> by the same Title that <hi>Saul</hi> Reignd, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods appointment, succeeded in his Throne, to the exclusion of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and all pretensions of Paternal Inheritance. And if <hi>Solomon</hi> had a right to succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed his Father, it must be by some other Title, then that of Primogeniture. A <hi>Cadet</hi> or Sisters Son, must have the Preference in Succession, if he has the same Title the first Lawful Prince had. And in Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that has its Foundation only in the positive appointment of God himself,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96077:68"/>
                  <hi>Benjamin</hi> the youngest, must have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Crown, if God so direct as well as one of that Tribe had the first Possession.</p>
               <p n="96">96. If <hi>Paternal Right,</hi> the Act of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting,</hi> give a Man <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> Inheritance or Primogeniture can give no Title; for he that cannot succeed to his Fathers Title, which was <hi>Begetting,</hi> cannot succeed to that Power over his Brethren, which his Father had by Paternal Right over them, but I shall have more to say on this by and by. This is plain in the mean time, that any Government whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supposed to be, at first founded in <hi>Paternal Right, Consent of the People,</hi> or the <hi>Positive Appointment of God himself,</hi> which can supersede either of the other, and so begin a new Government upon a new Foundation, I say, any Government began upon either of these, can by Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession come to those only, who have the Title of him, they succeed to. Power foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Contract,</hi> can descend only to him, who has Right by that Contract, Power founded on <hi>Begetting,</hi> he only can have that <hi>Begets,</hi> and Power founded on the positive <hi>Grant</hi> or Donation of God, he only can have by Right of Succession, to whom that Grant directs it.</p>
               <p n="97">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:96077:68"/>97. From what I have said, I think this is clear, that a Right to the use of the Creatures, being founded Originally in the Right a Man has to subsist and enjoy the conveniences of Life, and the natural Right Children have to Inherit the goods of their Parents, being founded in the Right they have to the same Subsistance and Commodities of Life, out of the Stock of their Parents, who are therefore taught by natural Love and Tenderness to provide for them, as a part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and all this being only for the good of the Proprietor or Heir; It can be no reason for Childrens Inheriting of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> which has another Original and a different end, nor can Primogeniture have any Pretence to a Right of solely Inheriting either <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> as we shall in, its due place, see more fully, 'tis enough to have shew'd here, that <hi>Adams Property</hi> or <hi>Private Dominion,</hi> could not convey any Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Rule to his Heir, who not having a Right to Inherit all his Fathers Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, could not thereby come to have any Sovereignty over his Brethren, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any Sovereignty, on account of his <hi>Property,</hi> had been vested in <hi>Adam,</hi> which in Truth there was not; yet it would have died with him.</p>
               <p n="98">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:96077:69"/>98. As <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sovereignty, if he had by vertue of being Proprietor of the whole World, had any Authority over Men, could not have been Inherited by any of his Children over the rest, because they had all Title to divide the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and every one had a Right to a Portion of his Fathers Possessions, so neither could <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sovereignty by Right of <hi>Fatherhood,</hi> if any such he had, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to any one of his Children; for it being, in our <hi>A—s</hi> account, a Right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by <hi>Begetting</hi> to Rule over those he had begotten, it was not a Power possible to be Inherited, because the Right being consequent to, and built on, an Act perfectly Personal, made that Power so too, and impossible to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited for Paternal Power, being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right, arising only from the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Father and Son, is as impossible to be Inherited as the relation it self, and a Man may pretend as well to Inherit the conjugal Power, the Husband, whose Heir he is, had over his Wife, as he can to Inherit the Paternal Power of a Father over his Children; For the Power of the Husband being founded on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and the Power of the Father on <hi>Begetting,</hi> he may as well Inherit the Power obtained by the conjugal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96077:69"/>
which was only Personal, as he may the Power obtained by Begetting, which could reach no farther then the Person of the Begetter, unless begetting can be a Title to Power in him, that does not beget.</p>
               <p n="99">99. Which makes it a reasonable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to ask, whether <hi>Adam</hi> dying before <hi>Eve</hi> his Heir, suppose <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Seth</hi> should have had by Right of Inheriting <hi>Adam's Fatherhood,</hi> Sovereign Power over <hi>Eve</hi> his Mother; for <hi>Adams Fatherhood,</hi> being nothing but a Right he had to Govern his Children, because he begot them, he that Inherits <hi>Adam's Fatherhood,</hi> inherits nothing even in our <hi>A—s</hi> sense, but the the Right <hi>Adam</hi> had to Govern his Children, because he begot them, so that the Monarchy of the Heir would not have taken in <hi>Eve,</hi> or if it did, it being nothing but the <hi>Fatherhood</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended by Inheritance, the Heir must have Right to Govern <hi>Eve,</hi> because <hi>Adam</hi> begot her; For <hi>Fatherhood</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
               <p n="100">100. Perhaps it will be said with our <hi>A</hi>—, that a Man can alien his Power over his Child, and what may be transfer'd by compact, may be possessed by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I answer, a Father cannot Alien the Power he has over his Child, he may perhaps
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96077:70"/>
to some degrees forfeit it, but cannot transfer it, and if any other Man acquire it, 'tis not by the Fathers Grant, but some Act of his own; For example, a Father, unnaturally careless of his Child, sells or gives him to another Man; and he again exposes him; a third Man finding him, breeds up cherishes and provides for him as his own: I think in this Case, no body will doubt but that the greatest part of filial Duty and Subjection was here owing, and to be paid to, this Foster Father, and if any thing could be demanded from him, by either of the other, it could be only due to his natural Father, who perhaps might have forfeited his Right to much of that Duty comprehended in the command, <hi>Honour your Parents,</hi> but could transfer none of it to another, he that purchased, and neglected the Child got by his Purchase and Grant of the Father, no Title to Duty or Honour from the Child, but only he acquired it, who by his own Authority, performing the Office and Care of a Father, to the Forlorn and Perishing Infant, made himself by Paternal Care, a Title to proportionable Degrees of Paternal Power. This will be more easily admitted upon consideration of the nature of Paternal Power, for which I refer my Reader to the 2<hi>d</hi> Book.</p>

To return to the Argument in hand, this is evident; That Paternal Power arising only from <hi>Begetting,</hi> for in that our <hi>A</hi>— places it alone, can neither be <hi>transfer'd,</hi> nor <hi>inherited</hi>; And he that does not beget, can no more have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power which arises from thence, then he can have a Right to any thing who performs not the condition, to which only it is annexed; If one should ask by what Law, has a Father Power over his Children, it will be answered no doubt by the Law of nature, which gives such a Power over them, to him that begets them; If one should ask likewise by what Law does our <hi>A—s</hi> Heir come by a Right to Inherit, I think it would be answer'd by the Law of nature too, for I find not that our <hi>A</hi>— brings one word of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove the Right of such an Heir he speaks of, why then the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, gives Fathers Paternal Power over their Children, because they did <hi>beget</hi> them, and the same Law of nature gives the same Paternal Power to the Heir over his Brethren, who did not <hi>beget</hi> them whence it follows, that either the Father has not his Paternal Power by begetting, or else that the Heir has it not at all; For 'tis hard to understand how the Law

of nature which is the Law of reason, can give the Paternal Power to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over his Children, for the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Begetting,</hi> and to the first born over his Brethren without this only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>i. e.</hi> for no reason at all, and if the Eldest by the Law of nature can inherit thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time 'tis as good Sense to say, that by the Law of nature, a Man has Right to inherit the Property of another, because he is of Kin to him, and is known to be of his Blood, and therefore by the same Law of nature, an utter Stranger to his Blood, has Right to inherit his Estate; As to say that by the Law of nature he that begets them, has P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When therefore it can be shew'd, that conjugal Power can belong to him that is not an Husband, it will also I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve be proved, that our <hi>A—s</hi> Paternal Power acquired by begetting, may be inherited by a Son, and that a Brother as Heir to his Fathers Power, may have Paternal Power over his Brethren, and by the same Rule conjugal Power to, but till then, I think we may rest satisfied, that the Paternal Power of <hi>Adam,</hi> this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority of <hi>Fatherhood,</hi> were there any such, could not descend to, nor be inherited by, his next Heir. <hi>Fatherly Power</hi> I easily grant our <hi>A</hi>— if it will do him any good, can never be lost, because it will be as long in the World as there are Fathers, but none of them will have <hi>Adams</hi> Paternal Power, or derive theirs from him, but every one will have his own, by the same Title <hi>Adam</hi> had his, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Begetting,</hi> but not by Inheritance or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, no more then Husbands have their conjugal Power by Inheritance from <hi>Adam</hi>; And thus we see as <hi>Adam</hi> had no

Absoluteness can add to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shewing who has a right to have it, is only to give a greater edg to Mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ambition, which of it self, is but too apt to be intemperate, and to set Men on the more eagerly to Scramble, and so lay a sure and lasting Foundation of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less contention and disorder instead of that Peace and Tranquillity, which is the business of Government, and the end of Human Society.</p>
               <p n="107">107.

For if the <hi>Assignment of Civil Power be by Divine Institution</hi> and <hi>Adams Heir,</hi> he to whom it is thus <hi>Assigned,</hi> as we see in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, our <hi>A</hi>— tells us, it would be as much Sacriledge for any one to be King, who was not <hi>Adams</hi> Heir, as it would have been amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> for any one to have been <hi>Priest,</hi> who had not been of <hi>Aarons</hi> posterity; For <hi>not only</hi> the Priesthood <hi>in general being by Divine

It follows, p. 19. <hi>Accordingly when Iacob bought his Brothers Birth-right, Isaac Blessed him thus; be Lord over thy Brethren, and let the Sons of thy Mother bow before thee,</hi> another instance I take it, brought by our. <hi>A</hi>— to evince Dominion due to Birth-right, and an admirable one it is; for it must be no ordinary way of reasoning in a Man, that is pleading for the natural Power of Kings, and against all compact to bring for Proof of it, an example where his own account of it, founds all the right upon compact, and settles Empire in the Younger Brother, unless buying and selling be no compact; for he tells us, <hi>when Iacob bought his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Birth-right</hi>; But passing by that, let us consider the History it self, with what ufe our <hi>A</hi>— makes of it, and we shall find these following mistakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That our <hi>A</hi>— reports this, as if <hi>Isaac</hi> had given <hi>Iacob</hi> this Blessing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon his Purchasing the <hi>Birth-right</hi>; for he says, <hi>when Iacob bought, Isaac Blessed him,</hi> which is plainly otherwise
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96077:79"/>
in the Scripture, for it appears there was a distance of time between, and if we will take the Story in the order it lies, it must be no small distance; All <hi>Isaacs</hi> Sojourning in <hi>Gerar,</hi> and Transactions with <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 26. coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, <hi>Rebeka</hi> being then Beautiful and consequently young, but <hi>Isaac</hi> when he Blessed <hi>Iacob,</hi> was old and decrepit; And <hi>Esau</hi> also complains of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 27. 36. that <hi>two times</hi> he had Supplanted him, <hi>he took away my Birth-right,</hi> says he, <hi>and behold now he hath taken away my Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>; words, that I think, signifies distance of time, and difference of Action.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Another mistake of our <hi>A—s,</hi> is, that he supposes <hi>Isaac</hi> gave <hi>Iacob</hi> the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> and bid him be <hi>Lord over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> because he had the <hi>Birth right,</hi> for our <hi>A</hi>— brings this example to prove, that he that has the <hi>Birth-right,</hi> has thereby a right to <hi>be Lord over his Brethren</hi>; But it is also manifest by the Text, that <hi>Isaac</hi> had no consideration of <hi>Iacobs</hi> having bought the Birth right, for when he Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, he considered him not as <hi>Iacob,</hi> but took him for <hi>Esau,</hi> nor did <hi>Esau</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand any such connexion between <hi>Birth-right</hi> and the <hi>Blessing,</hi> for he says, <hi>he hath Supplanted me these two times, he took away my Birth-right, and behold now he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96077:79"/>
hath taken away my Blessing,</hi> whereas had the <hi>Blessing,</hi> which was to be <hi>Lord over his Brethren,</hi> belong'd to the <hi>Birth-right, Esau</hi> could not have complain'd of this second as a Cheat, <hi>Iacob</hi> having got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what <hi>Esau</hi> had sould him, when he sould him his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> so that it is plain, Dominion if these words signifie it, was not understood to belong to the <hi>Birth-right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="114">114. And that in those days of the Patriarchs Dominion was not understood to be the Right of the Heir, but only a greater Portion of goods, is plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. for <hi>Sarah</hi> taking <hi>Isaac</hi> to be Heir, says, <hi>cast out this Bond-woman and her Son, for the Son of this Bond-woman, shall not be Heir with my Son,</hi> whereby could be meant nothing, but that he should not have a pretence to an equal share of his Fathers Estate after his death, but should have his Portion presently, and be gone. Accordingly, we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 5, 6. That <hi>Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, but unto the Sons of the Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines which Abraham had, Abraham gave Gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his Son, while he yet lived</hi>; That is, <hi>Abraham</hi> having given Portions to all his other Sons and sent them away, that which he had reserved, being the greatest part of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96077:80"/>
his substance, <hi>Isaac</hi> as Heir Possessed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, but by being Heir, he had no Right to be <hi>Lord over his Brethren</hi>; For if he had, why should <hi>Sarah</hi> desire to rob him of one of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> his <hi>Slaves,</hi> by desiring to have him sent away.</p>
               <p n="115">115. Thus as under the Law, the Priviledge of <hi>Birth-right,</hi> was nothing but a double Portion, so we see that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> in the Patriarchs time, from whence our <hi>A</hi>— pretends to take his model, there was no knowledge, no thought that Birth-right gave Rule or Empire, Paternal or Kingly Authority, to any one over his Brethren, which if it be not plain enough in the Story of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> let them look into 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 12. and there he may read these words, <hi>Ruben was the first Born, but for as much as he desiled his Fathers Bed, his Birth-right was given unto the Sons of Ioseph, the Son of Israeel, and the Geneology is not to be reckon'd after the Birth-right; For Iudah, prevailed above his Brethren, and of him came the cheif Ruler, but the Birth-right was Iosephs,</hi> and what this Birth-right was, <hi>Iacob</hi> Blessing <hi>Ioseph, Gen.</hi> 58. 22. telleth us in these words, <hi>Moreover I have given thee one Portion above thy Brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite, with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96077:80"/>
my Sword and with my Bow,</hi> whereby it is not only plain, that the Birth-right was nothing but a double Portion, but the Text in <hi>Chron.</hi> is express against our <hi>A—s</hi> Doctrin, shews that Dominion was no part of the Birth-right; for it tells us that <hi>Ioseph</hi> had the Birth-right, but <hi>Iudah</hi> the Dominion; But one would think our <hi>A</hi>— were very fond of the very name of <hi>Birth-right,</hi> when he brings this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> to prove that Dominion belongs to the Heir over his Brethren.</p>
               <p n="116">116. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Because it will be but an ill example to prove, that Dominion by Gods Ordination, belonged to the Eldest Son, because <hi>Iacob</hi> the Youngest here had it, let him come by it how he would; For if it prove any thing, it can only prove against our <hi>A</hi>—, that the <hi>Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dominion to the Eldest, is not by Divine Institution,</hi> which would then be unalterable; For if by the Law of God, or Nature, Absolute Power and Empire belongs to the Eldest Son and his Heirs, so that they are Supream Monarchs, and all the rest of their Brethren Slaves, our <hi>A</hi>— gives us reason to doubt, whether the Eldest Son has a Power to part with it, to the prejudice of his Posterity, since he tells us, <hi>O.</hi> 158. that <hi>in Grants and Gifts
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96077:81"/>
that have their Original from God or nature, no inferior Power of Man can limit, or make any Law of Prescription against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="117">117. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Because this place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 29. brought by our <hi>A</hi>— concerns not at all, the Dominion of one Brother over the other, nor the Subjection of <hi>Esau</hi> to <hi>Iacob</hi>; for 'tis plain in the History, that <hi>Esau</hi> was never Subject to <hi>Iacob,</hi> but lived a part in Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> where he founded a distinct People and Government, and was himself Prince over them, as much as <hi>Iacob</hi> was in his own Family. The words if one consider <hi>thy Brethren,</hi> and <hi>thy Mothers Sons in them,</hi> can never be understood literally of <hi>Esau,</hi> or the Personal Dominion of <hi>Iacob</hi> over him; for the words, <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> could not be used litterally by <hi>Isaac,</hi> who knew <hi>Iacob</hi> had only one Brother; And these words are so far from being true in a litteral Sense, or Establishing any Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in <hi>Iacob</hi> over <hi>Esau,</hi> that in the Story we find the quite contrary, for <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>Iacob</hi> several times calls <hi>Esau Lord,</hi> and himself his Servant, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. <hi>he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself seven times to the ground to Esau,</hi> whether <hi>Esau</hi> then were a Subject and Vassal, (nay as our <hi>A</hi>— tells us, all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are <hi>Slaves</hi>) to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> his Sovereign Prince by Birth right; I leave
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96077:81"/>
the Reader to judge and believe if he can, that these words of <hi>Isaac be Lord over thy Brethren, and let thy Mothers Sons bow down to thee,</hi> confirm'd <hi>Iacob</hi> in a Sovereignty over <hi>Esau,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Birth-right</hi> he had got from him.</p>
               <p n="118">118. He that reads the Story of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> will find there was never any Jurisdicton or Authority, that either of them had over the other after their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, they lived with the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Equallity of Brethren, neither <hi>Lord,</hi> neither <hi>Slave</hi> to his Brother, but Independent each of other, were both heads of their distinct Families, where they received no Laws from one another, but lived seperately, and were the Roots out of which sprang two distinct People, under two distinct Governments. This Blessing then of <hi>Isaac,</hi> whereon our <hi>A</hi>— would build the Dominion of the Elder Brother, signifies no more but what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beca</hi> had been told from God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 23. <hi>Two Nations are in thy Womb, and two manner of People, shall be seperated from thy Bowels, and the one People shall be stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the other People, and the Elder shall serve the Younger</hi>; And so <hi>Iacob</hi> Blessed <hi>Iudah, Gen.</hi> 49. and gave him the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Dominion, from whence our <hi>A—</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:96077:82"/>
might have argued as well, that Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Dominion belongs to the third Son over his Brethren, as well as from this Blessing of <hi>Isaac,</hi> that it belonged to <hi>Iacob</hi>; They being both Predictions of what should long after happen to their Posterities, and not the declaring the Right of Inheritance to Dominion in either; And thus we have our <hi>A—s</hi> two great and only Arguments to prove, that <hi>Heirs are Lords of their Brethren,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God tells <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sin might set upon him, he ought or might be master of it; For the most Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned interpreters understand the words of sin, and not of <hi>Abel,</hi> and give so strong reasons for it, that nothing can convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly be infer'd from so doubtful a Text to our <hi>A—s</hi> purpose, 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Because in this of <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>Isaac</hi> foretells that the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the Posterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> should have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the <hi>Edomites,</hi> the Posterity of <hi>Esau</hi>; therefore says our <hi>A— Heirs are Lords of their Brethren,</hi> I leave any one to judge of the conclusion.</p>
               <p n="119">119. And now we see how our <hi>A</hi>— has provided for the descending, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance down of <hi>Adams</hi> Monarchical Power, or Paternal Dominion to Posterity, by the Inheritance of his <hi>Heir,</hi> Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all his Fathers Authority, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96077:82"/>
upon his death as much Lord as his Father was, <hi>not only over his own Children, but over his Brethren,</hi> and all descended from his Father, and so <hi>in infinitum</hi>; But yet who this Heir is, he does not once tell us, and all the light we have from him in this so Fundamental a Point, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that in his instance of <hi>Iacob,</hi> by using the word <hi>Birth-right,</hi> as that which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from <hi>Esau</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> he leaves us to guess that by Heir, he means the Eldest Son, though I do not remember he any where mentions expresly the Title of the first Born, but all along keeps himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shelter of the indefinite Term <hi>Heir</hi>; But taking it to be his meaning, that the Eldest Son is Heir (for if the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be not, there will be no pretence, why the Sons should not be all Heirs alike) and so by Right of Pimogeniture has Dominion over his Brethren, this is but one step towards the Settelment of Succession, and the difficulties remain still as much as ever, till he can shew us who is meant by Right Heir, in all those cases which may happen where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Possessor hath no Son; But this he silently passes over, and perhaps wisely too; For what can be wiser after one has affirm'd, that <hi>the Person having that Power, as well as the Power and Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96077:83"/>
is the Ordinance of God,</hi> and <hi>by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, vid. O.</hi> 254. <hi>p.</hi> 12. then to be careful, not to start any question concerning the Person, the resolution whereof will certainly lead him into a a confession, that God and Nature hath determined nothing about him; And if our <hi>A</hi>— cannot shew who by Right of nature, or a clear positive Law of God, has the next right to inherit the Dominion of this natural Monarch, he has been at such pains about, when he dyed without a Son, he might have spared his pains in all the rest, it being more necessary to settle Mens consciences, and determin their Subjection and Allegiance, to shew them who by Original Right, Superior and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the Will, or any Act of Men, hath a Title to this <hi>Paternal Iurisdiction,</hi> than it is to shew that by Nature, there was such a <hi>Iurisdiction</hi>; It being to no purpose for me to know, there is such a <hi>Paternal Power,</hi> which I ought, and am, disposed to obey, unless where there are many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, I also know the Person that is rightfully invested and endow'd with it.</p>
               <p n="120">120. For the main matter in question being concerning the Duty of my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the Obligation of Conscience I am under to pay it to him that is of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96077:83"/>
Right, my Lord and Ruler, I must know the Person, that this Right of Paternal Power resides in, and so impowers him to claim Obedience from me; For let it be true, what he says, <hi>p.</hi> 12. That <hi>Civil Power not only in general is by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96077:84"/>
Divine Right, there is such a Power in the World.</p>
               <p n="121">121. And hence not being able to make out any Princes Title to Government, as Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> which therefore is of no use, and had been better let alone, he is fain to resolve all into present Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and makes Civil Obedience as due to an <hi>Vsurper</hi> as to a lawful King, and thereby the <hi>Vsurpers</hi> Title as good; His words are, <hi>O.</hi> 253. And they deserve to be remembred: <hi>If an Vsurper dispossess the true Heir, the Subjects Obedience to the Fatherly Power must go along and wait upon Gods Providence.</hi> But I shall leave his Title of Usurpers to be examin'd in its due place, and desire my sober Reader to consider what thanks Princes owe such Politics as this, which can suppose <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) a Right to Government into the hands of a <hi>Cade,</hi> or a <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and so all Obedience being due to pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power, the Obedience of Subjects will be due to them by the same Right, and upon as good Grounds as it is to lawful Princes, and yet this, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Doctrine as it is, must necessarily follow from making all Political Power to be nothing else but <hi>Adams</hi> Paternal Power by Right and <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> descending from him without being able
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96077:84"/>
to shew to whom it descended, or who is Heir to it.</p>
               <p n="122">122. For, I say, to settle Government in the World, and to lay Obligations to Obedience on any Mans Conscience, it is as necessary (supposing with our <hi>A</hi>— that all Power be nothing but the being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of <hi>Adams Fatherhood</hi>) to satisfie him who has a Right to this <hi>Power,</hi> this <hi>Fatherhood</hi> when the possessor dyes without Sons to succeed immediately to it, as it was to tell him that upon the death of the Father, the Eldest Son had a right to it; For it is still to be remembr'd, that the great question is, and that which our <hi>A</hi>— would be thought to contend for, if he did not sometimes forget it, what Persons have a Right to be obeyed, and not whether there be a Power in the World, which is to be called <hi>Paternal,</hi> without knowing in whom it resides, for so it be a Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> Right to govern, it matters not whether it be called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, Regal, Natural</hi> or <hi>acquired Supream Fatherhood,</hi> or <hi>Supream Brotherhood,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we know who has it.</p>
               <p n="123">123. I go on then to ask whether in the inheriting of this <hi>Paternal Power,</hi> this <hi>Supream Fatherhood</hi>; The Grand-Son by a Daughter, hath a Right before a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew by a Brother? whether the Grand-Son
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96077:85"/>
by the Eldest Son, being an Infant before the Younger Son a Man and able? whether the Daughter before the Uncle? or any other Man, descended by a Male Line? whether a Grand-Son by a Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Daughter, before a Grand-Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by an Elder Daughter? whether the Elder Son by a Concubine, before a Younger Son by a Wife? from whence also will arise many questions of Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and what in nature is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt a Wife and a Concubine? for as to the municipal or positive Laws of Men, they can signifie nothing here. It may farther be asked, whether the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son being a Fool, shall inherit this <hi>Paternal Power,</hi> before the Younger a wise Man? and what Degree of Folly it must be that shall exclude him? and who shall be judge of it? whether the Son of a Fool excluded for his Folly, before the Son of his wise Brother who Reign'd? who has the <hi>Paternal Power,</hi> whilst the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Queen is with Child by the deceased King, and no body knows whether it will be a Son or a Daughter? which shall be Heir of two Male twins, who by the dissection of the Mother, were laid open to the World? whether a Sister by the half Blood, before a Brothers Daughter by the whole Blood?</p>

These, and many more such doubts, might be proposed about the Titles of Succession, and the Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and that not as idle Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but such as in History we shall find, have concerned the Inheritance of Crowns and Kingdoms, and if ours want them, we need not go farther for Famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it, then the other Kingdom in this very Island, which having been fully related by the ingenious and Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Patriarchanon Monarcha,</hi> I need say no more of; And till our <hi>A</hi>— hath resolved all the doubts, that may arise about the next Heir, and shewed that they are plainly determin'd by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the revealed Law of God, all his Suppositions of a <hi>Monarchical, Absolute, Supream, Paternal Power in Adam,</hi> and the descent of that Power to his Heir, and so on; If I say, all these his suppositions were as much demonstrations, as they are the contrary, yet they would not be of the least use to Establish the Authority, or make out the Title of any one Prince now on earth, but would rather unsettle and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

World) <hi>descended to his Heirs,</hi> and that there is no other Power in the World but this; yet, if it be not past doubt, to whom this <hi>Paternal Power descends,</hi> and whose now it is, no body can be under any Obligation of Obedience, unless any one will say, that I am bound to pay O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>Paternal Power</hi> in a Man, who has no more <hi>Paternal Power</hi> then I my self, which is all one as to say, I obey a Man, because he has a Right to govern, and if I be asked how I know, he has a Right to govern, I should answer it cannot be known, that he has any at all; for that cannot be the reason of my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which I know not to be, so much less can that be a reason of my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which no body at all can know.</p>

and therefore the positive Laws of Men, cannot determine that which is it self, the Foundation of all Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and is to receive its Rule only from the Law of God and Nature. And that being silent in the Case, I am apt to think there is no such Right to be conveyed this way, I am fure it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose if there were, and Men would be more at a loss concerning Government and Obedience to Governors, then if there were no such Right, since by positive Laws and compact, which <hi>Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (if there be any) shuts out, all these end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less inextricable doubts, can be safely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against, but it can never be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, how a Divine natural Right, and that of such moment as is all Order and Peace in the World, should be convey'd down to Posterity, without any plain Natural or Divine Rule concerning it. And these would be an end of all Civil Government, if the <hi>Assignment</hi> of Civil Power were by <hi>Divine Institution</hi> to the Heir, and yet <hi>by that Divine Institution,</hi> the Person of the Heir, could not be known. This <hi>Paternal Regal Power,</hi> being by Divine Right only his, it leaves no room for human prudence, or confent to place it any where else; for if only one Man hath a Divine Right to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96077:87"/>
of Mankind, no body can claim that Obedience, but he that can shew that Right; nor can Mens Consciences by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretence be obliged to it; And thus this Doctrine cuts up all Government by the Roots.</p>
               <p n="127">127. Thus we see how our <hi>A</hi>— laying it for a sure Foundation, that the very <hi>Person</hi> that is to Rule, is <hi>the Ordinance</hi> of God, and by <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> tells us at large, only that this Person is the <hi>Heir,</hi> but who this Heir is, he leaves us to guess; and so this <hi>Divine Institution</hi> which As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs it to a Person, whom we have no Rule to know, is just as good as an Assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to no body at all. But whatever our <hi>A</hi>— does, <hi>Divine Institution</hi> makes no such ridiculous Assignments, nor can God be supposed to make it a Sacred Law, that one certain Person should have a Right to something, and yet not give Rules to mark out, and know that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by, or give an <hi>Heir</hi> a Divine Right to Power, and yet not point out who that <hi>Heir</hi> is. T'is rather to be thought, that an <hi>Heir</hi> had no such Right by <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> then that God should give such a Right to the <hi>Heir,</hi> but yet leave it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and undeterminable who such Heir is.</p>

The pronouncing of Sentence of Death is not a certain mark of Sovereignty, but usually the Office of Inferior Magistrates. The Power of making Laws of Life and Death is indeed a mark of Sovereignty, but pronouncing the Sentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those Laws may be done by others, and therefore this will but ill prove that he had Sovereign Authority, as if one should say, <hi>Iudge Iefferies,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Sentence of Death in the late Times, therefore <hi>Iudge Iefferies,</hi> had So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority: But it will be said, <hi>Iudah</hi> did it not by Commission from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and therefore did it in his own Right. Who knows whether he had any Right at all, heat of Passion might carry him to do that which he had no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do. <hi>Iudah had Dominion of Life and Death,</hi> how does that appear? he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised it, he <hi>pronounced Sentence of Death a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for as much as this they have done, War and Peace cannot be made for Politic So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, but by the Supream Power of such Societies, because War or Peace, giving a different Motion to the force of such a Politic Body, none can make War or Peace, but that which has the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the force of the whole body, and that in Politic Societies is only the Supream Power.

If it was not <hi>Paternal Authority,</hi> then Gods own People were govern'd by those that had not <hi>Paternal Authority,</hi> and those Governours did well enough without it: If it were <hi>Paternal Authority</hi> and God chose the Persons that were to exercise it, our <hi>A—s</hi> Rule fails, that <hi>whensoever God makes choice of any Person to be Supream</hi> Ruler (for I suppose the name King has no Spell in it 'tis not the Title, but the Power makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) <hi>he intends that the Issue also should have the benefit of it,</hi> since from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Davids</hi> time 400 Years, the <hi>Issue</hi> was never <hi>so sufficiently comprended in the Person of the Father,</hi> as that any Son after the Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, succeeded to the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all those Judges that judged <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>; If to avoid this, it be said, God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chose the Person of the Successor, and so transferring the <hi>Fatherly Authority</hi> to him, excluded his Issue from succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, that is manifestly, not so in the Story of <hi>Iephtha,</hi> where he Articled with

               <p n="164">164. 'Tis in vain then to say, that <hi>whensoever God chooses any special Person</hi> to have the exercise of <hi>Paternal Authority</hi> (for if that be not to be King, I desire to know the difference between a King and one having the exercise of <hi>Paternal Authority</hi>) <hi>he intends the Issue also should have the benefit of it,</hi> since we find the Authority, the Judges had, ended with them, and descended not to their Issue, and if the Judges had not <hi>Paternal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> I fear it will trouble our <hi>A</hi>—, or any of the Friends to his Principles, to tell who had then the <hi>Paternal Authority,</hi> that is, the Government and Supream Power amongst the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and I sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they must confess that the chosen People of God continued a People seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hundreds of Years, without any Knowledge or Thought of this <hi>Paternal Authority,</hi> or any appearance of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government at all.</p>

and directed all that was done on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion: he must conclude either that <hi>God</hi> was not <hi>careful to preserve the Fatherly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> amongst his own chosen People, or else that the <hi>Fatherly Authority</hi> may be preserved where there is no Monarchical Government; If the latter, then it will follow that though <hi>Fatherly Authority</hi> be never so well proved, yet it will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a necessity of Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; If the former, it will seem very strange and improbable that God should ordain <hi>Fatherly Authority</hi> to be so Sacred amongst the Sons of Men, that there could be no Power nor Government without it, and yet that amongst his own People, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whilst he is providing a Government for them, and therein prescribes Rules to the several States and Relations of Men, this Great and Fundamental one, this most material and necessary of all the rest should be concealed, and lye neglected for 400 Years after.</p>
               <p n="166">166. Before I leave this, I must ask how our <hi>A</hi>— knows that <hi>whensoever God makes choice of any special Person to be King, he intends that the Issue should have the benefit thereof,</hi> does God by the Law of Nature or Revelation say so? By the same Law
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96077:111"/>
also he must say, which of his <hi>Issue</hi> must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Crown in Succession, and so point out the Heir, or else leave his <hi>Issue</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide or scramble for the Government: both alike absurd, and such as will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the benefit of such Grant to the <hi>Issue.</hi> When any such Declaration of Gods Intention is produced, it will be our Duty to believe God intends it so, but till that be done, our <hi>A</hi>— must shew us some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Warrant before we shall be obliged to receive him as the Authentic Reveler of Gods Intentions.</p>
               <p n="167">167. <hi>The Issue,</hi> says our <hi>A—, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended sufficiently in the Person of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although the Father only was named in the Grant</hi>: And yet God when he gave the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 13. 15. thought fit to put <hi>his Seed</hi> into the Grant too, so the Priesthood was given to <hi>Aaron and his Seed</hi>; And the Crown God gave not only to <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>his Seed</hi> also: And however our <hi>A</hi>— assures us that <hi>God intends, that the Issue should have the benefit of it, when he chooses any Person to be King,</hi> yet we see that the Kingdom he gave to <hi>Saul,</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning his Seed after him never came to any of his <hi>Issue,</hi> and why when God
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:96077:111"/>
chose a Person to be King, he should intend that his <hi>Issue</hi> should have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it, more then when he chose one to be Judg in <hi>Israel</hi>; I would fain know a reason; or why does a Grant of <hi>Fatherly Authority</hi> to a King more comprehend the <hi>Issue,</hi> then when a like Grant is made to a Judge? Is <hi>Paternal Authority</hi> by Right to descend to the <hi>Issue</hi> of one and not of the other? there will need some Reason to be shewn of this difference, more then the name, when the thing given is the same <hi>Fatherly Authority,</hi> and the manner of giving it Gods choice of the Person, for I suppose our <hi>A</hi>— when he says, <hi>God raised up Iudges,</hi> will by no means allow they were chosen by the People.</p>
               <p n="168">168. But since our <hi>A</hi>— has so confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assured us of the care of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Fatherhood,</hi> and pretends to build all, he says, upon the Authority of the Scripture, we may well expect that that People whose Law, Constitution and History is chiefly contain'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, should furnish him with the clearest Instances of Gods care of preserving of the Fatherly Authority, in that People who 'tis agreed he had a most peculiar care of, let us see then what State this

                  <hi>Paternal Authority</hi> or Government was in amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> from their beginning to be a People. It was omitted by our <hi>A: s</hi> confession, from their coming into <hi>Egypt,</hi> till their return out of that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: above 200 Years. From thence till God gave the <hi>Israelites</hi> a King about 400 Years more, our <hi>A</hi>— gives but a very slender account of it, nor indeed all that time are there the least Footsteps of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or Regal Government amongst them.

               <p>All these premises having, as I think, been clearly made out, it is impossible that the Rulers now on Earth, should make any benefit, or derive any the least shadow of Authority from that, which is held to be the Fountain of all Power, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams Private Dominion and Paternal Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> so that, he that will not give just occasion, to think that all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, is the product only of Force and Violence, and that Men live together by no other Rules but that of Beasts, where the strongest carries it, and so lay a Foundation for perpetual Disorder and Mischeif, Tumult, Sedition and Rebellion, (things that the followers of that Hipothesis so loudly cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst) must of necessity find out another rise of Government, another Original of Political Power, and another way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing and knowing the Persons that have it, then what Sr. <hi>Robt.

Children, a Master over his Servant, a Husband over his Wife, and a Lord over his Slave.

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the State of Nature.</head>
               <p n="4">4. TO understand Political Power a right, and derive it from its Original, we must consider what Estate all Men are naturally in, and that is, a State of perfect Freedom to order their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and dispose of their Possessions, and Persons as they think fit, within the bounds of the Law of Nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the Will of any other Man.</p>
               <p>A State also of Equality, wherein all the Power and Jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more then another, there being nothing more evident, then that Creatures of the same species and rank promiscuously born to all the same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Nature, and the use of the same faculties, should also be equal one amongst another without Subordination or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, unless the Lord and Master of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96077:116"/>
them all, should by any manifest Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Will set one above another, and confer on him by an evident and clear appointment an undoubted Right to Dominion and Sovereignty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This equality of Men by Nature, the Judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> looks upon as so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it self, and beyond all question, that he makes it the Foundation of that Obligation to mutual Love amongst Men, on which he Builds the Duties they owe one another, and from whence he derives the great Maxims <hi>of Iustice</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> His words are;
<q>The like natural inducement, hath brought Men to know that it is no less their Duty, to Love others then themselves, for seeing those things which are equal, must needs all have one measure; If I cannot but wish to receive good, even as much at every Mans hands, as any Man can wish unto his own Soul, how should I look to have any part of my desire herein satisfied, unless my self be careful to satisfie the like desire, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in other Men weak, being of one and the same nature; to have any thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them repugnant to this desire, must needs in all respects grieve them as much as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96077:117"/>
me, so that if I do harm, I must look to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, there being no reason that others should shew greater measure of love to me, then they have, by me, shewed unto them; my desire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be loved of my equals in nature, as much as possible may be, imposeth upon me a natural Duty of bearing to themward, fully the like affection; From which relation of equality between our selves and them, that are as our selves, what several Rules and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, natural reason hath drawn for direction of life, no Man is Ignorant. <hi>Eccl. Pol. Li. 1.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But though this be a State of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet it is not a State of Licence, though Man in that State have an uncontroleable Liberty, to dispose of his Person or Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, yet he has not Liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy himself, or so much as any Creature in his Possession, but where some nobler use, then its bare Preservation calls for it. The State of Nature, has a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to govern it, which obliges every one, and reason, which is that Law, teaches all Mankind, who will but consult it; That being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his Life, Health, Liberty or Possessions; for Men being all the Workmanship of one Omnipotent,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96077:117"/>
and infinitely wise maker: All the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of one Sovereign Master, sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World by his order and about his business. They are his Property, whose Workmanship they are made to last during his, not one anothers Pleasure. And being Furnished with like Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, sharing all in one Community of Nature, there cannot be supposed any such Subordination among us, that may Authorize us to destroy one another, as if we were made for one anothers uses, as the inferior ranks of Creatures are for ours, every one as he is bound to preserve himself, and not to quit his Station willfully, so by the like reason when his own Preservation comes not in competition, ought he as much as he can to preserve the rest of Mankind, and not unless it be to do Justice on an offender, take a way, or impair the the life, or what tends to the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Life, the Liberty, Health, Limb or Goods of another.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And that all Men may be restrained from invading others Rights, and from doing hurt to one another, and the Law of Nature be observed, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Peace and Preservation of all
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96077:118"/>
Mankind, the Execution of the Law of Nature is in that State, put into every Mans hands, whereby every one has a Right to punish the transgressors of that Law to such a Degree, as may hinder its Violation. For the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would, as all other Laws that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Men in this World, be in vain, if there were no body that in the State of Nature, had a Power to Execute that Law, and thereby preserve the innocent and restrain offenders, and if any one in the State of Nature may punish another, for any evil he has done, every one may do so. For in that State of perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, where naturally there is no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority or jurisdiction of one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what any may do in Prosecution of that Law, every one must needs have a Right to do.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And thus in the State of Nature, one Man comes by a Power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but yet no Absolute or Arbitrary Power, to use a Criminal when he has got him in his hands, according to the passionate heats, or boundless extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of his own Will, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to him, so far as calm reason and conscience dictates, what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96077:118"/>
to his Transgression, which is so much as may serve for Reparation and Restraint. For these two are the only reasons, why one Man may lawfully do harm to another, which is that we call punishment. In trangressing the Law of Nature, the Offender declares himself to live by another Rule, then that of reason and common equity, which is that measure God has set to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men, for their mutual security, and so he becomes dangerous to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the tye, which is to secure them from injury and violence, being slighted and broken by him, which being a trespass against the whole Species, and the Peace and Safety of it, provided for by the Law of Nature, every Man upon this score, by the Right he hath to preserve Mankind in general, may restrain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and so may bring such evil on any one, who hath transgressed that Law, as may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and by his Example others, from doing the like mischief. And in this case, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, every Man hath a Right to punish the Offender, and be Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:96077:119"/>9. I doubt not but this will seem a very strange Doctrin to some Men, but before they condemn it, I desire them to resolve me by what Right any Prince or State can put to death, or punish an Alien, for any Crime he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in their Country. 'Tis certain their Laws by vertue of any Sanction, they receive from the promulgated Will of the Legislative, reach not a Stranger. They speak not to him, nor if they did, is he bound to hearken to them. The Legislative Authority, by which they are in Force over the Subjects of that Common-wealth, hath no Power over him. Those who have the Supream Power of making Laws in <hi>England, France</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> are to an <hi>Indian,</hi> but like the rest of the World, Men without Authority: And therefore if by the Law of Nature, every Man hath not a Power to punish Offences against it, as he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly Judges the Case to require, I see not how the Magistrates of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, can punish an Alien of another Country, since in reference to him, they can have no more Power, then what every Man naturally may have over another.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:96077:119"/>10. Besides the Crime which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in violating the Laws, and vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the right Rule of reason, whereby a Man so far becomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and declares himself to quit the Principles of Human Nature, and to be a noxious Creature, there is commonly injury done, and some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or other, some other Man, receives damage by his transgression, in which Case he who hath received any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, has besides the Right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment common to him, with other Men, a particular Right, to seek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from him that has done it. And any other Person who finds it just, may also joyn with him that is injur'd, and assist him in recovering from the Offender, so much as may make satisfaction for the harm he has suffer'd.</p>
               <p n="11">11. From these two distinct Rights, the one of Punishing the Crime for restraint, and preventing the like Offence, which right of punishing is in every body; the other of taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, which belongs only to the injured party, comes it to pass that the Magistrate, who by being Magistrate,

hath the common right of punishing put into his hands, can often where the public good demands not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Law, remit the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Criminal Offences by his own Authority, but yet cannot remit the satisfaction due to any Private Man, for the damage he has received. That, he who has suffered the damage has a Right to demand in his own name, and he alone can remit; The damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Person has this Power of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating to himself, the Goods or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Offender, by Right of self Preservation, as every Man has a Power to punish the Crime, to prevent its being committed again, by the Right he has of Preserving all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and doing all reasonable things, he can in order to that end: And thus it is, that every Man in the State of Nature, has a Power to kill a mude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, both to deter others from doing the like injury, which no reparation can compensate, by the Example of the punishment that attends it from every body, and also to secure Men from the attempts of a Criminal, who having renounced reason, the common Rule and Measure God hath given to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96077:120"/>
Mankind, hath by the unjust violence and slaughter, he hath committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, declared War against all Mankind, and therefore may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed as a <hi>Lion</hi> or a <hi>Tiger,</hi> one of those wild Savage Beasts, with whom Men can have no Society nor Security: And upon this is grounded that great Law of Nature, <hi>who so sheddeth Mans Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed.</hi> And <hi>Cain</hi> was so fully convinced, that every one had a Right to destroy such a Criminal, that after the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Brother, he cries out, <hi>every one that findeth me, shall slay me,</hi> so plain was it writ in the Hearts of all Mankind.</p>
               <p n="12">12. By the same reason, may a Man in the State of Nature punish the lesser breaches of that Law; It will perhaps be demanded with death? I answer each transgression, may be punished to that Degree, and with so much Severity as will suffice to make it an ill bargain to the Offender, give him Cause to repent, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie others from doing the like: Every Offence that can be committed in the State of Nature, may in the State of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96077:121"/>
Nature, be also punished, equally, and as far forth, as it may, in a Common-wealth; for though it would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides my present purpose, to enter here into the particulars of the Law of Nature, or its measures of punishment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; yet, it is certain there is such a Law and that too, as intelligible and plain to a rational Creature, and a Studier of that Law, as the positive Laws of Common-wealths, nay possibly plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; As much as reason is easier to be understood, then the Phansies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Contrivances of Men, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary and hidden interests put into Words; For truly, so are a great part of the municipal Laws of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which are only so far Right, as they are founded on the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which they are to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and interpreted.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To this strange Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the State of Nature, every one has the Executive Power of the Law of Nature, I doubt not but it will be objected; That it is unreasonable for Men to be Judges in their own Cases, that self love will make Men partial to themselves and their Friends.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96077:121"/>
And on the other side ill Nature, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Revenge will carry them too far in punishing others. And hence nothing but confusion and disorder will follow, and that therefore God hath certainly appointed Government to restrain the partiality and violence of Men, I easily Grant, that Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is the proper Remedy for the Inconveniences of the State of Nature, which must certainly be Great, where Men may be Judges in their own Case, since 'tis easiy to be imagined, that he who was so unjust as to do his Brother an Injury, will scarce be so just as to condemn himself for it: But I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire those who make this Objection, to remember that Absolute Monarchs are but Men, and if Government is to be the Remedy of those Evils, which necessarily follow from Mens being Judges in their own Cases, and the State of Nature is therefore not to be endured, I desire to know what kind of Government that is, and how much better it is then the State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where one Man commanding a multitude, has the Liberty to be Judge in his own Case, and may do to all his Subjects whatever he pleases,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96077:122"/>
without the least question or controle of those, who Execute his Pleasure? And in whatsoever he doth, whether lead by reason, mistake or passion, must be submitted to? Which Men in the State of Nature are not bound to do one to another. And if he that Judges, Judges amiss in his own, or any other Case, he is answerable for it, to the rest of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="14">14. 'Tis often asked as a mighty Objection, where are, or ever were, there any Men in such a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? To which it may suffice as an answer at present; That since all Princes and Rulers of <hi>Independant</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments all through the World, are in a State of Nature, 'tis plain the World never was, nor never will be, without numbers of Men in that State, I have named all Governors of <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Communities whether they are, or are not, in League with others; For 'tis not every compact, that puts an end to the State of Nature between Men, but only this one of agreeing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether mutually to enter into one Community, and make one body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic, other promises and compacts, Men
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96077:122"/>
may make one with another, and yet still be in the State of Nature. The promises and bargains for Truck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Between the two Men, in <hi>Soldania,</hi> in or between, a <hi>Swiss</hi> and an <hi>Indian,</hi> in the Woods of <hi>America</hi> are binding to them, though they are perfectly in a State of Nature, in reference to one another for Truth, and keeping of Faith belongs to Men, as Men, and not as Members of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p n="15">15. To those that say, there were never any Men in the State of Nature, I will not only oppose the Authority of the Judicious <hi>Hooker, Eccl. Pol.

naturally induced to seek Communion and Fellowship with others, this was the Cause of Mens uniting themselves, at first in Politic Societies.</hi> But I Moreover af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that all Men are naturally in that State, and remain so till by their own consents, they make themselves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of some Politic Society, and I doubt not in the Sequel of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to make it very clear.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. Of the State of War.</head>
               <p n="16">16. THE State of War is a State of Enmity and Destruction; And therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by Word or Action, not a passionate and hasty, but sedate setled Design, upon another Mans Life, puts him in a State of War with him against whom he has declared such an Intention, and so has exposed his Life to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Power to be taken away by him, or any one that joyns with him in his Defence, and espouses his Quarrel, it being reasonable and just I should have a Right to destroy that which threatens me with Destruction; For by the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96077:124"/>
Fundamental Law of Nature, Man being to be preserved, as much as possible, when all cannot be preserved, the safety of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is to be preferred: And one may destroy a Man who makes War upon him, or has discovered an Enmity to his being for the same Reason, that he may kill a Wolf or a Lion, because they are not under the ties of the Common Law of Reason, have no other Rule, but that of Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and so may be treated as a Beast of Prey, those dangerous and noxious Creatures that will be sure to destroy him, whenever he falls into their Power.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And hence it is that he who attempts to get an other Man into his Absolute Power, does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by put himself into a State of War with him; It being to be understood as a Declaration of a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96077:124"/>
Design upon his Life. For I have reason to conclude, that he who would get me into his Power without my Consent, would use me as he pleased when he had got me there, and destroy me too when he had a phansy to it; for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can desire to have me in his Absolute Power, unless it be to compel me by force to that which is against the Right of my Freedom, <hi>i. e.</hi> make me a Slave. To be free from such force, is the only security of my Preservation, and reason bids me look on him, as an Enemy to my Preservation, who would take away that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is the Fence to it, so that he who makes an attempt to enslave me, thereby puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a State of War with me. He that in the State of Nature, would take away the Freedom that belongs to any one in that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96077:125"/>
State, must necessarily be supposed to have a design to take away every thing else, that Freedom being the Foundation of all the rest: As he that in the State of Society, would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Freedom belonging to those of that Society or Common-wealth, must be supposed to design to take away from them every thing else, and so be looked on as in a State of War.</p>
               <p n="18">18. This makes it Lawful for a Man to kill a Theif, who has not in the least hurt him, nor declared any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon his Life, any farther then by the use of Force, so to get him in his Power, as to take away his Money, or what he pleases from him, because using force, where he has no Right to get me into his Power, let his pretence be what it will, I have no reason to suppose, that he, who would take away my Liberty, would not when he had me in his Power, take away every thing else. And therefore it is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to treat him, as one who has put himself into a State of War with me, <hi>i. e.</hi> kill him if I can; For to that hazard does he justly expose himself, whoever introduces a State of War, and is aggresser in it.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:96077:125"/>19. And here we have the plain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the State of Nature, and the State of War, which however some Men have confounded, are as far distant as a State of Peace, Goodwill, mutual Assistance, and Preservation; and a State of Enmity, Malice, Violence and Mutual Destruction are one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Men living together according to reason without a common Superior on Earth, with Authority to judge between them, is properly the State of Nature. But force, or a declared design of force upon the Person of another, where there is no common Superior on Earth to appeal to for relief, is the State of War: And 'tis the want of such an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal gives a Man the Right of War e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against an aggressor, though he be in Society and a fellow Subject. Thus a Theif whom I cannot harm, but by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Law, for having stolen all that I am worth, I may kill when he sets on me to rob me, but of my Horse or Coat, because the Law which was made for my Preservation, where it cannot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to secure my Life from present force, which if lost, is capeable of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, permits me my own Defence, and the Right of War, a liberty to kill the aggressor, because the aggressor allows
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96077:126"/>
not time to appeal to our common Judge, nor the decision of the Law, for reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a Case where the mischief may be irreparable. Want of a common Judge with Authority, puts all Men in a State of Nature; Force without Right, upon a Mans Person, makes a State of War both where there is, and is not, a common Judge.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But when the actual force is over, the State of War ceases between those that are in Society, and are equally on both sides Subject to the Judge: And therefore in such controversies, where the question is put, <hi>who shall be Iudge?</hi> It cannot be meant, who shall decide the controversie: every one knows what <hi>Iephtha</hi> here tells us, that <hi>the Lord the Iudge,</hi> shall Judge. Where there is no Judge on Earth, the Appeal lies to God in Heaven. That question then cannot mean who shall Judge, whether ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put himself in a State of War with me, and whether I may as <hi>Iephtha</hi> did appeal to Heaven in it? Of that I my self can only be Judge in my own Conscience, as I will answer it at the great day, to the Supream Judge of all Men.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of SLAVERY.</head>
               <p n="22">22. THE natural Liberty of Man is to be free from any Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Power on Earth, and not to be under the Will or Legislative Authority of Man, but to have only the Law of Nature for his Rule. The Liberty of Man, in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, is to be under no other Legislative Power, but that established, by consent, in the Commonwealth; nor under the Dominion of any Will, or Restraint of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Law, but what that Legislative shall enact, according to the Trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sr. <hi>R. F.</hi> tells us, <hi>O. A.</hi> 55. <hi>A Liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tyed by any Laws</hi>: but Freedom of Men, under Government, is, to have a standing Rule to live by, common to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of that Society, and made by the Legislative Power erected in it. A Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to follow my own Will in all things, where that Rule prescribes not; not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, Arbitrary Will of another Man. As Freedom of Nature is to be under no other restraint but the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:96077:127"/>23. This Freedom from Absolute, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, is so necessary to, and closely joyned with a Man's Preservation, that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his Preservation and Life together. For a Man, not having the Power of his own Life, cannot, by Compact, or his own Consent, enslave himself to any one, nor put himself under the Absolute, Arbitrary Power of another, to take away his Life, when he pleases. No body can give more Power than he has himself; and he that cannot take away his own Life, cannot give another Power over it. Indeed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by his fault, forfeited his own Life, by some Act that deserves Death; he, to whom he has forfeited it, may (when he has him in his Power) delay to take it, and make use of him to his own service; and he does him no injury by it. For, when-ever he finds the hardship of his Slavery out-weigh the value of his Life, 'tis in his Power, by resisting the Will of his Master, to draw on himself the Death he desires.</p>
               <p n="24">24. This is the perfect condition of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which is nothing else, but the State of War continued, between a lawful Conquerour, and a Captive. For, if once Compact enter between them, and make an agreement for a limited Power on the one
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96077:127"/>
side, and Obedience, on the other; the State of War and Slavery ceases, as long as the Compact endures. For, as has been said, no Man can, by agreement, pass over to another that which he hath not in himself, a Power over his own Life.</p>
               <p>I confess, we find among the <hi>Iews,</hi> as well as other Nations, that Men did sell themselves; but, 'tis plain, this was only to Drudgery, not to Slavery. For, it is evident, the Person sold was not under an Absolute, Arbitrary, Despotical Power. For the Master could not have Power to kill him, at any time, whom, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, he was obliged to let go free out of his service: And the Master of such a Servant was so far from having an Arbitrary Power over his Life, that he could not, at pleasure, so much as maim him, but the Loss of an Eye, or Tooth, set him free, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXI.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. Of PROPERTY.</head>
               <p n="25">25. WHether we consider natural Reason, which tells us, that Men, being once born, have a right to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96077:128"/>
their Preservation, and consequently to Meat and Drink, and such other things, as Nature affords for their Subsistence: Or <hi>Revelation,</hi> which gives us an account of those Grants God made of the World to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Sons; 'tis very clear, that God, as K. <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>Psal.</hi> CXV. xvj. <hi>has given the earth to the Children of men,</hi> given it to Mankind in common. But this being supposed, it seems to some a very great difficulty how any one should ever come to have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in any thing; I will not content my self to answer, That if it be difficult to make out <hi>Property,</hi> upon a supposition, That God gave the World to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity in common; it is impossible that any Man, but one universal Monarch, should have any <hi>Property</hi> upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That God gave the World to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Heirs in Succession, exclusive of all the rest of his Posterity. But I shall endeavour to shew, how Men might come to have a Property in several parts of that which God gave to Mankind in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and that without any express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact of all the Commoners.</p>
               <p n="26">26. God, who hath given the World to Men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of life, and convenience. The Earth, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96077:128"/>
all that is therein, is given to Men for the Support and Comfort of their being. And though all the Fruits it naturally produces, and Beasts it feeds, belong to Mankind in common, as they are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the spontaneous hand of Nature: and no body has originally a private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, exclusive of the rest of Mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of Men, there must, of necessity, be a means to appropriate them some way or other before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular Men. The Fruit, or Venison which nourishes the wild <hi>Indian,</hi> who knows no Inclosure, and is still a Tenant in common, must be his, and so his, <hi>i.e.</hi> a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his Life.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Though the Earth, and all inferior Creatures be common to all Men, yet every Man has a <hi>Property</hi> in his own <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> This no Body has any Right to but himself. The <hi>Labour</hi> of his Body, and the <hi>Work</hi> of his Hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves out of the State that Nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his Labour with it, and joined to it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96077:129"/>
that is his own, and thereby makes it his Property. It being by him removed from the common state Nature placed it in, it hath by this labour something an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, that excludes the common right of other Men. For this <hi>labour</hi> being the unquestionable Property of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, no Man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others.</p>
               <p n="28">28. He that is nourished by the Acorns he pickt up under an Oak, or the Apples he gathered from the Trees in the Wood; has certainly appropriated them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. No Body can deny but the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is his. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? When he digested? or when he eat? Or when he boiled? Or when he brought them home? Or when he pickt them up? And 'tis plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could. That labour put a distinction between them and common. That added something to them more than Nature, the common Mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right. And will any one say he had no right to those Acorns or Apples he thus appropriated, because he had not the consent of all Mankind to make them his? Was it a Robbery thus
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96077:129"/>
to assume to himself what belonged to all in Common? If such a consent as that was necessary, Man had starved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Plenty God had given him. We see in Commons, which remain so by Compact, that 'tis the taking any part of what is common, and removing it out of the state Nature leaves it in, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Property; without which the Common is of no use. And the taking of this or that part, does not depend on the express consent of all the Commoners. Thus the Grass my Horse has bit; the Turfs my Servant has cut; and the Ore I have dig'd in any place where I have a right to them in common with others, become my Property, without the assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or consent of any body. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my Property in them.</p>
               <p n="29">29. By making an explicit consent of every Commoner, necessary to any ones appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common. Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants could not cut the Meat which their Father or Master had provided for them in common, without assigning to every one his peculiar part. Though the Water running in the Fountain be every ones; yet who can doubt but that in the Pitcher
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96077:130"/>
is his only who drew it out? His labour hath taken it out of the hands of Nature where it was common, and belong'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to all her Children, and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appropriated it to himself.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Thus this Law of reason makes the Deer, that <hi>Indian</hi>'s who hath killed it; 'tis allowed to be his goods who hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his labour upon it, though before, it was the common right of every one. And amongst those who are counted the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd part of Mankind, who have made and multiplied positive Laws to determine Property, this original Law of Nature for the beginning of Property, in what was before common, still takes places; and by vertue thereof, what Fish any one catches in the Ocean, that great and still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Common of Mankind; or what Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergriese any one takes up here, is by the labour that removes it out of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon state Nature left it in, made his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty who takes that pains about it. And even amongst us the Hare that any one is Hunting, is thought his who pursues her during the Chase. For being a Beast that is still looked upon as common, and no Man's private Possession; who-ever has imploy'd so much labour about any of that kind, as to find and pursue her, has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by removed her from the state of Nature
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96077:130"/>
wherein she was common, and hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Property.</p>
               <p n="31">31. It will perhaps be objected to this, That if gathering the Acorns, or other Fruits of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes a right to them, then any one may ingross as much as he will. To which I Answer, Not so. The same Law of Nature that does by this means give us Property, does also bound that Property too. <hi>God has given us all things richly,</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 12. Is the Voice of Reason confirmed by Inspiration. But how far has he given it us, <hi>to enjoy?</hi> As much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils; so much he may by his labour fix a Property in. Whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others. Nothing was made by God for Man to spoil or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy. And thus considering the plenty of natural Provisions there was a long time in the World, and the few spenders, and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one Man could extend it self, and ingross it to the prejudice of others; especially keeping within the bounds set by reason of what might serve for his use; there could be then little room for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels or contentions about Property so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd.</p>
               <p n="32">
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:96077:131"/>32. But the chief matter of Property being now not the Fruits of the Earth, and the Beasts that subsist on it, but the Earth it self; as that which takes in and carries with it all the rest: I think it is plain, that Property in that too is acquired as the former. As much Land as a Man Tills, Plants, Improves, Cultivates, and can use the Product of; so much is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. He by his labour does as it were inclose it from the Common. Nor will it invalidate his right to say, Every body else has an equal title to it; and therefore he cannot appropriate, he cannot inclose, without the consent of all his Fellow-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, all Mankind. God when he gave the World in common to all Mankind, commanded Man also to labour, and the penury of his Condition required it of him. God and his Reason commanded him to subdue the Earth, <hi>i. e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> improve it for the benefit of Life, and therein lay out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon it that was his own, his labour. He that in obedience to this Command of God, subdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it something that was his Property, which another had no Title to, nor could without injury take from him.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Nor was this appropriation of any parcel of Land, by improving it, any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96077:131"/>
to any other Man, since there was still enough, and as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that in effect, there was never the less left for others because of his inclosure for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For he that leaves as much as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No Body could think himself injur'd by the drinking of another Man, though he took a good draught, who had a whole River of the same Water left him to quench his thirst. And the Case of Land and Water, where there is enough of both, is perfectly the same.</p>
               <p n="34">34. God gave the World to Men in Common, but since he gave it them for their benefit, and the greatest Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Life they were capable to draw from it; it cannot be supposed he meant it should always remain common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated. He gave it to the use of the industrious and rational, (and labour was to be his title to it;) not to the phancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious. He that had as good left for his improvement, as was already taken up, needed not complain, ought not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with what was already improved by another's labour: if he did, 'tis plain he desired the benefit of anothers pains which he had no right to, and not the ground
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96077:132"/>
which God had given him in common with others to labour on, and whereof there was as good left as that already pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed; and more than he knew what to do with, or his industry could reach to.</p>
               <p n="35">35. 'Tis true, in Land that is common in <hi>England,</hi> or any other Country, where there is plenty of people under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who have Money and commerce, no one can inclose or appropriate any part, without the consent of all his Fellow-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners: Because this is left common by Compact, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Law of the Land, which is not to be violated. And though it be Common, in respect of some Men, it is not so to all Mankind; but is the joint propriety of this Country, or this Parish. Besides, the remainder, after such inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, would not be as good to the rest of the Commoners as the whole was, when they could all make use of the whole; whereas in the beginning and first peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of the great Common of the World, it was quite otherwise. The Law Man was under was rather for appropriating. God Commanded, and his wants forced him to labour. That was his Property which could not be taken from him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had fixed it. And hence subduing or cultivating the Earth, and having Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96077:132"/>
we see, are join'd together. The one gave Title to the other. So that God, by commanding to subdue, gave Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity so far to appropriate. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of humane Life, which requires la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and materials to work on, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily introduce private Possessions.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The measure of Property, Nature well set, by the Extent of Mens Labour, and the Conveniency of Life: no Man's Labour could subdue, or appropriate all; nor could his Enjoyment consume more than a small part; so that it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Man, this way, to intrench upon the Right of another, or acquire, to himself, a Property, to the Prejudice of his Neighbour, who would still have room, for as good, and as large a Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (after the other had taken out his) as before it was appropriated; which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure did confine every Man's Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, to a very moderate Proportion, and such as he might appropriate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, without Injury to any Body, in the first Ages of the World, when Men were more in danger to be lost, by wandering from their Company, in the then vast Wilderness of the Earth, than to be striatned for want of room to plant in. And the same measure may be allowed still, without prejudice to any Body, as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96077:133"/>
full as the World seems. For supposing a Man, or Family, in the state they were at first, peopling of the World by the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi>; let him plant in some in-land, vacant places of <hi>America,</hi> we shall find that the Possessions, he could make himself, upon the measures we have given, would not be very large, nor, even to this day, prejudice the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or give them reason to complain, or think themselves injured by this Man's Incroachment, though the Race of Men have now spread themselves to all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the World, and do infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the small number was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Nay the extent of Ground is of so little value, without Labour, that I have heard it affirmed, that, in <hi>Spain</hi> it self, a Man may be permitted to plough, sow, and reap, without being disturbed, upon Land he has no other Title to, but only his making use of it. But, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Inhabitants think themselvs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him, who, by his Industry, on neglected, and consequently waste Land, has increased the stock of Corn, which they wanted. But be this as it will, which I lay no stress on; this I dare boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the same Rule of Propriety, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that every Man should have as much as he could make use of, would
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96077:133"/>
hold still in the World, without strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any body, since there is Land enough in the World, to suffice double the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, had not the Invention of Money, and the tacit Agreement of Men, to put a value on it, introduced (by Consent) larger Possessions, and a Right to them; which, how it has done, I shall, by and by, shew more at large.</p>
               <p n="37">37. This is certain, That in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the desire of having more than Men needed, had altered the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick value of things, which depends only on their usefulness to the Life of Man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow Metal, which would keep without wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or decay, should be worth a great piece of Flesh, or a whole heap of Corn; though Men had a Right to appropriate, by their Labour, each one to himself, as much of the things of Nature, as he could use: yet this could not be much, nor to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of others, where the same plenty was still left, to those who would use the same Industry.</p>
               <p>Before the Appropriation of Land, he who gathered as much of the wild Fruit, killed, caught, or tamed as many of the Beasts as he could; he that so employed his Pains about any of the spontaneous Products of Nature, as any way to alter
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96077:134"/>
them, from the state Nature put them in, by placing any of his Labour on them, did thereby acquire a Propriety in them: but if they perished, in his Possession, without their due use; if the Fruits rotted, or the Venison putrified, before he could spend it, he offended against the common Law of Nature, and was liable to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; he invaded his Neighbour's share, for he had no Right, farther than his Use called for any of them, and they might serve to afford him Conveniencies of Life.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The same measures governed the Possession of Land too: Whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it spoiled, that was his peculiar Right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could feed, and make use of, the Cattle and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was also his. But if either the Grass of his Inclosure rotted on the Ground, or the Fruit of his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of the Earth, notwithstanding his Inclosure, was still to be looked on as Waste, and might be the Possession of any other. Thus, at the beginning, <hi>Cain</hi> might take as much Ground as he could till, and make it his own Land, and yet leave enough to <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sheep to feed on; a few Acres would serve for both their Possessions. But as
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96077:134"/>
Families increased, and industry inlarged their stocks, their Possessions inlarged with the need of them; but yet it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without any fixed property in the ground they made use of, till they incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, setled themselves together, and built Cities, and then, by consent, they came in time, so set out the bounds of their distinct Territories, and agree on limits between them and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and by Laws within themselves, setled the Properties of those of the same Society. For we see, that in that part of the World which was first inhabited, and therefore like to be best peopled, even as low down as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with their Flocks, and their Herds, which was their substance, freely up and down; and this <hi>Abraham</hi> did, in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he was a stranger. Whence it is plain, that, at least, a great part of the Land lay in Common. That the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants valued it not, nor claimed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in any more than they made use of. But when there was not room enough in the same place, for their Herds to feed together, they, by consent, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> xiii. 5. separated and inlarged their Pasture, where it best liked
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96077:135"/>
them. And for the same Reason <hi>Esau</hi> went from his Father, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and planted in <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> Gen. xxxvi. 6.</p>
               <p n="39">39. And thus, without supposing any private Dominion, and property in <hi>Adam,</hi> over all the World, exclusive of all other Men, which can no way be proved, nor any ones Property be made out from it; but supposing the World given as it was to the Children of Men in common, we see how labour could make Men distinct titles to several parcels of it, for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uses; wherein there could be no doubt of right, no room for quarrel.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Nor is it so strange as perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consideration it may appear, that the Property of labour should be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance the Community of Land. For 'tis labour indeed that puts the difference of value on every thing; and let any one consider, what the difference is between an Acre of Land planted with Tabaco, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96077:135"/>
of labour makes the far greater part of the value. I think it will be but a very modest Computation to say, that of the Products of the Earth useful to the Life of Man 9/10 are the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts of labour: nay, if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several expences about them, what in them is purely owing to Nature, and what to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we shall find, that in most of them 99/100 are wholly to be put on the account of labour.</p>
               <p n="41">41. There cannot be a clearer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of any thing, than several Nations of the <hi>Americans</hi> are of this, who are rich in Land, and poor in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life; whom Nature having fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as liberally as any other people, with the materials of Plenty, <hi>i. e.</hi> a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soil, apt to produce in abundance, what might serve for food, rayment, and delight; yet for want of improving it by labour, have not 1/100 part of the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies we enjoy. And a King of a large and fruitful Territory there, feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a day Labourer in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="42">
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:96077:136"/>42. To make this a little clearer, let us but trace some of the ordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Life, through their several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses, before they come to our use, and see how much they receive of their value from human industry. Bread, Wine and Cloth are things of daily use and great plenty, yet notwithstanding Acorns, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Leaves, or Skins, must be our Bread, Drink and Cloathing, did not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour furnish us with these more useful Commodities. For whatever Bread is more worth than Acorns, Wine than Water, and Cloth or Silk than Leaves, Skins or Moss, that is wholly owing to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and industry. The one of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the food and rayment which unas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted Nature furnishes us with; the other Provisions which our industry and pains prepare for us, which how much they exceed the other in value, when any one hath computed, he will then see how much labour makes the far greatest part of the value of things we enjoy in this World: and the ground which produces the materials, is scarce to be reckon'd in as any, or at most, but a very small part of it: so little, that even amongst us, Land
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96077:136"/>
that is left wholly to Nature, that hath no improvement of Pasturage, Tillage, or Planting, is called, as indeed it is, wast; and we shall find the benefit of it amount to little more than nothing.</p>
               <p n="43">43. An Acre of Land that bears here Twenty Bushels of Wheat, and another in <hi>America,</hi> which, with the same Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, would do the like, are, without doubt, of the same natural, intrinsick Value. But yet the Benefit Mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from one in a Year is worth 5<hi>l.</hi> and the other possibly not worth a Penny; if all the Profit an <hi>Indian</hi> received from it were to be valued, and sold here; at least, I may truly say, not 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>000. 'Tis Labour then which puts the greatest part of Value upon Land, without which it would scarcely be worth any thing; 'tis to that we owe the greatest part of all its useful Products; for all that the Straw, Bran, Bread, of that Acre of Wheat, is more worth than the Product of an Acre of as good Land, which lies waste, is all the Effect of Labour. For 'tis not barely the Plough-man's Pains, the Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's and Thresher's Toil, and the Baker's
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96077:137"/>
Sweat, is to be counted into the Bread we eat; the Labour of those who broke the Oxen, who digged and wrought the Iron and Stones, who felled and framed the Timber imployed about the Plough, Mill, Oven, or any other Utensils, which are a vast Number, requisite to this Corn, from its sowing to its being made Bread, must all be charged on the account of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and received as an effect of that: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Earth furnished only the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most worthless Materials, as in themselves. 'Twould be a strange Catalogue of things, that Industry provided and made use of, about every Loaf of Bread before it came to our use, if we could trace them; Iron, Wood, Leather, Bark, Timber, Stone, Bricks, Coals, Lime, Cloth, Dying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Drugs, Pitch, Tar, Masts, Ropes, and all the Materials made use of in the Ship, that brought any of the Commodities, made use of by any of the Work-men, to any part of the Work, all which, 'twould be almost impossible, at least too long, to reckon up.</p>
               <p n="44">44. From all which it is evident, that tho' the things of Nature are given in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96077:137"/>
common: Man (by being Master of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and Proprietor of his own Person, and the Actions or Labour of it) had still in himself the great Foundation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: and that which made up the great part of what he applyed to the Support or Comfort of his being, when Invention and Arts had improved the conveniencies of Life, was perfectly his own, and did not belong in common to others.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Thus Labour, in the beginning, gave a Right of Property, where ever any one was pleased to imploy it, upon what was common, which remained, a long while, the far greater part, and is yet more than Mankind makes use of. Men, at first, for the most part, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves with what un-assisted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offered to their Necessities; and though afterwards, in some parts of the World, where the Increase of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Stock, with the Use of Money, had made Land scarce, and so of some Value, the several Communities setled the Bounds of their distinct Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and, by Laws, within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, regulated the Properties of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96077:138"/>
private Men of their Society, and so, by Compact and Agreement, setled the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which Labour and Industry began. And the Leagues, that have been made between several States and Kingdoms, either expresly or tacitly dis-owning all Claim and Right to the Land in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Possession, have, by common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, given up their Pretences to their natural common Right, which original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had to those Countries: and so have, by positive Agreement, settled a Property amongst themselves, in distinct Parts of the World; yet there are still great Tracts of Ground to be found, which the Inhabitants thereof, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving joyned with the rest of Mankind, in the consent of the Use of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Money, lye waste, and are more than the People, who dwell on it, do, or can make use of, and so still lye in common. Though this can scarce happen amongst that part of Mankind that have consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Use of Money.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The greatest part of things really useful to the Life of Man, and such as the necessity of subsisting made the first
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96077:138"/>
Commoners of the World look after, as it doth the <hi>Americans</hi> now, are generally things of short duration, such as, if they are not consumed by use, will decay and perish of themselves. Gold, Silver, and Diamonds, are things, that Phancy, or Agreement hath put the Value on, more than real Use, and the necessary Support of Life: Now of those good things which Nature hath provided in common, every one hath a Right (as hath been said) to as much as he could use, and had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in all he could effect with his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: all that his Industry could extend to, to alter from the State Nature had put it in, was his. He that gathered a Hundred Bushels of Acorns or Apples, had thereby a Property in them; they were his Goods, as soon as gathered. He was only to look that he used them before they spoiled; else he took more than his share, and robb'd others. And indeed it was a foolish thing, as well as dishonest, to hoard up more than he could make use of. If he gave away a part to any body else, so that it perished not uselesly in his Possession, these he also made use of. And if he also bartered away Plumbs, that would have rotted in a Week',
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96077:139"/>
for Nuts that would last good for his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a whole Year, he did no injury; he wasted not the common Stock; destroyed no part of the portion of Goods that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to others, so long as nothing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished uselesly in his hands. Again, If he would give his Nuts for a piece of Metal, pleased with its colour; or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his Sheep for Shells, or Wooll for a sparkling Pebble or a Diamond, and keep those by him all his Life, he inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the Right of others; he might heap up as much of these durable things as he pleased: the exceeding of the bounds of his just Property not lying in the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Possession, but the perishing of any thing uselesly in it.</p>
               <p n="47">47. And thus came in the use of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, some lasting thing that Men might keep without spoiling, and that, by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual consent, Men would take in exchange for the truly useful, but perishable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Life.</p>
               <p n="48">48. And as different degrees of Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry were apt to give Men Possessions in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96077:139"/>
different Proportions, so this Invention of Money gave them the opportunity to continue and enlarge them. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing an Island, separate from all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commerce with the rest of the World, wherein there were but a Hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but there were Sheep, Horses and Cowes, with other useful Animals, wholesome Fruits, and Land enough for Corn, for a Hundred thousand times as many, but nothing in the Island, either because of its Commonness, or perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, fit to supply the Place of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: What reason could any one have there to enlarge his Possessions, beyond the use of his Family, and a plentiful supply to its Consumption, either in what their own Industry produced, or they could barter for like perishable, useful Commodities, with others? Where there is not something both lasting and scarce, and so valuable to be hoarded up, there Men will not be apt to enlarge their Possessions of Land, were it never so rich, never so free for them to take. For I ask, What would a Man value Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, or an Hundred thousand Acres of excellent Land, ready cultivated, and well stocked too with Cattle, in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96077:140"/>
middle of the in-land Parts of <hi>America,</hi> where he had no hopes of Commerce with other parts of the World, to draw Money to him, by the Sale of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It would not be worth the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and we should see him give up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the wild Common of Nature what-ever was more than would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Conveniencies of Life, to be had there, for him and his Family.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Thus in the beginning all the World was <hi>America,</hi> and more so than that is now; for no such thing as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was any where known. Find out something that hath the Use and Value of Money amongst his Neighbours, you shall see the same Man will begin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to enlarge his Possessions.</p>
               <p n="50">50. But since Gold and Silver, being little useful to the Life of Man, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to Food, Rayment, and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, has its value only from the consent of Men, whereof labour yet makes in great part the measure, It is plain, that the consent of Men have agreed to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96077:140"/>
and unequal Possession of the Earth; I mean out of the bounds of Society and Compact: for in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Laws regulate it, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by consent, found out and agreed in a way how a Man may rightfully, and without injury, possess more than he himself can make use of by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gold and Silver, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in a Mans Possession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decaying for the overplus, and agreeing those Metals should have a value.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And thus, I think, it is very easy to conceive, without any difficulty, how labour could at first begin a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Property in the common things of nature, and how the spending it upon our uses bounded it. So that there could then be no reason of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling about title, nor any doubt about the largeness of Possession it gave. Right and Conveniency went together. For as a Man had a right to all he could imploy his labour upon, so he had no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of. This left no room
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96077:141"/>
for Controversie about the title, nor for incroachment on the right of others; what Portion a Man carved to himself, was easily seen; and it was useless as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.</p>

And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we see the Positive Law of God every where joins them together, without distinction, when it commands the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Children, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> Exod. 20. 12. <hi>Whosoever cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his Father or his Mother,</hi> Lev. 20. 9. <hi>Ye shall fear every Man his Mother and his

               <p n="53">53. Had but this one thing been well consider'd, without looking any deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, it might perhaps have kept men from running into those gross mistakes they have made about this Power of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which however it might, without any great harshness, bear the name of Absolute Dominion, and Regal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when under the title of <hi>Paternal</hi> Power, it seem'd appropriated to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; would yet have sounded but odly, and in the very name shewn the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, if this supposed Absolute Power over Children had been called Parental, and thereby discover'd that it belong'd to the Mother too: For it will but very ill serve the turn of those Men who contend so much for the Absolute Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fatherhood, as they call it, that the Mother should have any share in it. And it would have but ill supported the Monarchy they contend for, when by the very name it appeared, that that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Authority from whence they would derive their Government of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Person only, was not plac'd in one, but two Persons jointly. But to let this of names pass.</p>

Though I have said above (2.) <hi>That all Men by Nature are equal</hi>; I cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to understand all sorts of <hi>Equality:</hi> Age or Virtue may give Men a just Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: Excellency of Parts and Merit may place others above the Common Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel: Birth may subject some, and Alliance or Benefits others to pay an Observance to those, to whom Nature, Gratitude or other Respects may have made it due; and yet all this consists with the Equality which all Men are in, in respect of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or Dominion one over another: which was the Equality I there spoke of, as proper to the Business in hand, being that equal Right that every Man hath to his Natural Freedom, without being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Will or Authority of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man.</p>
               <p n="55">55. Children, I confess, are not born in this full state of Equality, though they are born to it. Their Parents have a sort of Rule and Jurisdiction over them when they come into the World, and for some time after, but 'tis but a temporary one. The Bonds of this Subjection are like the Swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cloths they are wrapt up in, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by, in the weakness of their Infancy. Age and Reason as they grow up, loosen them till atlength they drop quite off, and leave a Man at his own free Disposal.</p>

                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:96077:143"/>56. <hi>Adam</hi> was created a perfect Man, his Body and Mind in full possession of their Strength and Reason, and so was capable, from the first Instance of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to provide for his own Support and Preservation, and govern his Actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictates of the Law of Reason God had implanted in him. From him the World is peopled with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants, who are all born Infants, weak and helpless, without Knowledge or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. But to supply the Defects of this imperfect State, till the improvement of Growth and Age had removed them, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and after them all Parents were, by the Law of Nature, under an Obligation to preserve, nourish, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Children they had begotten, not as their own Workmanship, but the Workmanship of their own Maker, the Almighty, to whom they were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for them.</p>
               <p n="57">57. The Law that was to govern <hi>Adam,</hi> was the same that was to govern all his Posterity, the Law of Reason. But his Off-spring having another way of entrance into the World, different from him, by a natural Birth, that produced them igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and without the Use of Reason, they were not presently under that Law: For no Body can be under a Law that is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96077:143"/>
not promulgated to him; and this Law being promulgated or made known by Reason only, he that is not come to the Use of his Reason, cannot be said to be under this Law: and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not presently as soon as born, under this Law of Reason, were not presently free. For Law, in its true Notion, is not so much the Limitation as the direction of a free and intelligent Agent to his proper Interest, and prescribes no farther, than is for the general Good of those under that Law. Could they be happier without it, the Law, as an useless thing, would of it self vanish; and that ill deserves the Name of Confinement, which hedges us in on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Bogs and Precipices. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be mistaken, the end of Law, is not to abolish or restrain, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and enlarge Freedom. For in all the states of created Beings, capable of Laws, where there is no Law there is no Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For, Liberty is, to be free from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and Violence from others, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be where there is no Law, and is not, as we are told, <hi>A Liberty for every Man to do what he lists:</hi> For who could be free, when every other Man's Humour might domineer over him? But a Liberty to dispose and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der freely as he lists his Person, Actions, Possessions, and his whole Property with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96077:144"/>
the Allowance of those Laws, under which he is, and therein not to be subject to the the arbitrary Will of another; but freely follow his own.</p>
               <p n="58">58. The Power, then, that Parents have over their Children, arises from that Duty which is incumbent on them, to take care of their Off-spring, during the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect state of Childhood. To inform the Mind, and govern the Actions of their yet ignorant Nonage, till Reason shall take its place, and ease them of that Trouble, is what the Children want, and the Parents are bound to. For God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given Man an Understanding to direct his Actions, has allowed him a freedom of Will, and liberty of Acting, as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging thereunto, within the bounds of that Law he is under. But whilst he is in an Estate, wherein he has no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of his own to direct his Will, he is not to have any Will of his own to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: He that understands for him, must will for him too; he must prescribe to his Will, and regulate his Actions; but when he comes to the estate that made his Father a Free-man, the Son is a Free-man too.</p>
               <p n="59">59. This holds in all the Laws a Man is under, whether natural or civil. Is a man under the Law of Nature? what made him free of that Law? what gave him a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96077:144"/>
free disposing of his Property, according to his own Will, within the compass of that Law? I answer, an Estate wherein he might be suppos'd capable to know that Law, that so he might keep his Actions within the Bounds of it. When he has acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that state, he is presumed to know how far that Law is to be his Guide, and how far he may make use of his Freedom, and so comes to have it; till then, some body else must guide him, who is presumed to know how far the Law allows a Liberty. If such a state of Reason, such an Age of Discretion made him free, the same shall make his Son free too. Is a Man under the Law of <hi>England?</hi> what made him free of that Law? that is, to have the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to dispose of his Actions and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to his own Will, within the Permission of that Law? A capacity of knowing that Law. Which is supposed, by that Law, at the Age of Twenty one, and in some cases sooner. If this made the Father free, it shall make the Son free too. Till then, we see, the Law allows the Son to have no Will, but he is to be guided by the Will of his Father or Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, who is to understand for him. And if the Father die, and fail to substitute a Deputy in this Trust, if he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Tutor to govern his Son, during
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96077:145"/>
his Minority, during his Want of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Law takes care to do it; some other must govern him, and be a Will to him, till he hath attained to a state of Freedom, and his Understanding be fit to take the Government of his Will. But after that, the Father and Son are equally free, as much as Tutor and Pupil, after Nonage; equally Subjects of the same Law together, without any Dominion left in the Father, over the Life, Liberty, or Estate of his Son, whether they be only in the State, and under the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or under the positive Laws of an Establish'd Government.</p>
               <p n="60">60. But if, through defects, that may happen, out of the ordinary Course of Nature, any one comes not to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reason, wherein he might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed capable of knowing the Law, and so living within the Rules of it, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver capable of being a Free Man; he is never let loose to the disposure of his own Will, because he knows no bounds to it, has not Understanding, its proper Guide; but is continued under the Tuition and Government of others, all the time his own Understanding is uncapable of that Charge. And so Lunaticks and Ideots are never set free from the Government of their Parents; <hi>Children, who are not as
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96077:145"/>
yet come unto those years whereat they may have; and Innocents, which are excluded, by a natural defect, from ever having.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Madmen, which, for the present, cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have the use of right Reason to guide themselves, have, for their Guide, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that guideth other Men, which are Tutors over them, to seek and procure their good for them, says Hooker</hi> Eccl. Pol. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. §. 7. All which seems no more than that Duty which God and Nature has laid on Man, as well as other Creatures, to preserve their Off-spring till they can be able to shift for themselves, and will scarce amount to an instance or proof of Parents Regal Authority.</p>
               <p n="61">61. Thus we are born free, as we are born rational; not that we have actually the Exercise of either: Age that brings one, brings with it the other too. And thus we see how natural Freedom and Subjection to Parents may consist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are both founded on the same Principle. A Child is free by his Father's Title, by his Father's Understanding, which is to govern him, till he hath it of his own. The Freedom of a man, at years of discretion, and the Subjection of a Child to his Parents, whilst yet short of it, are so consistent, and so distinguishable, that the most blinded Contenders for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96077:146"/>
                  <hi>by Right of Fatherhood,</hi> cannot miss of it; the most obstinate cannot but allow of it. For were their Doctrine all true, were the right Heir of <hi>Adam</hi> now known, and, by that Title, setled a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in his Throne; invested with all the Absolute, Unlimited Power Sr. <hi>R. F.</hi> talks of; If he should dye as soon as his Heir were born, must not the Child, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he were never so free, never so much sovereign, be in subjection to his Mother and Nurse, to Tutors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, till Age and Education brought him Reason and Ability to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and others? The Necessities of his Life, the Health of his Body, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his Mind would require him to be directed by the Will of others and not his own: and yet will any one think, that this Restraint and Subjection were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with, or spoiled him of that Liberty or Sovereignty he had a Right to: or gave away his Empire to those who had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Nonage? This Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over him only prepared him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and sooner for it. If any body should ask me, When my Son is of Age to be free; I shall answer, Just when his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch is of Age to govern. <hi>But at what time,</hi> says the judicious <hi>Hooker, Eccl. Pol.</hi> l. 1. §. 6. <hi>a man may be said to have attain'd
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96077:146"/>
so far forth the use of Reason, as sufficeth to make him capable of those Laws whereby he is then bound to guide his Actions: this is a great deal more easie for sense to discern, than for any one, by Skill and Learning, to determine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="62">62. Commonwealths themselves take notice of, and allow, that there is a time when Men are to begin to act like Free Men, and therefore, till that time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not Oaths of Fealty or Allegiance, or other publick owning of, or Submission to the Government of their Countreys.</p>
               <p n="63">63. The Freedom then of Man, and Liberty of acting, according to his own Will, is grounded on his having Reason, which is able to instruct him in that Law he is to govern himself by, and make him know how far he is left to the freedom of his own will. To turn him loose to an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd Liberty, before he has Reason to guide him, is not the allowing him the priviledge of his Nature, to be free; but to thrust him out amongst Brutes, and abandon him to a state as wretched, and as much beneath that of a Man, as theirs. This is that which puts the Authority into the Parents hands to govern the Minority of their Children. God hath made it their business to imploy this Care on their Off-spring, and hath placed in them suitable Inclinations of Tenderness and Concern
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96077:147"/>
to temper this power, to apply it as his Wisdom designed it, to the Childrens good, as long as they should need to be under it.</p>
               <p n="64">64. But what reason can hence advance this Care, of the Parents, due to their Off-spring, into an Absolute, Arbitrary Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Father, whose power reaches no farther, than by such a Discipline, as he finds most effectual, to give such strength and health to their Bodies, such vigour and rectitude to their Minds, as may best fit his Children to be most useful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others; and, if it be necessary to his Condition, to make them work, when they are able, for their own Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence. But, in this power, the Mother too has her share with the Father.</p>
               <p n="65">65. Nay this power so little belongs to the Father, by any peculiar right of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only as he is Guardian of his Children, that when he quits his Care of them, he loses his power over them, which goes along with their Nourishment and Education, to which it is inseparably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and belongs as much to the Foster-Father of an exposed Child, as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Father of another. So little power does the bare act of begetting give a Man over his Issue: if all his Care ends there, and this be all the Title he hath to the Name and Authority of a Father: and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96077:147"/>
what will become of this Paternal Power in that part of the World where one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath more than one Husband at a time? Or in those parts of <hi>America,</hi> where, when the Husband and Wife part, which happens frequently, the Children are all left to the Mother, follow her, and are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under her Care and Provision? And if the Father die whilst the Children are young, do they not naturally every where owe the same Obedience to their Mother, during their Minority, as to their Father, were he alive? And will any one say, that the Mother hath a legislative Power over her Children; that she can make standing Rules, which shall be of perpetual Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by which they ought to regulate all the Concerns of their Property, and bound their Liberty all the course of their Lives, and inforce the observation of them with Capital Punishments? For this is the proper power of the Magistrate, of which the Father hath not so much as the shadow. His Command over his Children, is but temporary, and reaches not their Life or Property. It is but a help to the weakness and imperfection of their Non-age; a Discipline necessary to their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and though a Father may dispose of his own Possessions, as he pleases, when his Children are out of danger of perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96077:148"/>
for want; yet his power extends not to the lives or goods, which either their own industry, or anothers bounty, has made theirs; nor to their liberty neither, when they are once arrived to the infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisement of the years of discretion. The Father's Empire then ceases, and he can from thence forwards no more dispose of the liberty of his Son than that of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man. And it must be far from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, or perpetual Jurisdiction, from which a Man may withdraw himself, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Licence from Divine Authority, to <hi>leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="66">66. But though there be a time when a Child comes to be as free from subjection to the will and Command of his Father, as he himself is free from subjection to the will of any body else, and they are both under no other restraint, but that which is common to them both, whether it be the Law of Nature, or municipal Law of their Country; yet this freedom exempts not a Son from that honour which he ought, by the Law of God and Nature, to pay his Parents. God having made the Parents Instruments in his great design of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the Race of Mankind, and the occasions of Life to their Children, as he hath laid on them an obligation to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96077:148"/>
preserve, and bring up their Off-spring: so he has laid on the Children a perpetual obligation of honouring their Parents, which containing in it an inward esteem and reverence to be shewn by all outward expressions, ties up the Child from any thing that may ever injure or affront, disturb, or endanger the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or life of those from whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his: and engages him in all actions of defence, relief, assistance and comfort of those by whose means he entred into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and has been made capable of any enjoyments of life. From this obligation no State, no freedom, can absolve Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But this is very far from giving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents a power of command over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or an Authority to make Laws, and dispose as they please of their Lives or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. 'Tis one thing to owe honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, gratitude and assistance; another to require an absolute obedience and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The honour due to Parents, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in his Throne owes his Mother, and yet this lessens not his Authority, nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects him to her Government.</p>
               <p n="67">67. The subjection of a minor places in the Father a temporary Government, which terminates with the minority of the Child. And the honour due from a Child, places in the Parents a perpetual right to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96077:149"/>
respect, reverence, support and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to more, or less, as the Father's care, cost and kindness, in his Education, has been more or less. And this ends not with minority, but holds in all parts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a Man's Life. The want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing these two powers which the Father hath in the right of tuition, during minority, and the right of honour all his Life, may perhaps have caused a great part of the mistakes about this matter. For to speak properly of them, the first of these is rather the priviledge of Children, and duty of Parents, than any Prerogative of Paternal Power. The nourishment and Education of their Children, is a Charge so incumbent on Parents for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens good, that nothing can absolve them from taking care of it. And though the power of commanding and chastising them go along with it, yet God hath woven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the principles of humane nature, such a tenderness for their Off-spring, that there is little fear that Parents should use their power with too much rigour; the excess is seldom on the severe side, the strong bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass of nature drawing the other way. And therefore God Almighty, when he would express his gentle dealing with the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> he tells them, that though he chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd them, <hi>he chasten'd them as a man chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96077:149"/>
his Son, Deut.</hi> 8. 5. <hi>i. e.</hi> with tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and affection, and kept them under no severer discipline than what was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely best for them; and had been less kindness to have slacken'd. This is that power to which Children are commanded obedience, that the pains and care of their Parents may not be increased, or ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
               <p n="68">68. On the other side, honour and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all that which gratitude requires to return; for the benefits received by and from them is the indispensible duty of the Child, and the proper priviledge of the Parents. This is intended for the Parents advantage, as the other is for the Childs; though Education, the Parents duty, seems to have most power, because the ignorance and infirmities of Childhood, stand in need of restraint and correction; which is a visible exercise of Rule, and a kind of Dominion. And that duty which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the word <hi>honour,</hi> requires less obedience, though the obligation be stronger on grown than younger Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For who can think the Command, <hi>Children obey your Parents,</hi> requires in a Man that has Children of his own, the same submission to his Father, as it does in his yet young Children to him; and that by this Precept, he were bound to obey
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96077:150"/>
all his Father's Commands, if out of a conceit of authority he should have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion to treat him still as a Boy.</p>
               <p n="69">69. The first part then of Paternal Power, or rather Duty, which is Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, belongs so to the Father, that it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates at a certain season; when the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Education is over it ceases of it self; and is also alienable before. For a Man may put the tuition of his Son in other hands; and he that has made his Son an Apprentice to another, has discharged him, during that time, of a great part of his Obedience, both to himself and to his Mother. But all the duty of honour, the other part, remains never the less entire to them; nothing can cancel that. It is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from them both, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Authority cannot dispossess the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this right, nor can any Man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Son from honouring her that bore him. But both these are very far from a power to make Laws, and inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Penalties, that may reach Estate, Liberty, Limbs and Life. The power of Commanding ends with Non-age; and though after that, honour and respect, support and defence, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever gratitude can oblige a Man to, for the highest benefits he is naturally capable of, be always due from a Son to his Parents;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96077:150"/>
yet all this puts no Scepter into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's hand, no Soveraign Power of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding. He has no Dominion over his Sons property or actions, nor any right that his Will should prescribe to his Sons in all things; however it may become his Son in many things, not very inconvenient to him and his Family, to pay a Deference to it.</p>
               <p n="70">70. A Man may owe honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to an ancient or wise Man; defence to his Child or Friend; relief and support to the distressed; and gratitude to a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; to such a degree, that all he has, all he can do, cannot sufficiently pay it. But all these give no Authority, no right of making Laws to any one over him from whom they are owing. And 'tis plain, all this is due, not to the bare title of Father; not only because, as has been said, it is owing to the Mother too: but because these obligations to Parents, and the degrees of what is required of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, may be varied by the different care and kindness, trouble and expence, is often imployed upon one Child more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="71">71. This shews the reason how it comes to pass, that Parents in Societies, where they themselves are Subjects, retain a power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Children, and have as much
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96077:151"/>
right to their Subjection, as those who are in the state of Nature, which could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be, if all political Power were only paternal, and that, in truth, they were one and the same thing: for then, all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power being in the Prince, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject could naturally have none of it; but these two Powers, political and paternal, are so perfectly distinct and separate, and built upon so different Foundations, and given to so different Ends, that every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that is a Father, has as much a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power over his Children, as the Prince has over his. And every Prince that has Parents, owes them as much filial Duty and Obedience, as the meanest of his Subjects do to theirs; and can therefore contain, not any part or degree of that kind of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which a Prince, or Magistrate has over his Subject.</p>
               <p n="72">72. Though the Obligation on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to bring up their Children, and the Obligation on Children to honour their Parents, contain all the Power on the one hand, and Submission on the other, which are proper to this Relation; yet there is another Power, ordinarily, in the Father, whereby he has a tye on the Obedience of his Children, which, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with other men, yet the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of shewing it, almost constantly
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96077:151"/>
happening to Fathers in their private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and in Instances of <hi>it</hi> else-where being rare, and less taken notice of, it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the World for a part of <hi>paternal Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</hi> And this is the Power Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have, to bestow their Estates on those who please them best. The Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Father, being the Expectation and Inheritance of the Children ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in certain proportions, according to the Law and Custom of each Country; yet it is commonly in the Father's Power to bestow it with a more sparing or liberal hand, according as the Behaviour of this or that Child hath comported with his Will and Humour.</p>
               <p n="73">73. This is no small Tye to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Children: and there being always annexed to the Enjoyment of Land, a Submission to the Government of the Country, of which that Land is a part. It has been commonly suppos'd, That, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could oblige his Posterity to that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of which he himself was a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that his Compact held them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, it being only a necessary Condition annex'd to the Land, which is under that Government, reaches only those who will take it on that Condition, and so is no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tye or Engagement, but a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Submission. For every Man's Children
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:96077:152"/>
being, by Nature, as free as himself, or any of his Ancestours ever were, may, whilst they are in that Freedom, choose what Society they will join themselves to, what Commonwealth they will put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under. But if they will enjoy the Inheritance of their Ancestours, they must take it on the same terms their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours had it, and submit to all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, annex'd to such a Possession. By this Power indeed, Fathers oblige their Children to Obedience to themselves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are past Minority, and most commonly too, subject them to this or that political Power. But neither of these by any peculiar right of Father-hood, but by the Reward they have in their hands to inforce and recompence such a Compliance; and is no more Power than what a <hi>French</hi>-man has over an <hi>English</hi>-man, who by the hopes of an Estate he will leave him, will certainly have a strong tye on his Obedience: and if when it is left him, he will enjoy it, he must certainly take it upon the Conditions annex'd to the Possession of Land, in that Country where it lies, whether it be <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="74">74. To conclude then, though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Power of commanding, extends no farther than the Minority of his Children, and to a degree only fit for the Discipline,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96077:152"/>
and Government of that Age. And though that Honour and Respect, and all that which the <hi>Latins</hi> called Piety, which they indispensibly owe to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents all their Life times, and in all estates, with all that Support and Defence, is due to them, gives the Father no Power of governing, <hi>i. e.</hi> making Laws and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Penalties on his Children. Though by this he has no Dominion over the Property or Actions of his Son; yet 'tis obvious to conceive, how easie it was, in the first Ages of the World, and in places still where the thinness of People gives Families leave to separate into unpossessed Quarters, and they have room to remove and plant themselves in yet vacant habitations,<note place="margin">It is no improbable Opinion, therefore, which the <hi>Arch-Philosopher</hi> was of, That the chief Person in every Houshold, was always, as it were, a King; so when Numbers of Housholds joyn'd themselves in civil Societies together, Kings were the first kind of Governours amongst them, which is also, as it seemeth, the reason why the name of Fathers continued still in them, who of Fathers, were made Rulers; as also the ancient Custom of Governours to do as <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> and being Kings, to exercise the Office of Priests, which Fathers did, at the first grew, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by the same Occasion. Howbeit, this is not the only kind of Regiment that has been received in the World. The Inconveniences of one kind have caused sundry other to be devised, so that, in a word, all publique Regiment, of what kind soever, seemeth evidently to have risen from the deliberate Advice, Consultation and Composition between Men, judging it convenient, and behovefull, there being no impossibility in Nature, considered by it self, but that Man might have lived without any publique Regiment. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccl. l. 1. §. 10.</hi>
                  </note> for the Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to become the Prince of it; he had been
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96077:153"/>
a Ruler from the Beginning of the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Children, and when they were grown up: since without some Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it would be hard for them to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it was likelyest it should, by the express or tacit Consent of the Children, be in the Father, where it seemed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change, barely to continue. And when indeed nothing more was required to it, than the permitting the Father to exercise alone, in his Family, that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power of the Law of Nature, which every Free-man naturally hath, and by that Permission resigning up to him a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Power, whilst they remained in it. But that this was not by any paternal Right, but only by the Consent of his Children, is evident from hence, That no Body doubts but if a Stranger, whom Chance or Business had brought to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, had there kill'd any of his Children, or committed any other Fact, he might condemn and put him to Death, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have punished him as well as any of his Children, which was impossible he should do by virtue of any paternal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, over one who was not his Child; but by virtue of that executive Power of the Law of Nature, which, as a Man, he had a right to: and he alone could punish him in his Family, where the Respect of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96077:153"/>
his Children had laid by the Exercise of such a Power, to give way to the Dignity and Authority they were willing should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in him above the rest of his Family.</p>
               <p n="75">75. Thus 'twas easie and almost natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for Children by a tacit and almost na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural consent, to make way for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Authority and Government. They had been accustomed in their Child-hood, to follow his Direction, and to refer their little differences to him, and when they were Men, who fitter to rule them? Their little Properties, and less Covetousness, seldom afforded greater Controversies; and when any should arise, where could they have a fitter Umpire, than he, by whose Care they had every one been su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd and brought up, and who had a tenderness for them all? 'Tis no wonder that they made no distinction betwixt Minority and full Age, nor looked after one and Twenty, or any other Age, that might make them the free Disposers of themselves and Fortunes, when they could have no desire to be out of their Pupilage. The Government they had been under, during it, continued still to be more their Protection than Restraint: and they could no where find a greater security to their Peace, Liberties, and Fortunes, than in the Rule of a Father.</p>
               <p n="76">
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:96077:154"/>76. Thus the natural Fathers of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, by an insensible change, became the politick Monarchs of them too; and as they chanced to live long, and leave able and worthy Heirs, for several Successions, or otherwise: so they laid the Foundations of Hereditary, or Elective Kingdoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der several Constitutions, and Manors, according as Chance, Contrivance, or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions happen'd to mould them. But if Princes have their Titles in the Fathers Right, and it be a sufficient proof of the natural Right of Fathers to political Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; because, they commonly were those, in whose hands, we find, <hi>de facto,</hi> the Exercise of Government: I say, if this Argument be good, it will as strongly prove that all Princes, nay Princes only, ought to be Priests, since 'tis as certain that in the Beginning, <hi>The Father of the Family was Priest, as that he was Ruler in his own Houshold.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of Political or Civil Society.</head>
               <p n="77">77. GOD having made Man such a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that, in his own Judgment, it was not good for him to be alone, put him under strong Obligations of Necessity, Convenience, and Inclination, to drive him into Society, as well as fitted him with Understanding and Language to continue and enjoy it. The first Society was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen Man and Wife, which gave begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to that between Parents and Children; to which, in time, that between Master and Servant came to be added: and though all these might, and commonly did meet together, and make up but one Family, wherein, the Master or Mistriss of it had some sort of Rule, proper to a Family; each of these, or all together came short of <hi>Political Society,</hi> as we shall see if we consider the different Ends, Ties, and Bounds of each of these.</p>
               <p n="78">78. Conjugal Society is made by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary compact between Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and though it consist chiefly in such a Communion and Right in one anothers Bodies, as is necessary to its chief End, Procreation; yet it draws with it mutual
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96077:155"/>
Support and Assistance; and a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Interests too, as necessary, not only to unite their Care and Affection, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so necessary to their common Off-spring, who have a Right to be nourished and maintained by them, till they are able to provide for themselves.</p>
               <p n="79">79. For the end of conjunction between Male and Female, being not barely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, but the continuation of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. This conjunction betwixt Male and Female ought to last, even after Procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so long as is necessary to the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and support of the young Ones, who are to be sustained by those that got them, till they are able to shift and provide for themselves. This Rule, which the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wise Maker hath set to the Works of his hands, we find, the inferiour Creatures steadily obey. In those viviparous Animals, which feed on Grass, the conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Male and Female lasts no longer than the very Act of Copulation; because the Teat of the Dam being sufficient to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the Young, till it be able to feed on Grass: the Male only begets, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not himself for the Female or Young, to whose Sustenance he can contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But in Beasts of Prey the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lasts longer; because the Dam not being able well to subsist her self, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96077:155"/>
her numerous Off-spring, by her own Prey alone, a more laborious, as well as more dangerous way of living, than by feeding on Grass: the Assistance of the Male is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Maintenance of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Family, which cannot subsist, till they are able to prey for themselves, but by the joint Care of Male and Female. The same is to be observed in all Birds (except some domestick ones, where plenty of food excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Cock from feeding, and taking care of the young Brood) whose Young needing Food in the Nest, the Cock and Hen conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Mates till the Young are able to use their wing, and provide for themselves.</p>
               <p n="80">80. And herein, I think, lies the chief, if not the only reason, why the Male and Female, in Mankind, are tyed to a longer conjunction, than other Creatures; <hi>viz.</hi> because the Female is capable of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and <hi>de facto</hi> is commonly with Child again, and brings forth too a new Birth, long before the former is out of a dependency for support on his Parents help, and able to shift for himself, and has all the assistance is due to him from his Parents, whereby the Father, who is bound to take care for those he hath begot, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an obligation to continue in Conjugal Society, with the same Woman, longer than other Creatures, whose Young being
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96077:156"/>
able to subsist of themselves, before the time of Procreation returns again, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Bond dissolves of it self, and they are at liberty; till <hi>Hymen,</hi> at his usual anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Season, summons them again to chuse new Mates. Wherein one cannot but admire the Wisdom of the great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, who, having given to Man an Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to lay up for the future, as well as supply the present necessity, hath made it necessary, that Society of Man and Wife should be more lasting, than of Male and Female amongst other Creatures: that so their Industry might be encouraged, and their Interest better united, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, and lay up Goods for their common Issue; which uncertain mixture, or easie, and frequent solutions of Conjugal Society would mightily disturb.</p>
               <p n="81">81. But though these are Ties upon Mankind, which make the Conjugal Bonds more firm and lasting, in a Man, than the other species of Animals; yet it would give one reason to enquire, why this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, where Procreation and Education are secured, and Inheritance taken care for, may not be made determinable, either by consent, or at a certain time, or upon certain conditions, as well as any other voluntary compacts; there being no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, in the nature of the thing, nor to the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96077:156"/>
ends of it, that it should always be for life; I mean, to such as are under no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of any positive Law, which ordains all such contracts to be perpetual.</p>
               <p n="82">82. But the Husband and Wife, though they have but one common Concern, yet having different Understandings, will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably sometimes, have different wills too: it therefore being necessary, that the last Determination, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Rule, should be placed somewhere; it naturally falls to the Man's share, as the abler and the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But this, reaching but to the things of their common Interest and Property, leaves the Wife in the full and true pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of what, by contract, is her pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Right; and at least gives the Husband no more Power over her than she has over his Life. The Power of the Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so far from that of an absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, that the Wife has, in many cases, a liberty to separate from him; where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right, or their Contract allows it; whether that Contract be made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in the state of Nature, or by the Customs or Laws of the countrey they live in, and the Children, upon such Separation, fall to the Father or Mother's Lot, as such Contract does determine.</p>
               <p n="83">83. For all the ends of Marriage being to be obtained, under politick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:96077:157"/>
as well as in the state of Nature, the civil Magistrate doth not abridge the Right or Power of either, naturally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to those ends, <hi>viz.</hi> Procreation, and mutual Support, and Assistance, whilst they are together; but only decides any Controversie that may arise, between Man and Wife, about them. If it were otherwise, and that absolute Soveraignty and Power of life and death naturally belong'd to the Husband, and were necessary to the Society between Man and Wife, there could be no Matrimony in any of these Countries, where the Husband is allowed no such absolute Authority; but the ends of Matrimony requiring no such Power in the Husband, it was not at all necessary to it: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Conjugal Society put it not in him, but whatsoever might consist with Procreation and Support of the Children, till they could shift for themselves: mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Assistance, Comfort, and Maintenance might be varied, and regulated, by that contract which first united them in that Society; nothing being necessary to any Society, that is not necessary to the ends for which it is made.</p>
               <p n="84">84. The Society betwixt Parents and Children, and the distinct Rights and Powers, belonging respectively to them, I have treated of so largely, in the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:96077:157"/>
foregoing Chapter, that I shall not here need to say any thing of it. And I think it is plain, that it is far different from a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Society.</p>
               <p n="85">85. Master and Servant are Names as old as History, but given to those of far different condition; for a Free-man makes himself a Servant to another, by selling him, for a certain time, the Service, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to do, in exchange, for Wages he is to receive: and though this commonly puts him into the Family of his Master, and under the ordinary discipline thereof; yet it gives the Master but a Temporary Power over him, and no greater than what is contained in the Contract between them. But there is another sort of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which, by a peculiar Name, we call Slaves, who, being Captives, taken in a just War, are, by the Right of Nature, subjected to the Absolute Dominion, and Arbitrary Power of their Masters. These Men having, as I say, forfeited their Lives, and, with it, their Liberties, and lost their Estates; and being in the state of Slavery, not capable of any Property, cannot, in that state, be considered as any part of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society; the chief end whereof is the preservation of Property.</p>
               <p n="86">86. Let us therefore consider a Master of a Family with all these subordinate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96077:158"/>
of Wife, Children, Servants and Slaves, united under the domestick rule of a Family; which what resemblance so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may have in its order, offices, and number too, with a little Commonwealth; yet is very far from it, both in its consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, power and end: or if it must be thought a Monarchy, and the <hi>Paterfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milias,</hi> the absolute Monarch in it, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy will have but a very shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and short Power, when 'tis plain, by what has been said before, That the Master of the Family has a very distinct and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently limited Power, both as to time and extent, over those several persons that are in it; for excepting the Slave (and the Family is as much a Family, and his Power as <hi>Paterfamilias</hi> as great, whether there be any Slaves in his Family or no) he has no Legislative power of Life and Death over any of them, and none too but what a Mistress of a Family may have as well as he. And he certainly can have no absolute power over the whole Family, who has but a very limited one over every individual in it. But how a Family, or any other Society of Men dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from that which is properly political Society, we shall best see, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein political Society it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</p>
               <p n="87">
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:96077:158"/>87. Man being born, as has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with a title to perfect freedom, and an uncontrouled enjoyment of all the Rights and Priviledges of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, equally with any other Man, or number of Men in the World, hath by nature a power, not only to preserve his Property, that is, his Life, Liberty and Estate, against the injuries and attempts of other men; but to judge of and punish the breaches of that Law in others, as he is perswaded the offence deserves, even with death it self, in Crimes where the hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of the fact, in his opinion, requires it. But because no political Society can be, nor subsist without having in it self the power to preserve the property, and in order thereunto, punish the offences of all those of that Society; There, and there only is political Society, where every one of the Members hath quitted this natural Power, refign'd it up into the hands of the Community in all cases that exclude him not from appealing for protection to the law established by it. And thus all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment of every particular Member being excluded, the Community comes to be Umpire; and by understanding indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ent rules and men authorised by the community for their execution, decides all the differences that may happen between
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96077:159"/>
any Members of that Society, concerning any matter of right, and punishes those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which any member hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the Society with such penalties as the law has established; whereby it is easy to discern who are, and are not, in political Society together. Those who are united into one Body, and have a common establish'd Law and Judicature to appeal to, with Authority to decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies between them, and punish Offenders, are in civil Society one with another; but those who have no such common Appeal, I mean on Earth, are still in the state of Nature, each being where there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Judge for himself, and Executioner; which is, as I have before shew'd it, the perfect state of Nature.</p>
               <p n="88">88. And thus the Commonwealth comes by a power to set down what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment shall belong to the several trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions they think worthy of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongst the Members of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (which is the power of making Laws) as well as it has the power to punish any injury done unto any of its Members, by any one that is not of it, (which is the power of War and Peace;) and all this for the preservation of the property of all the Members of that Society, as far as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. But though every Man enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96077:159"/>
Society, has quitted his power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish offences against the Law of Nature, in prosecution of his own private Judgment; yet with the Judgment of offences which he has given up to the Legislative, in all Cases where he can appeal to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, he has given up a right to the Commonwealth, to imploy his Force for the Execution of the Judgments of the Commonwealth, whenever he shall be called to it, which indeed are his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they being made by himself or his representative. And herein we have the original of the Legislative and Executive Power of Civil Society, which is to judge by standing Laws how far offences are to be punished when committed within the Commonwealth; and also by occasional Judgments founded on the present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the fact, how far injuries from without are to be vindicated, and in both these to imploy all the force of all the Members when there shall be need.</p>
               <p n="89">89. Whereever therefore any number of Men so unite into one Society, as to quit every one his Executive Power of the Law of Nature, and to resign it to the publick, there and there only is a political, or civil Society. And this is done whereever any number of Men, in the State of Nature, enter into Society to make one People, one
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96077:160"/>
Body Politick under one Supream Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or else when any one joins himself to, and incorporates with any Government already made. For hereby he authorizes the Society, or which is all one, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative thereof to make Laws for him as the publick good of the Society shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; to the Execution whereof, his own assistance (as to his own decrees) is due. And this puts men out of a state of nature into that of a Commonwealth, by setting up a Judge on Earth, with Authority to determine all the Controversies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress the injuries that may happen to any Member of the Commonwealth; which Judge is the Legislative or Magistrates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by it. And whereever there are any number of Men, however associated, that have no such decisive power to appeal to, there they are still in the state of Nature.</p>
               <p n="90">90. And hence it is evident, that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarchy which by some Men is counted for the only Government in the World, is indeed inconsistent with civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and so can be no Form of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all: For the end of civil Society, being to avoid and remedy those inconveniencies of the state of Nature which necessarily follow from every Man's being Judge in his own Case, by setting up a known Authority, to which every
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96077:160"/>
one of that Society may appeal upon any injury received, or Controversy that may arise, and which every one of the Society ought to obey. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any persons are who have not such an authority to appeal to,<note place="margin">The publick Power of all Society is above every Soul contained in the same Society; and the principal use of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is to give Laws unto all that are under it, which Laws in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we must obey, unless there be reason shew'd which may necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, that the Law of Reason, or of God, doth injoin the contrary, <hi>Hook.

For he being suppos'd to have all, both Legislative and Executive Power in himself alone, there is no Judge to be found, no appeal lies open to any one, who may fairly and indifferently, and with authority decide, and from whence relief and redress may be expected of any injury or inconveniency that may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from him, or by his order.

Finally, they knew that no Man might, in reason, take upon him to determine his own Right, and according to his own Determination proceed in maintenance thereof, in as much as every man is towards himself, and them whom he greatly affects, partial; and therefore, that Strifes and Troubles would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, except they gave their common Consent, all to be ordered by some, whom they should agree upon, without which Consent, there would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the common state of rational Creatures, is denied a liberty to judge of, or defend his Right, and so is exposed to all the Misery and Inconveniencies that a Man can fear from one, who being in the unrestrained state of Nature, is yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Flattery, and armed with Power.</p>
               <p n="92">92. For he that thinks absolute Power purifies Mens Bloods, and corrects the baseness of humane Nature, need read but the History of this, or any other Age, to be convinced of the contrary. He that would have been insolent and injurious in the Woods of <hi>America,</hi> would not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be much better in a Throne, where perhaps Learning and Religion shall be found out to justifie all that he shall do to his Subjects; and the Sword presently si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all those that dare question it. For what the Protection of Absolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy is; what kind of Fathers of their Countries it makes Princes to be; and to what a degree of Happiness, and Security it carries civil Society, where this sort of Government is grown to perfection, he that will look into the late Relation of <hi>Ceylon</hi> may easily see.</p>
               <p n="93">93. In Absolute Monarchies indeed, as well as other Governments of the World, the Subjects have an Appeal to the Law,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96077:162"/>
and Judges to decide any Controversies, and restrain any violence that may happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Subjects themselves, one amongst another. This every one thinks necessary, and believes, he deserves to be thought a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Enemy to Society and Mankind, who should go about to take it away. But whether this be from a true Love of Mankind and Society, &amp; such a Charity as we owe all one to another, there is reason to doubt. For this is no more than what every Man, who loves his own Power, Profit, or Greatness, may, and naturally must do; keep those Animals from hurting, or destroying one another, who labour and drudge only for his Pleasure and Advantage; and so are taken care of, not out of any Love the Master has for them, but Love of himself, and the Profit they bring him. For if it be asked what Security, what Fence is there, in such a State, against the Violence and Oppression of this Absolute Ruler? The very Question can scarce be born. They are ready to tell you, that it deserves Death only to ask after Safety. Betwixt Subject and Subject, they will grant, there must be Measures, Laws, and Judges for their mutual Peace and Security. But as for the Ruler, he ought to be Absolute, and is above all such Circumstancés; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has a Power to do more hurt and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96077:162"/>
wrong, 'tis right when he does it. To ask how you may be guarded from harm, or injury, on that side, where the strongest hand is to do it, is presently the Voice of Faction and Rebellion. As if when Men, quitting the state of Nature, entered into Society, they agreed that all of them, but one, should be under the restraint of Laws; but that he should still retain all the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the state of Nature, increased with Power, and made licentious by Impunity. This is to think that Men are so foolish, that they take care to avoid what Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs may be done them by <hi>Pole-Cats,</hi> or <hi>Foxes,</hi> but are content, nay think it Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be devoured by <hi>Lions.</hi>

               <p n="94">94. But, whatever Flatterers may talk, to amuze Peoples Understandings, it never hinders Men from feeling; and when they perceive that any Man, in what Station so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is out of the Bounds of the civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety they are of, and that they have no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, on Earth, against any harm they may receive from him, they are apt to think themselves in the state of Nature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of him, whom they find to be so; and to take care, as soon as they can, to have that Safety and Security, in civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for which it was first instituted, and for which only they entered into it. And therefore, though perhaps at first, as shall
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96077:163"/>
be shewed more at large hereafter, in the following part of this Discourse, some one good and excellent Man having got a Preheminency, amongst the rest, had this Deference paid to his Goodness and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as to a kind of Natural Authority, that the chief Rule, with Arbitration of their differences, by a tacit Consent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved into his hands, without any other caution, but the assurance they had of his Uprightness and Wisdom; yet when time giving Authority, and, as some Men would perswade us, Sacredness to Customs, which the negligent, and unforeseeing Innocence of the first Ages began, had brought in Successors of another stamp, the People finding their Properties not secure under the Government as then it was.<note place="margin">At the first; when some certain kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment was once appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it may be that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was then farther thought upon for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of governing, but all permitted unto their Wisdom and Discretion, which were to Rule, till, by experience, they found this for all parts very inconvenient, so as the thing, which they had devised for a Remedy, did indeed but increase the Sore, which it should have cured. They saw, that <hi>to live by one Man's Will, became the cause of all Mens misery.</hi> This constrained them to come unto Laws wherein all Men might see their Duty beforehand, and know the Penalties of transgressing them. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccl.

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Beginning of Political Societies.</head>
               <p n="95">95. MEN being, as has been said, by Nature, all free, equal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent; no one can be put out of this Estate, and subjected to the Political Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of another, without his own Consent, which is done by agreeing, with other Men, to join and unite into a Community, for their comfortable, safe, and peaceable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, one amongst another, in a secure En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their Properties, and a greater Security against any that are not of it. This any number of Men may do, because it injures not the Freedom of the rest; they are left, as they were, in the Liberty of the state of Nature. When any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men have so consented to make one Community or Government, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by presently incorporated, and make one Body Politick, wherein the Majority have a Right, to act and conclude the rest.</p>
               <p n="96">96. For when any number of Men, have by the consent of every individual, made a Community, they have thereby made that Community one Body, with a power to act as one Body, which is only by the will and determination of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96077:164"/>
For that which acts any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, being only the consent of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of it, and it being one Body must move one way; it is necessary the Body should move that way whither the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er force carries it, which is the consent of the majority: or else it is impossible it should act or continue one Body, one Community, which the consent of every individual that united into it, agreed that it should; and so every one is bound by that consent to be concluded by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority. And therefore we see, that in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies impowred to act by positive Laws where no number is set, by that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Law which impowers them, the act of the majority passes for the act of the whole, and of course determines, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the Law of Nature and Reason, the power of the whole.</p>
               <p n="97">97. And thus every Man by consenting with others to make one Body Politick, under one Government, puts himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an obligation to every one of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to submit to the determination of the majority, and to be concluded by it; or else this original Compact, whereby he with others incorporates into one Society, would signifie nothing, and be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact if he be left free, and under no other ties than he was in before in the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96077:165"/>
state of Nature. For what appearance would there be of any Compact? What new engagement, if he were no farther tied by any Decrees of the Society, than he himself thought fit, and did actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to? This would be still as great a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as he himself had before his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, or any one else in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who may submit himself and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to any acts of it if he thinks fit.</p>
               <p n="98">98. For if the consent of the majority shall not in reason be received as the act of the whole, and conclude every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual; nothing but the consent of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual can make any thing to be the act of the whole, which, considering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of health, and avocations of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, which in a number, though much less than that of a Commonwealth, will necessarily keep many away from the publick Assembly; and the variety of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and contrariety of interests which unavoidably happen in all Collections of Men, 'tis next impossible ever to be had. And therefore if coming into Society be upon such terms, it will be only like <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s coming into the Theatre, <hi>tantum at exiret.</hi> Such a Constitution as this would make the mighty <hi>Leviathan</hi> of a shorter duration than the feeblest Creatures; and not let it outlast the day it was born in,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:96077:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which cannot be suppos'd till we can think that rational Creatures should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and constitute Societies only to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved. For where the majority cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the rest, there they cannot act as one Body; and consequently, will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dissolved again.</p>
               <p n="99">99. Whosoever therefore, out of a state of Nature, unite into a Community, must be understood to give up all the power necessary to the ends for which they unite into Society, to the majority of the Community, unless they expresly agreed in any number greater than the majority. And this is done by barely agreeing to unite into one political Society, which is all the Compact that is, or needs be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the individuals that enter into or make up a Commonwealth. And thus that which begins and actually constitutes any Political Society, is nothing but the consent of any number of Freemen capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of majority, to unite and incorporate into such a Society. And this is that, and that only, which did or could give begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any lawful Government in the World.</p>
               <p n="100">100. To this I find two Objections made. 1. That there are no instances to be found in story, of a Company of Men independant and equal one amongst
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96077:166"/>
another, that met together, and in this way began and set up a Government. 2. 'Tis impossible of right that Men should do so; because all Men being born under Government, they are to submit to that, and are not at liberty to begin a new one.</p>
               <p n="101">101. To the first, there is this to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That it is not at all to be wonder'd that History gives us but a very little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Men that lived together in the state of Nature. The inconveniencies of that condition, and the love and want of Society, no sooner brought any number of them together, but they presently united and incorporated, if they designed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue together. And if we may not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Men ever to have been in the state of Nature, because we hear not much of them in such a state; we may as well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Armies of <hi>Salmanasser,</hi> or <hi>Xerxes,</hi> were never Children, because we hear lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of them till they were Men, and imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in Armies. Government is every where antecedent to Records, and Letters seldom come in amongst a People till a long continuation of Civil Society, has by other more necessary arts, provided for their Safety, Ease and Plenty. And then they begin to look after the History of their Founders, and search into their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96077:166"/>
when they have outlived the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it. For 'tis with Commonwealths as with particular Persons, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ignorant of their own Births and Infancies: and if they know any thing of it, they are beholding for it to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Records that others have kept of it. And those that we have of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any Polities in the World, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Jews, where God himself immediately interpos'd, and which favours not at all Paternal Dominion; are all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain instances of such a beginning as I have mentioned, or at least have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest footsteps of it.</p>
               <p n="102">102. He must shew a strange inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deny evident matter of fact when it agrees not with his Hypothesis; who will not allow, that the beginning of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> were by the uniting together of several Men free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one of another, amongst whom there was no natural Superiority or Subjection. And if <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi>'s word may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he tells us, that in many parts of <hi>America</hi> there was no Government at all. <hi>There are great and apparent Conjectures,</hi> says he, <hi>that these men,</hi> speaking of those of Peru, <hi>for a long time had neither Kings nor Commonwealths, but lived in Troops, as they do this day in</hi> Florida, <hi>the</hi> Cheriquanas,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96077:167"/>
                  <hi>those of</hi> Bresil, <hi>and many other Nations, which have no certain Kings, but as occasion is offered in Peace or War, they choose their Captains as they please.</hi> l. 1. c. 25. If it be said, that every Man there was born sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Father, or the head of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. That the subjection due from a Child to a Father, took not away his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of uniting into what political Society he thought fit, has been already proved. But be that as it will, these Men, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, were actually free; and whatever superiority some Politicians now would place in any of them, they themselves claimed it not; but by consent were all equal, till by the same consent they set Rulers over themselves. So that their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Societies all began from a voluntary Union, and the mutual agreement of Men freely acting in the choice of their Governours, and forms of Government.</p>
               <p n="103">103. And I hope those who went away from <hi>Sparta,</hi> with <hi>Palantus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Iustin l.</hi> will be allowed to have been Freemen independent one of another, and to have set up a Government over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by their own consent. Thus I have given several Examples out of History, of people free and in the state of Nature, that being met together incorporated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Commonwealth. And if the want
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:96077:167"/>
of such instances be an argument to prove, that Government were not, nor could not be so begun, I suppose the Contenders for Paternal Empire were better let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, than urge it against natural Liberty. For if they can give so many instances out of History, of Governments began upon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Right, I think (though at least an Argument from what has been, to what should of right, be of no great force) one might, without any great danger, yield them the cause. But if I might advise them in the Case, they would do well not to search too much into the original of Governments, as they have begun <hi>de facto,</hi> lest they should find at the foundation of most of them, something very little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the design they promote, and such a power as they contend for.</p>
               <p n="104">104. But, to conclude, Reason being plain on our side, that Men are naturally free; and the Examples of History shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Governments of the World, that were begun in Peace, had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning laid on that foundation, and were made by the Consent of the People: There can be little room for doubt, either where the Right is, or what has been the Opinion, or Practice of Mankind about the first erecting of Governments.</p>
               <p n="105">
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:96077:168"/>105. I will not deny, that if we look back, as far as History will direct us, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Original of Commonwealths, we shall generally find them under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Administration of one Man. And I am also apt to believe, that where a Family was numerous enough to subsist by it self, and continued entire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without mixing with others, as it often happens; where there is much Land, and few People, the Government common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began in the Father. For the Father having, by the Law of Nature, the same Power, with every Man else, to punish, as he thought fit, any Offences against that Law, might thereby punish his transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Children, even when they were Men, and out of their Pupilage; and they were very likely to submit to his punishment, and all join with him against the Offender in their turns, giving him thereby power to Execute his Sentence against any trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and so in effect make him the Law-maker and Governour over all that remained in Conjunction with his Family. He was fittest to be trusted; Paternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection secured their Property and Interest under his Care, and the Custom of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in their Childhood, made it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to submit to him rather than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If therefore they must have one to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96077:168"/>
rule them, as Government is hardly to be avoided amongst Men that live together; who so likely to be the Man as he that was their common Father, unless Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Cruelty, or any other defect of Mind or Body, made him unfit for it. But when either the Father died, and left his next Heir for want of Age, Wisdom, Courage, or any other qualities less fit for Rule, or where several Families met and consented to continue together: There, 'tis not to be doubted, but they used their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural freedom to set up him whom they judged the ablest and most likely to Rule well over them. Conformable hereunto we find the People of <hi>America,</hi> who living out of the reach of the Conquering Swords and spreading domination of the two great Empires of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> enjoy'd their own natural freedom; though, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> they commonly prefer the Heir of their deceased King; yet if they find him any way weak or uncapable, they pass him by, and set up the stoutest and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest Man for their Ruler.</p>
               <p n="106">106. Thus, though looking back as far as Records give us any account of Peopling the World, and the History of Nations, we commonly find the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be in one hand, yet it destroys not that which I affirm (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96077:169"/>
beginning of Politick Society depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the consent of the Individuals to join into and make one Society; who when they are thus incorporated, might set up what form of Government they thought fit. But this having given occasion to Men to mistake and think, that by Nature Government was Monarchical, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Father, it may not be amiss, here to consider, why People, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, generally pitch'd upon this form, which though perhaps the Father's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency might, in the first institution of some Commonwealths, give a rise to, and place in the beginning, the Power in one hand: yet it is plain that the reason that continued the Form of Government in a single Person, was not any Regard or Respect to Paternal Authority; since all petty Monarchies, that is, almost all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, near their Original, have been commonly, at least upon occasion, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p n="107">107. First then, in the beginning of things, the Father's Government of the Childhood of those sprung from him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accustomed them to the Rule of one Man, and taught them, that where it was exercised with Care and Skill, with Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Love to those under it, it was sufficient to procure and preserve Men (all
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96077:169"/>
the political Happiness they sought for, in Society.) It was no wonder that they should pitch upon, and naturally run into that Form of Government, which, from their Infancy, they had been all accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to; and which, by experience, they had found both easie and safe. To which, if we add, that Monarchy being simple, and most obvious to Men, whom neither experience had instructed in Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor the Ambition or Insolence of Empire had taught to beware of the Encroachments of Prerogative, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of Absolute Power; which Monarchy, in Succession, was apt to lay claim to, and bring upon them. It was not at all strange, that they should not much trouble themselves to think of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of restraining any Exorbitances of those, to whom they had given the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them; and of ballancing the Power of Government, by placing several parts of it in different hands. They had neither felt the Oppression of Tyrannical Dominion, nor did the Fashion of the Age, nor their Possessions, or way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which afforded little matter for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness or Ambition; give them any reason to apprehend or provide against it; and therefore 'tis no wonder they put themselves into such a Frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96077:170"/>
as was, not only, as I said, most obvious and simple, but also best suited to their present State and Condition; which stood more in need of defence against fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Invasions and Injuries, than of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of Laws, where there was but very little Property: and wanted not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Rulers and abundance of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to direct and look after their Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where there were but few Trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and few Offenders. Since then, those who liked one another so well as to join into Society, cannot but be supposed to have some Acquaintance and Friendship together, and some Trust one in another. They could not but have greater Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of others, than of one another; and therefore their first care and thought cannot but be supposed to be how to secure themselves against foreign Force. 'Twas natural for them to put themselves under a Frame of Government, which might best serve to that end; and chuse the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and bravest Man to conduct them in their Wars, and lead them out against their Enemies, and in this chiefly be their Ruler.</p>
               <p n="108">108. Thus we see that the Kings of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which is still a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the first Ages in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> whilst the Inhabitants were too few for
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96077:170"/>
the Countrey, and want of People and Money gave Men no temptation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Possessions of Land, or contest for wider extent of Ground; are little more than Generals of their Armies: and though they command absolutely in War, yet at home, and in time of Peace, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise very little Dominion, and have but a very moderate Sovereignty; the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Peace and War, being ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either in the People, or in a Council. Though the War it self, which admits not of Pluralities of Governours, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devolves the Command into the King's sole Authority.</p>
               <p n="109">109. And thus in <hi>Israel</hi> it self, the chief Business of their Judges, and first Kings, seems to have been to be Captains in War, and Leaders of their Armies; which, (besides what is signified by, <hi>going out and in before the People,</hi> which was, to march forth to War, and home again in the Heads of their Forces) appears plainly in the story of <hi>Iephtha.</hi> The <hi>Ammonites</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War upon <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> in fear, send to <hi>Iephtha,</hi> a Bastard of their Family, whom they had cast off, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with him, if he will assist them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> to make him their Ruler; which they do in these Words, <hi>And the People made him head and captain
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96077:171"/>
over them, Iudg.</hi> 11. 11. which was, as it seems, all one as to be Judge. <hi>And he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Israel, Iudg.</hi> 12. 7. that is, was their Captain-general, <hi>six Years.</hi> So when <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> upbraids the <hi>Shechemites</hi> with the Obligation they had to <hi>Gideon,</hi> who had been their Judge and Ruler, he tells them, <hi>He fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hands of Midian, Iudg.</hi> 9.17. Nothing mentioned of him, but what he did as a General, and indeed, that is all is found in his History, or in any of the rest of the Judges. And <hi>Abimelech</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly is called King, though at most he was but their General. And when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of the ill Conduct of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Sons, the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> desired a King, <hi>like all the nations to judge them, and to go out before them, and to fight their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 20. God granting their Desire, says to <hi>Samuel, I will send thee a man, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel that he may save my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le out of the hands of the Philistines, c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 16. As if the only business of a King had been to lead out their Armies, and fight in their Defence; and, accordingly, at his Inauguration, pouring a Vial of Oyl upon him, declares to <hi>Saul,</hi> that, <hi>the Lord had anointed him to be Captain over his inheritance, c.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 1. And therefore
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96077:171"/>
those, who after <hi>Saul</hi>'s being solemnly chosen, and saluted King by the <hi>Tribes,</hi> at <hi>Mispah,</hi> were unwilling to have him their King, make no other Objection but this, <hi>How shall this man save us? v.</hi> 27. as if they should have said, This Man is unfit to be our King, not having Skill and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct enough in War, to be able to defend us. And when God resolved to transfer the Government to <hi>David,</hi> it is in these Words, <hi>But now thy Kingdom shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: the Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people, c.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 14. As if the whole Kingly Authority were nothing else but to be their General: and therefore the <hi>Tribes</hi> who had stuck to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Family, and opposed <hi>David</hi>'s Reign, when they came to <hi>Hebron</hi> with terms of Submission to him, they tell him, amongst other Arguments they had to submit to him as to their King, That he was, in effect, their King in <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, and therefore, they had no reason but to receive him as their King now. <hi>Also</hi> (say they) <hi>in time past, when Saul was King over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel, and the Lord said unto thee, thou shalt feed my People Israel, and thou shalt be a Captain over Israel.</hi>

                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:96077:172"/>110. Thus, whether a Family, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, grew up into a Commonwealth, and the Fatherly Authority being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on to the elder Son, every one in his turn growing up under it, tacitly submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, and the easiness and equality of it not offending any one, every one acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esced, till time seemed to have confirmed it, and setled a right of Succession, by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: or whether several Families, or the Descendants of several Families, whom Chance, Neighbourhood, or Business brought together, united into Society; the need of a General, whose Conduct might defend them against their Enemies in War, and the great confidence the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Sincerity of that poor but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Age, such as are almost all those which begin Governments that ever come to last in the World, gave Men one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, made the first Beginners of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths generally put the Rule into one Man's hand, without any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Limitation or Restraint, but what the Nature of the thing, and the End of Government required. It was given them for the publick Good and Safety, and to those Ends in the Infancies of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, they commonly used it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they had done so, young Societies could not have subsisted; without such
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96077:172"/>
nursing Fathers: without this care of the Governours, all Governments would have sunk under the Weakness and Infirmities of their Infancy, the Prince and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had soon perished together.</p>
               <p n="111">111. But the golden Age (tho' before vain Ambition, and <hi>amor sceleratus habendi,</hi> evil Concupiscence had corrupted Mens minds into a Mistake of true Power and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) had more Virtue, and consequently, better Governours, as well as less vicious Subjects; and there was then no stretching Prerogative on the one side to oppress the People; nor, consequently, on the other, any Dispute about Priviledge, to lessen or restrain the Power of the Magistrate: and so no contest betwixt Rulers and People, about Governours or Government. Yet, when Ambition, and Luxury,<note place="margin">At first, when some certain kind of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was once approved, it may be, nothing was then further thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the manner of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, but all permitted unto their Wisdom, and Discretion, which were to Rule, till, by experience, they found this for all parts very inconvenient, so as the thing, which they had devised for a Remedy, did indeed but increase the Sore, which it should have cured. They saw, that <hi>to live by one Man's Will, became the cause of all Mens misery.</hi> This constrained them to come unto Laws wherein all Men might see their Duty beforehand, and know the Penalties of transgressing them. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccl. Pol. l. 1. §. 10.</hi>
                  </note> in future Ages, would retain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the Business, for which it was given,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96077:173"/>
and aided by Flattery, taught Princes to have distinct and separate Interests, from their People; Men found it necessary to examine, more carefully, the Original and Rights of Government; and to find out ways to restrain the Exorbitances, and prevent the Abuses of that Power, which they having intrusted in another's hands, only for their own good, they found, was made use of to hurt them.</p>
               <p n="112">112. Thus we may see how probable it is, that People, that were naturally free, and, by their own consent, either submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Government of their Father, or united together, out of different Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to make a Government; should ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally put the Rule into one Man's hands, and chuse to be under the Conduct of a single Person; without so much, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Conditions, limiting or regulating his Power, which they thought safe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his Honesty and Prudence. Though they never dream'd of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy being <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> which we never heard of among Mankind, till it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us by the Divinity of this last Age; nor ever allowed Paternal Power to have a right to Dominion, or to be the Foundation of all Government. And thus much may suffice to shew, that, as far as we have any light from History, we have
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96077:173"/>
reason to conclude, that all peaceful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Government have been laid in the Consent of the People. I say <hi>peaceful,</hi> because I shall have occasion, in another place, to speak of Conquest, which some esteem a way of beginning of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The other Objection, I find, urged against the beginning of Polities, in the way I have mentioned, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="113">113. <hi>That all Men being born under Government, some or other, it is impossible any of them should ever be free, and at liberty, to unite together, and begin a new one, or ever be able to erect a lawful Government.</hi> If this Argument be good; I ask, how came so many lawful Monarchies into the World? For if any body, upon this supposition, can shew me any one Man, in any Age of the World, free to begin a lawful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; I will be bound to shew him Ten other free Men at liberty, at the same time, to unite and begin a new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under a Regal, or any other Form. It being demonstration, that if any one, born under the Dominion of another, may be so free, as to have a right to command others, in a new and distinct Empire; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is born under the Dominion
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:96077:174"/>
of another may be so free too, and may become a Ruler, or Subject, of a distinct separate Government. And so by this their own Principle, either all Men however born are free, or else there is but one law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, one lawful Government in the World. And then they have nothing to do but barely to shew us which that is. Which when they have done, I doubt not but all Mankind will easily agree to pay obedience to him.</p>
               <p n="114">114. Though it be a sufficient Answer to their Objection to shew, that it involves them in the same difficulties that it doth those they use it against; yet I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to discover the weakness of this Argument a little farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All men,</hi> say they, <hi>are born under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore they cannot be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to begin a new one. Every one is born a Subject to his Father, or his Prince, and is therefore under the perpetual tie of Subjection and Allegiance.</hi> 'Tis plain, Mankind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver owned nor considered any such natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral subjection that they were born in, to one or to the other, that tied them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own consents, to a subjection to them and their Heirs.</p>
               <p n="115">115. For there are no Examples so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in History, both sacred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, as those of Men withdrawing
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96077:174"/>
themselves, and their Obedience, from the Jurisdiction they were born under, and the Family or Community they were bred up in, and setting up new Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in other places, from whence sprang all that number of petty Commonwealths in the beginning of Ages, and which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways multiplied as long as there was room enough, till the stronger, or more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate swallow'd the weaker; and those great ones again breaking to pieces, dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into lesser Dominions. All which are so many testimonies against paternal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, and plainly prove, That it was not the natural right of the Father descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Heirs, that made Governments in the beginning; since it was impossible, upon that ground, there should have been so many little Kingdoms, but only one universal Monarchy, if Men had not been at liberty to separate themselves from their Families and their Government, be it what it will that was set up in it, and go and make distinct Commonwealths and other Governments as they thought fit.</p>
               <p n="116">116. This has been the practice of the World from its first beginning to this day: nor is it now any more hindrance to the freedom of Mankind, that they are born under constituted and ancient Polities,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96077:175"/>
that have established Laws and set Forms of Government, than if they were born in the Woods, amongst the unconfined Inhabitants that run loose in them. For those who would perswade us, that by being born under any Government, we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Subjects to it, and have no more any title or pretence to the freedom of the state of Nature, have no other reason (ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of Paternal Power, which we have already answer'd) to produce for it, but only because our Fathers or Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors passed away their natural Liberty, and thereby bound up themselves and their Posterity to a perpetual subjection to the Government, which they themselves sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to. 'Tis true, that whatever En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements or Promises any one made for himself, he is under the obligation of them, but cannot by any Compact what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, bind his Children or Posterity. For his Son, when a Man, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as free as the Father, any act of the Father can no more give away the liberty of the Son, than it can of any body else. He may indeed annex such Conditions to the Land he enjoyed, as a Subject of any Commonwealth, as may oblige his Son to be of that Community, if he will enjoy those Possessions which were his Fathers; because that Estate being his Fathers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96077:175"/>
he may dispose or settle it as he pleases.</p>
               <p n="117">117. And this has generally given the occasion to the mistake in this matter; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Commonwealths not permitting any part of their Dominions to be dismembred, nor to be enjoyed by any but those of their Community, the Son cannot ordinarily enjoy the Possessions of his Father, but under the same Terms his Father did; by becoming a Member of the Society; whereby he puts himself presently under the Government, he finds there establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as much as any other Subject of that Commonweal. And thus the Consent of Free-men, born under Government, which only makes them Members of it, being given separately in their turns, as each comes to be of Age, and not in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude together; People take no notice of it, and thinking it not done at all, or not necessary, conclude they are naturally Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as they are Men.</p>
               <p n="118">118. But, 'tis plain, Governments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves understand it otherwise; they claim no Power over the Son, because of that they had over the Father; nor look on Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as being their Subjects, by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being so. If a Subject of <hi>England</hi> have a Child, by an <hi>English</hi> Woman, in <hi>France,</hi> whose Subject is he? Not the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96077:176"/>
King of <hi>England</hi>'s; for he must have leave to be admitted to the Priviledges of it. Nor the King of <hi>France</hi>'s; for how then has his Father a liberty to bring him away, and breed him as he pleases: and who ever was judged as a Traytor or Deserter, if he left, or warr'd against a Countrey, for being barely born in it of Parents that were Aliens there? 'Tis plain then, by the Practice of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments themselves, as well as by the Law of right Reason, that a Child is born a Subject of no Country nor Government. He is under his Father's Tuition and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, till he come to Age of Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then he is a Free-man, at liberty what Government he will put himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; what Body Politick he will unite himself to. For if an <hi>English-Man</hi>'s Son, born in <hi>France,</hi> be at liberty, and may do so, 'tis evident there is no Tye upon him, by his Father's being a Subject of that Kingdom; nor is he bound up, by any Compact of his Ancestors: and why then hath not his Son, by the same reason, the same liberty, though he be born any where else! Since the Power that a Father hath naturally, over his Children, is the same, where-ever they be born; and the Ties of natural Obligations, are not bounded by the positive Limits of Kingdoms and Commonwealths.</p>
               <p n="119">
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:96077:176"/>119. Every Man being, as has been shewed, naturally free, and nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to put him into subjection to any earthly Power, but only his own Consent: It is to be considered, what shall be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be a sufficient Declaration of a Man's Consent, to make him subject to the Laws of any Government. There is a common distinction of an express, and a tacit Consent; which will concern our present Case. No body doubts but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Consent, of any Man, entering into any Society, makes him a perfect Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Society, a Subject of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The difficulty is, what ought to be look'd upon as a tacit Consent, and how far it binds, <hi>i. e.</hi> how far any one shall be looked on to have consented, and thereby submitted to any Government, where he has made no Expressions of it at all. And to this I say, that every Man, that hath any Possession, or Enjoyment, of any part of the Dominions of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, doth thereby give his tacit Consent, and is as far forth obliged to Obedience to the Laws of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during such Enjoyment, as any one under it; whether this his Possession be of Land, to him and his Heirs for ever, or a Lodging only for a Week; or whether it be barely travelling freely on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96077:177"/>
and, in Effect, it reaches as far as the very being of any one within the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of that Government.</p>
               <p n="120">120. To understand this the better, it is fit to consider, that every Man, when he, at first, incorporates himself into any Commonwealth, he, by his uniting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thereunto, annexed also, and submits to the Community those Possessions, which he has, or shall acquire, that do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready belong to any other Government. For it would be a direct Contradiction, for any one, to enter into Society with others for the securing and regulating of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: and yet to suppose his Land, whose Property is to be regulated by the Laws of the Society, should be exempt from the Jurisdiction of that Government, to which he himself, and the Property of the Land, is a Subject. By the same Act therefore, whereby any one unites his Person, which was before free, to any Commonwealth; by the same he unites his Possessions, which were before free, to it also; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, both of them, Person and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, subject to the Government and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Commonwealth, as long as it hath a being. Who-ever therefore, from thenceforth, by Inheritance, purchases Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, or otherwise enjoys any part of the Land, so annext to, and under the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:96077:177"/>
Government of that Commonweal, must take it with the Condition it is under; that is, of submitting to the Government of the Commonwealth, under whose Jurisdiction it is, as far forth, as any Subject of it.</p>
               <p n="121">121. But since the Government has a direct Jurisdiction only over the Land, and reaches the Possessor of it, (before he has actually incorporated himself in the Society) only as he dwells upon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys that: the Obligation any one is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by Virtue of such Enjoyment, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Government, begins and ends with the Enjoyment; so that when-ever the Owner, who has given nothing but such a tacit Consent, to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will, by Donation, Sale, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, quit the said Possession: He is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go and incorporate himself into any other Commonwealth, or agree with others to begin a new one, <hi>in vacuis locis,</hi> in any part of the World they can find free and unpossessed: whereas he that has once, by actual Agreement, and any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Declaration, given his Consent to be of any Commonweal, is perpetually and indispensably obliged to be, and remain unalterably a Subject to it, and can never be again in the liberty of the state of Nature; unless, by any Calamity, the Government, he was under, comes to be dissolved.</p>
               <p n="122">
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:96077:178"/>122. But submitting to the Laws of any Countrey; living quietly, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priviledges and Protection under them, makes not a Man a Member of that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; 'tis only a local Protection and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage due to, and from all those, who, not being in a state of War, come within the Territories belonging to any Government, to all parts whereof the force of its Law extends. But this no more makes a Man a Member of that Society, a perpetual Subject of that Commonwealth; than it would make a Man a Subject to another in whose Family he found it convenient to abide for some time; though, whilst he continued in it, he were obliged to comply with the Laws, and submit to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he found there. And thus we see, that Foreigners, by living all their Lives under another Government, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Priviledges and Protection of it, though they are bound, even in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to submit to its Administration, as far forth as any Denison; yet do not thereby come to be Subjects or Members of that Commonwealth. Nothing can make any Man so, but his actually enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it by positive Engagement, and express Promise and Compact. This is that, which I think, concerning the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Political Societies, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96077:178"/>
which makes any one a Member of any Commonwealth.</p>

IF Man in the state of Nature be so free as has been said; If he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Lord of his own Person and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no Body, why will he part with his Freedom, this Empire, and subject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Dominion and Controul of any other Power? To which 'tis obvious to Answer, that though in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he hath such a right, yet the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is very uncertain, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exposed to the Invasion of others; for all being Kings as much as he, every Man his Equal, and the greater part no strict Observers of Equity and Justice; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit this Condition, which however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and 'tis not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with others who are already united,

For though the Law of Nature be plain and intelligible to all rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet Men being biassed by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as well as ignorant for want of study of it, are not apt to allow of it as a Law binding to them in the application of it to their particular Cases.</p>
               <p n="125">125. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the State of Nature there wants a known and indifferent Judge, with Authority to determine all differences according to the established Law. For every one in that state being both Judge and Executioner of the Law of Nature, Men being partial to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Passion and Revenge is very apt to carry them too far, and with too much
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96077:179"/>
heat in their own Cases, as well as negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and unconcernedness, make them too remiss in other Mens.</p>
               <p n="126">126. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the state of Nature there often wants Power to back and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Sentence when right, and to give it due Execution. They who by any Injustice offended, will seldom fail, where they are able, by force to make good their Injustice; such resistance many times makes the punishment dangerous, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently destructive to those who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it.</p>
               <p n="127">127. Thus Mankind, notwithstanding all the Priviledges of the state of Nature, being but in an ill condition while they remain in it, are quickly driven into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Hence it comes to pass, that we seldom find any number of Men live any time together in this State. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies that they are therein exposed to, by the irregular and uncertain exercise of the Power every Man has of punishing the transgressions of others, make them take Sanctuary under the establish'd Laws of Government, and therein seek the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their Property. 'Tis this makes them so willingly give up every one his single power of punishing to be exercised by such alone as shall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it amongst them; and by such Rules
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96077:180"/>
as the Community, or those authorised by them, to that purpose shall agree on. And in this we have the original right and rise of both the Legislative and Executive Power, as well as of the Governments and Societies themselves.</p>
               <p n="128">128. For in the state of Nature, to omit the liberty he has of innocent delights, a Man has two Powers. The first is to do whatsoever he thinks fit for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himself and others within the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Law of Nature; by which Law, common to them all, he and all the rest of Mankind, are one Community, make up one Society distinct from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, and were it not for the corruption and vitiousness of degenerate Men, there would be no need of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no necessity that Men should sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from this great and natural Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and associate into lesser Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The other power a Man has in the state of Nature, is the power to punish the Crimes committed against that Law. Both these he gives up when he joins in a private, if I may so call it, or particular Political Society, and incorporates into any Commonwealth, separate from the rest of Mankind.</p>
               <p n="129">129. The first power, <hi>viz.</hi> of doing whatsoever he thought fit for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96077:180"/>
of himself, and the rest of Mankind, he gives up to be regulated by Laws made by the Society, so far forth as the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of himself and the rest of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety shall require; which Laws of the Society in many things confine the liberty he had by the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p n="130">130. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The power of punishing he wholly gives up, and engages his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force, which he might before imploy in the Execution of the Law of Nature, by his own single Authority, as he thought fit, to assist the Executive Power of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as the Law thereof shall require. For being now in a new State, wherein he is to enjoy many Conveniencies from the labour, assistance and society of others in the same Community, as well as protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from its whole strength; he is to part also with as much of his natural liberty, in providing for himself, as the good, prosperity and safety of the Society shall require; which is not only necessary but just, since the other Members of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety do the like.</p>
               <p n="131">131. But though Men when they enter into Society, give up the Equality, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Executive Power they had in the state of Nature, into the hands of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to be so far disposed of by the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative, as the good of the Society shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:96077:181"/>
yet it being only with an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in every one, the better to preserve himself, his Liberty and Property. (For no rational Creature can be supposed to change his condition with an intention to be worse) the power of the Society, or Legislative, constituted by them, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be suppos'd to extend farther than the common good; but is obliged to secure every ones Property by providing against those three defects above-mentioned, that made the state of Nature so unsafe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy. And so whoever has the Legislative or supream Power of any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is bound to govern by establish'd standing Laws, promulgated and known to the People, and not by Extemporary Decrees; By indifferent and upright Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who are to decide Controversies by those Laws. And to imploy the force of the Community at home, only in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of such Laws, or abroad to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or redress Foreign Injuries, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Community from Inroads and Invasion. And all this to be directed to no other end, but the Peace, Safety, and publick good of the People.</p>

THE Majority having, as has been shew'd, upon Mens first uniting into Society, the whole power of the Community, naturally in them, may imploy all that power in making Laws for the Community from time to time, and Executing those Laws by Officers of their own appointing; and then the Form of the Government is a perfect Democracy: Or else may put the power of making Laws into the hands of a few select Men, and their Heirs or Successors; and then it is an Oligarchy: Or else into the hands of one Man, and then it is a Monarchy: If to him and his Heirs, it is an Hereditary Monarchy: If to him only for Life, but upon his Death the Power only of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating a Successor, to return to them; an Elective Monarchy. And so accordingly of these make compounded and mixed Forms of Government, as they think good. And if the Legislative Power be at first given by the Majority to one or more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons only for their Lives, or any limited time, and then the Supream Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to them again; when it is so reverted,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:96077:182"/>
the Community may dispose of it again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new into what hands they please, and so constitute a new Form of Government. For the Form of Government depending upon the placing the Supream Power, which is the Legislative, it being impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive, that an inferiour Power should prescribe to a Superiour, or any but the Supream make Laws, According as the Power of making Laws is placed, such is the Form of the Commonwealth.</p>

               <p n="134">134. THE great end of Mens enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Society, being the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their Properties in Peace and Safety, and the great instrument and means of that being the Laws establish'd in that Society: The first and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal positive Law of all Commonwealths, is the establishing of the Legislative Power, as the first and fundamental natural Law which is to govern even the Legislative: It self is the preservation of the Society, and (as far as will consist with the publick good) of every person in it. This Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is not only the supream power of the Commonwealth, but sacred and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the hands where the Community have once placed it; nor can any Edict of any Body else, in what form soever conceived, or by what Power soever backed, have the force and obligation of a Law, which has not its Sanction from that Legislative which the publick has chosen and appointed: for without this the Law could not have that which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to its being a Law, the consent of the Society, over whom no

                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:96077:183"/>135. Though the Legislative, whether placed in one or more, whether it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in being, or only by intervals, though it be the Supream Power in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; yet, <hi>First,</hi> it is not, nor can possibly be absolutely Arbitrary, over the Lives and Fortunes of the People. For it being but the joint power of every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Society given up to that person, or Assembly, which is Legislator; it can be no more than those persons had in a state of Nature before they enter'd into Society, and gave it up to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For no Body can transfer to another more power than he has in himself; and no Body has an absolute Arbitrary Power over himself, or over any other, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy his own Life, or take away the Life or Property of another. A Man, as has been proved, cannot subject himself to the Arbitrary Power of another; and having in the state of Nature no Arbitrary Power over the Life, Liberty, or Possession of another, but only so much as the Law of Nature gave him for the preservation of himself, and the rest of Mankind; this is all he doth, or can give up to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and by it to the Legislative Power, so that the Legislative can have no more than this.

Thus the Law of Nature stands as an Eternal Rule to all Men, Legislators as well as others.

For the Law of Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwritten, and so no where to be found but in the minds of Men, they who through Passion or Interest, shall mis-cite, or misapply it, cannot so easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their mistake where there is no establish'd Judge: and so it serves not as it ought, to determine the Rights, and fence the Properties of those that live under it, especially where every one is Judge, Interpreter, and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of it too, and that in his own Case: and he that has right on his side, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily but his own single strength, hath not force enough to defend himself from Injuries, or punish Delinquents. To avoid these Inconveniencies which disorder
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96077:185"/>
Mens Properties in the state of Nature, Men unite into Societies, that they may have the united strength of the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to secure and defend their Properties, and may have standing Rules to bound it, by which every one may know what is his. To this end it is that Men give up all their natural power to the Society they enter into, and the Community put the Legislative Power into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be govern'd by declared Laws, or else their Peace, Quiet and Property, will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the state of Nature.</p>
               <p n="137">137. Absolute Arbitrary Power, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning without setled standing Laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of Society and Government, which Men would not quit the freedom of the state of Nature for, and tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Fortunes; and by stated Rules of Right and Property to secure their Peace and Quiet. It cannot be suppos'd, that they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Arbitrary Power over their Persons and Estates, and put a force into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates hand to execute his unlimited Will arbitrarily upon them: this were to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96077:185"/>
put themselves into a worse condition than the state of Nature, wherein they had a Liberty to defend their Right against the Injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by a single Man, or many in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power and Will of a Legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases. He being in a much worse condition, that is exposed to the Arbitrary Power of one Man who has the Command of 100000. than he that is expos'd to the Arbitrary Power of 100000. single Men, no Body being secure, that his Will, who has such a Command, is better than that of other Men, though his Force be 100000. times stronger. And therefore whatever Form the Commonwealth is under, the Ruling Power ought to govern by declared and received Laws, and not by extempory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates and undetermin'd Resolutions. For then Mankind will be in a far worse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than in the state of Nature, if they shall have armed one or a few Men with the joint power of a multitude, to force them to obey at pleasure the exorbitant and unlimited decrees of their sudden thoughts, or unrestrain'd, and till that
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96077:186"/>
moment unknown Wills without having any measures set down which may guide and justifie their actions. For all the power the Government has, being only for the good of the Society, as it ought not to be Arbitrary and at Pleasure: so it ought to be exercised by established and promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Laws; that both the People may know their Duty, and be safe and secure within the limits of the Law, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers too kept within their due bounds, and not be tempted by the power they have in their hands to imploy it to purposes, and by such measures as they would not have known, and own not willingly.</p>
               <p n="138">138. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Supream Power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take from any Man any part of his Property without his own consent. For the preservation of Property being the end of Government, and that for which Men enter into Society, it necessarily supposes and requires, that the People should have Property, without which they must be suppos'd to lose that by entering into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, which was the end for which they entered into it. Too gross an absurdity for any Man to own. Men therefore in Society having Property, they have such a right to the goods, which by the Law of the Community are theirs, that no Body hath a right to take them, or any part of them,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:96077:186"/>
from them, without their own consent; without this they have no Property at all. For I have truly no Property in that which another can by right take from me when he pleases, against my consent. Hence it is a mistake to think, that the Supream or Legislative Power of any Commonwealth, can do what it will, and dispose of the Estates of the Subject arbitrarily, or take any part of them at pleasure. This is not much to be fear'd in Governments where the Legislative consists wholly or in part in Assemblies which are variable, whose Members upon the dissolution of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, are Subjects under the common Laws of their Country, equally with the rest. But in Governments, where the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative is in one lasting Assembly, always in being, or in one Man, as in absolute Monarchies, there is danger still, that they will think themselves to have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct interest from the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and so will be apt to increase their own Riches and Power by taking what they think fit from the People. For a Mans Property is not at all secure, though there be good and equitable Laws to set the bounds of it between him and his Fellow Subjects, if he who commands those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, have power to take from any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man what part he pleases of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96077:187"/>
and use and dispose of it as he thinks good.</p>
               <p n="139">139. But Government into whosesoever hands it is put, being as I have before shew'd, intrusted with this condition, and for this end, that Men might have and secure their Properties, the Prince or Senate, however it may have power to make Laws for the regulating of Property between the Subjects one amongst another, yet can never have a Power to take to themselves the whole, or any part of the Subjects Property, without their own consent. For this would be in effect to leave them no Property at all. And to let us see, that even absolute Power, where it is necessary, is not arbitrary by being absolute, but is still limited by that reason, and confined to those ends which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in some Cases to be absolute, we need look no farther than the common practice of Martial Discipline. For the preservation of the Army, and in it of the whole Commonwealth, requires an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Obedience to the Command of every superiour Officer, and it is justly Death to disobey or dispute the most dangerous or unreasonable of them; but yet we see, that neither the Serjeant that could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Souldier to march up to the mouth of a Cannon, or stand in a Breach where
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:96077:187"/>
he is almost sure to perish; can command that Souldier to give him one penny of his money: nor the General that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to Death for deserting his Post, or not obeying the most desperate Orders, cannot yet with all his absolute Power of Life and Death, dispose of one Farthing of that Souldiers Estate, or seize one jot of his Goods; whom yet he can command any thing, and hang for the least disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Because such a blind Obedience is necessary to that end for which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander has his Power, <hi>viz.</hi> the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the rest, but the disposing of his goods has nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p n="140">140. 'Tis true, Governments cannot be supported without great Charge, and 'tis fit every one who enjoys his share of the Protection, should pay, out of his Estate, his proportion for the maintenance of it. But still it must be with his own Consent, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Consent of the Majority, giving it either by themselves, or their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives chosen by them; for if any one shall claim a Power to lay and levy Taxes on the People, by his own Authority, and without such consent of the People, he thereby invades the Fundamental Law of Property, and subverts the end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For what property have I in that which another may by right take when he pleases to himself.</p>
               <p n="141">
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:96077:188"/>141. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Legislative cannot transfer the Power of making Laws to any other hands, for it being but a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Power from the People, they who have it cannot pass it over to others. The People alone can appoint the Form of the Commonwealth, which is by Constituting the Legislative, and appointing in whose hands that shall be. And when the People have said, We will submit, and be govern'd by Laws made by such Men, and in such Forms; no Body else can say other Men shall make Laws for them: nor can they be bound by any Laws but such as are Enacted by those whom they have Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and Authorised to make Laws for them.</p>
               <p n="142">142. These are the Bounds which the trust that is put in them by the Society, and the Law of God and Nature, have set to the Legislative Power of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in all Forms of Government: First, They are to govern by promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted establish'd Laws, not to be varied in particular Cases, but to have one Rule for Rich and Poor, for the Favourite at Court, and the Country Man at Plough. Secondly, These Laws also ought to be designed for no other end ultimately but the good of the People. Thirdly, They must not raise Taxes on the Property of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:96077:188"/>
the People, without the Consent of the People, given by themselves, or their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties. And this properly concerns only such Governments where the Legislative is always in being, or at least where the People have not reserv'd any part of the Legislative to Deputies, to be from time to time chosen by themselves. Fourthly, Legislative neither must nor can transfer the Power of making Laws to any Body else, or place it any where but where the People have.</p>

               <p n="143">143. THE Legislative Power is that which has a right to direct how the Force of the Commonwealth shall be imploy'd for preserving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and the Members of it. Because those Laws which are constantly to be Executed, and whose Force is always to continue, may be made in a little time; therefore there is no need that the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive should be always in being, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always business to do. And because it may be too great temptation to humane
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:96077:189"/>
frailty, apt to grasp at Power, for the same Persons who have the Power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them, whereby they may exempt themselves from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws they make, and suit the Law, both in its making and execution, to their own private advantage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by come to have a distinct interest from the rest of the Community, contrary to the end of Society and Government. Therefore in well order'd Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, where the good of the whole is so considered as it ought, the Legislative Power is put into the hands of divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who duly Assembled, have by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or jointly with others, a Power to make Laws, which when they have done, being separated again, they are themselves subject to the Laws they have made; which is a new and near tie upon them to take care that they make them for the publick good.</p>
               <p n="144">144. But because the Laws that are at once, and in a short time made, have a constant and lasting force, and need a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Execution, or an attendance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: Therefore 'tis necessary there should be a Power always in being, which should see to the Execution of the Laws that are made, and remain in force. And thus
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96077:189"/>
the Legislative and Executive Power come often to be separated.</p>
               <p n="145">145. There is another Power in every Commonwealth, which one may call na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, because it is that which answers to the Power every Man naturally had before he entered into Society. For though in a Commonwealth the Members of it are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons still in reference to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as such are governed by the Laws of the Society; yet in reference to the rest of Mankind, they make one Body, which is, as every Member of it before was, still in the state of Nature with the rest of Mankind: so that the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that happen between any Man of the Society with those that are out of it, are managed by the publick; and an injury done to a Member of their Body, engages the whole in the reparation of it. So that under this consideration, the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity is one Body in the state of Nature, in respect of all other States or Persons out of its Community.</p>
               <p n="146">146. This therefore contains the Power of War and Peace, Leagues and Alliances, and all the Transactions, with all Persons and Communities without the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and may be called Federative, if any one pleases. So the thing be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, I am indifferent as to the name.</p>
               <p n="147">
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:96077:190"/>147. These two Powers, Executive and Federative, though they be really distinct in themselves, yet one comprehending the Execution of the Municipal Laws of the Society within its self, upon all that are parts of it; the other the management of the security and interest of the publick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, with all those, that it may receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or damage from, yet they are always almost united. And though this Federa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power in the well or ill management of it be of great moment to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet it is much less capable to be directed by antecedent, standing, positive Laws, than the Executive; and so must necessarily be left to the Prudence and Wisdom of those whose hands it is in, to be managed for the publick good. For the Laws that concern Subjects one amongst another, being to direct their actions, may well enough precede them. But what is to be done in reference to Foreigners, depending much upon their actions, and the variation of designs and interests must be left in great part to the Prudence of those who have this Power committed to them, to be managed by the best of their Skill for the advantage of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p n="148">148. Though, as I said, the Executive and Federative Power of every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96077:190"/>
be really distinct in themselves, yet they are hardly to be separated and placed at the same time in the hands of distinct Persons. For both of them requiring the force of the Society for their exercise, it is almost impracticable to place the Force of the Commonwealth in distinct, and not subordinate hands; or that the Executive and Federative Power should be placed in Persons that might act separately, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Force of the publick would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Commands, which would be apt sometime or other to cause disorder and ruin.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Subordination of the Powers of the Commonwealth.</head>
               <p n="149">149. THough in a Constituted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, standing upon its own Basis, and acting according to its own nature, that is, acting for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Community, there can be but one Supream Power, which is the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to which all the rest are and must be subordinate, yet the Legislative being only a Fiduciary Power to act for certain ends, there remains still in the People a
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96077:191"/>
Supream Power to remove or alter the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative, when they find the Legislative act contrary to the trust reposed in them. For all Power given with trust for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an end, being limited by that end, when ever that end is manifestly neglected, or opposed, the trust must necessarily be forfeited, and the Power devolve into the hands of those that gave it, who may place it a-new where they shall think best for their safety and security. And thus the Community perpetually retains a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power of saving themselves from the attempts and designs of any Body, even of their Legislators, whenever they shall be so foolish, or so wicked, as to lay and carry on designs against the Liberties and Properties of the Subject. For no Man or Society of Men, having a Power to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up their Preservation, or consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the means of it, to the absolute Will, and arbitrary Dominion of another; when ever any one shall go about to bring them into such a Slavish Condition, they will always have a right to preserve what they have not a Power to part with; and to rid themselves of those who invade this Fundamental, Sacred, and unalterable Law of Self-Preservation, for which they enter'd into Society. And thus the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity may be said in this respect, to be
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:96077:191"/>
always the Supream Power, but not as considered under any Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because this Power of the People can never take place till the Government be dissolv'd.</p>
               <p n="150">150. In all Cases, whilst the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment subsists, the Legislative is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power. For what can give Laws to another must needs be superiour to him; and since the Legislative is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Legislative of the Society, but by the right it has to make Laws for all the parts, and every Member of the Society prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Rules to their actions, and giving power of Execution where they are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed, the Legislative must needs be the Supream, and all other Powers in any Members or parts of the Society, derived from and subordinate to it.</p>
               <p n="151">151. In some Commonwealths where the Legislative is not always in being, and the Executive is vested in a single Person, who has also a share in the Legislative; there that single Person in a very tolerable sense may also be called Supream; not that he has in himself all the Supream Power, which is that of Law-making: but because he has in him the supream Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, from whom all inferiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates derive all their several subordinate Powers, or at least the greatest part of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:96077:192"/>
them; having also no Legislative superiour to him, there being no Law to be made without his consent, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected should ever subject him to the other part of the Legislative, he is properly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in this sense Supream. But yet it is to be observed, that though Oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and Fealty are taken to him, 'tis not to him as Supream Legislator, but as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Executor of the Law, made by a joint Power of him with others; Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being nothing but an Obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, which when he violates, he has no right to Obedience, nor can claim it otherwise than as the publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vested with the Power of the Law, and so is to be consider'd as the Image, Phantom, or Representative of the Commonwealth, acted by the will of the Society, declared in its Laws; and thus he has no Will, no Power, but that of the Law. But when he quits this Representation, this publick Will, and acts by his own private Will, he degrades him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and is but a single private Person with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Power, and without Will. The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers owing no Obedience but to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Will of the Society.</p>
               <p n="152">152. The Executive Power placed any where but in a Person that has also a share in the Legislative, is visibly subordinate and accountable to it, and may be at pleasure
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96077:192"/>
changed and displaced; so that it is not the Supream Executive Power that is exempt from Subordination, but the Supream Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Power vested in one, who having a share in the Legislative, has no distinct supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Legislative to be subordinate and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to, father than he himself shall join and consent, so that he is no more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate than he himself shall think fit, which one may certainly conclude will be but very little. Of other Ministerial and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Powers in a Commonwealth, we need not speak, they being so multiply'd with infinite variety in the different Customs and Constitutions of distinct Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, that it is impossible to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of them all. Only thus much which is necessary to our present purpose we may take notice of concerning them, that they have no manner of Authority any of them, beyond what is by positive Grant and Commission delegated to them, and are all of them accountable to some other Power in the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="153">153. It is not necessary, no nor so much as convenient, that the Legislative should be always in being. But absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the Executive Power should, because there is not always need of new Laws to be made, but always need of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Laws that are made. When
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:96077:193"/>
the Legislative hath put the Execution of the Laws they make into other hands, they have a power still to resume it out of those hands when they find cause, and to punish for any mall-administration against the Laws. The same holds also in regard of the Federative Power, that and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive being both Ministerial and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the Legislative, which as has been shew'd in a Constituted Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is the Supream. The Legislative also in this Case being suppos'd to consist of several Persons; for if it be a single Person, it cannot but be always in being, and so will as Supream, naturally have the Supream Executive Power, together with the Legislative, may assemble and exercise their Legislative, at the times that either their original Constitution, or their own Adjournment appoints, or when they please; if neither of these hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any time, or there be no other way prescribed to convoke them. For the Supream Power being placed in them by the People, 'tis always in them, and they may exercise it when they please, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by their original Constitution, they are limited to certain Seasons, or by an Act of their Supream Power, they have Adjourned to a certain time, and when that time comes, they have a right to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble and act again.</p>
               <p n="154">
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:96077:193"/>154. If the Legislative, or any part of it be of Representatives, chosen for that time by the People, which afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the ordinary state of Subjects, and have no share in the Legislature but upon a new choice, this power of chuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must also be exercised by the People, either at certain appointed Seasons, or else when they are summon'd to it; and in this latter Case, the power of convoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Legislative, is ordinarily placed in the Executive, and has one of these two limitations in respect of time: That either the Original Constitution requires their Assembling and acting at certain intervals, and then the Executive Power does nothing but Ministerially issue directions for their Electing and Assembling, according to due Forms: Or else it is left to his Prudence to call them by new Elections, when the occasions or exigencies of the publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the amendment of old, or making of new Laws, or the redress or prevention of any inconveniencies that lye on, or threaten the People.</p>
               <p n="155">155. It may be demanded here, what if the Executive Power, being possessed of the force of the Commonwealth, shall make use of that force to hinder the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting of the Legislative, when the original Constitution, or the publick
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:96077:194"/>
Exigencies require it? I say using Force upon the People, without Authority, and contrary to the Trust put in him that does so, is a state of War with the People, who have a right to reinstate their Legislative in the Exercise of their Power. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving erected a Legislative with an intent they should exercise the Power of making Laws, either at certain set times, or when there is need of it; when they are hinder'd by any force from what is so necessary to the Society, and wherein the safety and preservation of the People consists, the People have a right to remove it by force. In all states and conditions the true reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Force without Authority, is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Force to it. The use of Force with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority, always puts him that uses it into a state of War, as the Aggressor, and renders him liable to be treated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p n="156">156. The Power of Assembling, and dismissing the Legislative, placed in the Executive, gives not the Executive a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over it, but is a Fiduciary Trust placed in him for the safety of the People, in a Case where the uncertainty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableness of humane affairs could not bear a steady fixed rule. For it not being possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the first Framers of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should by any foresight, be so much
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:96077:194"/>
Masters of future Events, as to be able to prefix so just periods of return and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Assemblies of the Legislative, in all times to come, that might exactly answer all the Exigences of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; the best remedy could be found for this defect, was to trust this to the prudence of one who was always to be present, and whose business it was to watch over the publick good. Constant frequent meetings of the Legislative, and long Continuations of their Assemblies, without necessary occasion, could not but be burthensome to the People, and must necessarily in time produce more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inconveniencies, and yet the quick turn of affairs, might be sometimes such as to need their present help: any delay of their Convening might endanger the publick, and sometimes too their business might be so great, that the limited time of their sitting might be too short for their work, and rob the publick of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which could be had only from their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation. What then could be done in this Case to prevent the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from being exposed sometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eminent hazard on one side, or the other, by fixed intervals and periods, set to the meeting and acting of the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slative. But to intrust it to the prudence
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:96077:195"/>
of some, who being present, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the state of publick affairs, might make use of this Prerogative for the publick good? And where else could this be so well placed as in his hands who was intrusted with the Execution of the Laws for the same end? Thus supposing the regulation of times for the Assembling and Sitting of the Legislative, not setled by the original Constitution, it naturally fell into the hands of the Executive; not as an Arbitrary Power depending on his good pleasure, but with this trust always to have it exercised only for the publick Weal, as the Occurrences of times and change of affairs might require. Whether setled periods of their Convening, or a liberty left to the Prince for Convoking the Legislative, or perhaps a mixture of both, hath the least inconvenience attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, 'tis not my business here to inquire, but only to shew, that though the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power may have the Prerogative of Convoking and dissolving such Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Legislative, yet it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by superiour to it.</p>
               <p n="157">157. Things of this World are in so constant a Flux, that nothing remains long in the same State. Thus People, Riches, Trade, Power, change their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; flourishing mighty Cities come to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:96077:195"/>
ruine, and prove in time neglected deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Corners, whilst other unfrequented places grow into populous Countries, fill'd with Wealth and Inhabitants. But things not always changing equally, and private interest often keeping up Customs and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges when the reasons of them are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it often comes to pass, that in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where part of the Legislative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of Representatives chosen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that in tract of time, this Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation becomes very unequal and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the reasons it was at first establish'd upon. To what gross absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities the following of Custom when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son has left it may lead, we may be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when we see the bare name of a Town, of which there remains not so much as the ruins, where scarce so much Housing as a Sheepcoat, or more Inhabitants than a Shepherd is to be found, send as many Representatives to the grand Assembly of Law-makers, as a whole County nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in People, and powerful in riches. This Strangers stand amazed at, and every one must confess needs a remedy. Though most think it hard to find one, because the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Legislative being the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and supream act of the Society, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to all positive Laws in it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending wholly on the People, no inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96077:196"/>
Power can alter it. And therefore the People, when the Legislative is once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, having in such a Government as we have been speaking of, no Power to act as long as the Government stands; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience is thought incapable of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p n="158">158. <hi>Salus Populi Suprema Lex,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly so just and fundamental a Rule, that he who sincerely follows it cannot dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously err. If therefore the Executive, who has the Power of Convoking the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative, observing rather the true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than fashion of Representation, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates not by old custom, but true reason, the number of Members, in all places, that have a right to be distinctly represented, which no part of the People, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, can pretend to; but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the assistance which it affords to the publick, it cannot be judg'd to have set up a new Legislative, but to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored the old and true one, and to have rectified the disorders which succession of time had insensibly as well as inevitably introduced; for it being the interest as well as intention of the People to have a fair and equal Representative; whoever brings it nearest to that, is an undoubted Friend to, and Establisher of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cannot miss the Consent and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96077:196"/>
Approbation of the Community. Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being nothing but a Power in the hands of the Prince to provide for the publick good, in such Cases, which depending upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen and uncertain Occurrences, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and unalterable Laws could not safely direct. Whatsoever shall be done mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly for the good of the People, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the Government upon its true Foundations, is, and always will be, just Prerogative. The Power of Erecting new Corporations, and therewith new Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, carries with it a supposition, that in time, the measures of representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might vary, and those have a just right to be represented which before had none; and by the same reason, those cease to have a right, and be too inconsiderable for such a priviledge which before had it. 'Tis not a Change from the present State which perhaps Corruption or decay has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, that makes an Inroad upon the Government, but the tendency of it to injure or oppress the People, and to set up one part or Party with a distinction from, and an unequal subjection of the rest. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever cannot but be acknowledged to be of advantage to the Society and People in general, upon just and lasting measures, will always, when done, justify it self; and whenever the People shall chuse their
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:96077:197"/>
Representatives upon just and undeniably equal measures, suitable to the original Frame of the Government, it cannot be doubted to be the will and act of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whoever permitted or propos'd to them so to do.</p>

               <p n="159">159. WHere the Legislative and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive Power are in distinct hands, as they are in all moderated Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and well-framed Governments, there the good of the Society requires, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things should be left to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him that has the Executive Power. For the Legislators not being able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see and provide, by Laws, for all that may be useful to the Community, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor of the Laws having the power in his hands, has by the common Law of Nature, a right to make use of it for the good of the Society, in many Cases where the municipal Law has given no directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till the Legislative can conveniently be Assembled to provide for it; nay many things there are which the Law can by no means provide for, and those must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:96077:197"/>
be left to the discretion of him that has the Executive Power in his hands, to be ordered by him as the publick good and advantage shall require; nay, 'tis fit that the Laws themselves, should in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, give way to the Executive Power, or rather to this Fundamental Law of Nature and Government, <hi>viz.</hi> That as much as may be, all the Members of the Society are to be preserved. For since many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may happen wherein a strict and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid observation of the Laws may do harm, as not to pull down an innocent Mans House to stop the Fire when the next to it is burning; and a Man may come some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times within the reach of the Law, which makes no distinction of Persons, by an action that may deserve reward and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. 'Tis fit the Ruler should have a Power in many Cases to mitigate the severity of the Law, and pardon some Offenders, since the end of Government, being the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all as much as may be, even the guilty are to be spared where it can prove no prejudice to the innocent.</p>
               <p n="160">160. This Power to act according to discretion for the publick good, without the prescription of the Law, and sometimes even against it, is that which is called Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; for since in fome Governments the Law-making Power is not always in
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:96077:198"/>
being, and is usually too numerous, and so too slow for the dispatch requisite to Execution; and because also it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to foresee, and so by Laws to provide for all accidents and necessities that may concern the publick, or make such Laws as will do no harm, if they are Executed with an inflexible rigour on all occasions, and upon all Persons that may come in their way, therefore there is a latitude left to the Executive Power, to do many things of choice which the Laws do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.</p>

This Power whilst imployed for the benefit of the Community, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the trust and ends of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is undoubted Prerogative, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is questioned. For the People are very seldom, or never scrupulous or nice in the point, or questioning of Prerogative, whilst it is in any tolerable degree imploy'd for the use it was meant, that is, the good of the People, and not manifestly against it. But if there comes to be a question between the Executive Power and the People, about a thing claimed as a Prerogative; the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the exercise of such Prerogative, to the good or hurt of the People, will easily decide that question.</p>
               <p n="162">162. It is easy to conceive, that in the Infancy of Governments, when Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:96077:198"/>
differed little from Families in number of People, they differ'd from them too, but little in number of Laws: and the Governours being as the Fathers of them, watching over them for their good, the Government was almost all Prerogative. A few establish'd Laws served the turn, and the discretion and care of the Ruler supply'd the rest. But when mistake or flattery prevailed with weak Princes, to make use of this Power for private ends of their own, and not for the publick good, the people were fain by express Laws, to get Prerogative determin'd in those points wherein they found disadvantage from it: And declared limitations of Prerogative in those Cases which they and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors had left in the utmost latitude, to the Wisdom of those Princes who made no other but a right use of it, that is, for the good of their People.</p>
               <p n="163">163. And therefore they have a very wrong notion of Government, who say, that the People have incroach'd upon the Prerogative when they have got any part of it to be defined by positive Laws. For in so doing they have not pulled from the Prince any thing that of right belong'd to him, but only declared, that that Power which they indefinitely left in him, or his Ancestors hands, to be exercised for their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:96077:199"/>
good, was not a thing they intended him, when he used it otherwise. For the End of Government being the good of the Community, whatsoever alterations are made in it, tending to that end, cannot be an incroachment upon any body; since no body, in Government, can have a right tending to any other end. And those only are incroachments which prejudice or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the publick good. Those who say otherwise, speak as if the Prince had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and separate Interest from the good of the Community, and was not made for it. The Root and Source from which spring almost all those Evils and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which happen in Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And indeed, if that be so, the People, under his Government, are not a Society of Rational Creatures, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Community, for their mutual good, such as have set Rulers over themselves, to guard and promote that good; but are to be looked on as an Herd of inferiour Creatures, under the Dominion of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who keeps them, and works them, for his own Pleasure or Profit. If Men were so void of Reason, and brutish, as to enter into Society upon such Terms, Prerogative might indeed be, what some Men would have it, an Arbitrary Power to do things hurtful to the People.</p>
               <p n="164">
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:96077:199"/>164. But since a Rational Creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be supposed, when free, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into Subjection to another, for his own harm: (though where he finds a good and a wise Ruler, he may not, perhaps, think it either necessary or useful to set precise Bounds to his Power in all things) Prerogative can be nothing but the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples permitting their Rulers to do several things of their own free choice, where the Law was silent, and sometimes too against the direct Letter of the Law, for the publick good, and their acquiescing in it when so done. For as a good Prince, who is mindful of the trust put into his hands, and careful of the good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cannot have too much Prerogative, that is, Power to do good: So a weak and ill Prince, who would claim that Power his Predecessors exercised, without the direction of the Law, as a Prerogative belonging to him by Right of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which he may exercise at his pleasure, to make or promote an Interest distinct from that of the publick, gives the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an occasion to claim their Right, and limit that Power, which, whilst it was exercised for their good, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent should be tacitly allowed.</p>
               <p n="165">165. And therefore he that will look into the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will find that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:96077:200"/>
Prerogative was always largest in the hands of our wisest and best Princes: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the People observing the whole ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of their Actions to be the publick good, or if any humane frailty or mistake (for Princes are but Men, made as others) appear'd in some small declinations from that end; yet 'twas visible, the main of their Conduct tended to nothing but the care of the publick. The People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding reason to be satisfied with these Princes, whenever they acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or contrary to the Letter of the Law, acquiesced in what they did, and without the least complaint, let them inlarge their Prerogative as they pleased, judging rightly that they did nothing herein to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their Laws, since they acted conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Foundation and End of all Laws, the publick good.</p>
               <p n="166">166. Such God-like Princes indeed had some Title to Arbitrary Power, by that Argument that would prove Absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy the best Government, as that which God himself governs the Universe by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such Kings partake of his Wisdom and Goodness. Upon this is founded that saying, That the Reigns of good Princes have been always most dangerous to the Liberties of their People. For when their Successors, managing the Government
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:96077:200"/>
with different Thoughts, would draw the Actions of those good Rulers into Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and make them the Standard of their Prerogative; as if what had been done only for the good of the People, was a right in them to do for the harm of the People, if they so pleased: It has often occasioned Contest, and sometimes publick Disorders, before the People could recover their original Right, and get that to be declared not to be Prerogative which truly was never so: since it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible any body, in the Society, should ever have a right to do the People harm, though it be very possible and reasonable that the People should not go about to set any Bounds to the Prerogative of those Kings or Rulers, who themselves trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed not the Bounds of the publick good. For <hi>Prerogative is nothing but the Power of doing publick good, without a Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="167">167. The Power of calling Parliaments in <hi>England,</hi> as to precise time, place, and duration, is certainly a Prerogative of the King, but still with this trust, that it shall be made use of for the good of the Nation, as the exigencies of the Times, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Occasion shall require. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible to foresee which should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be the fittest place for them to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:96077:201"/>
in, and what the best season: the choice of these was left with the Executive Power, as might be best subservient to the publick good, and best suit the ends of Parliaments.</p>
               <p n="168">168. The old Question will be asked in this matter of Prerogative, But who shall be Judge when this Power is made a right use of? I answer: Between an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Power in being, with such a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and a Legislative, that depends upon his will for their convening, there can be no Judge on Earth. As there can be none between the Legislative and the People, should either the executive, or the Legislative, when they have got the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in their hands, design, or go about to enslave or destroy them. The People have no other remedy in this, as in all other cases, where they have no Judge on earth, but to appeal to Heaven. For the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in such attempts, exercising a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the people never put into their hands, who can never be supposed to consent that any body should rule over them for their harm, do that which they have not a right to do. And where the Body of the People, or any single Man, are deprived of their Right, or are under the Exercise of a power without right, having no Appeal on earth, they have a liberty to appeal to Heaven, when-ever they judge the Cause
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:96077:201"/>
of sufficient moment. And therefore, though the People cannot be Judge, so as to have, by the Constitution of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, any Superiour power, to determine and give effective Sentence in the case; yet they have reserv'd that ultimate Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to themselves, which belongs to all Mankind, where there lies no Appeal on Earth; by a Law antecedent, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to all positive Laws of Men, whether they have just Cause to make their Appeal to Heaven. And this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they cannot part with, it being out of a Man's power so to submit himself to another, as to give him a liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him; God and Nature never allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man so to abandon himself, as to neglect his own preservation. And since he cannot take away his own Life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he give another power to take it. Nor let any one think this lays a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual foundation for Disorder; for this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not till the Inconvenience is so great, that the Majority feel it, and are weary of it, and find a necessity to have it amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this the Executive Power, or wise Princes never need come in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of. And 'tis the thing, of all others, they have most need to avoid, as, of all others, the most perilous.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Of Paternal, Political, and Despotical Power, considered together.</head>
               <p n="169">169. THough I have had occasion to speak of these separately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet the great mistakes, of late, about Government, having, as I suppose, arisen from confounding these distinct Powers one with another, it may not, perhaps, be amiss, to consider them here together.</p>
               <p n="170">170. <hi>First</hi> then, Paternal or Parental Power, is nothing but that which Parents have over their Children, to govern them, for the Childrens good, till they come to the use of Reason, or a state of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wherein they may be supposed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to understand that Rule, whether it be the Law of Nature, or the municipal Law of their Countrey, they are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themselves by: Capable, I say, to know it, as well as several others, who live as Free-men under that Law. The Affection and Tenderness God hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the breasts of Parents, towards their Children, makes it evident, that this is not intended to be a severe. Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but only for the Help, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Preservation of their Off-spring.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:96077:202"/>
But, happen it as it will, there is, as I have proved, no reason why it should be thought to extend to Life and Death, at any time, over their Children, more than over any body else, or keep the Child in subjection to the Will of his Parents, when grown to a Man, and the perfect use of Reason, any farther, than as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Life and Education from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, obliges him to Respect, Honour, Gratitude, Assistance, and Support, all his Life, to both Father and Mother. And thus, 'tis true, the Paternal is a natural Government; but not at all extending it self to the Ends and Jurisdictions of that which is Political. The Power of the Father doth not reach at all to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Child, which is only in his own disposing.</p>
               <p n="171">171. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Political Power is that Power, which every Man, having in the state of Nature, has given up into the hands of the Society, and therein to the Governours, whom the Society hath set over it self, with this express, or tacit Trust, That it shall be imployed for their good, and the preservation of their Property: Now this Power, which every Man has in the state of Nature, and which he parts with to the Society, in all such cases where the Society can secure him,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:96077:203"/>
is to use such means for the preserving of his own Property, as he thinks good, and Nature allows him; and to punish the Breach of the Law of Nature in others; so as (according to the best of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) may most conduce to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himself, and the rest of Mankind; so that the end and measure of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when in every Man's hands, in the state of Nature, being the preservation of all of his Society, that is, all Mankind in general. It can have no other end or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, when in the hands of the Magistrate, but to preserve the Members of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in their Lives, Liberties, and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions; and so cannot be an Absolute, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power over their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which are as much as possible to be preserved; But a Power to make Laws, and annex such Penalties to them, as may tend to the preservation of the whole, by cutting off those Parts, and those only, which are so corrupt, that they threaten the sound and healthy, without which no severity is lawful. And this Power has its Original only from Compact and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and the mutual Consent of those who make up the Community.</p>
               <p n="172">172. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Despotical Power is an Absolute, Arbitrary Power, one Man has over another, to take away his Life when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:96077:203"/>
he pleases; and this is a Power, which neither Nature gives, for it has made no such distinction between one Man and another, nor Compact can convey. For Man, not having such an Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his own Life, cannot give another Man such a Power over it, but it is the effect only of Forfeiture, which the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor makes of his own Life, when he puts himself into the state of War with another. For having quitted Reason, which God hath given to be the Rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Man and Man, and the peaceable ways which that teaches, and made use of Force to compass his unjust ends upon another, where he has no right, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himself liable to be destroyed by his Adversary, when-ever he can, as any other noxious and brutish Creature that is destructive to his Being. And thus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, taken in a just and lawful War, and such only, are subject to a Despotical Power, which as it arises not from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, so neither is it capable of any, but is the state of War continued. For what Compact can be made with a Man that is not Master of his own Life? What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can he perform? And if he be once allowed to be Master of his own Life, the Despotical, Arbitrary Power of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster ceases. He that is Master of himself,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:96077:204"/>
and his own Life, has a right too to the means of preserving it; so that as soon as Compact enters, Slavery ceases, and he so far quits his Absolute Power, and puts an end to the state of War, who enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conditions with his Captive.</p>
               <p n="173">173. Nature gives the first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> Paternal Power, to Parents, for the Benefit of their Children, during their Minority, to supply their want of Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and understanding how to manage their Property. (By Property I must be understood here, as in other places, to mean that Property which Men have in their Persons as well as Goods.) Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Agreement gives the second, <hi>viz.</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Power, to Governours, for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their Subjects, to secure them in the Possession and Use of their Properties. And Forfeiture gives the third, Despoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power, to Lords, for their own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit over those who are stripp'd of all Property.</p>
               <p n="174">174. He that shall consider the distinct rise and extent, and the different ends of these several Powers, will plainly see that Paternal Power comes as far short of that of the Magistrate, as Despotical exceeds it; and that Absolute Dominion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever placed, is so far from being one kind of civil Society, that it is as inconsistent
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:96077:204"/>
with it as Slavery is with Property. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power is only where Minority makes the Child incapable to manage his Property; Political where Men have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in their own disposal; and Despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical over such as have no Property at all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Of CONQVEST.</head>
               <p n="175">175. THough Governments can origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally have no other Rise, than that before mentioned, nor Polities be founded on any thing but the Consent of the People; yet such has been the Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Ambition has fill'd the World with, that in the noise of War, which makes so great a part of the History of Mankind, this Consent is little taken notice of: and therefore many have mistaken the force of Arms for the Consent of the People, and reckon Conquest as one of the Originals of Government. But Conquest is as far from setting up any Government, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing an House is from building a new one in the place. Indeed it often makes way for a new Frame of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, by destroying the former;
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:96077:205"/>
but, without the Consent of the People, can never erect a new one.</p>
               <p n="176">176. That the Aggressor, who puts himself into the state of War with another, and unjustly invades another Man's right, can, by such an unjust War, never come to have a right over the Conquered, will be easily agreed by all Men, who will not think that Robbers and Pyrates have a Right of Empire over whomsoever they have Force enough to master, or that Men are bound by Promises, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Force extorts from them. Should a Robber break into my House, and with a Dagger at my Throat, make me seal Deeds to convey my Estate to him, would this give him any Title? Just such a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by his Sword, has an unjust Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who forces me into Submission. The Injury and the Crime is equal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed by the wearer of a Crown, or some petty Villain. The Title of the Offender, and the Number of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers make no difference in the Offence, unless it be to aggravate it. The only difference is, Great Robbers punish little ones to keep them in their Obedience; but the great ones are rewarded with Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Triumphs, because they are too big for the weak hands of Justice, in this World, and have the Power in their own
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:96077:205"/>
possession which should punish Offenders. What is my Remedy against a Robber that so broke into my House? Appeal to the Law for Justice. But perhaps Justice is deny'd, or I am crippled and cannot stir; Robbed and have not the means to do it. If God has taken away all means of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedy, there is nothing left but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But my Son, when able, may seek the Relief of the Law, which I am denyed: he or his Son may renew his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, till he recover his Right. But the Conquered, or their Children, have no Court, no Arbitrator on Earth to appeal to. Then they may appeal, as <hi>Iephtha</hi> did, to Heaven, and repeat their Appeal, till they have recovered the native Right of their Ancestours, which was, to have such a Legislative over them, as the Majority should approve, and freely acquiesce in. If it be objected, this would cause endless trouble; I answer, No more than Justice does, where she lies open to all that appeal to her. He that troubles his Neighbour, without a Cause, is punished for it, by the Justice of the Court he appeals to. And he that appeals to Heaven, must be sure he has Right on his side: and a Right too that is worth the Trouble and Cost of the Appeal, as he will answer at a Tribunal that cannot be deceived, and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:96077:206"/>
will be sure to retribute to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Mischiefs he hath created to his Fellow-Subjects; that is, any part of Mankind. From whence 'tis plain, that he that conquers, in an unjust War, can thereby have no Title to the Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Obedience of the Conquered.</p>
               <p n="177">177. But, supposing Victory favours the right side, let us consider a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in a lawful War, and see what Power he gets, and over whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis plain he gets no Power by his Conquest over those that Conquered with him. They that fought on his side cannot suffer by the Conquest, but must, at least, be as much Free-men as they were before. And most commonly they serve upon Terms, and on Condition to share with their Leader, and enjoy a part of the Spoil, and other Advantages that attend the conquering Sword: Or, at least, have a part of the subdued Countrey bestowed upon them. And the conquering People, are not, I hope, to be Slaves by Conquest, and wear their Laurels only to shew they are Sacrifices to their Leader's Triumph. They that found Absolute Monarchy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Title of the Sword, make their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, who are the Founders of such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, arrant <hi>Draw-can-Sirs,</hi> and forget they had any Officers and Souldiers
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96077:206"/>
that fought on their side, in the Battles they won, or assisted them in the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or shared in possessing the Countries they Master'd. We are told by some, that the English Monarchy is founded in the Norman Conquest, and that our Princes have thereby a Title to absolute Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which if it were true, (as by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story it appears otherwise) and that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had a right to make War on this Island; yet his Dominion by Conquest, could reach no farther than to the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britans,</hi> that were then Inhabitants of this Country. The <hi>Normans</hi> that came with him, and helped to Conquer, and all descended from them are Freemen, and no Subjects by Conquest; let that give what Dominion it will. And if I, or any Body else, shall claim freedom, as derived from them, it will be very hard to prove the contrary: And 'tis plain, the Law that has made no distinction between the one and the other, intends not there should be any difference in their Freedom or Priviledges.</p>
               <p n="178">178. But supposing, which seldom happens, that the Conquerers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd never incorporate into one People, under the same Laws and Freedom. Let us see next, what Power a lawful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer has over the subdued, and that I
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:96077:207"/>
say is purely Despotical. He has an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power over the Lives of those, who, by an unjust War, have forfeited them; but not over the Lives or Fortunes of those, who ingaged not in the War, nor over the Possessions even of those who were actually engaged in it.</p>
               <p n="179">179. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say then the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour gets no Power but only over those who have actually assisted, concurr'd, or consented to that unjust force that is used against him. For the People having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their Governours no Power to do an unjust thing, such as is to make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just War, (for they never had such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in themselves:) They ought not to be charged, as guilty of the violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice that is committed in an unjust War, any farther than they actually abet it, no more than they are to be thought guilty of any Violence or Oppression their Governours should use upon the People themselves, or any part of their Fellow-Subjects, they having impowered them no more to the one than to the other. Conquerours, 'tis true, seldom trouble themselves to make the distinction, but they willingly permit the confusion of War to sweep all together; but yet this alters not the Right: for the Conquerour's Power over the Lives of the Conquered,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:96077:207"/>
being only because they have used force to do or maintain an injustice, he can have that power only over those who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd in that force, all the rest are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and he has no more title over the people of that Country, who have done him no injury, and so have made no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Lives, than he has over any other, who without any injuries or provocations, have lived upon fair terms with him.</p>
               <p n="180">180. Thirdly, The Power a Conquerer gets over those he overcomes in a just War, is perfectly despotical; he has an absolute Power over the Lives of those, who by putting themselves in a state of War, have forfeited them; but he has not thereby a right and title to their Possessions. This I doubt not, but at first sight, will seem a strange Doctrine, it being so quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of the World. There being nothing more familiar in speaking of the dominion of Countries, than to say such an one Conquer'd it. As if Conquest, without any more ado, convey'd a right of Possession. But when we consider, that the practice of the strong and powerful, how universal soever it may be, is seldom the rule of Right, however it be one part of the subjection of the Conquer'd not to argue against the Conditions cut out to

Though in all War there be usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a complication of force and damage, and the Aggressor seldom fails to harm the Estate, when he uses force against the persons of those he makes War upon; yet 'tis the use of force only that puts a Man into the State of War. For whether by force he begins the injury; or else having quietly, and by fraud, done the injury, he refuses to make reparation, and by force maintains it, which is the same thing as at first to have done it by force; 'tis the unjust use of force that makes the War. For he that breaks open my House, and violently turns me out of Doors; or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving peaceably got in, by force keeps me out, does in effect the same thing; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing we are in such a state, that we have no common Judge on Earth, whom I may appeal to, and to whom we are both obliged to submit: for of such I am now speaking. 'Tis the unjust use of force then that puts a Man into the state of War with another, and thereby he that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it makes a forfeiture of his Life. For quitting reason, which is the rule given between Man and Man, and using force the way of Beasts, he becomes liable to be destroy'd by him he uses force against, as any savage ravenous Beast, that is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his being.</p>

                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:96077:208"/>182. But because the miscarriages of the Father are no faults of the Children, and they may be rational and peaceable, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the brutishness and injustice of the Father; the Father, by his miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and violence, can forfeit but his own Life, but involves not his Childten in his guilt or destruction. His goods which nature, that willeth the preservation of all Mankind as much as is possible, hath made to belong to the Children to keep them from perishing, do still continue to belong to his Children. For supposing them not to have join'd in the War, either through infancy or choice, they have done nothing to forfeit them, nor has the Conquerour any right to take them away, by the bare right of having subdued him that by force attempted his destruction, though perhaps he may have some right to them to repair the dammages he has sustained by the War, and the defence of his own right, which how far it reaches to the possessions of the Conquer'd, we shall see by and by; so that he that by Conquest has a right over a Mans Person, to destroy him if he pleases, has not thereby a right over his Estate to possess and enjoy it. For it is the brutal force the Aggressor has used, that gives his Adversary a right to take away his Life, and destroy him, if he pleases,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96077:209"/>
as a noxious Creature; but 'tis damage sustain'd that alone gives him title to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans Goods: For though I may kill a Thief that sets on me in the Highway, yet I may not (which seems less) take away his money, and let him go; this would be Robbery on my side. His force, and the state of War he put himself in, made him forfeit his Life, but gave me no title to his Goods. The right then of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest extends only to the Lives of those who join'd in the War, but not to their Estates, but only in order to make repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the damages received, and the Charges of the War, and that too with reservation of the right of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Wife and Children.</p>
               <p n="183">183. Let the Conquerer have as much Justice on his side as could be suppos'd, he has no right to seize more than the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd could forfeit; his Life is at the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Mercy, and his service and goods he may appropriate to make himself repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he cannot take the goods of his Wife and Children, they too had a title to the goods he enjoy'd, and their shares in the estate he possessed. For Example, I in the state of nature (and all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are in the state of nature one with another) have injured another Man, and refusing to give satisfaction, it is come to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96077:209"/>
a state of War, wherein my defending by force, what I had gotten unjustly, makes me the Aggressour; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: my Life, 'tis true, as forfeit, is at mercy, but not my Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens. They made not the War, nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in it. I could not forfeit their Lives, they were not mine to forfeit. My Wife had a share in my Estate, that neither could I forfeit. And my Children also, being born of me, had a right to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd out of my Labour or Substance. Here then is the Case; The Conquerour has a Title to Reparation for Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges received, and the Children have a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to their Father's Estate for their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence. For as to the Wife's share, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her own Labour or Compact gave her a Title to it, 'tis plain, her Husband could not forfeit what was hers. What must be done in the case? I answer; The Fundamental Law of Nature being, that all, as much as may be, should be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it follows, that if there be not enough fully to satisfie both, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Losses, and Childrens Maintenance, he that hath, and to spare, must remit something of his full Satisfaction, and give way to the pressing and preferible Title of those, who are in danger to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish without it.</p>

                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:96077:210"/>184. But supposing the Charge and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the War are to be made up to the Conquerour, to the utmost Farthing, and that the Children of the vanquished, spoiled of all their Father's Goods, are to be left to starve, and perish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of what shall, on this score, be due to the Conquerour, will scarce give him a Title to any Countrey he shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. For the Damages of War can scarce amount to the value of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tract of Land, in any part of the World, where all the Land is possessed, and none lies waste. And if I have not taken away the Conquerour's Land, which, being vanquished, it is impossible, I should; scarce any other spoil I have done him can amount to the value of mine, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it of an extent any way coming near what I had over-run of his, and equally cultivated too. The destruction of a Years Product or two, (for it seldom reaches four or five) is the utmost spoil that usually can be done. For as to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and such Riches and Treasure taken away, these are none of Natures Goods, they have but a phantastical imaginary value, Nature has put no such upon them. They are of no more account by her standard, than the Wampompeke of the <hi>Americans</hi> to an <hi>European</hi> Prince, or the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:96077:210"/>
Silver Money of <hi>Europe</hi> would have been formerly to an <hi>American.</hi> And five years Product is not worth the perpetual Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Land, where all is possessed, and none remains waste, to be taken up by him that is disseiz'd: which will be easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if one do but take away the imaginary value of Money, the disproportion being more than between five, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. Though, at the same time, half a years product is more worth than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, where there being more Land than the Inhabitants possess and make use of, any one has liberty to make use of the waste: But there Conquerours take little care to possess themselves of the Lands of the vanquished. No damage therefore, that Men, in the state of Nature (as all Princes and Governments are in reference to one another) suffer from one another, can give a Conquerour Power to dispossess the Posterity of the vanquished, and turn them out of that Inheritance which ought to be the Possession of them, and their Descendants to all Generations. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour indeed will be apt to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master. And 'tis the very condition of the subdued not to be able to dispute their Right: But, if that be all, it gives no other Title, than what bare Force gives to the stronger over the weaker.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:96077:211"/>
And, by this reason, he that is strongest will have a right to whatever he pleases to seize on.</p>
               <p n="185">185. Over those then that joined with him in the War, and over those of the subdued Countrey that opposed him not, and the Posterity even of those that did, the Conquerour, even in a just War, hath, by his Conquest, no right of Dominion. They are free from any subjection to him, and if their former Government be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, they are at liberty to begin and erect another to themselves.</p>
               <p n="186">186. The Conquerour, 'tis true, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Force he has over them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them, with a Sword at their Breasts, to stoop to his Conditions, and submit to such a Government as he pleases to afford them; but the enquiry is, What right he has to do so? If it be said, they submit by their own consent; then this allows their own consent to be necessary to give the Conquerour a Title to rule over them. It remains only to be considered, whether Promises, extorted by Force, without Right, can be thought Consent, and how far they bind. To which I shall say, they bind not at all, because whatsoever another gets from me by force, I still retain the Right of, and he is obliged presently to restore. He that forces my Horse from
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:96077:211"/>
me, ought presently to restore him, and I have still a right to retake him. By the same reason, he that forced a Promise from me ought presently to restore it, <hi>i. e.</hi> quit me, of the Obligation of it; or I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it my self, <hi>i. e.</hi> chuse whether I will perform it. For the Law of Nature lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an obligation on me, only by the Rules she prescribes, cannot oblige me by the violation of her Rules: such is the extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing from me by force. Nor does it at all alter the case, to say I gave my Promise, no more than it excuses the force, and passes the right, when I put my hand in my Pocket, and deliver my Purse my self to a Thief, who demands it with a Pistol at my Breast.</p>
               <p n="187">187. From all which it follows, that the Government of a Conquerour, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, by force, on the subdued, against whom he had no right of War, or who joined not in the War against him, where he had right, has no obligation upon them.</p>
               <p n="188">188. But let us suppose that all the Men of that Community being all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same Body Politick, may be taken to have join'd in that unjust War, wherein they are subdued, and so their Lives are at the Mercy of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p n="189">
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:96077:212"/>189. I say, this concerns not their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are in their Minority. For since a Father hath not, in himself, a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Life or Liberty of his Child; no act of his can possibly forfeit it: so that the Children, whatever may have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Fathers, are Free men, and the Absolute Power of the Conquerour reaches no farther than the Persons of the Men, that were subdued by him, and dies with them; and should he govern them as Slaves, subjected to his Absolute, Arbitrary Power, he has no such Right of Dominion over their Children. He can have no Power over them, but by their own consent, whatever he may drive them to say or do; and he has no lawful Authority, whilst Force, and not Choice, compels them to submission.</p>
               <p n="190">190. Every Man is born with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Right, <hi>First,</hi> A Right of Freedom to his Person, which no other Man has a Power over, but the free Disposal of it lies in himself. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Right, before any other Man, to inherit, with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, his Father's Goods.</p>
               <p n="191">191. By the first of these, a Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally free from subjection to any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though he be born in a place under its Jurisdiction. But if he disclaim the lawful Government of the Countrey
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:96077:212"/>
he was born in, he must also quit the Right, that belong'd to him, by the Laws of it, and the Possessions there descending to him, from his Ancestors, if it were a Government made by their consent.</p>
               <p n="192">192. By the second, the Inhabitants of any Countrey, who are descended, and derive a Title to their Estates from those who are subdued, and had a Government forced upon them, against their free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, retain a Right to the Possession of their Ancestours, though they consent not freely to the Government, whose hard Conditions were, by force, imposed on the Possessors of that Countrey. For the first Conqueror never having had a Title to the Land of that Country, the People, who are the Descendants of, or claim under those, who were forced to submit to the Yoke of a Government by constraint, have always a Right to shake it off, and free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Usurpation, or Tyranny the Sword hath brought in upon them; till their Rulers put them under such a Frame of Government, as they willingly, and of choice consent to (which they can never be supposed to do, till either they are put in a full state of Liberty to chuse their Government and Governours, or at least till they have such standing Laws, to which they have, by themselves, or their
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:96077:213"/>
Representatives, given their free consent, and also till they are allowed their due Property, which is so to be Proprietors of what they have, that no body can take away any part of it without their own consent, without which, Men under any Government are not in the state of Free-men, but are direct Slaves, under the force of War.) And who doubts but the <hi>Grecian</hi> Christians, Descendants of the antient Possessors of that Countrey, may justly cast off the <hi>Turkish</hi> Yoke they have so long groaned under, when-ever they have a Power to do it?</p>
               <p n="193">193. But granting that the Conquerour, in a just War, has a Right to the Estates, as well as Power over the Persons of the Conquered; which, 'tis plain, he hath not: nothing of Absolute Power will follow from hence, in the continuance of the Government. Because the Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of these being all Free-men, if he grants them Estates, and Possessions to inhabit his Countrey, without which it would be worth nothing, whatsoever he grants them, they have so far as it is granted, Property in. The nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that, without a Man's own consent, it cannot be taken from him.</p>
               <p n="194">194. Their Persons are free, by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Right, and their Properties, be they
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:96077:213"/>
more or less, are their own, and at their own dispose, and not at his; or else it is no Property. Supposing the Conquerour gives to one Man a Thousand Acres, to him and his Heirs for ever; to another he lets a Thousand Acres, for his Life, under the Rent of 50<hi>l.</hi> or 500<hi>l. per An.</hi> Has not the one of these a Right to his Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Acres for ever, and the other, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life, paying the said Rent? And hath not the Tenant, for Life, a Property in all that he gets over and above his Rent, by his Labour and Industry, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the said term, supposing it be double the Rent? Can any one say, the King, or Conquerour, after his Grant, may, by his Power of Conquerour, take away all, or part of the Land, from the Heirs of one, or from the other, during his Life, he paying the Rent? Or can he take away, from either, the Goods or Money they have got upon the said Land, at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? If he can, then all free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Contracts cease, and are void, in the World; there needs nothing but Power enough to dissolve them at any time. And all the Grants and Promises of Men, in Power, are but Mockery and Collusion. For can there be any thing more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous than to say, I give you and yours this for ever, and that in the surest and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:96077:214"/>
most solemn way of conveyance can be devised: and yet it is to be understood, that I have Right, if I please, to take it away from you again to morrow?</p>
               <p n="195">195. I will not dispute now whether Princes are exempt from the Laws of their Countrey, but this I am sure, they owe subjection to the Laws of God, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. No Body, no Power can exempt them from the Obligations of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law. Those are so great, and so strong, in the case of Promises, that Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency it self can be tyed by them. Grants, Promises, and Oaths are Bonds that hold the Almighty: what-ever some Flatterres say to Princes of the World, who, all together, with all their People joined to them, are, in comparison of the great God, but as a Drop of the Bucket, or a Dust on the Balance, inconsiderable, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing!</p>
               <p n="196">196. The short of the Case, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, is this, The Conquerour, if he have a just Cause, has a Despotical Right over the Persons of all that actually aided, and concurred in the War against him, and a Right to make up his Damage and Cost, out of their Labour and Estates, so he injure not the Right of any other. Over the rest of the People, if there were any that consented not to the War, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:96077:214"/>
over the Children of the Captives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or the Possessions of either he has no Power, and so can have, by Virtue of Conquest, no lawful Title himself to Dominion over them, or derive it to his Posterity; but is an Aggressour, and puts himself in a state of War against them, and has no better a Right of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, he, nor any of his Successours, than <hi>Hingar,</hi> or <hi>Hubba,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> had here in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Spartacus,</hi> had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Italy</hi>; which is to have their Yoke cast off, as soon as God shall give those, under their subjection, Courage, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do it. Thus, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever Title the Kings of <hi>Assyria</hi> had over <hi>Iudah,</hi> by the Sword, God assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to throw off the Dominion of that conquering Empire. <hi>And the Lord was with Hezekiah, and he prospered; wherefore he went forth, and he rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not,</hi> 2 Kings XVIII. vij. Whence it is plain, that shaking off a Power, which Force, and not Right, hath set over any one, though it hath the Name of Rebellion; yet is no Offence before God, but that which he allows and countenances, though even Promises and Covenants, when ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by force, have intervened. For 'tis very probable, to any one that reads
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:96077:215"/>
the Story of <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that the <hi>Assyrians</hi> subdued <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and deposed him, and made <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King in his Father's life time; and that <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> by agreement, had done him Homage, and paid him Tribute till this time.</p>

AS Conquest may be called a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Usurpation; so Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a kind of domestick Conquest, with this difference, that an Usurper can never have Right on his side; it being no Usurpation but where one is got into the Possession of what another has Right to. This, so far as it is Usurpation, is a change only of Persons, but not of the Forms and Rules of the Government: for if the Usurper extend his Power beyond what, of Right, belonged to the lawful Princes, or Governours of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, 'tis Tyranny, added to Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

The Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy being much alike, to have no Form of Government at all, or to agree that it shall be Monarchical; but to appoint no way, to design the Person that shall have the Power, and be the Monarch. All Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths therefore, with the Form of Government established, have Rules also of appointing and conveying the Right to those, who are to have any share in the publick Authority. And who-ever gets into the exercise of any part of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by other ways, than what the Laws of the Community have prescribed, hath no Right to be obeyed, though the Form of the Commonwealth be still preserved; since he is not the Person the Laws have appointed, and consequently not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the People have consented to. Nor can such an Usurper, or any, deriving from him, ever have a Title, till the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are both at liberty to consent, and have actually consented to allow, and confirm in him the Power he hath, till then, Usurped.</p>

               <p n="199">199. AS Usurpation is the exercise of Power, which another hath a Right to; so Tyranny is the exercise of Power beyond Right, which no Body can have a Right to. And this is making use of the Power any one has in his hands; not for the good of those who are under it, but for his own private, separate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. When the Governour, however entituled, makes not the Law, but his Will, the Rule, and his Commands, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not directed to the preservation of the Properties of his People, but the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his own Ambition, Revenge, Covetousness, or any other irregular Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p n="200">200. If one can doubt this to be Truth, or Reason, because it comes from the obscure hand of a Subject; I hope the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a King will make it pass with him. King <hi>Iames,</hi> in his Speech to the Parliament, 1603. tells them thus; <hi>I will ever prefer the Weale of the publick, and of the whole Commonwealth, in making of good Laws, and Constitutions, to any particular, and private Ends of mine. Thinking ever the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:96077:216"/>
Wealth and Weale of the Commonwealth, to be my greatest Weale, and worldly Felicity; a Point, wherein a lawful King doth directly differ from a Tyrant. For I do acknowledge that the special and greatest point of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that is between a rightful King, and an usurping Tyrant, is this, That whereas the proud and ambitious Tyrant doth think, his Kingdom and People are only ordained for satisfaction of his Desires, and unreasonable Appetites; the righteous and just King doth, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, acknowledge himself to be ordained for the procuring of the wealth and Property of his People.</hi> And again, in his Speech to the Parliament, 1609 he hath these Words; <hi>The KING binds himself, by a double Oath, to the observation of the fundamental Laws of his Kingdom. Tacitly, as by being a King, and so bound to protect, as well the People, as the Laws of his Kingdom; and expresly by his Oath at his Coronation: so as every just King, in a setled Kingdom, is bound to observe that Paction made to his People, by his Laws, in framing his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agreeable thereunto, according to that Paction which God made with</hi> Noah, <hi>after the Deluge. Hereafter, Seed-time, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and Cold, and Heat, and Summer, and Winter, and Day, and Night, shall not cease, while the Earth remaineth. And therefore a King, governing in a setled Kingdom, leaves
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:96077:217"/>
to be a King, and degenerates into a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as soon as he leaves off to rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Laws.</hi> And a little after: <hi>Therefore all Kings, that are not Tyrants, or perjured, will be glad to bound themselves within the Limits of their Laws. And they that perswade them the contrary, are Vipers, Pests both against them and the Commonwealth.</hi> Thus that learned King, who well understood the Notions of things, makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betwixt a King and a Tyrant, to consist only in this, That one makes the Laws the Bounds of his Power, and the Good of the publick the End of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; The other makes all give way to his own Will and Appetite.</p>
               <p n="201">201. 'Tis a Mistake, to think this Fault is proper only to Monarchies, other Forms of Government are liable to it, as well as that: for where-ever the Power, that is put in any hands, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People, and the Preservation of their Properties, is applied to other ends, and made use of to impoverish, harass, or subdue them to the Arbitrary, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Commands of those that have it: There it presently becomes Tyranny, whether those, that thus use it, are one, or many. Thus we read of the Thirty Tyrants at <hi>Athens,</hi> as well as one at <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuse</hi>; and the intolerable Dominion of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:96077:217"/>

               <p n="202">202. Where-ever Law ends, Tyranny begins, if the Law be transgressed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's harm. And whosoever, in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, exceeds the Power given him by the Law, and makes use of the Force, he has under his Command, to compass that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject which the Law allows not; ceases, in that, to be a Magistrate, and acting without Authority, may be opposed, as any other Man, who by force invades the Right of another. This is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in subordinate Magistrates. He that hath Authority to seize my Person in the street, may be opposed as a Thief, and a Robber, if he indeavours to break into my House to execute a Writ, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that I know he has such a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and such a legal Authority as will impower him to arrest me abroad. And why this should not hold in the highest, as well as in the most inferiour Magistrate, I would gladly be informed. Is it reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the eldest Brother, because he has the greatest part of his Father's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, should thereby have a Right to take away any of his younger Brothers Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Or that a rich Man, who possessed a whole Countrey, should from thence have a Right to seize, when he pleased,

the Cottage and Garden of his poor Neighbour? The being rightfully pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of great Power and Riches, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly beyond the greatest part of the Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> is so far from being an excuse, much less a reason for Rapine and Oppression, which the endamaging another, without Authority, is; that it is a great Aggravation of it. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Bounds of Authority, is no more a Right, in a great, than a petty Officer: no more justifiable in a King, than a Constable. But so much the worse in him, as that he has more trust put in him, is supposed, from the advantage of Education, and Counsellours to have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knowledge, and less reason to do it, having already a greater share than the rest of his Brethren.</p>

                  </gap>s, and, instead of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Order, leave nothing but Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and Confusion.</p>
               <p n="204">204. To this I answer: That Force is to be opposed to nothing but to unjust and unlawful Force; who ever makes any opposition, in any other Case, draws on
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:96077:218"/>
himself a just Condemation, both from God and Man; and so no such Danger or Confusion will follow, as is often sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested. For,</p>
               <p n="205">205. <hi>First,</hi> As, in some Countries, the Person of the Prince, by the Law, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and so, what-ever he commands, or does, his Person is still free from all Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Violence; not liable to Force, or any judicial Censure or Condemnation. But yet opposition may be made to the illegal Acts of any inferiour Officer, or other commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by him; unless he will, by actually putting himself into a State of War with his People, dissolve the Government, and leave them to that defence, which belongs to every one in the state of Nature. For of such things who can tell what the end will be? And a Neighbour Kingdom has shewed the World an odd Example. In all other Cases the Sacredness of the Person exempts him from all Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, whereby he is secure, whilst the Government stands, from all violence and harm whatsoever. Than which, there cannot be a wiser Constitution. For the harm he can do, in his own Person, not being likely to happen often, nor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it self far; nor being able, by his single strength, to subvert the Laws, nor oppress the Body of the People, should
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:96077:219"/>
any Prince have so much Weakness, and ill Nature as to be willing to do it. The Inconveniency of some particular mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that may happen, sometimes, when a heady Prince comes to the Throne, are well recompenced by the peace of the Publick, and security of the Government, in the Person of the chief Magistrate, thus set out of the reach of danger. It being safer for the Body, that some few private Men should be sometimes in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to suffer, than that the Head of the Republick should be easily, and upon slight occasions exposed.</p>
               <p n="206">206. <hi>Secondly,</hi> But this Priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing only to the King's Person, hinders not but they may be questioned, opposed, and resisted, who use unjust force, though they pretend a Commission from him, which the Law authorizes not. As is plain, in the Case of him that has the King's Writ to arrest a Man, which is a full Commission from the King; and yet he that has it cannot break open a Man's House to do it, nor execute this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the King upon certain days, nor in certain places, though this Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have no such exception in it; but they are the Limitations of the Law, which, if any one transgress, the King's Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion excuses him not. For the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:96077:219"/>
being given him only by the Law, he cannot impower any one to act against the Law, or justifie him, by his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in so doing. The Commission, or Command of any Magistrate, where he has no Authority, being as void and insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant as that of any private Man. The difference, between the one and the other, being, that the Magistrate has some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, so far, and to such ends, and the private Man has none at all. For 'tis not the Commission, but the Authority, that gives the Right of acting; and against the Laws there can be no Authority. But, notwithstanding such Resistance, the King's Person and Authority are still both secured, and so no danger to Governour or Government.</p>
               <p n="207">207. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Supposing a Government, wherein the Person of the chief Magistrate is not thus Sacred; yet this Doctrine, of the lawfulness of resisting all unlawful exercises of his Power, will not, upon every slight occasion, indanger him, or imbroil the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For, where the injured Party may be relieved, and his damages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, by Appeal to the Law, there can be no pretence for Force; which is only to be used, where a Man is intercepted from appealing to the Law. For nothing is to be accounted Hostile Force, but
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:96077:220"/>
where it leaves not the remedy of such an Appeal. And 'tis such Force alone, that puts him that uses it, into a state of War, and makes it lawful to resist him. A Man, with a Sword in his hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my Purse, in the High-way, when, perhaps, I have not 12<hi>d.</hi> in my Pocket; This Man I may lawfully kill. To ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I deliver 100<hi>l.</hi> to hold, only whilst I alight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hich he refuses to restore me when I am got up again, but draws his Sword to defend the possession of it, by force: I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to retake it. The mischief, this Man does me, is a hundred, or possibly a thousand times more than the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps intended me, (whom I kill'd, before he really did me any) and yet I might lawfully kill the one, and cannot so much as hurt the other lawfully. The Reason whereof is plain; because the one using force, which threatned my Life, I could not have time to appeal to the Law to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it: And when it was gone, 'twas too late to appeal. The Law could not restore Life to my dead Carcass. The Loss was irreparable; which, to prevent, the Law of Nature gave me a Right to destroy him, who had put himself into a state of War with me, and threatned my destruction. But, in the other case, my Life not being in danger, I might have
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:96077:220"/>
the benefit of appealing to the Law, and have Reparation, for my 100<hi>l.</hi> that way.</p>
               <p n="208">208. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But if the unlawful acts, done by the Magistrate, be maintained, (by the Power he has got) and the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is due by Law, be, by the same Power, obstructed; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Right of resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even in such manifest Acts of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, will not suddenly, or on slight occasions, disturb the Government. For if it reach no farther than some private Mens Cases, though they have a right to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to recover, by force, what, by unlawful force, is taken from them; yet the Right to do so, will not easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in a Contest, wherein they are sure to perish: It being as impossible, for one or a few oppressed Men, to disturb the Government, where the Body of the People do not think themselves concerned in it, as for a raving mad Man, or heady Male content to overturn a well setled State; the People being as little apt to follow the one, as the other.</p>
               <p n="209">209. But if either these illegal Acts, have extended to the Majority of the People; or if the Mischief and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has light only on some few, but in such Cases as the Precedent and Consequences seem to threaten all; and they are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:96077:221"/>
in their Consciences that their Laws, and with them, their Estates, Liberties, and Lives are in danger, and perhaps their Religion too; how they will be hindred from resisting illegal Force, used against them, I cannot tell. This is an Inconvenience, I confess, that attends all Governments whatsoever, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours have brought it to this pass, to be generally suspected of their People, the most dangerous state they can possibly put themselves in; wherein they are the less to be pityed, because it is so easie to be avoided. It being as impossible, for a Governour, if he really means the good of his People, and the preservation of them, and their Laws together, not to make them see and feel it; as it is for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Family not to let his Children see he loves, and takes care of them.</p>
               <p n="210">210. But if all the World shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Pretences of one kind, and Actions of another; Arts used to elude the Law, and the Trust of Prerogative (which is an Arbitrary Power in some things, left in the Prince's hand, to do good, not harm, to the People) employed contrary to the end, for which it was given, If the People shall find the Ministers, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Magistrates chosen, suitable to such ends, and favoured, or laid by proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:96077:221"/>
as they promote, or oppose them: If they see several Experiments made of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, and that Religion under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand favoured, though publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed against, which is readiest to introduce it, and the Operators in it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as much as may be; and when that cannot be done, yet approved still, and liked the better, and a long Train of Actings shew the Councils all tending that way: how can a Man any more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himself from being perswaded in his own Mind, which way things are going; or from casting about how to save himself, than he could from believing the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Ship he was in, was carrying him, and the rest of the Company, to <hi>Algiers,</hi> when he found him always stear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Course, though cross Winds, Leaks in his Ship, and want of Men, and Provisions, did often force him to turn his Course another way, for some time, which he steadily returned to again, as soon as the Wind, Weather, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances would let him?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Dissolution of Governments.</head>
               <p n="211">211. HE that will, with any clearness, speak of the Dissolution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ought, in the first place, to distinguish between the Dissolution of the Society, and the Dissolution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. That which makes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and brings Men out of the loose State of Nature, into one Politick Society, is the Agreement, which every one has, with the rest, to incorporate and act as one Body, and so be one distinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The usual, and almost only way, whereby this Union is dissolved, is the Inroad of foreign Force making a Conquest upon them. For in that Case, (not being able to maintain and support themselves, as one intire, and independent Body) the Union belonging to that Body, which consisted therein, must necessarily cease, and so every one return to the state he was in before, with a liberty to shift for himself, and provide for his own Safety, as he thinks fit, in some other Society. Whenever the Society is dissolved, 'tis certain, the Government of that Society cannot remain. Thus Conquerors Swords
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:96077:222"/>
often cut up Governments by the Roots, and mangle Societies to pieces, separating the subdued or scattered multitude from the Protection of, and Dependence on that Society which ought to have preserved them from violence. The World is too well instructed in, and too forward to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of this way of dissolving of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to need any more to be said of it; and there wants not much Argument to prove, that where the Society is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, the Government cannot remain: that being as impossible, as for the Frame of an house to subsist when the Materials of it are scattered and displaced by a Whirl-wind, or jumbled into a confused heap by an Earthquake.</p>
               <p n="212">212. Besides this over-turning, from without, Governments are dissolved from within,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When the Legislative is altered, Civil Society being a state of Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those who are of it, from whom the state of War is excluded by the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage, which they have provided in their Legislative, for the ending all differences, that may arise amongst any of them. 'Tis in their Legislative, that the Members of a Commonwealth are united and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together into one coherent, living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This is the Soul that gives Form,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:96077:223"/>
Life, and Unity to the Commonwealth: from hence the several Members have their mutual Influence, Sympathy, and Connexion: and therefore, when the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative is broken, or dissolved, Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Death follows. For the Essence, and Union of the Society consisting in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one Will, the Legislative, when once established by the Majority, has the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, and, as it were, keeping of that Will. The Constitution of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is the first and fundamental Act of Society, whereby provision is made for the Continuation of their Union, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Direction of Persons, and Bonds of Laws, made by Persons authorized thereunto, by the Consent and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People, without which no one Man, or number of Men, amongst them, can have Authority of making Laws that shall be binding to the rest. When any one, or more, shall take upon them to make Laws, whom the People have not appointed so to do, they make Laws without Authority, which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not therefore bound to obey; by which means they come again to be out of subjection, and may constitute to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a new Legislative, as they think best, being in full liberty to resist the force of those, who, without Authority, would
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:96077:223"/>
impose any thing upon them. Every one is at the disposure of his own Will, when those, who had, by the delegation of the Society, the declaring of the publick Will, are excluded from it, and others usurp the place, who have no such Authority or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation.</p>
               <p n="213">213. This being usually brought about by such, in the Commonwealth, who mis-use the Power they have: It is hard to consider it aright, and know at whose door to lay it, without knowing the Form of Government in which it happens. Let us suppose then the Legislative placed in the Concurrence of three distinct Persons. <hi>First,</hi> A single, hereditary Person having the constant, supream, executive Power, and, with it, the Power of convoking, and dissolving the other two, within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Periods of Time. <hi>Secondly,</hi> An As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semby of hereditary Nobility. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Assembly of Representatives chosen, <hi>pro tempore,</hi> by the People: Such a Form of Government supposed, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</p>
               <p n="214">214. <hi>First,</hi> That when such a single Person, or Prince sets up his own Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Will, in place of the Laws, which are the Will of the Society, declared by the Legislative, then the Legislative is changed. For that being, in effect, the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:96077:224"/>
Legislative whose Rules and Laws are put in execution, and required to be obeyed, when other Laws are set up, and other Rules pretended and inforced, than what the Legislative, constituted by the Society, have enacted, 'tis plain that the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is changed. Who-ever introduces new Laws, not being thereunto authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, by the fundamental Appointment of the Society, or subverts the old, disowns and overturns the Power, by which they were made, and so sets up a new Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative.</p>
               <p n="215">215. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Prince hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Legislative from assembling in its due time, or from acting freely, pursuant to those ends for which it was constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Legislative is altered. For 'tis not a certain number of Men, no, nor their meeting, unless they have also Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of debating, and Leisure of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is for the good of the Society, wherein the Legislative consists, when these are taken away, or altered, so as to deprive the Society, of the due exercise of their Power, the Legislative is truly altered. For it is not Names that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Governments, but the use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of those Powers that were intended to accompany them: so that he who takes away the Freedom, or hinders the acting
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:96077:224"/>
of the Legislative in its due seasons, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect takes away the Legislative, and puts an end to the Government.</p>
               <p n="216">216. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When, by the Arbitrary Power of the Prince, the Electours, or ways of Election are altered, without the Consent, and contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest of the People, there also the Legislative is altered. For if others, then those whom the Society hath authorized thereunto, do chuse, or in another way than what the Society hath prescribed, those chosen are not the Legislative ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the People.</p>
               <p n="217">217. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The delivery also of the People into the subjection of a foreign Power, either by the Prince, or by the Legislative, is certainly a change of the Legislative, and so a Dissolution of the Government. For the end, why People entered into Society, being to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one intire, free, independent Society, to be governed by its own Laws; this is lost when-ever they are given up into the Power of another.</p>
               <p n="218">218. Why, in such a Constitution as this, the Dissolution of the Government, in these Cases, is to be imputed to the Prince, is evident, because he having the Force, Treasure, and Offices of the State, to imploy, and often perswading himself,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:96077:225"/>
or being flattered by others, that as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate, he is uncapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; he alone is in a Condition to make great Advances toward such Changes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of lawful Authority, and has it in his hands to terrifie, or suppress Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, as factious, seditious, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Government: whereas no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Legislative, or People, is capable, by themselves, to attempt any alteration of the Legislative, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and visible Rebellion, apt enough to be taken notice of; which, when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, produces Effects very little different from foreign Conquest. Besides the Prince, in such a Form of Government, having the Power of dissolving the other Parts of the Legislative, and thereby rendring them private Persons, they can never, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to him, or without his Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, alter the Legislative by a Law; his Consent being necessary to give any of their Decrees that Sanction. But yet so far as the other parts of the Legislative any way contribute to any attempt upon the Government, and do either promote, or not, what lies in them, hinder such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, they are guilty, and partake in this, which is certainly the greatest Crime Men can be guilty of one towards another.</p>
               <p n="219">
                  <pb n="439" facs="tcp:96077:225"/>219. There is one way more, whereby such a Government may be dissolved, and that is; When he, who has the supreme, executive Power, neglects, and abandons that charge, so that the Laws, already made, can no longer be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is demonstratively to reduce all to Anarchy, and so effectually to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Government. For Laws not being made for themselves, but to be, by their execution, the Bonds of the Society, to keep every part of the Body Politick in its due place, and function. When that totally ceases, the Government visibly ceases, and the People become a confused Multitude, without Order or Connexion. Where there is no longer the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice, for the securing of Mens Rights; nor any remaining Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Community to direct the Force, or provide for the Necessities of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; there certainly is no Government left. Where the Laws cannot be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it is all one as if there were no Laws; and a Government without Laws, is, I suppose, a Mystery in Politicks, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable to humane Capacity, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with humane Society.</p>
               <p n="220">220. In these, and the like Cases, when the Government is dissolved, the People are at liberty to provide for themselves,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:96077:226"/>
by erecting a new Legislative, differing from the other, by the change of Persons, or Form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety and good. For the Society can never, by the fault of another, lose the native and original Right it has to preserve it self; which can only be done by a setled Legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the Laws made by it. But the state of Mankind is not so miserable, that they are not capable of using this Remedy, till it be too late to look for any. To tell People they may provide for themselves, by erecting a new Legislative; when, by Oppression, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, or being delivered over to a foreign Power, their old one is gone, is only to tell them, they may expect Relief, when it is too late, and the evil is past Cure. This is, in Effect, no more, than to bid them, first be Slaves, and then to take care of their Liberty; and, when their Chains are on, tell them, they may act like Free-men. This, if barely so, is rather Mockery than Relief, and Men can never be secure from Tyranny, if there be no means to escape it, till they are perfectly under it: And therefore it is, that they have not only a Right to get out of it, but to prevent it.</p>
               <p n="221">
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:96077:226"/>221. There is therefore Secondly another way, whereby Governments are dissolved; and that is, when the Legislative, or the Prince, either of them act contrary to their Trust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Legislative acts against the Trust reposed in them, when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to invade the Property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and to make themselves, or any part of the Community, Masters, or Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Disposers of the Lives, Liberties, or Fortunes of the People.</p>
               <p n="222">222. The Reasons why Men enter into Society, is the preservation of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and the end why they chuse, and authorize a Legislative, is, that there may be Laws made, and Rules set, as Guards and Fences to the Properties of all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to limit the Power, and moderate the Dominion of every Part and Member of the Society. For since it can never be supposed to be the Will of the Society, that the Legislative should have a Power to destroy that which every one designs to secure, by entering into Society, and for which the People submitted themselves to Legislators of their own making; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Legislators endeavour to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and destroy the Poperty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or to reduce them to Slavery, under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:96077:227"/>
a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore the Legislative shall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, endeavour to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power, over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People: by this breach of Trust they forfeit the Power, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who have a Right to resume their original Liberty, and, by the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new Legislative (such as they shall think fit) provide for their own Safety and Security, which is the end for which they are in Society. What I have said here, concerning the Legislative, in general, holds true also concerning the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Executor, who having a double Trust put in him, both to have a part in the Legislative; and the supreme Execution of the Law, acts against both, when he goes about to set up his own Arbitrary Will, as the Law of the Society. He acts also contrary to his Trust, when he imploys the Force, Treasure, and Offices of the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:96077:227"/>
Society, to corrupt the Representatives, and gain them to his purposes: when he openly pre-ingages the Electors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, to their choice, such, whom he has, by Sollicitation, Threats, Promises, or othewise, won to his designs; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them to bring in such, who have promised before-hand what to vote, and what to enact. Thus to regulate Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates and Electors, and new model the ways of Election, what is it, but to cut up the Government by the Roots, and poison the very Fountain of publick Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? For the People having reserved to themselves the Choice of their Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, as the Fence to their Properties, could do it for no other end, but that they might always be freely chosen, and so chosen, freely act and advise, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Commonwealth, and the publick Good should, upon examination, and mature debate, be judged to require. This, those who give their Votes before they hear the Debate, and have weighed the Reasons on all sides, are not capable of doing. To prepare such an Assembly as this, and endeavour to set up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Abettors of his own Will, for the true Representatives of the People, and the Law-makers of the Society, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as great a breach of trust, and as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:96077:228"/>
a Declaration of a design to subvert the Government, as is possible to be met with. To which, if one shall add re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments visibly imploy'd to the same end, and all the arts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Law made use of to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design, and will not comply and consent to betray the Liberties of their Country, 'twill be past doubt what is doing. What Power they ought to have in the Society who thus imploy it contrary to the trust went along with it in its first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, is easy to determine; and one cannot but see, that he who has once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any such thing as this, cannot any longer be trusted.</p>
               <p n="223">223. To this perhaps it will be said, that the People being ignorant and always discontented; to lay the Foundation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the unsteady opinion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain humour of the People, is to expose it to certain ruin: and no Government will be able long to subsist, if the People may set up a new Legislative whenever they take offence at the old one. To this I Answer quite the contrary. People are not so easily got out of their old Forms as some are apt to suggest. They are hardly to be prevailed with to amend the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Faults in the Frame they have been
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:96077:228"/>
accustom'd to. And if there be any origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal defects, or adventitious ones introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by time or corruption; 'tis not an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy thing to get them changed, even when all the World sees there is an opportunity for it. This slowness and aversion in the People to quit their old Constitutions, has in the many Revolutions have been seen in this Kingdom, in this and former Ages, still kept us to, or aftersome interval of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less attempts, still brought us back again to our old Legislative of King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: and whatever provocations have made the Crown be taken from some of our Princes Heads, they never carried the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so far as to place it in another Line.</p>
               <p n="224">224. But 'twill be said, this Hypothesis lays a ferment for frequent Rebellion. To which I Answer,</p>
               <p>First, No more than any other Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis. For when the People are made miserable, and find themselves exposed to the ill usage of Arbitrary Power; cry up their Governours as much as you will for Sons of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> let them be Sacred and Divine, descended or authoriz'd from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; give them out for whom or what you please, the same will happen. The People generally ill treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:96077:229"/>
heavy upon them. They will wish and seek for the opportunity, which in the change, weakness and accidents of human affairs seldom delays long to offer it self. He must have lived but a little while in the World, who has not seen Examples of this in his time; and he must have read very little, who cannot produce Examples of it in all sorts of Governments in the World.</p>
               <p n="225">225. Secondly, I Answer, such Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions happen not upon every little mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management in publick affairs. Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and inconvenient Laws, and all the slips of human frailty will be born by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without mutiny or murmur. But if a long train of Abuses, Prevarications and Artifices, all tending the same way, make the design visible to the People, and they cannot but feel what they lye under, and see whither they are going; 'tis not to be wonder'd that they should then rouze themselves, and endeavour to put the rule into such hands which may secure to them the ends for which Government was at first erected; and without which, ancient Names and specious Forms, are so far from being better, that they are much worse than the state of Nature, or pure Anarchy; the inconveniencies being all
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96077:229"/>
as great and as near, but the remedy far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off and more difficult.</p>
               <p n="226">226. Thirdly, I Answer, that this Power in the People of providing for their safety anew, by a new Legislative, when their Legislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their Property, is the best fence against Rebellion, and the probablest means to hinder it. For Rebellion being an Opposition, not to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons but Authority, which is founded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Constitutions and Laws of the Government; those, whoever they be, who by force break through, and by force j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stify their violation of them, are truly and properly Rebels. For when Men by entering into Society and civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have excluded force, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Laws for the preservation of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Peace and Unity amongst themselves; those who set up force again in opposition to the Laws, do <hi>rebellare,</hi> that is, bring back again the state of War, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Rebels: which they who are in Power, by the pretence they have to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the temptation of force they have in their hands, and the Flattery of those about them being likeliest to do; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest way to prevent the evil, is to shew them the danger and injustice of it, who are under the greatest temptation to run into it.</p>
               <p n="227">
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:96077:230"/>227. In both the forementioned Cases, when either the Legislative is changed, or the Legislators act contrary to the end for which they were constituted; those who are guilty are guilty of Rebellion. For if any one by force takes away the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Legislative of any Society, and the Laws by them made, pursuant to their trust, he thereby takes away the Umpirage which every one had consented to, for a peaceable decision of all their Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and a bar to the state of War amongst them. They who remove, or change the Legislative, take away this decisive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which no Body can have but by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and consent of the People; and so destroying the Authority which the People did, and no Body else can set up, and introducing a Power which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath not authoriz'd; actually intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a state of War, which is, that of Force without Authority: and thus by removing the Legislative establish'd by the Society, in whose decisions the People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesced and united, as to that of their own will; they unty the Knot, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the People anew to the state of War. And if those, who by force take away the Legislative, are Rebels, the Legislators themselves, as has been shewn, can be no less esteemed so; when they who were
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:96077:230"/>
set up for the protection and preservation of the People, their Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, shall by force invade and indeavour to take them away; and so they, putting themselves into a state of War with those who made them the Protectors and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of their Peace, are properly, and with the greatest aggravation, <hi>Rebellantes</hi> Rebels.</p>
               <p n="228">228. But if they who say it lays a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Rebellion, mean that it may occasion civil Wars, or intestine Broils, to tell the People they are absolved from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, when illegal attempts are made upon their Liberties or Properties, and may oppose the unlawful violence of those who were their Magistrates when they invade their Properties, contrary to the trust put in them; and that therefore this Doctrine is not to be allow'd, being so destructive to the Peace of the World. They may as well say upon the same ground, that honest Men may not oppose Robbers or Pirars, because this may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion disorder or bloodshed. If any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief come in such Cases, it is not to be charged upon him who defends his own right, but on him that invades his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. If the innocent honest Man, must quietly quit all he has for Peace sake, to him who will lay violent hands upon it,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:96077:231"/>
I desire it may be consider'd, what a kind of Peace there will be in the World, which consists only in Violence and Rapine; and which is to be maintain'd only for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Robbers and Oppressors. Who would not think it an admirable Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Mighty and the Mean, when the Lamb, without resistance, yielded his Throat to be torn by the imperious Wolf? <hi>Polyphemus</hi>'s Den gives us a perfect Pattern of such a Peace. Such a Government wherein <hi>Vlysses</hi> and his Companions had nothing to do, but quietly to suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be devour'd. And no doubt, <hi>Vlysses,</hi> who was a prudent Man, preach'd up Passive Obedience, and exhorted them to a quiet Submission, by representing to them of what concernment Peace was to Mankind; and by shewing the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies might happen, if they should of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to resist <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> who had now the Power over them.</p>
               <p n="229">229. The end of Government is the good of Mankind, and which is best for Mankind, that the People should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expos'd to the boundless will of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or that the Rulers should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times liable to be oppos'd, when they grow exorbitant in the use of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and imploy it for the destruction, and not the preservation of the Properties of their People?</p>
               <p n="230">
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:96077:231"/>230. Nor let any one say, that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief can arise from hence, as often as it shall please a busy head or turbulent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to desire the alteration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis true, such Men may stir whenever they please, but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition. For till the mischief be grown general, and the ill designs of the Rulers become visible, or their attempts sensible to the greater part, the People, who are more disposed to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, than right themselves by Resistance, are not apt to stir. The examples of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Injustice, or Oppression of here and there an unfortunate Man, moves them not. But if they universally have a perswasion grounded upon manifest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that designs are carrying on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Liberties, and the general course and tendency of things cannot but give them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their Governours, who is to be blamed for it? Who can help it, if they, who might avoid it, bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into this suspicion? Are the People to be blamed, if they have the sence of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures, and can think of things no otherwise than as they find and feel them? And is it not rather their fault who put things in such a posture that they would not have them thought as they
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:96077:232"/>
are? I grant, that the Pride, Ambition, and Turbulency of private Men have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times caused great Disorders in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and Factions have been fatal to States and Kingdoms. But whether the mischief hath oftner began in the Peoples Wantonness, and a Desire to cast off the lawful Authority of their Rulers; or in the Rulers Insolence, and Endeavours to get, and exercise an Arbitrary Power over their People; whether Oppression, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience gave the first rise to the Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I leave it to impartial History to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. This I am sure, who-ever, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ruler or Subject, by force goes about to invade the Rights of either Prince or People, and lays the foundation for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the Constitution and Frame of any Just Government; he is guilty of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Crime, I think, a Man is capable of, being to answer for all those mischiefs, of Blood, Rapine, and Desolation, which the breaking to pieces of Governments bring on a Countrey. And he, who does it, is justly to be esteemed the common Enemy and Pest of Mankind; and is to be treated accordingly.</p>
               <p n="231">231. That Subjects or Foreigners at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting by force, on the Properties of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, may be resisted with force, is agreed on all hands. But that Magistrates,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:96077:232"/>
doing the same thing, may be resisted, hath of late been denied: As if those who had the greatest Priviledges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by the Law, had thereby a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to break those Laws, by which alone they were set in a better place than their Brethren: whereas their Offence is thereby the greater, both as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for the greater share they have by the Law, and breaking also that Trust which is put into their hands by their Brethren.</p>
               <p n="232">232. Whosoever uses force without Right, as every one does in Society, who does it without Law; puts himself into a state of War with those, against whom he so uses it, and in that state all former Ties are cancelled, all other Rights cease, and every one has a Right to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to resist the Aggressour. This is so evident, that <hi>Barclay</hi> himself, that great Assertor of the Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Kings, is forced to confess, That it is lawful for the People, in some Cases, to resist their King; and that too in a Chapter, wherein he pretends to shew that the Divine Law shuts up the People from all manner of Rebellion. Whereby it is evident, even by his own Doctrine, that, since they may, in some Cases, resist, all resisting of Princes is not Rebellion.

                  </bibl> In English thus:</p>
               <p n="233">233. <q>But if any one should ask, Must the People then always lay themselves open to the Cruelty and Rage of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny? Must they see their Cities pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and laid in ashes, their Wives and Children exposed to the Tyrant's Lust, and Fury, and themselves and Families reduced, by their King, to Ruine, and all the Miseries of Want and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet sit still? Must Men alone be debarred the common Priviledge of opposing force with force, which Nature allows so freely to all other Creatures, for their preservation from Injury? I answer: Self-defence is a part of the Law of Nature; nor can it be denied the Community, even against the King himself: but to revenge themselves upon him, must by no means, be allowed them; it being not agreeable to that Law. Wherefore if the King shall shew
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:96077:234"/>
an hatred, not only to some particular Persons, but sets himself against the Body of the Commonwealth, whereof he is the Head, and shall, with intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ill usage, cruelly tyrannize over the whole, or a considerable part of the People; in this case, the People have a right to resist and defend themselves from Injury: but it must be with this Caution, that they only defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but do not attack their Prince: They may repair the Damages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but must not, for any provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, exceed the bounds of due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Respect. They may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse the present attempt, but must not revenge past violences. For it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for us to defend Life and Limb, but that an Inferiour should punish a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is against Nature. The mischief which is designed them, the People may prevent before it be done, but when it is done, they must not revenge it on the King, though Author of the Villany. This therefore is the Priviledge of the People in general, above what any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Person hath; That particular Men are allowed, by our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (<hi>Buchanan</hi> only excepted) to have no other Remedy but Patience; but the Body of the People may, with Respect,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96077:234"/>
resist intolerable Tyranny; for when it is but moderate, they ought to endure it.</q>

               <p n="235">235. 'Tis true, he has annexed two Limitations to it, to no purpose;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He says, it must be with Reverence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It must be without Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Punishment; and the Reason he gives, is, <hi>Because an Inferiour cannot punish a Superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> How to resist Force without striking again, or how to strike with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, will need some Skill to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. He that shall oppose an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault only with a Shield to receive the Blows, or in any more respectful Posture, without a Sword in his hand, to abate the Confidence and Force of the Assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, will quickly be at an end of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and will find such a defence serve only to draw on himself the worse usage. This is as ridiculous a way of resisting, as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> thought it of fighting; <hi>ubi tu pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas, ego vapulo tantum.</hi> And the Success of the Combat, will be unavoidably the same he there describes it:
<q>
                     <l>— Libertas pauperis haec est:</l>
                     <l>Pulsatus rogat, &amp; pugnis concisus, adorat,</l>
                     <l>Vt liceat paucis cum dentibus inde reverti.</l>

                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:96077:235"/>
This will always be the event of such an imaginary Resistance, where Men may not strike again. He therefore who may resist, must be allowed to strike. And then let our Author, or any Body else, join a Knock on the Head, or a Cut on the Face, with as much Reverence, and Respect as he thinks fit. He that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Blows and Reverence, may, for ought I know, deserve for his pains, a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Respectful Cudgelling, where-ever he can meet with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his Second, <hi>An Inferiour cannot punish a Superiour</hi>; that's true, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally speaking, whilst he is his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But to resist Force with Force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of War, that levells the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, cancels all former relation of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Respect, and Superiority: and then the odds, that remains, is, That he, who opposes the unjust Aggressour, has this Superiority over him, that he has a Right, when he prevails, to punish the Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, both for the Breach of the Peace, and all the Evils that followed upon it. <hi>Barclay</hi> therefore, in another place, more coherently to himself, denies it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to resist a King in any Case.

               <p n="237">237. <q>What then, Can there no Case happen wherein the people may of right, and by their own Authority, help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, take Arms, and set upon their King, imperiously domineering over them? None at all, whilst he remains a King. <hi>Honour the King,</hi> and <hi>he that resists the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:96077:236"/>
Power, resists the Ordinance of God</hi>; are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles that will never permit it. The People therefore can never come by a Power over him, unless he does some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that makes him cease to be a King. For then he divests himself of his Crown and Dignity, and returns to the state of a private Man, and the People become free and superiour; the Power which they had in the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> before they Crown'd him King, devolving to them again. But there are but few miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which bring the matter to this state. After considering it well on all sides, I can find but two. Two Cases there are, I say, whereby a King, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes no King, and loses all Power and Regal Authority over his People; which are also taken notice of by <hi>Winze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> The first is, if he indeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Government, that is, if he have a purpose and design to ruin the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Commonwealth, as it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Nero,</hi> that he resolved to cut off the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> lay the City wast with Fire and Sword, and then remove to some other place. And of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> that he openly declar'd, that he would be no longer a head to the People or Senate, and that he had it in his thoughts to cut off the worthiest Men of
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:96077:237"/>
both Ranks, and then retire to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>: and he wisht that the People had but one Neck, that he might dispatch them all at a blow. Such designs as these, when any King harbours in his thoughts, and seriously promotes, he immediately gives up all care and thought of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and consequently forfeits the Power of Governing his Subjects, as a Master does the dominion over his Slaves whom he hath abandon'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="238">238. <q>The other Case is, When a King makes himself the dependent of another, and subjects his Kingdom which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors left him, and the People put free into his hands, to the Dominion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For however perhaps it may not be his intention to prejudice the People; yet because he has hereby lost the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of Regal Dignity, <hi>viz.</hi> to be next and immediately under God, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream in his Kingdom; and also because he betray'd or forced his People, whose liberty he ought to have carefully preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, into the Power and Dominion of a Foreign Nation. By this as it were alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Kingdom, he himself loses the Power he had in it before, without transferring any the least right to those on whom he would have bestowed it; and so by this act sets the People free,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:96077:237"/>
and leaves them at their own disposal. One Example of this is to be found in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Annals.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="239">239. In these Cases <hi>Barclay,</hi> the great Champion of Absolute Monarchy, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to allow, That a King may be resisted, and ceases to be a King. That is in short, not to multiply Cases: In whatsoever he has no Authority, there he is no King, and may be resisted: For wheresoever the Authority ceases, the King ceases too, and becomes like other Men who have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And these two Cases he instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in, differ little from those above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, to be destructive to Governments, only that he has omitted the Principle from which his Doctrine flows; and that is, The breach of trust, in not preserving the Form of Government agreed on, and in not intending the end of Government it self; which is the publick good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Property. When a King has Dethron'd himself, and put himself in a state of War with his People, what shall hinder them from prosecuting him who is no King, as they would any other Man, who has put himself into a state of War with them. <hi>Barclay,</hi> and those of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, would do well to tell us. <hi>Bilson,</hi> a Bishop of our Church, and a great Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for the Power and Prerogative of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:96077:238"/>
does, if I mistake not, in his Treatise of <hi>Christian Subjection,</hi> acknowledge, That Princes may forfeit their Power, and their title, to the Obedience of their Subjects; and if there needed authority in a Case where reason is so plain, I could send my Reader to <hi>Bracton, Fortescue,</hi> and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Mirror, and others, Writers, that cannot be suspected to be ignorant of our Government, or Enemies to it. But I thought <hi>Hooker</hi> alone might be enough to satisfie those Men, who relying on him for their Ecclesiastical Polity, are by a strange fate carried to deny those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon which he builds it. Whether they are herein made the Tools of Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninger Workmen, to pull down their own Fabrick, they were best look. This I am sure, their civil Policy is so new, so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and so destructive to both Rulers and People, that as former Ages never could bear the broaching of it; so it may be hoped, those to come, redeem'd from the Impositions of these <hi>Egyptian</hi> Under-Taskmasters, will abhor the Memory of such servile Platterers, who whilst it seem'd to serve their turn, resolv'd all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into absolute Tyranny, and would have all Men born to what their mean Souls fitted them, Slavery.</p>
               <p n="240">
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:96077:238"/>240. Here, 'tis like, the common Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will be made, who shall be Judge whether the Prince, or Legislative, act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Trust? This, perhaps, ill-affected, and factious Men may spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the People, when the Prince only makes use of his due Prerogative. To this I reply; The People shall be Judge; for who shall be Judge whether his Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stee or Deputy acts well, and according to the Trust reposed in him, but he who deputes him, and must, by having depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; have still a Power to discard him, when he fails in his Trust? If this be reasonable, in particular Cases of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, why should it be otherwise in that of the greatest moment, where the Welfare of Millions is concerned, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so where the evil, if not prevented, is greater, and the Redress very difficult, dear, and dangerous?</p>
               <p n="241">241. But farther, this Question, (Who shall be Judge?) cannot mean, that there is no Judge at all. For where there is no Judicature on Earth, to decide Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies amongst Men, God in Heaven is Judge. He alone, 'tis true, is Judge of the Right. But every Man is Judge for himself, as in all other Cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a State of War with him, and whether he
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96077:239"/>
should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as <hi>Iephtha</hi> did.</p>
               <p n="242">242. If a Controversie arise betwixt a Prince, and some of the People, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where the Law is silent, or doubtful, and the thing be of great Consequence, I should think, the proper Umpire, in such a Case, should be the Body of the People. For in Cases, where the Prince hath a Trust reposed in him, and is dispensed from the common, ordinary Rules of the Law; there, if any Men find themselves aggrieved, and think the Prince acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, or beyond that Trust, who so proper to judge, as the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (who, at first, lodg'd that Trust in him) how far they meant it should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend? But if the Prince, or who-ever they be in the Administration, decline that way of Determination, the Appeal then lies no where but to Heaven. Force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween either Persons, who have no known Superiour on Earth, or which permits no Appeal to a Judge on Earth, being properly a State of War, wherein the Appeal lies only to Heaven, and in that State the injured Party must judge for himself, when he will think fit to make use of that Appeal, and put himself upon it.</p>
               <p n="243">243. To conclude, The Power that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96077:239"/>
individual gave the Society, when he entered into it, can never revert to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals again, as long as the Society lasts, but will always remain in the Community; because without this, there can be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, no Commonwealth, which is contrary to the original Agreement: so also when the Society hath placed the Legislative in any Assembly of Men, to continue in them and their Successors, with Direction and Authority for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such Successors, the Legislative can never revert to the People whilst that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lasts: Because having provided a Legislative with Power, to continue for ever, they have given up their Political Power to the Legislative, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it. But if they have set Limits to the Duration of their Legislative, and made this Supreme Power, in any Person, or Assembly, only temporary: Or else when, by the Miscarriages of those in Authority, it is forfeited; upon the Forfeiture of their Rulers, or at the Determination of the Time set, it reverts to the Society, and the People have a Right to act as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and continue the Legislative in themselves, or place it in a new Form, or new hands, as they think good.</p>
