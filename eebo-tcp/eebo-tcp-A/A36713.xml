            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>IT would be a great Impudence in me to say much of a <hi>Comedy,</hi> which has had but indifferent success in the action. I made the Town my Judges; and the greater part condemn'd it. After which I do not think it my Concernment to defend it, with the ordinary Zeal of a Poet for his decry'd Poem. Though <hi>Corneille</hi> is more resolute in his <hi>Preface</hi> before his <hi>Pertharite,</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd more Uuiversally than this: for he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowes boldly, That in spight of Censure his <hi>Play</hi> was well, and regularly written; which is more than I dare say for mine. Yet it was receiv'd at Court; and was more than once the Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Majesty, by His own Command.
<pb facs="tcp:51495:3"/>
But I have more modesty than to ascribe that to my Merit, which was His particular Act of Grace. It was the first attempt I made in <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique Poetry;</hi> and, I find since, a very bold one, to begin with <hi>Comedy;</hi> which is the most difficult part of it. The Plot was not Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally my own: but so alter'd, by me (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the better or worse, I know not) that, whoever the Author was, he could not have challeng'd a Scene of it. I doubt not but you will see in it, the uncorrectness of a young Writer: which is yet but a small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for him, who is so little amended since. The best Apology I can make for it, and the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, is onely this; That you have since that time received with Applause, as bad, and as uncorrect <hi>Playes</hi> from other Men.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>IS it not strange, to hear a Poet say,</l>
               <l>He comes to ask you, how you like the Play?</l>
               <l>You have not seen it yet! alas 'tis true,</l>
               <l>But now your Love and Hatred judge, not You.</l>
               <l>And cruel Factions (brib'd by Interest) come,</l>
               <l>Not to weigh Merit, but to give their Doome:</l>
               <l>Our Poet therefore, jealous of th' Event,</l>
               <l>And (though much boldness takes) not confident.</l>
               <l>Has sent me, whither you, fair Ladies, too</l>
               <l>Sometimes upon as small occasions goe,</l>
               <l>And from this Scheme, drawn for the hour and day,</l>

               <p>Who must judge of it, we, or these Gentlemen? We'll not meddle with it, so tell your Poet. Here are in this House the ablest Mathematicians in <hi>Europe</hi> for his purpose.</p>

               <l>This Play is <hi>English,</hi> and the growth your own;</l>
               <l>As such it yields to <hi>English</hi> Plays alone.</l>

                     <p>Well Mr. <hi>Failer,</hi> I did not think you of all the rest would have endeavoured a thing so much against my inclination, as this Marriage: if you had been acquainted with my heart, I am sure you would not.</p>

                  <p>He did indeed, Mr. <hi>Failer:</hi> but, why should I suspect him? his carriage is fair, and his means great: he could never live after this rate if it were not.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps so; but he thought you did: and good reason he had for it.</p>

                  <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
                  <p>The most convincing in the World: he knew my Cousin <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> never lov'd you: he has heard her say, you were as invincibly ignorant as a Town-fop judging a new Play: as shame fac'd as a great over-grown School-boy: in fine, good for nothing but to be worm'd out of your estate, and Sacrificed to the god of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                  <p>Was your Cousin so barbarous to say this?</p>

                  <p>And would he let me proceed in my suit to her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
                  <p>For that I must excuse him; he never thought you could love one of my Cousin's humor: but took your Court to her, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a blind to your affection for me: and being possessed with that opinion, he thought himself as worthy as you to marry me.</p>

                  <hi>EPILOGVE</hi> to the WILD GALLANT, as it was first Acted.</head>
               <l>The <hi>Wilde Gallant</hi> has quite played out his game;</l>
               <l>He's marry'd now, and that will make him tame;</l>
               <l>Or if you think Marriage will not reclaim him,</l>
               <l>The Critiques swear they'll damn him, but they'll tame him,</l>
               <l>Yet though our Poet's threatned most by these,</l>
               <l>They are the only People he can please:</l>
               <l>For he to humour them, has shown to day,</l>
               <l>That which they only like, a wretched Play:</l>
               <l>But though his Play be ill, here have been shown</l>
               <l>The greatest Wits, and Beauties of the Town,</l>
               <l>And his Occasion having brought you here</l>
               <l>You are too grateful to become severe.</l>
               <l>There is not any Person here so mean,</l>
               <l>But he may freely judge each Act and Scene:</l>
               <l>But if you bid him chuse his Judges then,</l>
               <l>He boldly names true English Gentlemen:</l>
               <l>For he ne'r thought a handsome Garb or Dress,</l>
               <l>So great a Crime to make their Judgment less:</l>
               <l>And with these Gallants he these Ladies joyns,</l>
               <l>To judge that Language their Converse refines.</l>
               <l>But if their Censures should condemn his Play,</l>
               <l>Far from Disputing, he does only pray</l>
               <l>He may <hi>Leanders</hi> Destiny obtain:</l>
               <l>Now spare him, drown him when he comes again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <head>
                  <hi>EPILOGVE</hi> to the WILDE GALLANT reviv'd.</head>
               <l>OF all Dramatique Writing, Comick Wit,</l>
               <l>As 'tis the best, so 'tis most hard to hit.</l>
               <l>For it lies all in level to the eye,</l>
               <l>Where all may judge, and each defect may spy.</l>
               <l>Humour is that which every day we meet,</l>
               <l>And therefore known as every publick street;</l>
               <l>In which, if e'r the Poet go astray</l>
               <l>You all can point, 'twas there he lost his way,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:51495:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But, What's so common, to make pleasant too,</l>
               <l>Is more then any wit can alwayes do.</l>
               <l>For 'tis, like <hi>Turkes,</hi> with <hi>Hen</hi> and Rice to treat;</l>
               <l>To make regalio's out of common meat.</l>
               <l>But, in your Diet you grow Salvages:</l>
               <l>Nothing but Humane flesh your taste can please:</l>
               <l>And, as their Feasts with slaughtered slaves began,</l>
               <l>So you, at each new Play must have a Man.</l>
               <l>Hither you come, as to see Prizes fought;</l>
               <l>If no Blood's drawn, you cry the Prize is naught.</l>
               <l>But fooles grow wary now; and when they see</l>
               <l>A Poet eyeing round the Company,</l>
               <l>Straight each man for himself begins to doubt;</l>
               <l>They shrink like Seamen when a Press comes out.</l>
               <l>Few of 'em will be found for Publick use,</l>
               <l>Except you charge an Oph upon each house,</l>
               <l>Like the Train-Bands, and every man ingage</l>
               <l>For a sufficient Foole to serve the Stage.</l>
               <l>And, when with much adoe you get him there,</l>
               <l>Where he in all his glory shou'd appear,</l>
               <l>Your Poets make him such rare things to say,</l>
               <l>That he's more wit than any Man ith' Play.</l>
               <l>But of so ill a mingle with the rest,</l>
               <l>As when a Parrat's taught to break a jest.</l>
               <l>Thus aiming to be fine, they make a show</l>
               <l>As tawdry Squires in Country Churches do.</l>
               <l>Things well consider'd, 'tis so hard to make</l>
               <l>A Comedy, which should the knowing take:</l>
               <l>That our dull Poet, in despair to please,</l>
               <l>Does humbly beg by me his Writ of ease.</l>
               <l>'Tis a Land-tax, which he's too poor to pay;</l>
               <l>You, therefore must some other Impost lay.</l>
               <l>Would you but change for serious Plot and Verse</l>
               <l>This mottley garniture of Fool and Farce,</l>
               <l>Nor scorn a Mode, because 'tis taught at home,</l>
               <l>Which does, like Vests, our Gravity become;</l>
               <l>Our Poet yields you should this Play refuse,</l>
               <l>As Tradesmen by the change of fashions, lose</l>
               <l>With some content their fripperies of <hi>France,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In hope it may their staple Trade advance.</l>
