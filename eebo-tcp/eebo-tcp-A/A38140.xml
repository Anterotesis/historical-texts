            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his sacred Majesty:
Sent by Sir Philip Stapleton to his Excellency
the Earle of Essex, and by him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE your Majesties loyall
Subjects, the Lords and
Commons in Parliament,
cannot without great grief
&amp; tendernes of compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
behold the pressing mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the eminent dangers,
and the devouring Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which do extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
threaten, and have
partly seized upon both your Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the practises of a party prevailing
with your Majesty, who by many wicked plots and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109494:3"/>
Conspiracies have attempted the alteration of the
true Religion, and the ancient Government of this
Kingdome, and the introducing of popish idolatry
and Superstition in the Church, and Tyranny and
confusion in the State, and for the compassing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
have long corrupted your Majesties Councels, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
your power, and by suddaine and untimely
dissolving of former Parliaments, have often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the reformation and prevention of those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes.
And being now disabled to avoide the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of this Parliament by any such meanes, have
traiterously attempted to over-awe the same by force;
And in prosecution of their wicked designes, have
excited, incouraged, and fostered an unnatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by which, in a most cruell and
outragious manner many thousands of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
subjects there have bin destroyed. And by false
slaunders upon your Parliament, and malicious and
unjust accusations have indeavoured to beginne the
like Massacre here. And being through Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
therein disappointed, have (as the most mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
and bloody designe of all) drawne your
Majesty to make Warre against your Parliament, and
good Subjects of this Kingdome, leading in your
Person an Army against them, as if You intended by
Conquest to establish an absolute and illimitted power
over them, and by your power and the countenance
of your presence have ransacked, spoyled, impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and murthered divers of your people, and for
their better assistance in their wicked designes, doe
seeke to bring over the Rebels of Ireland, and other
Forces beyond the Seas to joyne with them; And wee
finding our selves utterly deprived of your Majesty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109494:3"/>
protection, and the Authors, Councellors, and Abbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of these mischiefs in greatest power and favour
with your Majesty, and defended by you against
the Iustice and Authority of your high Court of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby they are grown to that height and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
as to manifest their rage and malice against
those of the Nobility and others who are any whit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
unto Peace, not without great appearance of
danger to your own Royall Person; If you shall not
in all things concur with their wicked and Trayterous
courses, have for the just and necessary defence of the
Protestant religion of your Majesties person, Crown,
and Dignity, of the Laws, and Liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and the Priviledges and power of Parliament,
taken up Armes and appointed and authorized <hi>Robert</hi>
Earl of Essex to be Captain Generall of all the Forces
by us raised, and to lead and conduct the same against
these Rebells and Traytors, and them to subdue, and
bring to condigne punishment. And do most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech your Majesty to withdraw your royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and countenance from these wicked persons, &amp;
if they shall stand out in defence of their rebellions
and unlawfull attemps, That your Majesty will leave
them to be supprest by that power which we have sent
against them, and that your Majesty will not mixe
your own dangers With their's; but in peace, and
safety without your Forces forth-with returne to
your Parliament, and by their faithfull Councell and
advice Compose the present distempers &amp; confusions
abounding in both your Kingdomes and provide for
the security and honour of your selfe and your royall
posterity, and the prosperous estate of all your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
wherein if your Majesty please to yeeld to our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109494:4"/>
most humble and earnest desires, wee doe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Almighty God professe that we will receive
your Majesty with all honour, yeeld you all due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and subjection, and faithfully endeavour to secure
your Person and Estate from all dangers, and to the
utermost of our power to procure and establish to your
selfe, and to your people, all the blessings of a glorious
