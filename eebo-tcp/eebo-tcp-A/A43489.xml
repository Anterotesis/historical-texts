            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>RICHARD FORSTER, Doctor in Phyſick, one of the Colledg of Phyſicians in London, in Aſtronomy very learned, and in Aſtrology no leſs skilful, as many yet living do very well remember; for although he was Phyſician to <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> that great Earl of Leiceſter, yet did he ſurvive him, and dyed long after King <hi>Iames</hi> came into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: by this Doctors means Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> Kt.
<pb facs="tcp:55256:4"/>
of the County of Norfolk, became not onely a Lover but an admirable Student in Aſtrology; and to ſay truth, I do not find in all my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any of the Ancients did exceed him in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg herein.</p>
            <p>Some years after K. <hi>Iames</hi> his coming into England this learned Knight, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his gratefulneſs unto Doctor <hi>Forſter,</hi> from whom he acknowledged his initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Study, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto him in London in a well written hand, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and deep piece of Philoſophy which I now
<pb facs="tcp:55256:4"/>
make publike. Doctor <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> as my ſelf well know, received it as an ineſtimable Jewel, and preſerved it in his Study amongſt the rareſt and choiceſt Pieces therein; but death depriving this learned Doctor of life in that year he was Preſident of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, by great providence this enſuing Treatiſe came into my hands; which I have carefully preſerved with great reſpect, both to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and matter it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have many times endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored its impreſſion, but without ſucceſs; for until of late years ſuch was the error
<pb facs="tcp:55256:5"/>
or rather malice of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, who only had priviledg of licenſing Books of this nature, that they wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the publication: But of late caſually ſhewing this Manuſcript to my worthy friend <hi>Elias Ashmole</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> he earneſtly deſired it might be made publike, freely offering to be at the charges of cutting the Diagrams in braſs, that ſo the work might appear in its greater luſtre.</p>
            <p>I might here fall into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and juſt Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every particular Chapter of this Work, and the weight almoſt of every
<pb facs="tcp:55256:5"/>
word in each Chapter; but ſith the Work it ſelf is ſhort, I will not anticipate thy read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but refer thee to the book it ſelf, having abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied my ſelf in theſe my aged days to have added ſomewhat to the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of Aſtrology, which during all my years, and they are more then 70. hath been ſtrangely kept under, and aſperſed by men mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and unlearned; ſo that although I had my ſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſerious thoughts of expreſſing my own Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Conceptions in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, yet was I ever either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
<pb facs="tcp:55256:6"/>
by Friends, or retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſervile fear of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the then preſent Powers. However, if God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my days, I hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be ſerviceable to the learned Society of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, unto whom I heartily commend this at preſent, and in the future ſuch other Pieces as he ſhall enable me to perform, while I live, and am called, Thine,</p>

And to add ſomething of my own experience, my ſelf having made ſome tryals of the height of the Clouds, as well in the heat of Summer, as at other times, could never yet finde them more lifted up above the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth, then 236. perches.

            </head>
            <p>ANd now to proſecute theſe things in order: Firſt, I affirm, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſee Heat and Light to deſcend joyntly with the Beams of the Sun, yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55256:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it doth not concomitate the light of all the Stars; for that heat is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſubſtance of the light, (for aſſertion whereof <hi>Scaliger</hi> juſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 75.</note> 
               <hi>Cardane,)</hi> nor more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with light then ſight, then ſight is to be confounded with touch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Light and Heat are proper Objects. For as we cannot feel the Light, nor ſee the Heat; ſo thoſe Senſes which are not always joyntly exerciſed together (as we ſee, and not feel, and feel, and not ſee) do teach us, that Light and Heat are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers qualities, and both in reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be conceived to ſubſiſt the one without the other. This will beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the diffinition of both, which evermore expreſſeth the nature of the thing in queſtion. Foraſmuch therefore as <hi>Heat is that quality which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heat or Hotneſs defined.</note> 
               <hi>homogeneal things, and ſeparate thoſe that are heterogeneal,</hi> which agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the property of the Light, which is brought unto us by the Beams of the Stars, the ſame being defined (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Alhazen</hi> and <hi>Vitellio)</hi> to be <note place="margin">Light defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs.</note> only <hi>The Species or Image of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Light of the Sun or Star from</hi>

               <hi>whence it is ſent:</hi> There is nothing more evident then that that Heat which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto us with the beams of the Sun, is of a divers nature from the light thereof. For both Sence and Experience do prove, That Heat is no Image or ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, but a real and active quality, which how it ſhould ſubſiſt in an Image as in the ſubject, or how Light ſhould ſubſiſt in Heat, being likewiſe an accidental quality, are difficulties which in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not eaſily be anſwered, except we can prove, that one accident may be the ſubject of another, which is againſt all <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> This then alone, although it doth ſufficiently prove, that Light and Heat are two divers qualities; yet to make it more apparent, dayly obſervation doth ſhew, That one may be and remain in the abſence of the other, as we ſee in Attrition, where Heat is excited without Light, and ſo we may exclude the Light, when nevertheleſs the heat of the Sun ſhall remain. And though the Earth, and the reſt of the Elements, retein the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the former day, yet doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Earth, Air, or Water, ſhine after the Sun is ſet: Wherefore if Heat may
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55256:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thus exiſt, and be ſeparated from the light; and it be alſo true (as before hath been ſhewed) that the one cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the other, what may be more clear then that for theſe Reaſons Light and Heat are two diverſe qualities, and that Light can neither be the eſſence of Heat, nor Heat of Light? Truly therefore doth <hi>Durandus</hi> diſtinguiſh of their properties, teaching us, that the property of Light is only to illuminate, and that it is not of the eſſence thereof either to heat or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigidate; <hi>Sed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>duntaxat me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito corporis in quo ineſt, ut ſi virtute calidum ſit, &amp;c.</hi> So then the heat, which accompanieth the light of the Sun, is not to be ſaid any property of light, but in truth to be referred to the Suns occult and ſpecifick Virtue: as with like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I do affirm, and hereafter will prove, That the reſt of the firſt qualities, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſpecial properties of every Star, doth accompany Light as well as Heat. For it is clear, that there be many <note place="margin">Light in many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which yet be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cold.</note> lightſom bodies which do not heat, but are rather actually cold, as for example, the <hi>Diamond, Carbuncle,</hi> and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, beſides the Eyes, Heads,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55256:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Scales of Fiſhes, and the Sea it ſelf, which in tempeſtuous weather doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent huge mountains of light. Yet to affirm that the Sea burns, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the common Proverb, no better then a plain lye. So falſe is it, that light is always the cauſe of heat, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only from ſuch bodies as are of a hot nature; which I could yet further am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie by experience that I have made in Reflections, it being certain that <hi>Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Concaves, or <hi>Parabolical</hi> Sections, will as ſenſibly reflect the actual cold of Snow or Ice, as it will the heat of the Sun. Wherefore if Cold may accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the reflected Light, why not the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <note place="margin">Cold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth reflected Light.</note> Light it ſelf? Neither do I deſire herein my bare word to go for payment, but do further remit him that ſhall call this in doubt unto his own practiſe, and the Teſtimonies of <hi>Maginus,</hi> who, in the Repreſentations of his Glaſs ſent to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> doth confirm the ſame in theſe words: <hi>Species eſſe ſenſu tactus perceptibilis, ut apparet ex lumine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delae, item ex nive &amp; glacie infrigidante per ſuam imaginem remotè admodum.</hi> And my ſelf have often made the like
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55256:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tryal of the full Moon, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <note place="margin">The light of the Moon not to be hot, found by reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is reflected without any heat at all that ſenſe can perceive, notwithſtanding that the ſame Glaſs doth ſenſibly rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate heat with the light of a ſmall can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and reflecteth the beams of the Sun with that force, that it inflameth all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible matter in an inſtant, and cauſeth Lead to run. Whereunto then may it be imputed, that the Moon ſhining with her borrowed light, doth not ſenſibly warm, as well when it is projected from the Sun? Will they anſwer that the Suns light is debilited by reflection from the Moon? But if they maintain heat always to accompany light, then this is no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And though I ſhould yield that it may weaken the heat alſo, and cauſe calefaction in a leſſer degree, yet this doth not ſatisfie how ſo glorious a Light as the full Moon doth yield, eſpecially in Winter, ſhould be deprived of all heat, when the ſame is collected, re-united, and multiplied again, in which caſe as well all Beams are as well ſtrengthened by reflection, as weakened without his help. Add hereunto, that the greateſt Froſts happen in the faireſt Moon-ſhine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55256:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nights, which proveth Cold to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her light. VVherefore I rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this to be another notable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proving Light of an indifferent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither hot nor cold of it ſelf, but to participate of the quality of the ſtar, or other body from whence it is reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing the ſame light which from the Sun cauſeth heat, hath no ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity reflected from the Moon, but rather the contrary, and divers from it, the force thereof chiefly ſhewing it ſelf in cold and moiſture. But if <hi>Keplers</hi> opinion were true, that Cold were nothing but a meer <hi>Privation,</hi> this could not be: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving that which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alledged to the Judgment of the learned, I hold it very material, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order formerly propounded, to prove next, That Cold is a poſitive quality.</p>

            <p>ANd firſt I demand of <hi>Kepler,</hi> or any that maintaineth his Opinion, if Cold be aſcribed to nothing but priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat by the Suns long abſence, how it cometh to paſs, that one VVinter doth far exceed another in extremity of Cold? Will he anſwer that the Sun is more remote, or longer abſent from us, one year then another? It were too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, knowing that the Sun hath his limits preſcribed, which he never did tranſgreſs, neither can, without violating the Law of Nature. The uniform courſe of the Sun therefore can be no cauſe of this variety of one year from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Neither (if it be well conſidered) <note place="margin">Privation can be no cauſe of Cold.</note> can Privation be any cauſe of Cold at all. For ſeeing Privation is no nature in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but only an imaginary <hi>noncens,</hi> how can that which is not have any action aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto it? Such a cold therefore could not refrigerate, and ſo in truth can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55256:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be no cold at all. But on the contrary, we ſee that Cold is ſuch a quality, as actually conſtringeth Hail, Snow, Froſt, and other congealed Meteors; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſeth the flowing <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Water into a firm glaſſie Subſtance; it chilleth the Blood, and benumeth the Senſe with the extremity thereof: And to be ſhort, through the real exiſtence of this quality in any Subject, we ſee it giveth the ſame denomination of Cold, and that the Senſe is able to judg it ſo: But it were abſurd to ſay we could feel that which is not, and againſt all Reaſon and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to aſcribe theſe effects unto ſuch a thing as reſteth only in imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but hath no Being in Nature. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Error in this Point is as palpable as the Cold it ſelf.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55256:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhine, they ſtill affirm ſucceeding heat to deſcend with their light, whereupon it doth neceſſarily follow, that if there be no poſitive nature to refrigerate, all muſt needs be inflamed. They muſt therefore firſt remove the Sun and Stars out of Heaven, before they can eſtabliſh their vain Cold by abſence and privation of Heat. Which were it granted unto them, ſee further how, whilſt they avoyd <hi>Scylla,</hi> they fall into <hi>Charybdis.</hi> For as on the one ſide Privation, being a meer Negative, hath no action, and therefore (as hath been proved) cannot mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the heat conceived in Summer: So on the other ſide, ſuppoſe Cold once induced into the world by privation of Heat, and it will be as impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Heat again by the return of the Sun, or any other natural means, as to give life to a dead man. For <hi>a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad habitum nullus eſt regreſſus.</hi> As for their <hi>ſimile</hi> or example, it will do them ſmall ſervice: For ſeeing that betwixt twelve and two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the Sun continueth his action ſtill without interruption, their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will teach them, that this is not

Wherefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Point alſo: foraſmuch as Cold is the oppoſite quality to Heat, which of it ſelf is by <hi>Kepler</hi> and <hi>Cardane</hi> confeſſed to have a real exiſtence in Nature: They muſt alſo be driven to acknowledge Cold to be more then a meer Negation and Privation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is impoſſible that that which is not habituall can be actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a particular Nature in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

But if it be better conſidered, we may more truly ſay with <hi>Roſlinus,</hi> That the

To us it is variable, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hot, ſometimes cold, ſometimes moiſt, and ſometimes dry. And to them nearer the <hi>North Pole</hi> for the moſt part cold. Nay, which is more abſurd, were theſe qualities formally in the Elements, we ſhould of neceſſity be driven to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute two forms in every Element an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the two firſt qualities aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to every one of them, and thoſe

For <hi>Aſtra agere quod in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſis non eſt,</hi> is no rare Maxim among the learned, ſome of whom uſe this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the differing manner of theſe qualities in the Stars otherwiſe then in the Elements, by ſuppoſing them in the firſt only <hi>effective,</hi> and in the latter <hi>ſubjective:</hi> Becauſe (as they will have it) the Stars are not actually hot or cold, but <hi>virtualiter;</hi> that is, they have a certain power to produce Heat and Cold, and the reſt of the qualities in the other bodies out of themſelves, which nevertheleſs are not in themſelves. But for mine own part, I freely confeſs not well to conceive this ſubtilty (though it be <hi>Scaligers)</hi> how the Sun not being habitually hot, yet nevertheleſs can burn.

For as the <hi>Load-ſtone</hi> (more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then any <hi>Diamond)</hi> hath in many points a ſingular affinity with Heaven, ſo it doth not fail to lend us a moſt lively example, how contraries may be found in the ſame natural body without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof. For what can be more contrary then attraction &amp; repulſion Yet if the Needle be touched with the North Pole of the Load-ſtone, it is certain, that as that part will attract the ſame, ſo the contrary Pole or End will make it fly away, yet without any danger or paſſion in the ſtone it ſelf. Why ſhould we not therefore believe, that as Heaven is far more excellent then theſe ſublunary Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo it ſhould be endowed with all the virtues which are found here beneath in a far more excellent manner, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to the purity of the matter whereof it conſiſteth. For if the <hi>Matter</hi> be not proportioned unto the power of the <hi>Agent,</hi> no effect can follow.

conſiſting of a ſimple and fift eſſence free from all paſſion, <hi>ergo</hi> although we do admit contrary qualities to flow from the Stars, yet ſhall this work no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the matter of Heaven is not an apt ſubject for this purpoſe.

And that one or two examples may ſtand for many, we ſee the North part of Heaven particularly to affect Iron, that hath either layn long North and South in ſome old building, or that otherwiſe hath bin forg'd at ſuch a poſition, as preciſely reſpecteth the ſame.

By <hi>ſimply</hi> he meaneth, as if Heaven did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this motion only becauſe it is moved. By <hi>accident,</hi> as if by moving is communicateth an accidental faculty of motion unto other things: as when the hand moveth the candle to flax; the hand by his own motion moveth the candle, and ſo burneth the flax or ſtraw; the

But if <hi>Picus,</hi> to avoyd this, deny Heaven to impart any ſuch virtue, and perſiſt in this opinion, that Heaven moveth becauſe it is moved: Then ſaith <hi>Valeſius,</hi> it ſhall not skill of what matter Heaven conſiſteth; ſeeing this effect would as well follow, if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were of wood, mettal, or ſtone, and were withall carryed about. But this could not be: For if a wooden Sphere were turned about circularly over our heads, why ſhould a ſtone and ſmoak (for example) move, in a ſtreight line, the one upward, the other downward?

or turned about by Heaven; ſeeing the ſame falleth in a ſtreight line: Wherefore <hi>Valeſius</hi> ſtrongly concludeth, That the matter of Heaven concurreth with thoſe things that are moved by immitting ſome virtue which moveth every thing in the kind, which yet is diverſe from the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion it ſelf.</p>

Not that the diverſity of Motions alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nature of the Planets, which is ever the ſame, but becauſe in regard hereof they work not after one manner in every place, nor yet alike in the ſame place at the ſame poſition, but diverſly in all places, as the force of their operation is increaſed or diminiſhed through this diverſity of their particular motions, and then diverſly applyed by the diurnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the Heavens unto the matter of <hi>ſublunary</hi> things.

            <p>THe Cauſes hitherto mentioned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be very divine, and contain much excellency in them, yet they come all neerer the nature of Matter then this which followeth. For the manner of their operation did conſiſt chiefly in a certain flux and emiſſion of light conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued down to theſe <hi>ſublunary</hi> bodies, which although it be commonly thought without <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>time,</hi> yet it is not without the demenſions of <hi>Quantity.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In what reſpects the precedent rules of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion and romiſsion come neerer the nature of Matter, then this now to be handled.</note> For it is made by a <hi>right line;</hi> it is atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by the diſtance thereof from the <hi>Star;</hi> it increaſeth or decreaſeth with the face of the <hi>Planet</hi> it ſelf; it is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by oppoſition of a <hi>ſhady body;</hi> and laſtly, the viſible preſence of the Star admitted, it is neceſſarily preſuppoſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Neither is this found in one and the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55256:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſame ſingle ſtar, conſidered by it ſelf, but in compariſon alſo with others. As be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> excel all other Stars in their viſible magnitude; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their action is moſt evident: but in the reſt, whoſe viſible <hi>Diameters</hi> are not comparable to the Suns or Moons, their efficacy is hardly ſenſible, and not to be attained without long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>This cauſe therefore which followeth and belongeth equally to the <hi>Planets</hi> and fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> is more noble, and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired then the other.

Which kind of operation, if the Stars be ſwift in Motion, is in a manner but momentany; for that the Geometrical Angle being changed into
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55256:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
another Angle that is improportionable and improper, immediately, or not long after, this efficacy alſo ceaſeth, though the light of the Star at that time chance to increaſe. For which Cauſe I give not ſo much regard to the Aſpects of the <hi>Moon</hi> with other Planets in the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Weather, as unto the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations of the <hi>Planets</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or with the fixed Stars, whoſe motion being but ſlow in reſpect of the <hi>Moons,</hi> doth not ſo ſuddenly vary the Angle of their Configuration at the Earth.</p>
            <p>From hence it is therefore that thoſe Arks or Portions of the Heaven allotted unto the Aſpects are not ſo much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all other Cauſes in <hi>Aſtrological Judgments.</hi> For although it be true, that in all Scituations the Stars ſend forth their Beams unto all the parts of Heaven and Earth which they behold, as may be argued out of <hi>Vitellio</hi> his <hi>Demonſtration,</hi>

Earth, which may ſeem to make an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect among themſelves: Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all the ancient and modern <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> following <hi>Nature</hi> for their Guide, have heretofore regarded theſe few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations only, being but five in all, namely the ☌, ⚹, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, and ☍: amongſt which, although the firſt do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly go for an <hi>Aspect,</hi> becauſe every <hi>Aspect</hi> is reputed a proportioned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between two or more Stars; yet nevertheleſs ſeeing a certain Poſition of the Stars in the Zodiack is rather conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in this Poſition, then any diverſity of place, and that the enumeration of the <hi>Aſpects</hi> ever beginneth from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; Therefore as well in reſpect of this <hi>Analogie,</hi> as of the received uſe, it may not be ſecluded out of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Aspects,</hi> ſpecially knowing that the Beams of the Stars are as well extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upward and downward, as obliquely and collaterally.</p>
            <p>But if any man deſire further to be ſatisfied of the Reaſon which firſt moved the ancient <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> to obſerve thoſe diſtances and Arks aſſigned unto the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects</hi> as of more virtue then any other:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55256:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Surely the Anſwer is eaſie, ſeeing Nature it ſelf every where, both in the motions and effects of the heavenly Bodies, as alſo in other Arithmetical and Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical reſpects, chiefly celebrateth theſe very proportions with a ſingular Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. <hi>Picus</hi> ſpeaking hereof, thinketh <note place="margin">Nature hath as it were firſt alured us to obſerve the Aſpects by ſpecial tokens, or ſecret marks in the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> they were firſt induced hereunto by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſeveral illuminations or ages of the <hi>Moon,</hi> for that when ſhe is <hi>new, horned,</hi> in her <hi>quarters, gibboſſity,</hi> and <hi>fulneſs,</hi> her forms are ſtill changed at theſe proportioned ſpaces from the Sun.

Neither have other <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> failed to note, how <hi>Nature</hi> pointeth (as it were with a finger) particularly unto every Configuration, while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the motions of the other Planets. For thus <hi>Abohazer</hi> wittily affirmeth the two inferiour Planets in their Stations to obſerve the Ark proper to a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> aſpect. <hi>Pliny</hi> likewiſe with him as skilfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth <note place="margin">

For between any two great Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> there are 19 <hi>Aegyptian</hi> years, 318 days, and 13 hours, in which time thoſe <hi>Planets</hi> are moved from the place of their former Conjunctions 8 ſigns, and almoſt 3 degrees, which exceſs of 3 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees is the cauſe why after 10 Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they paſs from one <hi>Triplicity</hi> to another, and one <hi>Triplicity</hi> continueth 198 equal years, 2<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> imagined the year 1588. from the birth of Chriſt would have been ſo fatal. From hence therefore it is, that not without cauſe they are called great Conjunctions, both hapning rarely, and abiding thus in one Triplicity almoſt 200 years together, and not finiſhing all the Triplicities of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> in much leſſer then 800 years, not having therefore reiterated all the <hi>Triplicities</hi> 8 times ſince the beginning of the World. Neither are the other Poſitions of theſe <hi>Planets</hi> to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for if any man will take the pains to obſerve when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do behold one another with a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> or ☍ aſpect, they ſhall evidently perceive that they ſtill carry ſuch a regard unto the ſigns or places of their precedent and next Conjunctions, as evermore they irradiate the one and the other with a ⚹, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, or ☍ aſpects. And ſo this ſhall ſuffice (if it be not more then enough) to ſhew how Nature hath alured us to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe <hi>Arks</hi> by theſe <hi>Aſpects</hi> in the particular Motion of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi>

And now in a word to confirm the <note place="margin">The aſpects confirmed by their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> ſame by their virtue and effects: Firſt, The <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are taught by experience, That the <hi>Criſis</hi> of all ſharp diſeaſes have a notorious and moſt memorable <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> with all theſe five Configurations of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> to the place of her Being in the beginning of the ſickneſs. Thus alſo we ſee the Seas themſelves in their Tydes to dance as it were after the motion of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, while their Spring and higheſt Floods always concur with her ☌ and ☍ to the <hi>Sun,</hi> as their Neaps and loweſt Tydes do likewiſe reſpect her Quarters. And as memorable a thing it is, that the Seas in their dayly flowing and ebbing upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Coaſt, have ſtill a conſtant reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch <hi>Azimuthal</hi> Circles as are in a quartile poſiture when the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> paſſeth by them. To conclude, it is more manifeſt then that I need to inſiſt upon it, that the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf ſeemeth greatly to reſpect the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, in that he moderateth the viciſſitudes or four quarters of the year by his ingreſs into the four <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> and <hi>Tropical</hi> Points.</p>

And what thoſe Figures are before ſaid to perform, either doubled or joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may alſo be truly aſcribed unto the oppoſite aſpect by it ſelf, for that the <hi>Diametral</hi> Line, which paſſeth from the place of Conjunction to the oppoſite Point, divideth a Circle into two equal parts, the like whereof cannot be found in any other inſcripts. For example, the ſide of a regular <hi>Pentagon</hi> ſubtendeth 72. degr. of an <hi>Octagon</hi> but 45. the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of which Arks, <hi>viz.</hi> 108. and 135. gr. are not ſubtended by the ſides of any ordinate figure.</p>
            <p>And thus, as it is before ſhewed, That the Subtenſes of theſe Aſpects be the

               </note> Inſcripts, and do only therefore take up the Circumference of a Circle: So it is evident, that the Angles at which they concur be the ſame wherewith the ordinate plains take up the whole ſpace about the Center. For if we conſider the Angle of a ⚹ at the Earth, it is all one with that of an aequilater Triangle conſiſting of 60. gr. and containeth ⅔ of a right Angle, but ſix times ⅔ of a right Angle makes four right Angles; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſix <hi>Sextiles</hi> equal to ſix aequilater Triangles fill the whole ſpace about a point, which is equal to four right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.

Thirdly, The Angle which two Stars in a <g ref="char:trine">△</g> make at the Center of the World, is meaſured by an Angle of 120. gr. and ſo equal to the Angle of a regular <hi>Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> conſiſting of a right Angle, and 1/<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

about the Center: To which me may not improperly add the oppoſite Aſpect, conſiſting of two right Angles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doubled, ſhall perform the like office with the reſt, any other figure of many Angles, however joyned together at the Angles, ſhall either want of four right Angles, or exceed them.

            <p>Theſe Speculations therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it were ſenſleſs to imagine, that Nature hath ſo many ways honored theſe Irradiations of the Stars in vain, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed us to a ſpecial regard of them by ſo many rare and ſecret Obſervations, both in the motions of the Planets, and alſo in their effects and proportions, if they were not indued with more virtue then others.

Now as that which is defective, and wanteth proportion, leaveth the action fruſtrate, and without effect: ſo that which on the other ſide offendeth in exceſs, muſt needs incur the contrary fault, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that which either Nature or Art intendeth, whereby of neceſſity it will follow, that there being no defect, nor exceſs, but an equal and juſt mixture of the influence of the Stars in theſe Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, theſe only ſhall be apt and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to produce agreeable effects in the matter of all <hi>ſublunary</hi> things. For it fareth in theſe effects, which are produced by the mixture of Light and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, as with <hi>Chymical</hi> Operations, where the defect of heat produceth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; as on the other ſide exceſs doth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55256:55"/>
either by <hi>Sublimation, Eruption, Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> breaking the Veſſel, and the like, deſtroy the work. And to make it yet clearer, how the Beams of any ſuch Stars do proportionally take up the Center of the World, whereas, in that which went before, I have only ſhewed how the Points of thoſe Ordinate Playns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto theſe Configurations have been compared, often reiterated, do take up place. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Reaſon why any</hi> 2 <hi>Stars in Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall take up all elementary matter at the Center with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Angles made by their Beams, incident, reflected, or oppoſite.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Now will I ſet forth how the Beams of any two Stars in any one of the former Configurations ſhall take up more ſpace, then that which is comprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Incidents or Beams of true motion, and how by their Beams, either incident, reflected, or oppoſite, they do poſſeſs, and take up the whole Center of the World at one inſtant with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Angles. For evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration whereof concerning ☌ and ☍, (whoſe force rather dependeth upon union then proportion) I need no further labour, then to refer the Reader to the view of the laſt figure but one, where he ſeeth the united Beams of ſuch Stars as are in ☌ &amp; ☍ to ſurround the Center, and all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55256:55"/>
elementary matter whatſoever ſubject unto the actions of Heaven. And ſo for the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, whoſe Beams incident and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, traverſe the Center of the World at four right Angles, <hi>viz.</hi> AFG, GFI, AFH, and HFI; ſeeing four Points of a rectangle quadrilater figure hath been before proved to occupy place, I likewiſe need no other proof, then that the Reader will in the laſt figure conſider how theſe four right Angles made by one <hi>Quartile</hi> take up the Center of the World. But concerning the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> and ⚹, although the like be evident enough to any of mean skil, yet nevertheleſs there are ſome other ſpeculations which require a word or two more. For in the laſt figure ſuppoſe two Stars A &amp; Birradiate the earth with their ⚹ Beams, although it be true, that by the protracting of the oppoſite Beam from F to D, the Center of the whole World ſeemeth occupied with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Angles, BFA being ſubtended by the Ark of 60. which is before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the Angle of an ordinate <hi>aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later triangle,</hi> and ſo leaveth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Angle BFI equal to the Angle of an ordinate <hi>Hexagon,</hi> ſubtended hereby
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55256:56"/>
the Ark 120, which is the Ark of a <g ref="char:trine">△</g>; the like being alſo to be underſtood of the Angles made by the oppoſite Beams <hi>ad verticem.</hi> Yet nevertheleſs we are here further to conſider, how the incident Beam of B, <hi>viz.</hi> BF, reflecteth unto C, and ſo taketh up the whole <hi>Semicircle</hi> ABCI, with three ⚹, <hi>viz.</hi> AFB, BFC, and CFI. In like manner, if we conſider C to be in a triangular Configuration with A, we ſee that as the oppoſite Beam of A, <hi>viz.</hi> FI, maketh a ⚹ with the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Beam of a Star at C, <hi>viz.</hi> CF; ſo CF being the Beam incident of the Star C reflecteth alſo to the Point B, and ſo maketh the ſame three ⚹, wherewith the aforeſaid whole <hi>Semicircle</hi> is taken up, as is before demonſtrated. Wherefore this may ſatisfie the indifferent, how any two Stars in any of theſe Configurations do proportionably ocupy the whole Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the World in the ſame moment, without reiterating the ſame Angle.</p>
            <p>And becauſe hitherto we have ſpoken only of the old Configurations, known to the ancient <hi>Astronomers,</hi> I may not forget to ſignifie, that in theſe our days our late Artiſts (whereof <hi>Kepler</hi> is the

chief) have added unto theſe former <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Three new Aſpects,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Quintile, Biquintile <hi>&amp;</hi> Seſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadrate <hi>added by</hi> Kepler, <hi>and the Reaſon which drew him to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſo making</hi> 8 <hi>Aſpects in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to ſo many diviſions of a</hi> Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord.</note> Aſpects three others, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Quintile,</hi> conſiſting of 72 degr. the <hi>Biquintile</hi> of 144 degr. and the <hi>Seſquiquadrate</hi> of 135 degr. ſo making 8 Configurations anſwerable to the 8 Conſonant Stops in a <hi>Monochord.</hi> Neither dare I for my part contradict theſe new additions: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made trial as wel in the ſpeculations of the Weather &amp; Meteors, as in the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Nativities, I dare boldly affirm, That there have divers events and effects concurred with theſe new Configurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for which, without theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we can find as yet no Reaſon at all in <hi>Astrologie:</hi> Neither wanted they true grounds of Reaſon for this their Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For as in Muſick there be but 3 perfect Concords, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Diapaſon, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apente,</hi> and <hi>Diateſſaron;</hi> ſo in <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> there are but 3 perfect Aſpects anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the foreſaid <hi>Harmonies,</hi> namely the ☍, the <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, and the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, the ⚹ being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and ſo proved before to be but an imperfect Aſpect, anſwering exactly to B flat, the firſt among the imperfect or compounded Concords. Wherefore conſidering that the firſt 3 perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55256:57"/>
are found to have their perfect Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects anſwerable unto them, and that B flat being an imperfect Concord is alſo found to agree exactly in proportion with the ⚹, being an imperfect Aſpect: This gave <hi>Kepler</hi> firſt cauſe to ſuſpect that the other Harmonical Proportions contained in the ſame <hi>Monochord</hi> might alſo have their Aſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, Biquintile,</hi> and <hi>Seſquiquadrate</hi> anſwerable unto them; wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as yet I have not entered into any other <hi>Geometrical</hi> Speculation, why theſe diſtances are alſo effectual in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as well as the former, thus much for this time may ſuffice, both for the occaſion of their firſt invention, as alſo for their probability to be obſerved in practiſe.</p>
            <p>And now having thus diſcourſed at large of the Dignity, and diverſe Reaſons of theſe Aſpects or Configurations, which are ſo powerful in operation, I ſhall conclude with this deſire, that two things more may be further noted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That we are not only to regard theſe proportioned Diſtances among the <hi>Planets,</hi> but alſo of the <hi>Planets</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:55256:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the <hi>fixed Stars.</hi> Which <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as it hath been heretofore omitted by others, either through loathneſs to calculate the Aſpects of the <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> or through neglecting them altogether; ſo undoubtedly it hath been no ſmall cauſe, why our <hi>Prognoſticators</hi> have failed in their Judgments by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a principal part of their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, That where we finde plenty of Aſpects, eſpecially coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is a manifeſt Argument, that plenty of matter ſtirred up will follow, which will cauſe great alteration of the Air apt for the Seaſon.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55256:58"/>
my ſelf as well as I could in the morning about 7 of the Clock to take their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: but at that time the Air being cloudy, and the Heaven only favorable about the <hi>Horizon,</hi> I could perceive <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> only in his Matutine Emerſion, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearing out of the Sun-beams, but <hi>Saturn</hi> at that time was not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the youngeſt eye there. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I only at that time obſerved <hi>Jupiter</hi> his diſtance <hi>a lance Meridionali,</hi> 27. gr. 33. m. 30. ſec.</p>
            <p>The place of <hi>Lanx Merid:</hi> according to <hi>Tycho,</hi> was then 9. gr. 33. m. 30. ſec ♏.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing <hi>Jupiter</hi> his latitude by the <hi>Ephem:</hi> was 54. m. <hi>Sept.</hi> and the latitude of <hi>Lanx Merid:</hi> 26. m. <hi>Sept.</hi> agreeing thus in the denomination of your latitude, and ſo near the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> it is evident that <hi>Jupiter</hi> his place was <hi>quoad longitudinem,</hi> without more Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, 7. gr. 7. m. ♐.</p>
            <p>The three day following, <hi>viz.</hi> 4, 5, and 6. were very foul and ſtormy, but the ſeventh being froſty in the morning, gave me reaſonable opportunity to attend this buſineſs again, at what time we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held both <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>

in an <hi>Iſoceles</hi> triangle almoſt, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly repreſenting the beginning of the firy <hi>Trigon:</hi> But the day being broken, and the Sun approaching apace, we were fain to take ſuch Obſervations as we could of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and let <hi>Mercury</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, hor. 7. m. 25. I obſerved <hi>Saturn</hi> to be diſtant from <hi>Lan: Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional</hi> 28. gr. 24. m. 30. ſec. <hi>bis.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Jupiter</hi> from the ſame fixed Star twice alſo, hor. 7. m. 40.—28. 24 30. at what time <hi>Saturn</hi> his light, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the breaking of the day, was very weak; therefore we began with him, and ended with <hi>Jupiter:</hi> and by this Obſervation I then concluded, That I thought it the Will of God I ſhould have opportunity to obſerve the true moment of the great Conjunction, which, as appeareth by theſe diſtances, happened in the 7 gr. 58 m. of ♐, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they could not both have had equal diſtance from the ſame fixed Star, lying parallel in effect with them to the Ecliptick.</p>
            <p>I alſo obſerved both <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> upon the ſixteenth day,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:55256:59"/>

            <p>All which Obſervations I ſet down, to the end you may compare them, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſhall find they will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm then derogate from the place and time of this great Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter:</hi> yet, to ſpeak ingenuouſly, not truſting my Obſervation more then I ſhould, partly becauſe the day-light would not ſuffer us to obſerve other fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stars with the Planets, and partly by reaſon of the ſlow motion of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> I layd them aſide till after peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Kepler de Stella Nova,</hi> I was the more encouraged to make account of my Obſervation: for I found in pag. 48. that he, by ſuch Obſervation as he could make, conſtituteth the time at <hi>Prage</hi> to be the 7 day, 8 hor. and 20 min. although afterwards he ſhew as little confidence in the hour as my ſelf did before, I was confirmed by his Obſervation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the <hi>Meridians</hi> be compared, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55256:60"/>
difference of time between his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mine is not above 13 m. which is not worth the ſpeaking of, and may happen as well by the Error of <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> as of the Obſervation.

And the <hi>Longitude</hi> of <hi>London</hi> in Mr <hi>Cambdens Britannia</hi> is 23. gr. 25. m. the difference is 14. gr. 35. m. which wants but 2. m. of the whole hour. Wherefore if 58. m. being the common difference between the <hi>Meridians</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> be ſubducted from 8 hor. 28 m. the remainder ſheweth the moment of the great Conjunction at <hi>London</hi> to be 7 ho. 22 m. by <hi>Kepler.</hi> But whereas my Obſervation of <hi>Iupiter</hi> was at 7 ho. 40 m. with me, whoſe dwelling is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about 5 m. of time from the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> of <hi>London</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> by my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation the ſame happen 7 ho. 35 m. at <hi>London,</hi> which is but 13 m. later then <hi>Kepler</hi> aſſigneth it, whoſe Obſervation, being only by the <hi>Quadrate</hi> and <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> with many operations and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as you may read, I hold not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as my own.</p>

Thus then having both obſerved the time my ſelf, and confirmed my Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Keplers,</hi> and by Obſervations of my own, both preceding and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, (for that the obſervation of <hi>Iupiter</hi> the 3 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> and thoſe of the 16. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined by the diurnal Motion, will vary little or nothing from the day and time before limited,) I will now erect the Figure of the Heavens for the <hi>Horizon</hi> of <hi>London</hi> at that inſtant, that ſo you may have a foundation of further Speculations then have hitherto been thought on.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to be neglected, that this new Star excelled all the reſt of the Planets in Magnitude and Light: and whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perverſe old <hi>Saturn</hi> (the Preſident of Antiquity) both in reſpect of his ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in his own Orb, being in <hi>Apogaeo Eccentrici et Epicycli,</hi> and alſo in regard of his Latitude, was elevated above <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his own houſe: Now this new Star having Latitude, 1 gr. 53 m. 54 ſec. <hi>Sept.</hi> by our Obſervation is elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

               </hi> hardly enduring to be thus over-topped, prepared againſt him, and toward the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Novem.</hi> that year thought to have encountred him; behold he was alſo fain to come under the <hi>Lee</hi> (as the <hi>Sea-men</hi> term it) of the new Star, and ſo glad to paſs away, and leave the new Star ſtill keeping poſſeſſion, and as it were maſter of the field, where it ſtill continued, till at laſt the Sun returning the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place which he held in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the great Conjunction, and the beginning of this new Star, as before is ſhewed, he there finiſhed the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of all this ſolemn Art, with a great Eclipſe of his Light exactly in the <hi>Mid-heaven</hi> of the beginning of the great Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and in a ⚹ to the <hi>Aſcendant</hi> thereof, and the place of this new Star. This is the true Hiſtorical Narration.</p>
            <p>What the meaning hereof is, I leave to thoſe that are indued with a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Prophetical Inſtinct then my ſelf: Yet thus much we ſee, that he who overlooked proud <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and challenged Antiquity to himſelf, is here put down

by the brightneſs of this new Light. And further, as the Sun <hi>Metaphorically</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth Kings and Magiſtrates, and Nobility in <hi>Astrologie</hi> are reſembled to the Planets about the Sun: So the fixed Stars are compared to the People, and Commons, amongſt whom ſome excel others, and therefore whether there be a new <hi>Democraty</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocraty</hi> of the Church and Common-wealth founded while the Sun ſuffereth his light to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, or whether the Goſpel (often by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> reſembled to the Sun) ſhall ſuffer an Eclipſe, I take not upon me to decide. But this I verily believe, as far as I can look into it with any probable gueſs, that ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this great Conjunction there hath been many Treaties of Peace over all the parts of the World, both between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Lowcountry-men</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and alſo between the <hi>Emperor, Turks</hi> and <hi>Hungarians;</hi> all which are concluded, ſaving the Peace between the <hi>Low-countries</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> So you ſhall ſee (if I be not deceived) that Treaty will break off, and by that means the Wars be renewed, &amp; the King

of <hi>Spain</hi> utterly beaten out of his <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> propagated unto the <hi>Southern</hi> parts. For to what other end is this new Star Perpendicular to the <hi>Indian</hi> Seas, and to the beſt part of <hi>America?</hi> To what end alſo (though <hi>Mars</hi> ſeemeth in the Eclipſe in reſpect of his Poſition, as alſo in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in reſpect of his Latitude di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) is he notwithſtanding both in the figure of the great Conjunction elevated above all the Planets, while <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> are <hi>in peſſimo loco,</hi> and in the figure of the Eclipſe, as your ſelf materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally noted, <hi>in imperante gradu &amp; ſigno,</hi> over the place Eclipſed? Beſides, you aptly note the diſſembling and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ⚹ of <hi>Saturn in</hi> 12. <hi>loco</hi> to the place Eclipſed, together with the hoſtile and exact Irradiation of <hi>Iupiter</hi> to the ſame: I ſpeak not theſe things as if I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them <hi>Ab Apollinis Tripode,</hi> but as I compare the likelihood of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accidents by the ſtate of things preſent, as they have any alluſion to the apparition of the heavenly bodies: All which I ſubmit to your grave Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
