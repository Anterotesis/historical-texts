            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My most honour'd Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am too well acquainted with the weaknesses of mine abilities (far unfit to undergo such a Task as I have in hand) to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my self with the hope I may either inform your understanding, or do my self honour by what I am to write. But I am so desirous you should be possest with the true knowledge of what a bent will I have upon all occasions to do you ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30084:5"/>
that obedience to your command weigheth much more with me, then the lawfulnesse of any excuse can, to preserve me from giving you in writing such a testimonie of my ignorance and erring Phantasie as I fear this will prove. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any more circumstance, I will, as I can, deliver to you in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, what th'other day I discoursed to you upon the 22. Staffe of the ninth <hi>Canto</hi> in the second Book of that match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Poem, <hi>The Faery Queen,</hi> written by our English <hi>Virgil</hi>; whose words are these:
<q>
                  <l>The Frame thereof seem'd partly Circular,</l>
                  <l>And part Triangular: O work divine!</l>
                  <l>Those two the first and last proportions are;</l>
                  <l>The one, imperfect, mortall, feminine;</l>
                  <l>Th'other immortal, perfect, masculine;</l>
                  <l>And twixt them both a Quadrate was the Base,</l>
                  <l>Proportion'd equally by seven and nine;</l>
                  <l>Nine was the Circle set in Heavens place,</l>
                  <l>All which compacted made a goodly Diapase.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30084:5"/>In this Staffe the Author seems to me to proceed in a different manner from what he doth elsewhere generally through his whole Book. For in other places, although the beginning of his Allegory or mysticall sense, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, yet in the processe of it, he doth himself declare his own conceptions in such sort as they are obvious to any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie capacitie: But in this, he seems onely to glance at the profoundest noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that any Science can deliver us, and then on a sudden (as it were) recalling himself out of an Enthusiasme, he returns to the gentle Relation of the Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call History he had begun, leaving his Readers to wander up and down in much obscuritie, &amp; to come within much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of erring at his Intention in these lines? Which I conceive to be dictated by such a learned Spirit, and so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a knowing Soul, that were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else extant of <hi>Spencers</hi> writing, yet these few words would make me esteeme him no whit inferiour to the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30084:6"/>
men that ever have been in any age: as giving an evident testimonie herein, that he was throughly verst in the Mathematicall Sciences, in Philosophy, and in Divinity, to which this might serve for an ample Theme to make large Commentaries upon. In my praises up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this subject, I am confident that the worth of the Author will preserve me from this Censure, that my Ignorance onely begets this Admiration, since he hath written nothing that is not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But that it may appear I am gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded somewhat by my own Judgement (tho' it be a meane one) and not by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith, and that I may in the best manner I can, comply with what you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from me, I will no longer hold you in suspense, but begin immediately, (tho' abruptly) with the declaration of what I conceive to be the true sense of this place, which I shall not go about to adorne with any plausible discourses, or with Authorities and examples drawne from others writings (since my want
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30084:6"/>
both of conveniency and learning would make me fall very short herein) but it shall be enough for me to intimate mine own conceptions, and offer them up to you in their own simple and naked form, leaving to your better Judgement the examination of the weight of them, and after perusall of them, beseeching you to reduce them and me if you perceive us erring.</p>
            <p>Tis evident that the Authors intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this <hi>Canto</hi> is to describe the bodie of a man inform'd with a rationall soul, and in prosecution of that designe he sets down particularly the severall parts of the one and of the other: But in this <hi>Stanza</hi> he comprehends the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of them both, as (being joyned together to frame a compleat Man) they make one perfect compound, which will the better appear by taking a survey of every severall clause thereof by it self.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:30084:7"/>
               <l>The Frame thereof seemd partly Circular,</l>
               <l>And part Triangular—</l>
            </q>
            <p>By these Figures, I conceive that he means the mind and body of Man; the first being by him compared to a Circle, and the latter to a Triangle. For as a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of all Figures is the most perfect, and includeth the greatest space, and is every way full and without Angles, made by the continuance of one onely line: so mans soul is the noblest and most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Creature, that God hath created, and by it we are capable of the greatest gifts that God can bestow, which are Grace, Glory, and Hypostaticall Union of the Humane nature to the Divine, and she enjoyeth perfect freedome and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in all her Actions, and is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out composition which no Figures are that have Angles (for they are caus'd by the coincidence of severall lines) but of one pure substance which was by God breath'd into a Body made of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30084:7"/>
earth as in the preceding <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> the Author describes. And this is the exact Image of him that breathed it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting him as fully as tis possible for any creature which is infinitely distant from a Creator. For, as God hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning nor ending: so, neither of these can be found in a Circle, although that being made of the successive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a line, it must be supposed to have a beginning somewhere: God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Circle whose Center is every where, but his circumference no where: But mans soul is a Circle, whose circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is limited by the true center of it, which is onely God. For as a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference doth in all parts alike respect that indivisible Point, and as all lines drawn from the inner side of it, do make right Angles within it, when they meet therein: so all the interiour actions of mans soul ought to have no other respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Point to direct themselves unto, but God; and as long as they make right Angles, which is, that they keep the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30084:8"/>
middle of virtue, and decline not to either of the sides where the contrary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dwell, they cannot fail, but meet in their Center. By the Triangular Figure he very aptly designes the body: for as the Circle is of all other Figures the most perfect and most capacious: so the Triangle is most imperfect, and includes least space. It is the first and lowest of all Figures; for fewer then 3 right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles cannot comprehend and inclose a superficies, having but 3 angles they are all acute (if it be equilaterall) and but equall to 2 <hi>right</hi>; in which respect all other regular Figures consisting of more then 3 lines, do exceed it.</p>
            <p>(May not these be resembled to the 3 great compounded Elements in mans bodie, to wit, Salt, Sulphur and Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which mingled together make the naturall heat and radicall moysture, the 2 qualities whereby man liveth?) For the more lines that go to comprehend the Figure, the more and the greater the Angles are, and the nearer it comes to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30084:8"/>
the perfection and capacitie of a Circle. A Triangle is composed of severall lines, and they of Points, which yet do not make a quantitie by being contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to one another: but rather the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them doth describe the lines. In like manner the Body of man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the foure Elements which are made of the foure primarie qualities, not compounded of them (for they are but Accidents) but by their operation upon the first matter. And as a Triangle hath three lines, so a solid Body hath three dimensions, to wit, Longitude, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Profunditie. But of all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Man is of the lowest rank, (as the Triangle is among Figures) being composed of the Elements which make it liable to alteration and corruption. In which consideration of the dignitie of bodies, I divide them by a generall divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, into sublunarie (which are the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated ones) and Aethereall, which are supposed to be of their own nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and peradventure there are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30084:9"/>
some other <hi>species</hi> of corporeall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is not of this place to dispute.</p>
            <q>
               <l>O work divine!</l>
            </q>
            <p>Certainly of all Gods works, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest and perfectest is Man, and for whom indeed all others were done. For, if we consider his <hi>soul,</hi> it is the very Image of God. If his <hi>bodie,</hi> it is adornd with the greatest beautie and most excellent sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of parts, of any created thing: whereby it witnesseth the perfection of the Architect, that of so drossie mold is able to make so rare a fabrick: If his <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> they are free: If his <hi>end,</hi> it is eternall glory. And if you take <hi>all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Man is a little world, an exact type of the great world, and of God himself. But in all this, me thinks, the admirablest work is the joyning together of the two <hi>different</hi> and indeed <hi>opposite</hi> substances in Man, to make one perfect compound; the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body,</hi> which are of so contrary a nature, that their <hi>uniting</hi> seems
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30084:9"/>
to be a Miracle. For how can the one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and work in the other, since there's no mean of operation (that we know of) between a spirituall substance and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall? yet we see that it doth: as hard it is to find the true proportion betweene a Circle and a Triangle; yet, that there is a just proportion, and that they may be equall, <hi>Archimedes</hi> hath left us an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious demonstration; but in reducing it to a Probleme, it fails in this, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the proportion between a crooked line and a straight one, is not known, one must make use of a Mechanick way of measuring the <hi>peripherie</hi> of the one, to convert it to the side of the other.</p>
            <q>
               <l>These two the first and last proportions are.</l>
            </q>
            <p>What I have already said concerning a Circle and a Triangle, doth sufficiently unfold what is meant in this verse. Yet twill not be amisse to speak one word more hereof in this place. All things that have existence, may be divided into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30084:10"/>
three <hi>Classes</hi>; which are, either what is pure and simple in it self, or what hath a nature compounded of what is simple, or what hath a nature compounded of what is compounded. In continued quantitie this may be exemplified by a Point, a line, and a superficies in Bodies: and in numbers, by an unity, a Denary, and a Centenary. The first, which is onely pure &amp; simple, like an indivisible point, or an unity, hath relation onely to the Divine nature: That point then moving in a sphericall manner (which serves to expresse the perfection of Gods actions) describes the Circles of our souls, and of Angels, and intellectuall substances, which are of a pure and simple nature, but receiveth that from what is so, in a perfecter manner, and that hath his, from none else. Like lines that are made by the flowing of points; or Denaries that are composed of Unities: beyond both which there is nothing. In the last place, Bodies are to be rankt, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the Elements: and they likewise
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30084:10"/>
suffer composition, and may very well be compared to the lowest of the Figures which are composed of lines, that owe their being to Points (and such are Triangles) or to Centenaries that are composed of Denaries, and they of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But if we will compare these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by proportion, God must be left out, since there is as infinite distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Simplicitie and Perfection of his nature, and the composition and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of all created substances, as there is between an indivisible Point and a continuate quantitie, or between a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Unitie and a compounded number. So that onely the other two kinds of substance do enter into this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and of them I have already proved, that mans Soul is of the one the noblest, (being dignified by hypostaticall Union above all other intellectuall substances) and his elementated Body, of the other the most low and corruptible. Whereby it is evident, that those two are the first and last Proportions, both in respect of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30084:11"/>
their own Figure, and of what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The one imperfect, Mortall, Feminine:</l>
               <l>Th'other immortall, perfect, Masculine.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Mans Body hath all the proprieties of imperfect matter. It is but the Patient: of it self alone, it can do nothing: it is liable to corruption and dissolution if it once be deprived of the form which actuates it, and which is incorruptible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. And as the feminine Sex is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and receives perfection from the masculine: so doth the Body from the Soul, which to it is in lieu of a male. And as in corporall generations the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male affords but grosse and passive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which the Male gives active heat and prolificall vertue: so in spirituall generations (which are the operations of the minde) the body administers one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Organs, which if they were not imployed by the Soul, would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves serve for nothing. And as there is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30084:11"/>
a mutuall appetence between the Male and the Female, betweene matter and forme; So there is betweene the bodie and the soul of Man, but what ligament they have, our Author defineth not (and it may be Reason is not able to attaine to it) yet he tels us what is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that this Machine rests on, and what keeps the parts together; in these words.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And twixt them both, a Quadrate was the Base.</l>
            </q>
            <p>By which Quadrate, I conceive, that he meaneth the foure principall humors in mans Bodie, <hi>viz. Choler, Blood, Phleme,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy</hi>: which if they be distempered and unfitly mingled, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the whole doth immediately ensue: like to a building which falls to ruine, if the foundation and Base of it be unsound or disordered. And in some of these, the vitall spirits are contained and preserved, which the other keep in convenient temper; and as long as they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30084:12"/>
do so, the soul and bodie dwell together like good friends: so that these foure are the Base of the conjunction of the other two, both which he saith, are
<q>
                  <l>Proportion'd equally by seven and nine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In which words, I understand he meanes the influences of the superior substances (which governe the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour) into the two differing parts of Man; to wit, of the <hi>Starres</hi> (the most powerfull of which, are the seven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, into his body: and of the Angels divided into nine Hierarchies or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) into his soul: which in his <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel,</hi> he saith is
<q>
                  <l>By soveraigne choice from th`heavenly Quires select,</l>
                  <l>And lineally deriv`d from Angels race.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And as much as the one governe the Body, so much the other do the Minde. Wherein is to be considered, that some
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30084:12"/>
are of opinion, how at the instant of a childs conception, or rather more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually at the instant of his Birth, the conceived sperme or tender Body doth receive such influence of the Heavens as then raigne over that place, where the conception or birth is made: And all the Starres or virtuall places of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall Orbes participating the qualities of the seven Planets (according to which they are distributed into so many Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or the compounds of them) it comes to passe, that according to the varietie of the severall Aspects of the one and of the other, there are various inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and qualities in mens bodies, but all reduced to seven generall heads and the compounds of them, which being to be varied innumerable wayes, cause as many different effects, yet the influence of some one Planet continually predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating. But when the matter in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans wombe is capable of a soul to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, then God sendeth one from Heaven into it.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:30084:13"/>
               <l>— Eternall God,</l>
               <l>In Paradise whilome did plant this Flower,</l>
               <l>Whence he it fetcht out of her native place,</l>
               <l>And did in Stock of earthly flesh inrace.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And this opinion the Author more plainly expresses himself to be of, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work, where he saith:
<q>
                  <l>There she beholds with high aspiring thought</l>
                  <l>The cradle of her own Creation;</l>
                  <l>Emongst the seats of Angels heavenly wrought.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which whether it have been created ever since the beginning of the world, and reserv'd in some fit place till due time, or be created on emergent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; no man can tell: but certain it is, that it is immortall, according to what I said before, when I spake of the Circle which hath no ending, and an uncertain beginning. The messengers to conveigh which soul into the bodie, are the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30084:13"/>
which move the Orbes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who according to their severall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures communicate to it severall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties: and they most, who are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of those Starres at that instant, who have the superioritie in the plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary aspects. Whereby it comes to passe, that in all inclinations there's much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie betweene the Soul and the Body, being that the like is betweene the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences and the Starres, both which communicate their vertues to each of them. And these Angels, being, as I said before, of nine severall Hierarchies, there are so many principle differences in humane souls, which participate most of their proprieties, which whom in their descent they made the longest stay, and that had most active power to work on them, and accompanied them with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Genius</hi> (which is according to their severall Governments) like the same kind of water that running through various conduits wherein severall aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matike and odoriferous things are laid,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30084:14"/>
do acquire severall kinds of tastes and smels. For it is supposed, that in their first Creation, all Souls are alike, and that their differing proprieties arive to them afterwards when they passe through the spheres of the governing Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So that by such their influence, it may truly be said, that
<q>
                  <l>Nine was the Circle set in Heavens place.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which verse, by assigning this office to the nine, and the proper place to the Circle, gives much light to what is said before. And for a further confirmation that this is the Authors opinion, read attentively the sixt <hi>Canto</hi> of the 3. Book, where most learnedly and at large he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the <hi>Tenets</hi> of this Philosophie; and for that. I commend to you to take par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of the 2d. and thirty two <hi>Stanzaes</hi>: as also the last of his <hi>Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamion</hi>: and survaying his works, you shall finde him a constant disciple of <hi>Platoes</hi> School.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:30084:14"/>
               <l>All which compacted, made a goodly Diapase.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In Nature there is not to be found a more compleat and more exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of all parts, then that which is betweene the compaction and conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Body and Soul of Man: Both which although they consist of many and most different faculties and parts, yet when they keepe due time with one another, they altogether make the most perfect Harmony that can be imagined. And as the nature of sounds, that consist of friendly consonancies and accords, is to mingle themselves with one another, and to slide into the eare with much sweetnesse, where by their unity they last a long time and delight it: where as contrarily, discords continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally jarre, and fight together, and will not mingle with one another: but all of them striving to have the victory, their reluctation and disorder gives a speedie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30084:15"/>
end to their sounds, which strike the Eare in a harsh and offensive manner, and there die in the very beginning of their Conflict: In like manner, when a mans Actions are regular, and directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, they become like the lines of a Circle, which all meet in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then his musick is most excellent and compleat, and all together are the Authors of that blessed harmony which maketh him happie in the glorious visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods perfections, wherein the minde is filled with high knowledges and most pleasing contemplations; and the senses, as it were, drowned in eternall delight; and nothing can interrupt this Joy, this Happinesse, which is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Diapase: Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if a mans actions be disorderly, and consisting of discords, (which is, when the sensitive part rebels and wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles with the Rationall, striving to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it) then this musick is spoiled, and instead of eternall life, pleasure and joy, it causeth perpetuall death, horrour,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30084:15"/>
paine, and misery. Which infortunate estate the Poet describes elsewhere; as in the conclusion of this Staffe he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates: the other happy one, which is the never-failing Reward of such an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent bodie, and ethereall and vertuous minde, as he makes to be the feat of the bright Virgin <hi>Alma,</hi> mans worthiest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, <hi>Reason. Her</hi> I feele to speake within me, and chide me for my bold Attempt, warning me to stray no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For what I have said (considering how weakly it is said) your Command is all the excuse that I can pretend. But since my desire to obey that, may bee seene as well in a few lines, as in a large Discourse, it were indiscretion in me to trouble you with more, or to discover to you more of my Ignorance. I will onely begge pardon of you for this blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and interlined paper, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are so meane that it cannot deserve the paines of a Transcription, which if you make difficulty to grant to it, for my sake, let it obtain it for having been yours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:30084:16"/>And now I return to you also the Book that contains my Text, which ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday you sent me, to fit this part of it with a Comment, which peradventure I might have performed better, if either I had afforded my selfe more time, or had had the conveniencie of some other books apt to quicken my Invention, to whom I might have been beholding for enlarging my understanding in some things that are treated here, although the Application should still have been my own: With these helps perhaps I might have dived further into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Intention (the depth of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sounded by any that is lesse learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then he was) But I perswade my self very strongly, that in what I have said there's nothing contradictory to it, and that an intelligent and well learned man proceeding on my grounds might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a worthie and true Commentarie on this Theme: Upon which I wonder how I stambled, considering how many learned men have failed in the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

of it, and have all at the first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, approved my opinion.</p>
            <p>But it was Fortune that made me fall upon it, when first this <hi>Stanza</hi> was read to me for an indissoluble Riddle.
