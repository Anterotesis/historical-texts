         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I may well doubt how this my
firſt labour ſhall be accepted of, or gaine credit
with thee and I did long hang in ſuspence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſhould as an abortiſe, burie it, or as a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
cheriſh it. The firſt ſure had beſt pleaſèd
me, if therein I ſhould not haue diſpleaſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and bene commanded by the power they haue ouer me, and
perſwaded by their learned reaſons, not onely to nouriſh it, but
to bring it vp to full growth and ſtrength: aſſuring me, there
would be as much pleaſure, and profit taken therein in publicke,
as I had taken paines therewith in priuate. And although I
had at the beginning, great reaſons to diſſwade me from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
(as a matter ouer-difficult, the ſame hauing bene attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
by two or three, and periſhed, with one, in the bud, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in the bloſſome, and with the third, being no ſooner ripe,
but foorthwith it was rotten.) Neuertheleſſe, I was ſtill, vnder
this aſſurance, prouoked to go forward, and did euery day, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more force, and in the end, by the warmth and heate, of a
fauourable ſunne, brought it to the best perfection I could, and
the change of the ſoile would giue me leaue. In which estate I do
freely offer it vnto thee: deſiring thee, not ſiniſterly to interpret,
if there be any thing not agreeing to thy minde, but friendly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
that thou ſhalt find amiſſe. And before thou do pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
full ſentence againſt me, I beſeech thee with a ſound iudgement to
enter into conſideration of the ſence, and ſubſtance of the author,
and not of euery particular word: (albeit euen therein likewiſe
(as neare as the matter would giue me leaue) I haue ſought to
ſatisfie thee.</p>
            <p>Touching the ſubstance of the booke, it contàineth matter of
pollicie, and eſpecially concerneth the eſtabliſhment of Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
It is deuided into ſixe ſeuerall bookes, in the foure former, he
<pb facs="tcp:9028:5"/>
ſheweth what the Prince ſhould be, what vertues he is eſpecially
to be endued withall, how he ſhould make choiſe of good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers,
and officers: and to be ſhort, after what ſort he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue,
and eſtabliſh him ſelfe in time of peace.</p>
            <p>The fifth booke ſetteth downe, in what maner he ſhould begin,
vndertake, and execute, foraine warre: how the ſame ſhould be
finiſhed, and peace eſtabliſhed thereby, which is the true ende of
warre. A worke ſo neceſſarie for Captains, and thoſe that ſerue
their prince in the field, that in many things it ſurpaſſeth all thoſe
diſcourſes of warre, I could yet come to the ſight of. In the ſixth
booke, he treateth of ciuill warre.</p>
            <p>Concerning the order I haue kept in this worke, I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all diſſented from the Author (though at the firſt blush
the contrarie may appeare.) For whereas he hath distinguiſhed
the ſentences, and it may ſeeme I haue not: yet are they (in my
opinion) as well ſeuered by this marke *, as if they were farther
diſtant the one from the other.</p>
            <p>Another thing (I feare) will be obiected againſt me, that I
haue not rightly pointed my diſtinctions. Whereunto I anſwer,
that if you looke into the Author, you ſhall find his meaning, and
my distinctions to agree. For albeit he hath ſet a <hi>periodes</hi> (.) in
the end of many ſentences, yet doth not the full ſence end there, but
ſtill hang, and continue, as <hi>Lipſius</hi> him ſelfe confeſſeth in theſe
words: <hi>Nec enim sinis ſemper ſententiae in fine clauſulae, ſed
pendet ea ſemper, &amp; haeret.</hi> I haue followed theſe vſuall points:
(,) : (.)</p>
            <p>And whereas I was perſwaded by ſome, to leaue out the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of the ſeuerall Authors, and the notes of the margent; I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
not to their perſwaſion for two reſpects. The one, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it might be thought, I had bene a corrupt, and faithleſſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator,
and that I durſt not ſet my worke to the touch. The other,
that the ſaid marginall notes, do giue great light to the worke, &amp;
ſerue to explaine many matters therein: beſides they haue this
ſingularitie in them (which I haue not ſeene in any other) that
they do entertaine one another, as if they were a continued ſpeech:
which if you reade them by them ſelues, you ſhall ſoone finde out.
Moreouer, if any be pleaſed to confer, ſome one ſentence of mine,
<pb facs="tcp:9028:5"/>
or more, with the originall, by the quotacion of the Authors, the
ſame may be more eaſily found, and he the better ſatisfied, of my
paines, and diligence in this labour, or what fault I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therein.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whereas I haue ſometimes changed the tenſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
the perſon: I ſay, the diſcourſe could not elſe be well
knit together: and herein I haue eſpecially in the whole worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
the pluralitie of Gods (which all Chriſtians deteſt) and
the Author could not but mention, his ſentences being taken alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from prophane writers. And as concerning ſome thing left
out in the third Chapter of the ſecond Booke, it was a thing done
of ſet purpoſe; for ſome important cauſe, which I meane not here
to vtter.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue (gentle Reader) giuen thee ſome taſte of this
notable diſcourſe; which I deſire may be well diſgeſted by thee,
the which I do leaue to thy fauourable peruſing: yet before thou
enter any further therein, I pray thee with thy pen to correct thoſe
faults, which haue paſſed the preſſe, which by reaſon of my dayly
attendance at my Lords are grown to a greater number, then
either my deſire or the Printers was they ſhould. And
ſo I wiſh thee many happie, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
yeares.</p>

concerning maners, or ſciences, deſerueth praiſe, and there is good vſe
thereof: and is it not a matter of more worth to do the like in a kingdom,
&amp; Ciuill gouernement? when as by that, ſome one citizen only, is made
better, and more learned: by this, in one, all others. Surely it is euen ſo.
We that are commanded, are linked together as it were with a ſtraight
chaine, with him that commandeth. And as the mind in mans bodie,
cannot either be whole, or diſeaſed, but the functions thereof in like
maner, are either vigorous, or do languiſh: euen ſo is the Prince, in this

ſocietie. Doth he leade vs the way to vertue? we followe. To vice? we
encline thither. Liueth he an honeſt, and bleſſed life? we flouriſh. Is he
vnfortunate? we decline, or runne to ruine with him. And as the light
or darkneſſe in this world below proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunne: ſo the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of good or euill in the ſubiects, is deriued from the prince. <hi>Ceſar</hi>

               </gap> to deſerue well of our
Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, we ought to guide, and direct him, to this marke of the
common profit. For (be not ye (ô princes) led away with error) this is
your end. You haue preheminence ouer men, but it is for the benefite
of men: neither are you onely, Lords, and Iudges of matters, but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones,
and ſtewards.</p>
            <p>They are euill, and wicked Princes, who in a kingdome, thinke vpon
nothing elſe, but the commandement they haue, being arrogant, and
idle, and who do imagine, they are not giuen to their ſubiects, but their
ſubiects to them. For like as the ſtarres receiue light, yet for the vſe of
mortal men: ſo do you your dignities, but yet tied to a charge &amp; office.
The Common-wealth by God, and men, is deliuered into your boſome:
yea it is in deed laide in your boſome, but to th'end it may be cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
O rightly is that Prince iuſt, &amp; lawful, who in his greateſt felicitie,
had not rather heare men ſay, that he is mightie, then that he is good:
and who knoweth, how to conioyne two moſt diuerſe things, <hi>Modeſtie,</hi>
and <hi>Prudence</hi> together. Who when he walketh abroad, men do ſtriue to
behold, as it were ſome fauourable, and beneficiall godhead: and being
indifferent betweene loue, and aw, and changing oft their iudgements,
do doubt, whether they ſhould ſalute him as their Lord, or as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Theſe are thoſe worthie things (ô Princes) which bring ſafetie, to
the which both thoſe of former age, &amp; my ſelfe do call you. Giue vs the
hearing. Neither do you for this reaſon deſpiſe our counſels, becauſe
you are aboue our commandements. For as it is a moſt happie thing in
a prince, not to be compelled. So is it a miſerable thing in him, not to
be perſwaded. I confeſſe, ye haue thoſe about you, that do dayly yeeld
you, plentie of their counſell: but would to God they gaue alwayes
faithfull and good counſell. Alphonſus that worthie amongſt kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked, who were the beſt Counſellers? anſwered the dead; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thereby good authors, and ſuch other monuments, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flattering at all, nor keeping any thing ſecret, do lay open the pure
and ſimple troth. The which that it may ſticke faſt in your memories: &amp;
that you may either knowe by my meanes, or acknowledge with me,
thoſe things that are of beſt worth, I do from the bottome of my heart
pray vnto thee, who art the eternall veriue. Fare ye well.</p>

               <p>Now all warres are vnlawfull, which are grounded vpon

               <p>Concerning the firſt point this is my opinon, that two

(which will growe to an infinite ſumme in the dayly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement

               <p>Concerning which matters,<note place="margin">Neyther like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in peace ought they to be together in one place.</note> there is this caution, that they
be neither too many in multitude, nor alwayes together in
