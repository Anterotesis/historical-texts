            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the mean time the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> who was commanded with the reſt to ſeek his fortune, was by chance purſued by ſome Souldiers, but meeting with a Countrey fellow formerly a Souldier in the Old Kings Army, he was by him ſecured, though ſomewhat ſtrangely, for he carries him into a Malt-houſe belonging to Mrs. <hi>Jane Lane,</hi> and having no othet convenient place to hide him in, clapt him under the Kilne, though there were then ſome fire in it, and the Malt ſo oaking on the top. In the mean time, the Souldiers then in purſuit of him, entred the houſe, and having made about three quarters of an hours ſearch every where elſe, but not at all ſuſpecting the Kilne, where they ſaw the fire burning, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> was taken out of the Kilne almoſt ready to faint with the extremity of the heat. The Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow having thus ſecured this Lord, acquaints Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> with what he had done, and ſhe extteamly glad of it, gets him to her houſe, wherhin conference ſhe enquires of the Kings ſafety. The Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> gives her the former relation of his great miſeries &amp; Diſtreſs, which forces tears from the tender-hearted Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe earneſtly intreats him to take ſome courſe for the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his Majeſty, and conducting him to her houſe, ſhe being reſolved to venture het life, had ſhe ten thouſand, for the

In this Journy there hapned many accidents worthy commemoration: and fi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next &amp; moſt important accident of all was, tha coming to a town where they were to paſs through, there was a Troop of horſ there to be quartered drawn up, which cauſed ſome fear, but at length with reſolution they paſſed on, and the Captain taking them for honeſt travellers, made h<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Troop open to the right and left, and ſo permitted them to paſs. Another accident there happened, which one may ſay was almoſt comical in this Tragedy, Ms. <hi>Lane</hi> coming into the Inne, leaves his Majeſty under the name of <hi>Willi.</hi> her ſervant in the Kitchin, with whom the maid enters into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhe asks him where he was born, and what trade he was, he anſwers at <hi>Brumingham,</hi> and a Naylors ſon, and after a great deal of other diſcourſe, the Jack being down, the maid deſires him to wind it up, which he willingly undertakes, but goes the wrong way about it, and prejudices it; at which the maid grew angry asking him where he wat bred and telling him he was the ve<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yeſt clowniſh booby that ever ſhe ſaw in all her life; which railing of hers made his Majeſty, notwithſtanding his preſent miſery, go out of the Room ſmiling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48610:4"/>
Mrs. <hi>Lane</hi> notwithſtanding his Majeſty went as her ſervant, yet had a greater reſpect for him before others, pretended him her Tenant's ſon; but on the Road ſhe would alwayes ask what he would have to dinner or ſupper, and what piece of that he liked, which ſhe would alwayes be ſure to get made ready, and give him, he ſtill ſitting at the lower end of the table.</p>
            <p>But ro come to the end of their journey, being arrived at <hi>Briſtol</hi> they lodged at the houſe of a Noble gentleman there, and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to Mr. <hi>Laſtles:</hi> the King finding it to be a houſe of great reſort, feins himſelf ſick of an Ague, and ſo keeps his Chamber all the day, coming down only at nights; but one night coming down and being ſomewhat cold craves a glaſſe of Wine of the Butler, who carries him into the Butlery; this Butler having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerved his Majeſties Father in the Wars, looking earneſtly upon him, ſuſpected him to be the King, ſo eaſily will Majeſty appear though ve l'd in the utmoſt diſguiſes, and thereupon pulling off his hat, told him very ceremoniouſly. That he might command what Wine he pleaſed; of which the King took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but drinking off his Wine went out; yet the Butler could not ſatisfie his ſuſpicion, but went up to Mr. <hi>Laſtels,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him how long he had had that ſervant, whreupon Mr. <hi>Laſtels</hi> was very angry at his boldneſs, in daring to ask him ſuch a queſtion, but the Butler ſtill perſiſted, and whiſpering told him that he believed it was the King, whereupon Mr. <hi>Laſtels</hi> ſeeing he was diſcovered, ſends immediatly for his Majeſty, whom he acquaints with the Butlets diſcovery of him with whom the King was ſomewhat angry, in regard he did not firſt acquaint himſelf with his ſupition, it not being impoſſible, but that <hi>Mr. Laſtels</hi> might not have know him to be the King; but upon pardon asked by the Butler, it was granted by the King, and he afterwards proved very inſtrumental in his <hi>Majeſties</hi> convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance through the Countrey.</p>
            <p>But here at <hi>Briſtol</hi> the chief deſign they had in hand failed them; for though there were a little Barque lay there, judged moſt convenient for the buſineſs, yet the Maſter would for no reward tranſport a ſingle perſon, though he was ſo honeſt as only to deny it and made no further ſearch or inquiry concerning the perſon, which might perhaps have tended to a diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48610:4"/>
This deſign here failing, his Majeſty deſired to be brought ſome miles Weſtward to the houſe of a worthy Gentlen an whom he knew to be a truſty friend, where coming he finds the gentleman in the field with his ſervants, having diſcovered himſelf to him, he was by him con<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
