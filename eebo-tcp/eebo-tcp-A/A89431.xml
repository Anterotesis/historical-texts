            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſt Article was this:</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> contrary to his Engagement to the Councel of State, and Councels of States Declarations upon the Petitioners Exceptions, procured lately ſuch in the County of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> to be Iuſtices of the Peace, Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for Sequestrations, Commiſſioners for the Miniſtry, and Commiſſioners for the Militia there as were known Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and ſuch as are diſaffected to the preſent Government, and complying with the Scotiſh Intereſt, as by the Charge againſt them hereunto annexed, and another Charge againſt them, formerly exhibited to the Councel of State, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Charge in this Article you ſee is declared falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous by the Councel of State, which is ſufficient to ſtop the mouth of that calumny therein vented againſt Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic. 2.</hi> That the ſaid Sir <hi>Ar.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117873:6"/>
as were well-affected, without any Charge removed from their Ministry, and put them out of their places, whereby he diſcovers his diſ-affection to the preſent Government, by up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and countenancing the Malignant party in Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and keeping under the Parliaments friends, all which this Petitioner is able to prove, and further refers himſelf to the Copies of Letters hereunto annexed, the Originals being in the Petitioners hands.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Firſt, Sir <hi>A.

            <p>Secondly, Sir <hi>A.</hi> verily believes that there was never any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter approved that publiquely refuſed to take the Engagement; and he is very confident, that there was not any Miniſter againſt whom proof was made of his Delinquency or ſcandal, but was put out.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He doth not know of any one well-affected perſon that was put out of his living, except ſcandalous, ignorant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient; as for the Copies of the Letters, Sir <hi>A.

            </q>
            <p>The Councel hath declared this alſo to be falſe and ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and concerning Sir <hi>A.

            <p>Firſt, That he had ſigned Warrants with his own Hand and Seal, with Sir <hi>William Carnaby,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho: Riddal,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho: Liddal,</hi> for carrying Arms and Ammunition which came out of <hi>Holland</hi> into <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and were ſent unto the late King after he had ſet up his Standard, which were uſed againſt the Parliaments Forces at <hi>Edghil</hi> Battel, two of which Warrants were produced.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, That he compelled his ſervant <hi>Thomas Chilton</hi> to ſerve in Col. <hi>Hiltons</hi> Regiment againſt the Parliament, which Regiment being broken by the Parliament Forces at <hi>Marston Moor,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Chilton</hi> returned to his ſaid Maſter <hi>George Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns</hi> Houſe.</p>

his firſt march into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was digracefully and justly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiered, by the now Lord General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for plundering, and other groſs and foul Miſdemeanors; and one <hi>Thomas Dalaval,</hi> an arch Malignant, and diſaffected to the preſent Government, who lived in the Enemies quarters all the time the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> had his Forces.</p>

            <p>It is well if thoſe that were diſplaced appear well-affected to the Publick, and faithful to their Truſt; ſurely that was no cauſe of their ejection: if unfaithfulneſs was not their ſin, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be their ſorrow: as for Col. <hi>Wren,</hi> he hath ever been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Parliament, and in Arms for them from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and did aſcend unto his Colonelſhip by degrees; and when his Regiment went into <hi>Scotland</hi> after <hi>Hamiltons</hi> defeat, ſo ſoon as they came into <hi>Scotland,</hi> they did conceive they might have plundered in <hi>Scotland</hi> as the <hi>Scots</hi> had done in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> immediately before, as ſuppoſing themſelves legal Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners (and that without Commiſſion) of the Law of Taliation, and that they might act the <hi>Scotch-men</hi> in their own Countries, and thereupon they were very unruly; the Lord General being very much offended thereat, deſired the Colonel to return back into his Country, but he was not caſhiered, as is here falſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. As for Mr <hi>Haſlerig,</hi> he hath a very good Eſtate in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and is very well known to be an able and well-affected man, and very fit for the employment, and ſo is Mr <hi>Tho: Dalaval,</hi> and Sir <hi>A.</hi> beleeves <hi>Muſgrave</hi> can never prove him an arch Malignant, onely his work is to ſlander, and he loves to be doing.</p>

                     <hi>SIR,</hi> About the 15 day of <hi>October,</hi> Mr <hi>Clement Skelton</hi> brought in an Order from the Commiſsioners for Compounding to the Commiſsioners for Sequeſtrations in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> to examine the validity of a Deed produced to them, touching the clearing of <hi>Andrew Huddleſton's</hi> Eſtate, a Papiſt in Arms, worth 120 l. <hi>per annum:</hi> The ſaid Mr <hi>Skelton,</hi> bringing the ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before us, and the ſaid Deed, was demanded, wherefore he did not ſeek his Intereſt in that Eſtate before that time, the ſame being under Sequeſtration for four or five years: The ſaid Mr <hi>Skelton</hi> replyed, He could never get a man for his purpoſe, until he met with Mr <hi>John Muſgrave:</hi> and being asked, How the ſaid Order was got, He anſwered, Mr <hi>Muſgrave</hi> knew better then himſelf; whereupon Mr <hi>Muſgrave</hi> was called, and at his coming in, ſaid, 'Tis true, he had 10 <hi>l.</hi> to ſollicite that buſineſs: It being replyed, He was not ſent for to know what he had for ſo doing, but what the Commiſsioners for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding ſaid to the matter in diſpute, and what he thought of it himſelf; To the firſt he anſwered, That Mr <hi>Winſlow</hi> did engage to ſend the ſaid Order; and that he conceived, if we could not prove the ſaid <hi>Skelton</hi> to have made away the Eſtate to the ſaid <hi>Huddleston,</hi> the Deed was valid, and ſo it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove us to certifie: whereupon he withdrew. The ſaid Mr <hi>Skelton</hi> being further asked, When he had the aforeſaid Eſtate in poſſeſsion, and what Rent he had received of the ſaid Mr <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> He thereupon was ſilent; whereupon we told the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117873:15"/>
ſaid Mr <hi>Skelton,</hi> That if any man went about to conceal a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents Eſtate, that ſame Act made him liable to Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and further, we produced before him the late Committee Book, wherein it did appear the ſaid Mr <hi>Skelton</hi> had farmed the ſaid Eſtate of the late Committee, in the year 1647, and payd the Rent due for the ſame, without claiming any Intereſt therein: whereupon the ſaid Mr <hi>Skelton</hi> withdrew, and never ſince appeared to claim any Title therein: But ſince, the ſaid Mr <hi>Andrew Huddleston,</hi> paying in his Rent due for the ſame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that he had given to Mr <hi>John Muſgrave</hi> himſelf 10 <hi>l.</hi> and ſent him up to <hi>London 5 l.</hi> more: and about the day afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, Mr <hi>Muſgrave</hi> being asked, Why he would take 10 <hi>l.</hi> for ſolliciting a buſineſs of that nature againſt the State and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, at the very time when he was Commiſsioner for Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations for the State, contrary to his Truſt and Oath, which he either had, or ſhould have taken; He replyed, He was a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor, as well as a Commiſsioner, and would not forego his Solliciting for being a Commiſsioner.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, That about the 27 of <hi>April,</hi> 1650. the ſaid Deed was produced before Mr <hi>Craiſter, Tho: Langhorn,</hi> and Mr <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> then Commiſsioners for Sequeſtration: The ſaid Commiſsioners returned the Deed with this Anſwer, That it was to be cleared above; whereupon the ſaid Mr <hi>Muſgrave</hi> by his expreſsions ſeemed to undertake that buſineſs, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he did; and alſo at that time ſpoke in other Delinquents behalf ſo much, as gave occaſion to his Fellow-Commiſsioners to have ſome Jealouſies of his actings; and preſently after the ſaid <hi>Tho: Langhorn</hi> ſaw the ſaid Mr <hi>Muſgrave</hi> receive a ſum of Mony from the ſaid Mr <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> and the ſaid Mr <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> went preſently after to <hi>London,</hi> and ſtayd there above three moneths, which cauſed Mr <hi>Craiſter</hi> and <hi>Tho: Langhorn</hi> to deſire the Commiſsioners for compounding, either to joyn with them ſuch as would act faithfully and fully for the Publick, or elſe excuſe them from the ſervice, the affairs of Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſpeedily requiring diligence and action; upon which deſire of theirs the ſaid <hi>Muſgrave</hi> was outed, and others put in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117873:15"/>
the ſaid Mr <hi>Skeltons</hi> Order was examined: but Mr <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> took his diſcharge ſo ill, that he did vehemently threaten that the ſaid <hi>Tho: Langhorn,</hi> and others, ſhould have <hi>Lex Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionis;</hi> and further, that Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerig,</hi> to ſtop his mouth, had made him a Commiſſioner, but now being outed, his mouth was open: To which one replyed, <hi>It ſeems a great place will ſtop your mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo at that time he was outed of being Steward of the honor of <hi>Penrith:</hi> and the ſaid Mr <hi>Muſgrave</hi> being poor, his Eſtate not being poſſible to be made worſe, we do verily beleeve put him upon printing his Book: notwithſtanding, we deſire to forgive him, and the Lord to give him Repentance, which is all we can offer to you at this time: The truth of what is ſaid ſhall be ſufficiently by our ſelves and others proved.

                     <hi>SIR,</hi> This evening I received a Letter from <hi>Captain Place,</hi> wherein he intimates, that he is commanded to bring two of his Soldiers before you to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> upon my Father in Law Mr <hi>Vaux</hi> his complaint, that they took him forth of his bed, and carryed him a mile in his ſhirt, and that they took and detained a Horſe of his worth 10 <hi>l.</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> was deſirous that I ſhould come along with them to give account of the thing, ſo far as I knew, and the ſame related to my Mother and me, which very willingly I would have done, if I had not been conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Audite to morrow, by appointment from Mr <hi>Pollard,</hi> the States Receiver, I (being the <hi>States</hi> Steward for the Honor of <hi>Penrith</hi>) might neglect that Service, but to morrow night I ſhall be, God willing, with my Brother <hi>Graham</hi> at <hi>Newbygin,</hi> and the next day at <hi>Newlathes,</hi> to hold the Leet for my ancient Friend <hi>Captain Sikes,</hi> Purchaſer of the Manor of <hi>John De Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,</hi> whither if you ſend, upon notice I will wait on you, ſo be I may, according to Law, be free from Arreſts, which in that <hi>Corporation</hi> may cauſleſs be layd upon me for vexation, as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117873:17"/>
often heretofore hath been done, I ſpeak not this that I know or fear any juſt cauſe, for I never concealed my ſelf, and ſhall be ready to appear <hi>gratis</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to any action: in the mean time take a ſhort account of what I know there concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I doubt not but you have heard of the difference betwixt me and Mr <hi>Vaux,</hi> and him and my Mother, and how, while the late Kings party was Maſter of this County, wickedly he uſed her, and endevored to have ſtarved her; for the Committee of this County ordered her 30 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> till ſhe could obtain relief in a legal way, which Order he never obſerved, not to ſpeak of his wilful contemning the preſent Authority, refuſing to anſwer any Proces, or obey any Order therein, for which, at my Suit ſome fourteen days ſince, he was proclaimed by the Sheriff, and upon an Order under ſeal out of the High Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> for 20 <hi>l.</hi> 250 <hi>l.</hi> Arrearages, and fourty pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> upon an Attachment by a ſpecial Warrant from the Sheriff of this County, to me and <hi>Thomas Graves</hi> and others directed, he was arreſted: The maner was thus, before any Souldier was quartered with my Mother, we went to <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow,</hi> and his chamber door being open, and he in bed, we peaceably entered, and deſired him to riſe, which he refuſed to do; then I told him, he was a Priſoner; whoſe Priſoner (quoth he?) I ſaid, my priſoner, wiſhing him to riſe and put on his clothes; I ſhewed him the Warrant under ſeal, and read it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but he ſaid, It was a counterfeit Warrant, and he would not obey it, and if we had him, we ſhould take him naked; ſo finding him obſtinate, we took him out of his bed, and brought him into the Hall, and ſet him in a chair, wiſhing him to put on his dublet, which <hi>Thomas Grave</hi> brought out of the chamber, but he would not, fearfully curſing me, and my Mother: I offered to fetch his breeches, but he cryed out, I went to rob him; ſo I forbare, wiſhing his man there preſent to fetch his clothes, but he commanded the contrary: I offered him, if he would give ſecurity to appear and anſwer the Court, I would accept it; or if he would go to Mr <hi>Sanderſons,</hi> or any other Friend, I would carry him thither, deſiring him ſtill to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117873:18"/>
put on his clothes, which after long refuſal, fearing his Tenants coming in to reſcue him, as ſometimes they had done, we <hi>HOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED HIM,</hi> and caſt a cloke about him even <hi>per</hi> force, and carryed him to <hi>Laths,</hi> not half a mile from his own houſe, where he was taken, and with much entreaty got him to go to bed, he ſtill refuſing to put on clothes, which the good-wife of the houſe brought him; and after <hi>Henry Dacre</hi> came to him, and brought his clothes, he cauſed them to be ſent away: I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Dacres</hi> to accept bond for his appearance without going further, but <hi>Dacres</hi> went to the Underſheriff and brought a diſcharge, a copy whereof I ſend you. That night late I went to <hi>Catterben</hi> to ſee how things were with my Mother, where I found theſe two Soldiers quartered, as they ſaid, by Orders; they were much diſcontented with Dyet and Lodging, wanting indeed all fit accommodation, having neither fire, victuals, or bedding for them; ſome words paſſed betwixt them and me: I told them, my Mother was a forſaken woman, had nothing but that great empty houſe, her Husband not allowing her common neceſſaries, and contempting all Orders made for her, deſired them to go to him, and quarter there, or cauſe him to bring in proviſion, and ſhe would make it ready, and if that would not ſerve, they muſt bring it with them, for they could not have it where it was not: That night they layd upon hay with ſuch coverings as ſhe had, diſ-furniſhing her ſelf, and ſup'd with Big-pottage, Fare coarſe enough. The next day I ſhewed them Mr <hi>Vaux</hi> his man in the field, but he would not come neer us, though none intended him harm; the Souldiers finding the man ſo refractory, horſed after him, and a while after brought the Horſe, dear of ſix pounds, being lame, into the Courting, which my Mother took from the Souldiers, and which ſhe ſent away to be ſold without the privity or conſent of the Soldiers: what ſhe hath done, ſhe will maintain and juſtifie, and when that mony is ſpent, as moſt of it be, ſhe muſt fetch more from him; for four years ſhe had not any thing from him, whereby ſhe contracted great debts, and if God had not enabled me to travel for her, he had ſtarved her long ere
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117873:18"/>
this; perhaps ere long you may have a larger view of all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in print. Yeſterday after I came from keeping the Leet at <hi>Feverham</hi> for the <hi>State,</hi> I finde two Soldiers more quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my Mother; this morning I ſent to the Conſtables who layd them upon her, wiſhing them either to provide for them, or take them away; but they ſaid they durſt not do any thing without Mr <hi>Vaux</hi> conſent: Mr <hi>Vaux</hi> hath complained to a Councel of War at <hi>Penrith,</hi> but they finde no cauſe to interpoſe amongſt us in theſe civil differences: This day I acquainted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Rippon</hi> with my Mothers burthens and condition, and he took off that charge for the preſent, as by the encloſed you may perceive. I deſire you for the future that my Mother may not be troubled with billeting any Souldiers, till there be a ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt her and her husband, for avoyding the like diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances as theſe: I have been larger, then I intended, but you have nothing but truth; for Mr <hi>Vaux</hi> his uncivilities to us are not worthy mentioning. I take leave and reſt,</p>

            <p>Judg again Reader, didſt thou ever ſee ſuch Tyranny upon the dunghil in all thy life before? What (think'ſt thou) would it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance unto, was it upon the Throne? Look back upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, tell the aggravations thereof: A poor old man of ſeventy years of age, in time of peace, having his chamber door broken open, taken out of his bed, in the Winter ſeaſon, in the North of <hi>England,</hi> put naked upon a horſe, for neither felony nor Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by his wives own ſon (this <hi>Muſgrave</hi>) and ſo carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards this wretched mans houſe, and compel'd (for fear the old man ſhould dye, or rather of the reward of a murtherer) to haſten him into a Milners houſe by the way, and put him into bed, hardly able to keep life in him, and all for ſo ſmall a matter as is here ſpecified: Would not a man think that the great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentor of mankind was mew'd up in this <hi>Muſgrave,</hi> and that a few more of ſuch <hi>Muſgraves</hi> would render thoſe places where they were, as if Hell was broke looſe, and the Inhabitants thereof had dwelt therein?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:117873:19"/>I ſhall forbear any further digging in his own dunghil; for the truth is, I loath the work, and it ſhall be pure neceſſity that ſhall re-compel my pains of this nature, if ever I attempt it the ſecond time: no more now but only this; he pretends himſelf the grand Advocate for the godly Miniſters in the Northern Counties; if you may judg of his Clergy Clients by one or two of them, whoſe cauſe he ſolicited very lately before the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Plunder'd Miniſters, you may quickly gheſs what Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters they are: and for thy ſatisfaction herein, read the Orders of the ſaid Committee after full hearing of both of their Cauſes.</p>
