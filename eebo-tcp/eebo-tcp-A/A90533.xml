         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CASE
OF
Mr. Hugh Peters,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>THey which think to Vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the World by writing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
rarely reach their ends, becauſe
their Game is an After-game: preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
is ſtrong, and the Plaiſter can
hardly be made broad enough, nor Apologies put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all hands who have pre-judged and received the
firſt tincture. And therefore our bleſſed Saviour is
ſlow in that work; onely clears the great queſtion of
that age, by proving himſelf the Meſſiah, <hi>(Joh. 5.)</hi> by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168921:3"/>
four witneſſes, but not forward to anſwer expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the World otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And yet ſo much of his example there is; yea, ſo
much of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and others, that there ſeems to be
a neceſſity of ſaying ſomething, though hard to wipe
off ſo much dirt as is thrown on my ſelf. Yet at this
diſtance and leaſure, hearing by printed papers what
my Lot is in <hi>England,</hi> my native Country; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do in the Name and fear of God, and before
his holy Majeſty, Angels and Men, profeſs that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had head nor hand in contriving or managing
the late Kings death, as is baſely and ſcandalouſly
ſuggeſted by black mouths: was all that day (he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
ſick and ſad in my Chamber; which I prove by
two ſubſtantial witneſſes. And for what is in that
Pamphlet <hi>June 19.</hi> about my confeſſing in my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
landing at <hi>Plymouth</hi> from <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true
and miſtaken: for I never was ſick at <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
nor landed there from <hi>Ireland:</hi> nor any of that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
colourable; &amp; this I avouch in the truth of my
ſoul; and would in preſence juſtifie, if weakneſs, and
lameneſs, and this diſtance did not hinder; yea, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years being upon me, and an utter inability to do
my ſelf right in theſe things, if the Lord do not make
my way in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly give an account of my coming into
<hi>England,</hi> my behaviour ſince I came, and my preſent
condition in this Juncture.</p>
            <p>A Colony going to ſettle in <hi>New England,</hi> by his
late Majeſties Patent, I went thither; who by my
birth in <hi>Cornwel,</hi> was not a meer ſtranger to that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168921:3"/>
place, and fiſhing-trade: and thither, invited often, I
ſay, went, and was with another ſent into <hi>England</hi> by
the Magiſtrates there, for eaſe in Exciſe and Cuſtom,
and ſome ſupplies for Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe I had
been witneſs to the Indians receiving the Goſpel there
in Faith and Practiſe; they having the Bible tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by us into their Language, and part thereof prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and hundreds of them profeſſing the Goſpel, and
teaching each other the knowledge of the true God;
and the rather, from the example of the Engliſh there:
when in ſeven years among thouſands there dwelling,
I never ſaw any drunk, nor heard an Oath, nor any
begging, nor Sabbath broken: all which invited me
over to <hi>England:</hi> but coming, found the Nation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled
in troubles and War; the Preaching was,
<hi>Curſe ye Meroz,</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England;</hi> the beſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
going into the field: in which (not without ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging)
I was imbarqued in time; and by force upon
me here, failed of my promiſe of returning home:
which was and is my ſad affliction.</p>
            <p>My firſt work was, with the firſt to go for <hi>Ireland;</hi>
which I did with many hazards; then was at Sea
with my old Patron the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> to whom I
ow'd my life; then was imploy'd by the City; then
by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> my Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and others; and
my return ſtopt by the Power that was; and ſo was in
the laſt Army in ſeveral places, but never in the
North: In all which affairs I did labour to perſwade
the Army to their duty.</p>
            <p>My Principles in Religion guided me to thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
truths expreſt in the Confeſſions of Faith in
<hi>England;</hi> and am known to joyn with the Proteſtants
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168921:4"/>
who are ſound in the Faith, in <hi>Germany</hi> upper and
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ower, <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. I have and do hereby witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all Errours of all kinds. For the War, I
thought the Undertakers knew their Work; I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
yea, heartily ſorry for miſtakes about
me. For my Carriage, I challenge all the Kings
party to ſpeak if I were uncivil; nay, many of them
had my Purſe, Hand, Help every way, and are ready
to witneſs it; yea, his preſent Majeſties ſervants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by me through hazards. I was never privy to
the Armies tranſactions about the late King at <hi>Holm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
or elſewhere, or of any <hi>Juncto,</hi> Council or Cabal.
But when his Majeſty ſent for me, I went to him, with
whom I dealt about my <hi>New England</hi> buſineſs, &amp; was
three or four times with him, and had his ſpecial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
and ſerved him to my utmoſt, and uſed all
my little skill for his and the Nations good more
then twice: for which I have witneſs; though it be
hard to cut my way through ſo many Rocks. But
God is good.</p>
            <p>It is true, I was of a Party, when I acted zealouſly,
but not with malice or miſchief: it hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
honourable, <hi>Et Caeſare in hoſte probat,</hi> to keep
to principles of honour and honeſty. I never quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
others for their judgement in Conſcience. It
is received, that <hi>Religio docenda eſt, non coercenda.</hi> I
ſaw Reformation growing, Laws made, and ſome
againſt debauchery and evil (which I was glad to
read in his <hi>Majeſties</hi> late Proclamation.) I ſaw a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
learned, godly, able Miniſtry as any the world,
well provided for: I ſaw the Univerſities reformed,
and flouriſhing; and ſuch things much encouraged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168921:4"/>
me in my Endeavours. I ſtudyed the 13 of the <hi>Rom.</hi>
and was tender; but found the beſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>England</hi> of the Miniſtry engaged, and ſo ſatisfied me,
that I underſtand the firſt undertaking is ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
good. By the War, I never enriched my ſelf:
I have often offer'd my perſonal Eſtate for 200 <hi>l.</hi> and
for Lands, I never had any but that part of a Noble
mans, which <hi>I</hi> never laid up peny of; nor never ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> or others, to buy, nor knew not of
the ſale, till done; nor juſtifie any unworthy thing in
it. I never plundred nor cheated, never made
peny over the Sea, nor hoarded or hid any in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never was guilty of ſecluding the Members in 48.
nor knew it, till done, and ſent by my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>
to fetch off two of them, and to know who they were
that were ſecluded.</p>
            <p>I never had Jewels, nor any thing of Court or
State, more then before, directly nor indirectly. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any Eccleſiaſtical Promotion in my life in
the Nation to enrich me; but lived on my own when
I had any thing: nor have been a lover of money.</p>
            <p>The many ſcandals upon me for uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
abhor as vile and falſe, being kept from that and
thoſe aſperſions caſt; and ſuch I make my proteſt
againſt as before. I know how low my name runs,
how Titleleſs, how contemned. <hi>David</hi> knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why
<hi>Shemei</hi> curſt him</p>
            <p>For the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> I know no place hath
better: onely having lived where things are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
and cheap, I have ſhewed my folly ſo to ſay:
and having no evil intention, a very worthy Lawyer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168921:5"/>
took exception at ſomething of mine or my friends,
which was never intended in his ſenſe by either, and
crave his excuſe; I can charge my ſelf with evil e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as any excentrick motion of mine from my
own Calling, want of a ſolemn ſpirit in ſlight times,
with unbelief, if I have gone about to reach Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ends by trampling upon civil duties, breaking
of any Covenants, or ſlighting them; and do fear
Goſpel, and the Spirit alſo may be undervalued by
mine, and others unworthy dealing with them.
Much to theſe I might add, who have ſeen many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
under the Sun; and the World hung with
Nets and Snares: Alas, there is nothing to
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I underſtand what exception is upon
me for Life and Eſtate in the Houſe of Commons.
I have taken hold of the Kings Majeſties gracious
Pardon, as others did; and know not truly where
this exception lies grounded. I wiſh I had been
with their Honours to have clear'd it. I hope a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
report or Airy noiſe takes no place with them:
for I challenge all the World for my innocence for
theſe ſuggeſtions; and appeal to their Honours,
and the Noble Lords, for a review of the Charge or
Information; and crave no favour if any ſober man
can charge me; otherwiſe I moſt heartily beg juſt
favour, unleſs my evil be only for acting with ſuch a
party, I muſt have it: For I know before whom my
Cauſe is, and may not deſpair.</p>
            <p>I muſt again profeſs, were I not a Chriſtian, I am
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168921:5"/>
a Gentleman by birth, and from that extract do
ſcorn to engage in the vile things ſuggeſted, and that
by one creditleſs witneſs, that only ſuppoſeth, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
nothing.</p>
            <p>I wiſh from my heart that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Prince may be, and the Nation
by him more happy then any; and
that the true ends of GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT
may be had and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
fully; that every honeſt heart
may have cauſe to rejoyce in God, the
King, and their Laws. And for my
ſelf (through Grace) I reſolve to be
quiet in a corner (if I may) to let
God alone with ruling the World,
to whoſe Wiſdom and Power we
ought to ſubmit yea, to mind <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
