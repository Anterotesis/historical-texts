            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEeting with Mr. <hi>John Gadbury's Almanack,</hi> or Diary, for the
year 1682. Printed for the Company of <hi>Stationers</hi> (with more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Gain than Loyalty) I could not but take notice of his
ſcandalous Reflections, by them Printed, and by him, according to
the Old Papiſtical Method of Lying, thrown upon my ſelf: Of which I take not
ſo much regard under my private Circumſtances, as under that publick Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of being the King's Evidence againſt him the ſaid <hi>Gadbury,</hi> and ſeveral
of his Fellow-Conſpirators againſt the Life of His Majeſty, and the Peace of
the Kingdom; I ſay Conſpirators; for what I then ſwore, I am ready ſtill to
maintain and juſtifie. The Company of <hi>Stationers,</hi> when they ſaw Mr. <hi>Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
famous Lines, might have been ſo kind to have conſulted me, before
they Printed ſuch ſcandalous Aſperſions upon my Evidence, and the Diſcoveries
I made. But ſince they have made them publick, <hi>Gadbury</hi> ſhall not think to
wipe off ſo eaſily the Stains and Blurs of his deny'd Complyances with <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
by calling me <hi>Buffoon,</hi> and <hi>Scoundrel.</hi> But it is ſo natural for an <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
to Lie, that I am in very great hopes that the World will give no more
credit to him than is his due; which is in verity none at all. 'Tis a ſtrange
thing to me, that <hi>He</hi> who, when he was accuſed by my ſelf before the King
and Council, and was then asked this Queſtion by the King <hi>(viz.) If he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
his Stars, to know whether he ſhould be ſent to</hi> Newgate <hi>or to the</hi> Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
and could tell no more what Anſwer to make, than a Horſe: Or that
<hi>He</hi> who can tell not ſo much as a common Shepherd, when 'twill Rain, when
'twill Snow, when 'twill Hail; and has made ſuch a ſilly Conjecture of the preſent
Raging Storms, by crying, <hi>Somewhat Windy at the beginning,</hi> ſhould be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as to prognoſticate the Changes and Alterations of Supreme Councils, and
National Governments, and bring the Planets and Stars to vouch his paltry Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
upon the People. For this reaſon it was that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians,</hi>
(for by thoſe names the <hi>Fortune-tellers,</hi> and <hi>Scheme-Erectors</hi> of thoſe
Times, commonly aſſumed to themſelves) were ſeveral times expell'd <hi>Italy;</hi>
particularly in the Time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who ordered one <hi>Thraſyllus</hi> by name, for
his Lying, to be thrown into the Sea. Secondly, in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> at what
time one of their Ringleaders, called <hi>Pituanius,</hi> was caſt headlong from the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peian
Rock</hi> into <hi>Tybur.</hi> And then again in the Time of <hi>Veſpaſian;</hi> certainly the
<hi>Chaldean, Gadbury,</hi> cannot pretend to any more Art than they did; and how he
a Profeſſor of an Impoſtor, infamous, we find as well to Heatheniſm as Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſhould now aſpire to ſpit in the face of <hi>Truth,</hi> I cannot eaſily underſtand,
unleſs it be that he is an utter Enemy to that which he never did, or could write
in his Life. Surely he forgot to conſult the Stars, whether I would anſwer him
or not; for if he had, he would never have had the Impudence to deny what
he does. And now Mr. <hi>John Gadbury</hi> to the point, in the management of which
I ſhall addreſs my ſelf to your <hi>Chaldeanſhip,</hi> in the common tearms of <hi>You</hi> and
I, for brevities ſake; and you ſhall have the honour to have your <hi>You</hi> put into
Dominical Letters, becauſe You are an Almanack-maker, and ſignally <hi>black</hi> is
the Dominican Colour.</p>
            <p>You <hi>ſay that</hi> meeting with the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemaines</hi> Manifeſto, and in p. 96.
your Name mention'd as ſubpena'd to teſtify at his Lordſhips Tryal, <hi>with this
mark,</hi> That <hi>You</hi> never had any diſcourſe with <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> about his Lordſhip, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63114:3"/>
the ſaid <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> pretended, And being demanded by many of your particular
Friends, and others, whether the thing his Lordſhip ſaid there were true. <hi>You</hi>
did and do aver it for a truth, and as true as truth itſelf. And alſo <hi>You</hi> farther
aver, that <hi>You</hi> never had diſcourſe with <hi>Dangerfeild,</hi> either about his Lordſhip,
or concerning any matter or Perſon elſe, as having never ſeen him but twice in your
life before he appear'd againſt <hi>You</hi> at the Council, and then but tranſiently neither.</p>
            <p>As to his Lordſhips reflection upon your aſſertion, there is little or no heed to
be given to it. For 'tis well known of what credit his Lordſhips writings are in
reference to the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> to which, the World well knows how zealous a

Now as to your <hi>avowment</hi> and <hi>farther avowment, You</hi> ſhall hear what I ſwore, and
then ſet it be brought to Tryal when <hi>You</hi> pleaſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>You</hi> and I, upon or about the 2d of <hi>September</hi> 1679. entring into diſcourſe,
I perceiv'd your countenance to change, when looking very angrily on me, <hi>You</hi> told
me, that <hi>You</hi> wonder'd I would offer to diſpleaſe the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

               </gap>d, that I was not a little

               </gap>ir diſpleaſure. <hi>You</hi> then repli'd, yes, yes, <hi>You</hi> did; and then <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alling into a great
paſſion, ſaid, 'twas becauſe I would not kill the King; ſaid <hi>You</hi> to me, I admire at your
Ingratitude, that when you could not prop<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe to your ſelf any poſſible way of getting
out of Priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſhould offer to ref<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe it. Nay ſaid <hi>You</hi> to me, I might have
done it with all the eaſe in the World, for no manner of hurt could have befallen me.
Why ſaid I, would not Death unavoidably have been the Conſequence of it? <hi>No ſaid
<hi>You,</hi>
               </hi> for before I was releas'd out of the <hi>Kings Bench, <hi>You</hi>
               </hi> had an exact account
from Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> of the Year, Month, Week, Day, and Hour I was born in. And
the Counteſs of <hi>Powis</hi> ordered <hi>You</hi> to calculate my Nativity. And it is ſo clear,
ſaid <hi>You</hi> to me, that you are by all adjudged, the Perſon allotted for that hold and
daring enterprize.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal firſt, <hi>to your own conſcience, if you have any,</hi> and then to all the
World, whether this were not an abſolute diſcourſe between <hi>You</hi> and I, about
the <hi>Lord Caſtlemaine.</hi> For it is all moſt ſacredly true, notwithſtanding all your
confidence to deny it. But here lies the knack of the buſineſs, <hi>You</hi> mean that I
never had any diſcourſe with <hi>You</hi> about the <hi>Lord Caſtlemaine</hi> in the Year 1641.
or in the year 1681. had you ſaid ſo, there <hi>You</hi> had hit the nail o' the head: but
alaſs, I did not ſwear to any of thoſe Years, but only to the Year 1679. and
that I'll ſtand by to the laſt. And therefore neither <hi>You</hi> nor the <hi>Lord Caſtlemaint</hi>
muſt think to <hi>Sham</hi> the world with impertinent <hi>Manifeſto's</hi> and <hi>Averments,</hi> to
which there is no more credit to be given, than to your own obſervations upon
the weather: 'tis only two <hi>Papiſts</hi> in a bad cauſe vouching one for another, like
two Horſe-ſtealers in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> For my part, I was certainly and intirely upon
a conſcientious diſcovery of the Truth, and before thoſe Perſons who were not
to be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lamm'd, or impos'd upon, neither did I make, or offer at the leaſt, Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
for my life, till the <hi>King,</hi> after full ſatisfaction given concerning the
truth of my diſcovery, out of his Majeſties great clemency and wiſdom, gave
that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> order for a pardon for me, in whoſe power my Life was, whether I
ſpoke truth or no: and which I had moſt aſſuredly forfeited, had they found
me aſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rologizing like your ſelf, Mr. <hi>Gadbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But <hi>You</hi> go on, and</hi> avow that <hi>You</hi> never had any diſcourſe with me concerning
any matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or perſon, as having never ſeen me but twice in your life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is another moſt notorious falſhood: and this I muſt tell ye, in all your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63114:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
three capacities; as a Taylor, a Quack, and a Figure Caſter. For <hi>You</hi> ſaw me
once when I came to give you notice of the meeting between the Lord <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Robert Payton,</hi> and three times within the ſpace of ſix weeks
before that: once upon a <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the evening, which was about the 23d of
<hi>Septemb.</hi> 1679. at what time I call'd for Dame <hi>Cellier,</hi> whom I left at your
Houſe while I went <hi>ſhe knows where,</hi> once at your own Houſe, by your own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
which was about the 27th day of <hi>Septemb.</hi> and in the afternoon
about three of the clock, where we diſcourſed about Sir <hi>Denzell Hollis, &amp;c.</hi>
and after that in ſome ſhort time, at Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Arundell Street,</hi>
and all this I will prove to your face, by ſeveral Witneſſes, which perhaps you
may in good time hear more of, for all your pardon. Then let me put <hi>You</hi> in
mind of that extraordinary rainy day, when <hi>You</hi> came to Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi>'s Houſe,
and told her <hi>You</hi> were juſt come from the <hi>Tower,</hi> that <hi>You</hi> had din'd with the
<hi>Lord Powis,</hi> and had brought her a note from the <hi>Lord Arundell,</hi> to go to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
place mention'd in the ſaid note, to receive a Sum of Mony. And further
to rub up your memory, for to uſe your own Words, I find it <hi>very much bruis'd
of late, <hi>You</hi>
               </hi> know I gave <hi>you</hi> two Books, entitled, <hi>Traitors Transform'd into
Martyrs,</hi> which I told you were wrote by one <hi>Dormer,</hi> upon the Execution of
the five Jeſuits. What weather is it now <hi>friend John?</hi> Here are no leſs than
eight times, which are ſix more than <hi>twice,</hi> and if <hi>You</hi> conſider the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
more than <hi>tranſiently</hi> to boot.</p>
            <p>So then that <hi>You</hi> were privy to the deſign intended by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt
the Kings Life, and had made your ſelf an equal Conſpirator with them, and
did diſcourſe with me concerning the Lord <hi>Caſtlemaine</hi> is undenyably true. Now
for further ſatisfaction, I ſhall refer the Reader to your own <hi>Evidence</hi> at <hi>Mrs.
Celliers Tryal,</hi> where <hi>You</hi> ſwear, <hi>that ſhe deſired you to conſult your Art, to know
how long the King would live,</hi> (His Majeſty being then ſick at <hi>Windſor) and that
ſhe asked <hi>You</hi> ſomething about me:</hi> and being ask'd by the Court what that <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
was? <hi>You</hi> repli'd, <hi>to get me out of Priſon.</hi> Then being again ask'd by the Court,
if <hi>You</hi> did nothing for <hi>Cellier</hi> at that time when ſhe ſo earneſtly importun'd <hi>You</hi>
to conſult your Art about the Kings Life, <hi>You</hi> repli'd, <hi>You <hi>did a Scheme then, but
ſince</hi> You <hi>found it to be for me, but</hi> You <hi>knew not for what it was when you did it.</hi>
               </hi>
Then being ask'd if <hi>You</hi> could apply one <hi>Scheme</hi> to any body? <hi>You</hi> replied,
<hi>When Mrs.</hi> Cellier <hi>came to <hi>You,</hi> ſhe gave <hi>You</hi> the time of a Perſons Nativity, and
<hi>You</hi> ſet the figure of Heaven to that time, to know whether he were a Perſon fit to
be truſted to get in mony, her Husband being a French Merchant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what were the remarks of the Court upon theſe ſhuffling, cutting, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocating
anſwers of yours? <hi>Why, truly that <hi>You</hi> talk'd as like a</hi> Papiſt <hi>as
could be—That <hi>You</hi> made all the company laugh,</hi> &amp;c. And paſs'd many Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſmes
upon your baffling diſcourſe, which ſhewed how much they were diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the <hi>bruiſes of your memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come more particularly to the point, <hi>You</hi> confeſs that Dame <hi>Cellier did
deſire <hi>You</hi> to conſult your Art, how long the King would live.</hi> Which being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
all the world will believe that Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> would not have importun'd
<hi>You</hi> about a buſineſs of ſuch a dangerous conſequence, had ſhe not had a more
than an ordinary <hi>Conjuring</hi> confidence in <hi>You.</hi> Whence I infer, that being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately,
if I may not ſay deſperately engaged with Mrs. <hi>Cellier, <hi>You</hi>
               </hi> could not
chuſe but have ſeen me more than <hi>twice tranſiently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next <hi>You</hi> confeſs <hi>you <hi>did a Scheme which afterwards</hi> you <hi>found to be for me, to
know whether I were fit to be truſted or no, to get in old debts.</hi>
               </hi> A very probable
ſtory this! This French Merchant, Husband to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> had been broke for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63114:4"/>
many years before, and was as poor as a Rat, till his induſtrious Wife found
the way to the <hi>Plot;</hi> and yet will any man of Reaſon believe that two or three
hundred pounds ſhould be rais'd and disburs'd to procure my liberty, for no
other end or purpoſe, than to gather in the debts of a Banckrupt that was
ſome hundreds of pounds worſe than nothing? and more than this, I defie any
Man, Woman, or Child in the world to ſay to my face that ever I demanded a
ſhilling from them as a Debt to Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> or any Perſon intruſted for him,
Ah, friend <hi>John,</hi> friend <hi>John,</hi> theſe are meer flams, and ſtories badly contriv'd,
and worſe put together; ſurely you never conſulted the Stars about this? But
lay your diſcourſe and mine together. <hi>That I had diſpleas'd the Lords in the
Tower,</hi> and why? your expoſtulating with me about ingratitude, and for what
reaſon? Your ſecuring me from danger, by the countenance of the Stars, and
upon what account; and then it will appear why Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was ſo kind a
ſolcitreſs for me; who they were, that had been ſo liberal, and why? Then it
will appear that <hi>you</hi> did erect a Scheme for me, and that your buſineſs was of a
higher nature than to trouble the ſeven Planets, and the Dragons Tail about ſuch
a ſilly Queſtion, <hi>as whether I were fit to be truſted to</hi> gather in the ſweepings of
a Banckrupt's Eſtate, who as ſuch, ſeldom or never have any thing they can call
their own. Then it will appear, or at leaſt be vehemently ſuſpected that <hi>you</hi>
did do a <hi>Scheme</hi> for the King. For Mrs. <hi>Cellier</hi> was a Woman that would not
be flam'd, and that you know well enough, Mr. <hi>John;</hi> ſhe underſtood Men, and
would not keep a correſpondency of <hi>ten or twelve years</hi> with a Conjurer for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Then, that I may touch you to the Quick, compare her letter to me, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I was committed by the King and Council) for <hi>you</hi> muſt allow her the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the firſt invention) <hi>viz. I have ſaid you were taken into my Houſe to get
in deſperate debts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It cannot worſt you.</hi> And your anſwer, <hi>That <hi>you</hi> did the
Scheme to know whether I was a Perſon fit to be truſted to get in deſperate debts,</hi>
and then it will appear your anſwer was a ſham, becauſe the invention from
which it was borrowed was the ſame, a meer contrivance and forgery to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
the <hi>Truth,</hi> The two Queſtions ariſe thus; Mrs. <hi>Cellier,</hi> why did <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi>
lodge at your Houſe? Anſwer. <hi>To get in my Husbands deſperate Debts.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> why did you erect a <hi>Scheme</hi> for <hi>Dangerfeild?</hi> Anſwer. <hi>To know
whether he might be truſted to get in thoſe deſperate debts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> excuſe for me being a moſt deviliſh lie; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that Mr. <hi>John Gadburies</hi> anſwer muſt be of the ſame ſtamp, as coming out
of the ſame Mint. And ſo the excuſe failing the charge remains more clear
than before.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſince it is ſo plain, that <hi>You</hi> did draw a <hi>Scheme</hi> of Enſurance for
me, to <hi>Kill the King,</hi> and proffered me all the ſpangled Hoſt of Heaven for Bail,
if there be any perſon that will believe that <hi>You</hi> never did diſcourſe with me
about the <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that I never diſcourſed with <hi>You</hi> about
the <hi>Lord Caſtlemaine;</hi> and in ſhort, that <hi>You,</hi> being one Confederate, never ſaw
me your Brother-Confederate, <hi>but twice tranſiently</hi> in your life; that man is
no rational Creature, till he have ſuck'd his reaſon from the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Toe.</hi> Now
how <hi>You</hi> came to play theſe pranks, and ſcape the <hi>Tridentine Figure,</hi> as <hi>You</hi>
call it, is paſt my Aſtrology to tell, unleſs it were that the Stars had given <hi>You</hi>
their <hi>Minion,</hi> better ſecurity than <hi>You</hi> could impoſe by their warrant, upon
my belief.</p>
            <p>But now I think on't, I have one Queſtion more to ask <hi>You,</hi> very pertinent
to the matter in hand: For if we had never ſeen one another, and that <hi>You</hi>
had not been very inſtrumental in the Cauſe wherein <hi>You</hi> found me engag'd, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63114:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what purpoſe was the two hundred and ten pounds given <hi>You,</hi> and that was
collected for <hi>You</hi> immediately after <hi>You</hi> were diſcharg'd out of the <hi>Gatehouſe.</hi>
I know your wiſh will be (as it was, when the ſame Queſtion was put to <hi>You</hi>
by another hand) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>You <hi>may go to Hell immediately, if ever you ſaw or
told one penny of it, or ever heard of any ſuch thing:</hi>
               </hi> That is, <hi>You</hi> wiſh <hi>You
<hi>may go to Hell immediately,</hi>
               </hi> that is, to Hell in the <hi>Pallace Yard,</hi> if ever <hi>You</hi> ſaw
it with the <hi>Obſervators</hi> Eyes, <hi>if ever <hi>You</hi> told one penny of it,</hi> with your
<hi>Thimble</hi> and <hi>Bodkin;</hi> or <hi>if ever <hi>You</hi> heard of any ſuch thing,</hi> with <hi>Cowzers</hi>
Ears. But notwithſtanding all this, 'tis true enough, <hi>You</hi> had this money, and
it was given <hi>you</hi> for your ſufferings and fidelity to the Catholick Cauſe, and
<hi>you</hi> had as good confeſs, or elſe your neighbour <hi>M. G.</hi> will maintain and prove
it to your face. Now that in all your Travels and painful Viſits which <hi>you</hi>
made to earn this money, that <hi>you</hi> ſhould never ſee me <hi>but Twice, and that
tranſiently;</hi> is a thing ſo much without the Verge of Belief, that <hi>you</hi> might as
well have ſworn me inviſible. And that both <hi>you</hi> and the <hi>Lord Caſtlemaine</hi>
muſt do, before all the <hi>Averments, Avows,</hi> and <hi>Manifeſto</hi>'s in the world will do
any good, unleſs it be to the Company of <hi>Stationers,</hi> and they—</p>
            <p>To draw a little more from your own mouth, I will apply one Plaiſter more
to your <hi>bruiſed memory;</hi> For being asked <hi>when <hi>you</hi> knew the Scheme was for</hi>
Dangerfeild? <hi>you</hi> anſwered, <hi>never before <hi>you</hi> came to the King and Council,</hi> for
ſaid <hi>you, he went by the name of Willoughby before.</hi> Now how far that <hi>before</hi>
reach'd backward, <hi>you</hi> muſt give the thinking part of the world leave to judge,
by what has gone before. And thus we have diſcover'd the Spring that moves
this whole frame of Aſtrological equivocation: and thus <hi>you</hi> have cut more
work out to batch up againſt next Year. For this Year <hi>you</hi> have only avow'd that
<hi>you</hi> never ſaw <hi>Dangerfeild but twice tranſiently:</hi> that <hi>you</hi> never diſcours'd with
<hi>Dangerfeild,</hi> about the <hi>Lord Caſtlemaine</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Year <hi>You</hi> muſt write an other ſhort <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the Candid Reader, and
m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke the ſame ſtrenuous <hi>avow</hi> in reference to <hi>Willoughby,</hi> Come, come, <hi>friend
John,</hi> theſe devices will never do your work; I perceive <hi>you</hi> underſtand Proverbs;
ſoft and fairly goes far: He that Damns himſelf but once a Year, I'le warrant
him ſhall go ſoon enough to the <hi>Devil.</hi> I commend your Providence; <hi>you</hi>
thought one full mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d, Cannon-bore equivocation would laſt twelve months,
and ſo reſerv'd <hi>Willoughby</hi> for the next Year. But the worſt on't is, the <hi>Lord
Caſtlemaine</hi> muſt alter his <hi>Manifeſto</hi> too: a curſed trouble, but that we find, he has
a good quick hand at his Pen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having made your</hi> avow<hi>'s you come to ask Queſtions, and demand,</hi> upon
what account I made my ſelf ſo familiar with <hi>you,</hi> and ſwore <hi>you</hi> into the knowledge
of the Honourable Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> whoſe faces <hi>you</hi> never yet ſaw that <hi>you</hi>
knew of. His conſcience, if he hath any, can beſt inform him.</p>
            <p>This 'tis to be <hi>caſting</hi> the <hi>Figures</hi> of other Men's conſciences, and not mind
your own. For look ye now—I muſt yet mind ye once more of the <hi>Rainy
Day</hi> before mentioned, when <hi>you</hi> your individual ſelf ſaid, <hi>you</hi> came from the
<hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower;</hi> That you din'd with the <hi>Lord Powis,</hi> and brought a Note
from the <hi>Lord Arundel.</hi> Did the <hi>Lord Powis</hi> ſit at Table <hi>Alamode du Dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhow?</hi>
mute and vizarded? If <hi>you</hi> will not believe your ſelf, can <hi>you</hi> expect that
other People ſhould believe ye? 'Tis a likely ſtory that <hi>you</hi> could dine with a
man and not ſee his face. In the next place I am to put <hi>you</hi> in mind, that upon
your examination before the King and Council, <hi>you</hi> confeſs'd, <hi>That <hi>you</hi> had caſt
the Lord</hi> Powis's <hi>Nativity.</hi> For which I refer <hi>you</hi> to the Council Minutes taken
upon <hi>Sunday, Novemb.</hi> 2. 1679. Which being true, it is moſt rational to believe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63114:5"/>
that <hi>you</hi> were admitted to the <hi>Lord Powis</hi>'s Table, either in acknowledgment
of what <hi>you</hi> had done, or in order to what <hi>you</hi> were to do. For <hi>Lords</hi> are
curious, and not underſtanding your Aſtrological ſnatches, cannot but have a
natural deſire to underſtand the expoſition of your marks and ſigns, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things: And it cannot be imagin'd but the curioſity of the reſt of the
<hi>Lords</hi> muſt bring them all in a hurrey to hear great news from the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
were it for no other reaſon, but out of a Complement, either to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the happineſs, or condole the misfortune of their fellow ſufferer. Now
is it likely that <hi>you</hi> would hazard your ſelf upon ſuch dangerous enterprizes,
without knowing the faces and feeling the Purſes too of thoſe that employed ye?
Then again the Perſons for whom the <hi>Schemes</hi> were erected, and the juncture of
time, plainly demonſtrate the concatenation of the Cauſes of theſe ſolicitous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.
The Kings life was ſought, but hearing he was ſick, a <hi>Scheme</hi> muſt be
erected to know whether he would outlive the diſtemper or put them to farther
trouble. Then <hi>Mine</hi> in the nick of time, for encouragement to proceed, in caſe
of His Majeſties Recovery. Then the <hi>Lord Powis</hi>'s, to make a diſcovery of
the iſſue of the buſineſs by his good or bad Fortune. Now that the <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi>
in the <hi>Tower</hi> ſhould be unacquainted with their <hi>Delphian Oracle,</hi> eſpecially <hi>you</hi>
your ſelf confeſſing <hi>you</hi> had din'd with one, receiv'd a note from another, and
telling me that the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> were diſpleas'd with me, and that <hi>you</hi>
knew the reaſon of it, is a thing never to be controverted.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which I cannot paſs by, and that is, that <hi>you</hi> call your
ſelf a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> It was a thing which the Court would not believe, nor can
any unbſaſs'd perſon in the world have any reaſon to believe it, by that which
follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Court demanded of <hi>you,</hi>
               </hi> if you knew of any attempt to change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<hi>To which <hi>you</hi> anſwered, <hi>you</hi>
               </hi> knew of no Plot, unleſs it were a Plot
to bring Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> over to the Kings Intereſt. That Plot <hi>you</hi> had ſome
concern in.</p>
            <p>But why a <hi>Plot</hi> to bring over Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> to the Kings Intereſt <hi>you'l</hi>
ſay, becauſe Sir <hi>R. P,</hi> was a great ſtickler againſt the <hi>Duke of Yorks</hi> Intereſt, and
took great pains to incenſe the People againſt it. Now to ſhew how like a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<hi>you</hi>
               </hi> manag'd this deſign, 'tis well known that <hi>you</hi> procur'd a meeting
between the <hi>Lord Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Sir Robert Payton</hi> at your own houſe, and
this under pretence of a long continu'd Friendſhip, and there they met ſo often,
that at length Sir <hi>Robert Payton,</hi> was perſwaded to wait upon the <hi>Duke,</hi> and did
kiſs his Hand, and was from that time forthwith taken into favour. And this
<hi>you</hi> call a <hi>Plot</hi> to bring over Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> your great Friend to the Kings Intereſt,
by getting of him receiv'd into the <hi>Dukes</hi> favour only. What ſaid the Court
to this? Not a tittle. For they underſtood better things than to believe <hi>you</hi>
ſpoke a word of <hi>Truth.</hi> Well knowing, that the Kings Intereſt is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Proteſtant,</hi> the Peace and Quiet of the Religion and Government in
Church and State, as it is now by Law Eſtabliſh'd: the Intereſt of the <hi>Duke</hi> of
another nature, as having been declar'd a <hi>Romiſh Catholick.</hi> So that it was Sir
<hi>Robert Paytons</hi> loſs, that out of your ſeeming <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Friendſhip, <hi>you</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him to your own <hi>Romiſh Catholick</hi> party; whoſe Intereſt is ſo Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
contrary to the Intereſt of His Majeſty, and to the <hi>Genius</hi> and Intereſt of
the whole Nation. For which kindneſs would Sir <hi>R. P.</hi> but take upon him the
ſo much abus'd Character of the Kings moſt Loyal Evidence, I am of opinion,
I might ſee <hi>you</hi> tranſlated from your habitation in <hi>Brick Court</hi> to another place.
And now whether <hi>He</hi> that profeſſes himſelf a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and acted ſo like a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63114:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cordial <hi>Papiſt,</hi> can be believ'd, to be what he only ſays he is, I leave to all
the <hi>Candid-Readers</hi> in the world to judge.</p>
            <p>As for your praying for the King, 'tis to be look'd upon as a meer piece of
convenient and time ſerving flattery, a pretence to cover the malignity of your
black Soul. Were it real, it were highly to be commended; but as it is not,
there are many that pray for the King with their lips, yet curſe him in their
hearts. As for all your <hi>hatings,</hi> and <hi>abhorrings</hi> of this and that, while <hi>you</hi>
pray for the King, <hi>you</hi> curſe his Loyal and beſt Subjects under the names of
<hi>Jugling Nonconformiſts, Papiſts in Maſquerade,</hi> and <hi>Narrative Writers,</hi> and
all this, meerly becauſe they obviated your Helliſh Deſigns. And indeed he
that will betray his friend, can never be true to his King. And this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable
by your <hi>Plot</hi> to bring over Sir <hi>Robert Payton</hi> to the Kings Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
For if that were your deſign, why did <hi>you</hi> not do it? if <hi>you</hi> did it out
of affection to the <hi>Popiſh Intereſt,</hi> you were a <hi>Traitor</hi> to your Friend, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
to your Prince, and conſequently an abſolute Papiſt, however <hi>you</hi>
may pretend your ſelf to be a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> So that your <hi>Honouring Monarchy</hi>
ſignifies nothing. For <hi>England</hi> was Monarchical in time of Popery as well
as now, and under that Circumſtance <hi>you</hi> expected it would ere now have
been ſo again. Your profeſſing your ſelf to be a Member of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> ſignifies as little. For in the Ages of <hi>Peter-Pence,</hi> we know the
Church of <hi>England</hi> was then Eſtabliſh'd by Law, and that no queſtion, is the
Eſtabliſhment <hi>you</hi> mean, and as <hi>you</hi> have confirm'd by your own practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>As for your Aſtrological Obſervations, they are not worth the <hi>leaneſt louſe</hi>
that ever ſuffered under the violence of your needle. <hi>you</hi> ſpeak irreverently
of the very Stars <hi>you</hi> get your Bread by. Say <hi>you</hi> in your Obſervations upon
<hi>January, The angry Stars do belch out enmity faſter than the Planets can breath
forth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A ſtrange and unſeemly accuſation of the Stars; as if <hi>you</hi>
were indebted to the Planets for rent, and therefore thought to pay your Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
with good words, <hi>you</hi> ſpeak ſcandalouſly of the Juſtice of the Nation in
theſe words; <hi>When is there hopes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity? When we ſhall hate Violence, Fraud
and Perjury.</hi> As if they who by their Oaths and Teſtimonies had brought
the Conſpirators againſt His Majeſty to condign puniſhment, had done it by
<hi>Fraud and Perjury,</hi> and that nothing but <hi>Caſtlemaines Compendiums,</hi> and
<hi>Manifeſto</hi>'s were to be believ'd. Every page of your Obſervations breaths
forth nothing but malice againſt the Kings <hi>beſt Witneſſes,</hi> advancement of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
diſturbance of the Government, and the raiſing of fears and jealouſies
between the Prince and his People. What have <hi>you</hi> to do with the Councils
at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> or the Councils in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but only to amuſe the unthinking,
and moſt giddy People of the multitude? For moſt certainly <hi>you</hi> knew no
more than <hi>Cowzers</hi> dead <hi>Broom.</hi> Tell the Country Gentlewoman when ſhe
ſhall ſow her Peaſe, and ſet her Sweet Marjerome: tell the City Haberdaſher
of ſmall wares, when <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Exeter</hi> Fairs will be, and tell him how far it
is between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>St. Davids:</hi> This is your buſineſs <hi>Friend John.</hi> Can any
Man of reaſon abſtain from loud laughter to hear <hi>you</hi> apply your nonſenſe to
State Affairs? as for example, in your Obſervations upon the Suns ingreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aries. What ſhall I ſay? Can Saturn the great enemy of nature bode any
good this Year to Mankind? Is he not in the 7th angle, and the houſe of his
Enemy too?</hi> What if he be? there let him ſtay, who cares a ruſh? <hi>But when
he ſhall be Lord of any revolution, and in</hi> Leo <hi>having Northern Latitude, he
renders the deſigns and projects of many men fruſtrate.</hi> What ſtuff is this?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63114:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And yet the intent of it is miſchievous, to keep the minds of men addicted
to folly, and ſuperſtitious imaginations in ſuſpence. And that this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
at which <hi>you</hi> drive is plain, by your quoting a ſilly Propheſie of that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Wizard Nostre-Damus,</hi> in deriſion of your enemy <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort ſuch Figure-Caſters as <hi>you,</hi> are not fit to be ſuffered under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Government, nor indeed underſtand. For as your Art is fallacious, and
conſequently impious, ſo when thoſe fallacies and impieties are us'd to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
end, they are the more to be abominated. None but the Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
believe ye, and never any that did believe ye, but periſh'd through their
folly. <hi>A ſort of People,</hi> ſaith Tacitus, <hi>Treacherous to Princes, deceivers of
them that believe them, and therefore alwaies prohibited from our City.</hi>
And therefore it is a ſhame that they are ſo publickly tolerated to hang out
their amuſing ſigns in <hi>This,</hi> and to give our their bills about the Streets, to
inveigle, and many times undo wanton and inquiſitive Youth.</p>
            <p>After all this I admire what unlucky Star influenc'd <hi>you</hi> to make this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
vindication, and to provoke me to collect theſe <hi>Truths</hi> in my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
to encounter your lies and equivocations. For certainly Men are not
to live in this world, that will hear themſelves abus'd, and tax'd of Villanies,
and Perjuries, by thoſe that are the Criminals themſelves. If <hi>you</hi> have your
pardon, thank God and the King for it, but in my opinion 'tis a breach of
