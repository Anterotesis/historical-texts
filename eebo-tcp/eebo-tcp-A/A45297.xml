            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old, thus and thus; but I ſay unto you thus &amp; thus, &amp; as if the Son of God in checking the upſtart Antiquities of a miſgrounded &amp; unreaſonable tradition, meant to condemn the truly ancient and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cuſtoms of the whole Chriſtian Church, which all ſober and judicious Chriſtians are wont to look upon with meet reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence: and certainly whoſoever ſhall have ſet down this reſolution with himſelf to ſleight thoſe, either Inſtitutions or Practices which are derived to us from the Primitive Times, and have ever ſince been entertained by the whole Church of Chriſt upon earth, that man hath laid ſufficient foundation of Schiſmes and dangerous Singularities: And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109039:4"/>
doth that which the moſt eminent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> chargeth with no leſs then the moſt inſolent madneſs, <hi>Inſolenti ſini eſt,</hi> &amp;c. For me and my Friends, God give us grace to take the advice which our Saviour gave his Spouſe, <hi>To go forth by the footſteps of the flock, and to feed our Kids beſides the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Tents,</hi> Canticle 1.8 And to walk in the ſure paths of uncorrupt Antiquity, for the celebration of the Solemn Feaſt of our Saviours Nativity, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt, which you ſay is cryed down by your Zealous Lecturers: One would think theſe ſhould be reaſons enough in thoſe wonderfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefits, which thoſe days ſerve to Commemorate unto us; for (to inſtance in the ſaid Feaſt of the Nativity) when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel brought the news of that bleſſed Birth to the Jewiſh ſhepherds: <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be unto all people; for unto you is born this day a Saviour,</hi> Luke 2.10. If then the report of this bleſſing were the beſt tidings of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt joy that ever was, or ever could be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly incident unto mankinde, why ſhould not the commemoration thereof be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: where we conceive the greateſt joy,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109039:5"/>
what ſhould hinder us to expreſs it in a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Feſtivity; but you are taught to ſay the day conferred nothing on the bleſſing: that every day we ſhould with equal thankfulneſs remember this ineſtimable benefit of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God. So as a ſet Aniverſary day is altogether needleſs. Know then and conſider, that the all-Wiſe God, who knew it fit that his people ſhould every day think of the great work of the Creation, and of that miraculous Deliverance of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſervitude, and ſhould daily give honour to their Almighty Creator and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; yet ordained one day of ſeven for the more ſpecial Recognition of theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous works, as well knowing, how apt we are to forget thoſe Duties, wherewith we are only encharged in common, without the deſignement of a particular renumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Beſides, the ſame reaſon will hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable againſt any monethly or annual Celebration whatſoever: The <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have been much to blame, if they had not every Day thankfully remembred the great Deliverance which God wrought for them from the bloody deſign of cruel <hi>Haman</hi>: yet it was thought requiſite, if not neceſſary, that there ſhould be two ſpecial days of <hi>Purim</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:109039:5"/>
ſet apart for the Aniverſary memorial of that wonderful preſervation, the like may be ſaid for the <hi>Engliſh Purim</hi> of <hi>November.</hi> It is well in beſides the general tye of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, a preciſe Day ordained by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can enough quicken our unthankful dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to give God his own for ſo great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Shall we ſay it is the work of the year, what needs a day? As therefore no Day ſhould paſs over our heads without a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgement of the great myſterie of God Incarnate: So withall the wiſdom of the Primitive Church, no doubt but by the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt hath pitched upon one ſpecial Day wherein we ſhould intirely devote our thoughts to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of this Work which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven cannot enough admire. But we are told, that perhaps we miſſe of the Day, ſince the Seaſon is Litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, uncertain, unknown, and in all likelyhood other then our <hi>December,</hi> and that it is purpoſely not revealed, that it may not be kept.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, I deny not that the juſt Day is not certainly known, the great Saviour of the World, that would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109039:6"/>
have his ſecond coming without obſervation going before it, would have his firſt coming without obſervation following it: he meant to come down without noiſe, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded notice, even in the ſecond hundred ſo ancient we are ſure this Feſtivity is. There was queſtion and different opinions of the ſeaſon, the juſt knowledge and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof, matters nothing at all to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our celebration; moſt ſure we are that ſuch a day there was, and no leſs ſure that it was the happieſt day that ever lookt forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World: It is all one to us, whether this day, or that, we content our ſelves with this, that it hath pleaſed the Church for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years to ordain this day for the Commemoration of that tranſcendent bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, what care we to ſtand upon theſe 12. hours that made up the Artificial day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this wonderfull work was wrought, which we are ſure cannot be much changed by ſo many intercalations, ſo long and conſtant a practiſe of the Chriſtian Church upon ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounds, it is no leſs warrant to us, then if an Angel from heaven ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us the juſt hour of this bleſſed Nativitie.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, Surely, whoſoever ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109039:6"/>
tell you, that God did purpoſely hide this day from us that it might eſcape a Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he concealed the burial of <hi>Moſes</hi> to avoid the danger of an Idolatrous Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes himſelf a preſumptuous Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor upon the Actions of the Almighty; when did God tell him ſo? or what Revelation can he pretend for ſo bold an aſſertion? If this were the matter, why then did not the ſame God, with equal caution conceal the day of the Paſſion, Reſurrection, &amp; Aſcenſion of our bleſſed Saviour, and of the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, the Obſervation of all which Days, is with no leſs vehemency, and upon the ſame danger cried down by theſe ſcrupulous perſons; either therefore let him ſay that God would have theſe other Feaſt days obſerved becauſe he would have them known to the World, or yield that he did not therefore conceal the day of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Chriſt, becauſe he would not have it obſerved.</p>
            <p>But you hear it ſaid, there is Popery and Superſtition in keeping that Day. Tell thoſe that ſuggeſt ſo, that they caſt a foul ſlander upon the Saints of God in the Primitive Church, upon the Holy and Learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who Preached, and wrote ſo, and kept
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109039:7"/>
the Feaſt of Chriſts Nativity; which ſacred Solemnity many hundred years before Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was hatched, and that they little know what wrong they do to Religion and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and what honour they put upon that Superſtition which they profeſs to deteſt, in aſcribing that to Popery which was the meer act of holy and devout Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But to colour this Plea, you are taught that the myſterie of Iniquity began early to work, even in the very Apoſtolick Times; and that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> did ſecretly put in his claw before his whole body appeared. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a ſingular Uſe wont to be made of this ſhift by thoſe which would avoid the countenance of all Primitive Authority, to any diſpleaſing (however lawfull and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible) Inſtitutions and practiſes: ſo the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> tels us, that the baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is one of the timely workings of the myſterie of Iniquity; ſo the blaſphemous <hi>Neſtorians</hi> of our time tell us that the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the bleſſed Trinity of perſons in the unity of one Godhead, is but an ancient device of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> working under hand before his formal exhibition. Every ſort is apt to make this Challenge, and therefore it behooves us wiſely to diſtinguiſh betwixt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109039:7"/>
thoſe things which men did as good Chriſtians, and thoſe which they did as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to their own private, or to the more common Intereſt of others: What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage can we conceive it might be to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> that Chriſt ſhould have a day cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated to the memory of his bleſſed Birth, and that devout Chriſtians ſhould meet together in their Holy Aſſemblies, to praiſe God for the benefit of that happy Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And what other effect could be expected from ſo Religious a Work, but Glory to GOD and Edification to Men? Who can ſuppoſe that the enemy of Chriſt ſhould gain by the honour done to Chriſt? Away therefore with this groundleſs Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and let us be ſo Popiſh, ſo Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, as thoſe holy Fathers, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Primitive Church, famous for Learning and Piety, who Lived and Died devout Obſervers of this Chriſtian Feſtival.</p>
            <p>But you are bidden to aske what warrant we find in the Word of God (which is to be the rule of all our actions) for the ſolemn keeping of this Day? In anſwer you may tell that <hi>Queſtioniſt,</hi> that to argue from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Negatively in things of this nature is ſomewhat Untheological. Aſke you him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

with better reaſon, what Scripture he findes to forbid it, for if that be unlawfull to be done, which is not in Gods Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then much rather that which is not there forbidden, cannot be unlawfull to be done: Generall grounds of Edification, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, peaceable Conformity to the Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Spiritual Governors, are in theſe Caſes more then enough to build our Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice upon: If it be Replyed that we are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned ſix dayes to Labour, and forbidden to obſerve Dayes and Times as being part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pedoegogie (two common pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences with which the eyes of the Jgnorant are wont to be bleared) know that for the firſt, it is not ſo much Preceptive, as Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, neither was it the intentions of the Almighty to interpoſe the command of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires in the firſt Table of his Royal Law, wherein Himſelfe and his Service is imediately concern'd, in ſuch like expreſſions; mayſt, and ſhalt, are equivalent and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cvovſly uſed, that inſtance is clear and pregnant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16. <hi>The Lord,</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>commanded the man, Saying, Eating thou ſhalt eat of every Tree in the Garden,</hi> which our laſt Verſion renders well to the ſenſe: <hi>Thou mayſt freely eat of every tree
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109039:8"/>
of the Garden.</hi> And if that charge in the 4th. Commandment were abſolute and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, what Humane Authority could diſpenſe with thoſe large threds of Time, which we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually cut out of the ſix days for Sacred occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, what warrant could we have to intermit our work for a daily Lecture; or a monethly Faſt, or for an Aniverſary <hi>Fifth of November</hi>; And if notwithſtanding this command of God it be allowed to be in the power of man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soveraign (as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> appropriated it) or Spiritual, to ordain the ſetting of ſome ſet parcels of time to holy uſes, why ſhould it be ſtuck at in the Appropriating and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Pious and uſefull Celebration of this Feſtival. As for that other ſuggeſtion of the Apoſtles taxation of obſerving Days and Times; any one that hath but half an eye may ſee that it hath reſpect to thoſe Judaical Holy days, which were part of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, now long ſince out of date, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Typical ſignification, and ſhadows of things to come, ſhould we therefore go about to revive thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feaſts, or did we erect any new day to an eſſential part of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God? or place holineſs in it as ſuch? We ſhould juſtly incur that blame which the Apoſtles caſt upon the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Falſe Teachers</hi>; but to wreſt this forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to a Chriſtian ſolemn Purity, which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109039:9"/>
is meerly commemoration of a bleſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, without any prefiguration of things to come, without any opinion of holineſs anexed to the day, is no other then injurious violence.</p>
            <p>Vpon all this which hath been ſaid, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſerious weighing of what ever may be further alledged to the contrary, I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirm that there is no juſt reaſon why good Chriſtians ſhould not withall godly cheerfulneſs obſerve this, which that holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtiled the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of all Feaſts, to which I add that thoſe, which by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Doctrine ſleight this Day, cauſing their People to diſhonour it with their worſt cloaths, with ſhops open, with ſervile works, ſtand guilty before God of an high and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contempt of that lawfull Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they live; for as much by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of our Land made by the full concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of King and State: This is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be kept holy by all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, and this power is backed by the charge of God; <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If now after all this I ſhould let my Pen looſe to the ſuffragant Teſtjmonies, whether of Antiquity, or Modern Divines, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, I ſhould tire your patience, and inſtead of a Letter ſend you a Volume, let it ſuffice, that ever ſince the ſecond 100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:109039:9"/>
years after Chriſt, this Feaſt hath without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction obtained due reſpect in the Church of God, &amp; received many noble Elogies and paſſionate inforcements from the Learned and holy Fathers of the Church, amongſt the reſt that of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> [in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations upon the Day of the Nativity of Chriſt] is ſo remarkable, that I may not omit it, as that which ſets forth the exceſs of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſpect wherewith the Ancient Chriſtians were wont to keep this day.
<q>Let us ſaith he, Celebrate this Feaſt, not in a Panegyrical, but Divine, not in a worldly, but ſuperſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner: not regarding ſo much our ſelvs, or others; as the worſhip of Chriſt, and how ſhall we effect this? not with Crowning our doors with Garlands, nor leading of Dances, nor adorning our Streets, not by feeding our eyes, not by delighting our ears with pleaſant Songs, not by effeminating our ſmell with perfumes, not with humouring our taſte with dainties, not with pleaſing our touch, not with ſilken &amp; coſtly cloaths, and not with the ſparkling Jewels, not with the luſter of Gold, not with the artifice of counterfeit colours; let us leave theſe things to Pagans; for their pomp, &amp;c. But we who adore the word of the Father, if we think fit to affect delicacies, let us feed our ſelves with the dainties of the Law of God, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109039:10"/>
with thoſe Divine Diſcourſes, eſpeciall which are fitting for this preſent Feſtival.</q>
So that Learned and eloquent Father to his Auditors of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where to, let me (if you pleaſe) have leave to add one or two practical inſtances, one ſhall be of the good Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> lying now for eight moneths under the ſevere Cenſure of Biſhop <hi>Ambroſe</hi> when the Feaſt of the Nativity drew neer, what moan did that Religious Prince make to his Courtiers, that he was by that reſolute Biſhop ſhut out (for his blood-guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs) from partaking with the aſſembly in that holy Service, and what importunate means did he make for his admiſſion, <hi>Hiſt. tri. partit.</hi> lib. 9. cap. 30. Had that gracious Emperour been of the Diet of theſe our new Divines he would have ſleighted that repulſe, and gladly taken this occaſion of abſenſe from that Superſtitious Solemnity, or had one of theſe grave Monitors been at his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, he might have ſaved that pious Prince the expence of many ſighs and tears, which now he beſtowed upon his abſtention from that dearly affected Devotion. The other ſhal be a Hiſtory of as much note, as horror, too clear a proofe of the ancient Celebration of this Feaſtival, it was under the Tyrany of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and his Co-partner <hi>Maximinus, Nicephor.</hi> 1.7. <hi>ca.</hi> 6. that 20000. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109039:10"/>
met to Celebrate the Feaſt of this Nativity in the large Church of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> which were made an <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> and burnt together with that goodly Fabrick to aſhes on that day; Lo ſo great a multitude as 20000. Chriſtians of al ages, of both Sexes, had not thus mett together in a time of ſo mortal danger, to celebrate this Feaſt, if the holy Zeal of their duty had not told them they ought to keep that day, which theſe <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> teach us to contemne.</p>
            <p>Now let theſe bold men ſee, of how contrary a diſpoſition they are to thoſe, bleſſed Martyrs, which as this day ſent up their Soules (like <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noahs</hi> Angel) to Heaven in thoſe flames.</p>
            <p>After thus much ſaid, I ſhould be glad to know (ſince reaſon there can be none) what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity induces theſe Gain-ſaiers to oppoſe ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient &amp; received a Cuſtome in the Church of God; you tell me of a double Teſtimony cyted to this purpoſe, the one of <hi>Socrates</hi> the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which I ſuppoſe is fetched out of the 5th. Book of <hi>Ecleſiaſtical</hi> Story <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> he paſſeth his Judgement upon the indeffrent nature of all thoſe ancient Feaſts which were of uſe in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times, ſhewing, that the Apoſtles never meant to make any Law for the keeping them, but left men to the free obſervation thereof.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer whereunto, I do not tell you that this Author is wont to be impeached of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatianiſm,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109039:11"/>
and therefore may ſeem fit to yield Patronage to ſuch a Clyent; I rather ſay, that take him at the worſt, he is no enemy to our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or Practice, we agree with him that the Apoſtles would have men free from ſervitude of the Jewiſh obſervation of days, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted no Law for ſet Feſtivals, but left perſons and places ſo to their liberty in theſe Caſes, that none ſhould impoſe a neceſſity upon others; this were to be preſſed upon <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who violently obtruded a day for the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon all Churches (ſuppoſing in the mean time an <hi>Eaſter</hi> univerſally kept of all Chriſtians, though not on the ſame day.) This makes nothing againſt us, who place no Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the very hours, nor plead any Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call injunction for days, nor tye any perſon, or Church to our ſtrict <hi>Calender,</hi> but only hold it fit out of obedience to the Laws both of our Church and Kingdom, to continue a joyfull Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of a memorial Day to the honour of our bleſſed Saviour: But that other Authority which you tell me was urged to this purpoſe, I confeſs doth not a little amaze me: it was, you ſay, of K. <hi>James</hi> our Learned Soveraign of late &amp; bleſſed memory, whoſe teſtimony was brought in before the credulous people (not without the juſt applauſe of a <hi>Solomon</hi>-like-wiſdom) as cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down theſe Feſtivals: and in a certain Speech of his applauding the purity of the Church of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109039:11"/>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> above that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> for that it obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the common Feaſts of Chriſts Nativity &amp; Reſurrection, &amp;c. Is it poſſible, that any mouth could name that wife and good King, in ſuch a cauſe, whom all the world knows to have been as zealous a Patron of theſe Feſtivals, as any lived upon earth; and if he had let fall any ſuch Speech before he had any Down upon his chin, &amp; whiles he was under the Ferule, what candor is it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it now to the contradiction of his better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and riper judgement: Nay, is it not famouſly known that it was one of the main er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands of his journey into his Native Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to reduce that Church into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the reſt of the Churches of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the obſervation of theſe Solemn Dayes, and to this purpoſe was it not one of the main buſineſſes which he ſet on work in the Aſſembly at <hi>Perth.</hi> [one of the 5. Articles of <hi>Perth</hi>] And wherein he imployed the ſervice of his worthy Chaplain, Dr. <hi>Young</hi> Dean of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and re-eſtabliſh theſe Feſtivals. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in purſuance of his Majeſties earneſt deſires this way, was it not enacted in that Aſſembly, that the ſaid Feaſts ſhould be duly kept? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was, &amp; that not without much wiſe care &amp; holy caution, which act becauſe it cannot be had every where, and is well worthy of your notice: and that which clears the point in hand, I have thought good here to inſert: The tenor of it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109039:12"/>
is this, <hi>As we abhor the ſuperſtitious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Feſtivall days by the Papiſt: and deteſt all licentious and prophane abuſe thereof, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of profeſſors, ſo we think that the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefits received from God by our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts Birth, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſending down of the Holy Ghoſt, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably and godly remembred at certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar days, and times, by the whole Churches of the World, and may be alſo now; therefore the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ordains that every Miniſter ſhall upon theſe days have the commemoration of the aforeſaid ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable benefits, and make choice of ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Texts of Scripture, and frame their doctrine and Exhortations thereto, and rebuke all Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious obſervation, &amp; licentious prophanation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> I could, if it were needfull, give you other proofs of K. <hi>Iames</hi> his zeal for theſe days: but what ſhould I ſpend time in proving there is a Sun in the Heaven, &amp; light in the Sun, the name of that great King ſuffereth for his exces this way. Seeing then the Church of God, his anointed Law, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and Reaſon, are for us in this point (and I doubt not but we wil gladly be on their ſide) Away with all Innovations and frivolous quarrels, we were divided enough before, and little needed any new rents; the God of Peace quiet all theſe diſtempers, and unite our hearts one to another, and all to Himſelf; Farewell in the Lord.</p>
