         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, becauſe ſome Truths, I here indeavour to make legible,
<pb facs="tcp:115338:5"/>
the tyranny of Cuſtome and Policy labors to conceale, as deſtructive to the Project of Government; and therefore unlikely to paſſe by wiſe men, without a formall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe; who have beene long ſince taught by unerring Experience, That Ignorance drawes with the leaſt reluctancy, in the Yoake of Obedience; being of ſo ſheepiſh a Nature, as ſhe is no bodies foe but her owne.</p>
            <p>Next to ſpare you the trouble of arming your Reaſon, in way of defence, upon every Alarum, They may receive, from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſer or weaker Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For not carrying the
<pb facs="tcp:115338:5"/>
markes of your particular Intereſt, you may ſtand, as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, behind the Curtine of indifferency, and heare without bluſhing the Opinions of others, if chance or your will ſhould pleaſe to make Them the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Diſcourſe. Amongſt whom, if any accuſe Them, as too cheape and obvious, They are unadviſed Queſtioners of their owne Charter, in caſe they ſhould be Fathers: who were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd yet the fredome to teach their Children to manage an Hobby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, without offering violence to Gravity or Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Neither do we ſo ordinarily
<pb facs="tcp:115338:6"/>
fall through the unevenneſſe or difficulty of the way, as careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance in the <hi>Journals of former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> This makes it the greateſt demonſtration of Paternall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, like the Pelican, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect my ſelfe before you, and by ripping up mine owne Bowels, to let you ſee where the defects of humanity reſide, which are not only the occaſions of many corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Diſeaſes, but of moſt of the Misfortunes accompanying Life.</p>
            <p>And though, in paſſing through ſo much weakneſſe, They are rendered more deficient, then,
<pb facs="tcp:115338:6"/>
conſidered in their owne Nature, in truth they are; Yet, being the beſt I am able to afford you, They cannot but be looked upon by You for as lively a Monument of my Love, as if they bare the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall Impreſſe of a worke of <hi>Solomons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in regard of Time, none can be more opportune then this, in which men carry breaſts of ſteele againſt thoſe of their own Profeſſion (ſome niceties excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) under the imperious pretence of Religion.</p>
            <p>If any blinded with Ignorance, or miſled by a more candid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould engage for the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
<pb facs="tcp:115338:7"/>
of Theſe, or any thing elſe, I have writ: I am conſcious of too many flawes in my ſelfe, to be ſwell'd beyond my naturall proportion.</p>
            <p>Your ſake alone produced Them, that during the little time I have to live, you might turne to my Iudgment, upon all occaſions, without trouble; and converſe with me being dead, without feare.</p>
            <p>There is no great difference between good daies, &amp; evill, when paſt; yet if thus fortified by the Advice of a Father, no leſſe then the Prayers of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable

indulgent Mother, you ſhould breake out into Extravagancies, preſuming on the Opinion of your owne Iudgment, and the mediation of our Love, (Though it would be the ſevereſt curſe remaining in the cuſtody of Fortune, yet unlayed upon mee:) I doubt not, but to receive more comfort, from a Patience able to beare it, then you ſhall from a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſufficient to blot it out.</p>
            <p>But it is neither Delight in me, nor Charity unto you, by Iealouſy to antedate Crimes

never yet commited; I deſire you therefore to take theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, as markes to ſayle by, not for preſages of Shipwrack.</p>

to unfold the Riddles of all States: None making more faithfull reports of things done in all nations, then Embaſſadors; who cannot want the beſt Intelligence, becauſe their Princes Penſioners unload in their boſomes, all they can diſcover.

of their tongue and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your owne, to profeſſe your ſelfe a Maſter therein, eſpecially ſince they ſcorne to learne yours. And to ſhew this is not grounded on my ſingle Judgment, I have often been informed, that the firſt and wiſeſt Earle of Pembroke did returne and Anſwer to the Spaniſh Embaſſador, in Welch, for which I have heard him highly commended.</p>
            <p n="10">10.

the ſinns of Solitude, making ſimple Fornication to ſprout into Adultery.

If none of my perſwaſions, nor others wofull Experience dayly met with in the world, can deterre you from Yoaking your ſelfe to anothers deſires, make not <hi>a celebrated Beauty</hi> the object of your Choice; unleſſe you are ambitious of rendring your houſe as populous as a Confectioners Shop; to which the gaudy Waſpes, no leſſe than the liquoriſh Flyes make it their buſineſſe to reſort, in hope of obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a lick at your honey-pot, which though bound up with the ſtrongeſt obligations or reſolutions, &amp; ſealed by never ſo many proteſtations, yet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115338:32"/>
feminine veſſells are obnoxious to ſo many frailties, as they can hardly beare without breaking the pride and content they naturally take in ſeeing themſelves adored; Neither can you, according to the looſe cuſtome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, decently reſtraine her from this concourſe, without making demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of jealouſy towards her (by which you confeſſe your ſelfe a Cuccold in your owne imagination already) or incivility to ſuch as come to viſit you, though it may be ſtrongly preſumed, your ſake hath the leaſt ſhare in this Ceremony; however tied in manners to attend with patience, till his <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> perhaps his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> hath pumped his witt dry, having no more Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments left but to take his leave; Thus with his invention rebated, but not his Luſt, he returnes home, where the old preſerver of baudery, his Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Perceiving by his dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that he came ſhort of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, &amp; wanting a new gowne, imbarks herſelfe for the employment; &amp; to put the honeſter face upon ſo ugly a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,

ſhe contracts a ſtrait alliance with your (yet-poſſibly-unconquered) Bedfellow, and under pretence of a Goſſiping, or perhaps a voyage to ſome religious exerciſe, hurries her away in his Honour's Coach to a Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where though ſhe be taken by ſtorme, is fairely ſent home with bag and baggage, being only plundered of what you are not likely to miſſe; And finding it unſafe to complaine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes againe upon her parole, or ſo often as her new Governour pleaſeth to ſummon her; ſheltering the fault under cuſtome, your unavoidable fate, or perhaps Providence (which for their excuſe, ſome are wicked enough to pleade) till her forehead be as much hardened with impudence, as yours is by reproaches &amp;c. And yet he is the happier owner, who hath a wife wife enough to conceale the reall Hornes of her husband, than ſhe, that being innocent, doth by her light car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage make the baſe ſymptomes appeare in the world's opinion. Oh remember this when you are about to forget the

pleaſure and ſafety only to be found in a ſingle life.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If you conſider <hi>Beauty</hi> alone, quite diſcharged from ſuch Debentur's as ſhe owes to the Arts of Tire women, Taylors, Shooemakers, &amp; perhaps Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; you will find the Remaines ſo inconſiderable, as ſcarce to deſerve your preſent thoughts, much leſſe to be made the price of your perpetuall Slavery.

            <p n="11">11. The <hi>Engliſh Lawes</hi> are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo far in favour of <hi>Wives,</hi> as if our Anceſtors had ſent Women to their Parliaments, whilſt their Heads were a wool-gathering at home; allowing no abuſing of husbands Capitall, nor marriage diſſolvable, but in caſe of Adultery, not ſubject to proofe but under the atteſts of two witneſſes at

one and the ſame time: Nor is non-co-habitation a ſufficient diſcharge from his keeping all ſuch children, as her luſt ſhall produce during his aboad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the four Engliſh Seas; ſo as if his wife be a Strumpet, he muſt banniſh himſelfe, or deale his bread and cloaths to the Spurious iſſue of a ſtranger; a thraldome, no wiſe man would ſell himſelfe to for the faireſt inheritance, much leſſe for trouble, vexation and want during life. Whence it may be ſtrongly preſumed, that the hand of <hi>Policy</hi> firſt hung this Padlock upon the liberty of men; and after Cuſtome had loſt the Key, the Church, according to her wonted Subtilty, tooke upon her to protect it; delivering in her Charge to the people, that ſingle wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock was by divine Right, making the contrary, in diverſe places, Death; &amp; where ſhe proceeded with the greateſt moderation, Excommunication: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thereby (beſides four fift parts of the world) the holy Patriarchs, who among their ſo frequent Dialogues held with their Maker, were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

for multiplying Wives and Concubines, reckoned to David as a Bleſſing, &amp; to Solomon for a marke of magnificence. Nevertheleſſe the wily <hi>Prieſts</hi> are ſo tender of their owne Conveniencyes, as to for bid all <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> to themſelves upon as heavy a puniſhment as they doe Polygamy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others: Now if nothing capable of the name of Felicity was ever, by men or Angells, found to be denyed to the Prieſthood, may not Marriage be ſtrongly ſuſpected to be by them thought out of that liſt? though to render it more glibb to the widet ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the long abuſed Laity, they have gilt it with the glorious Epithite of a Sacrament, which yet they loath to clog their owne ſtomachs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
            <p n="12">12. However the patient ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Inſtitution of <hi>Marriage</hi> is the more to be wondred at, ſince Man and Woman not being allowed of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall ſtrength, are yet ſo farr prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by Policy, as quietly to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to one Yoke.</p>

And to ſuch as aske, How ſhould the world ſubſiſt, did all obſerve the like caution? It may be anſwered, As well as without Unthrifts, who by ſpending their eſtates profuſely, make way for wiſer men to be the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: and as it is impoſſible to find a dearth of the latter, though not compelled thereunto by any other Law, then the inſtigation of their owne folly; ſo doubt not but there will be enough found of the former, to ſtock the world, without putting ſo chargeable an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment on your owne conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</p>

And can your Reaſon promiſe you to continue the ſame unto Beauty, ſo tranſitory, as it is in a manner loſt, before you can truly conſider, whether it belongs to Nature, or the Dreſſe? therefore when diſcontented with your preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tumble towards any change, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then into that bottomleſſe pit, out of which no repentance can bayle you.</p>

This requires, Love to be uſhered, into this undiſſolveable nooſe, by Diſcretion: ſince it hath rarely fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len within the compaſſe of Example, that both parties (if wiſe) ſhould be cordially pleaſed with their bargain: Therefore the Yoke of Marriage had need be lined with the richeſt ſtuffe, and ſofteſt outward conveniences, elſe it will gall your neck &amp; heart, ſo, as you ſhall take little comfort in the Vertue, Beauty, Birth, &amp;c, of her to whom you are coupled.</p>

for by commendation you ſhall the better ſcrue out the true Opinion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have of it; which upon your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like will be concealed, or heightned out of ſhame, or oſtentation.</p>

ſhreek at the ugly buggs, may poſſibly be found crawling in the magnificent Tombe of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; which alſo hinders the variety of ſuch contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reſurrections, as unarched Bodies enjoy, without giving interruption to That, which He, that will not againe die, hath promiſed to ſuch as love him and expect his appearing: Beſides, that man were better forgotten, who hath nothing of greater moment to regiſter his Name by, then a Grave.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conteſt not with ſuch frantick peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as deny men the <hi>Buriall</hi> formerly cal'd Chriſtian: ſince unquietneſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes a living Body more, then a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony can advantage one that is dead. This and an hundred other changes ought not to perplex our Reſt, who are leſſe intereſted in what can happen after our death, then in that was extant before our birth; No bookes being legible in the Grave.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Neither can I apprehend ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in <hi>Death,</hi> as ſome do, that render their lives miſerable to avoid it; meeting it oftentimes by the ſame way they take
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115338:84"/>
to ſhun it. Death, if he may be gheſt at by his elder brother Sleep, (borne before he was thought on, and fell upon <hi>Adam,</hi> ere he fell from his Maker) cannot be ſo terrible a Meſſenger, being not without much eaſe, if not ſome voluptuouſneſſe: Beſides, nothing in this world is worth comming from the houſe-top to fetch it, much leſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the deep Grave; furniſhed with all things, becauſe empty of deſires.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And concerning a <hi>future account,</hi> I find the Bill to ſwell, rather then ſhrink, by continuance; Or if a ſtronger propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to Religion, reſides in Age, then Youth (which I wiſh I had no cauſe to doubt of) it relates more to the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Body, then any improvement of the Mind; &amp; ſo unworthy of any other reward, then what is due to the effects of humane infirmities.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To conclude, Let us <hi>ſerve God</hi> with what reverence we are able; and <hi>do</hi> all the <hi>good</hi> we can; making as little unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary worke for repentance, as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And the mercy of our Heavenly Father ſupply all our Defects in the Son of his Love. AMEN.</p>

               <hi>Thus I have left you finiſhed (Deare Son)</hi> a Picture of the World; <hi>in this at leaſt like it, that it is fraile and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; being an Originall, not a Coppie; No more forrein help having been imploy'd in it, then what my owne miſerable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had imprinted in my Memory. And as you have by Triall already found the Truth of ſome of theſe; So I moſt earneſtly beg of you, to truſt the reſt, without thruſting your fingers, like a Child, into thoſe flames, in which your Father hath formerly beene burnt; and ſo, adde by your owne purchaſe, to the multitude of inconveniences, he is forced to leave you by inheritance.</hi>
