            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. he would do duty to both, and be found without offence to either. 2. In respect of all Actions, Companies, Places and Times; he was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised <hi>always,</hi> not after a Sermon or Communion only, not under some heavy Cross, or after some notable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and delivery only, but he aimed, designed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be so constantly and equally.</p>

                  <p>I shall at once and together propose several <hi>Doctrines</hi> clearly deducible from the Text, the prosecution where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will help to clear both the words and the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> whereof is, There are many sorts of offences both toward God and toward men that we are subject an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41558:22"/>The <hi>second</hi> is, There is within every man a Conscience that takes notice of every piece of his carriage, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly affected with it, and affects the man for it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> is, What-ever things are offences toward God or Men are also offensive to the Conscience, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever sin strikes against his Law wounds the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is, It's a very good, choice, and excellent thing for a Believer to walk so, as to keep a Conscience always void of offence toward God and toward Men; and on the contrary it is a very ill thing at any time to have offence toward either of them lying on the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> is, It is the duty of all men and more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Believers to walk so, as they may always keep a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science void of offence, yea it is not only a duty, but we may look on it as an excellent mean for advancing of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> is, Where men honestly aim to keep a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science always void of offence, it will be an exercising and uptaking thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> is, Where this exercise is neglected and not seriously carried on, the Conscience is left to stumble at, and to abound with, offences.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>first,</hi> That there are many kinds of offences which People are subject to, toward God and Men; It is a thing uncontroverted by all, and we need say little of it; only <hi>first,</hi> There are sins against the first Table, which are offences toward God, being immediatly against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there are sins against the second Table, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be against God, yet immediatly they touch and reflect on men. 2.

                     </gap>ins against the Law of God and wounding of the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That there is a Conscience within every man which takes notice of every peice of his carriage, and is accordingly affected with it, and affects him for it: This is the ground of all that follows, and had need to be more

                  <p>For further clearing of this, we shall speak a little <hi>first,</hi> To what this Conscience is, if it be possible satisfyingly to explain it. 2. To the use and ends of it, and why God hath placed this in man; where we shall shew the several sorts of Consciences that are in men, good and evil.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> to wit, What Conscience is, we may for coming at the understanding of it, consider the name <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> which signifies a co-knowledge, or a knowledge going along with our knowledge: which we may consider, <hi>First,</hi> As looking to Gods knowledge going alongst with ours, and ours going alongst with his, and thus it implyes as his knowledge of all our thoughts, words and ways, so our knowledge together with his of these, or our taking notice of them with respect to his knowledge. 2. We may consider it as reflex-knowledge joyned with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41558:24"/>
knowledge, as for instance when a man hath a direct knowledge of Prayer as his duty, and a reflex knowledge going along with the practise or exercise of the duty, whereby he sees and discerns himself, either to behave suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in it, or to be faulty; in this respect Conscience is a practical knowledge taking notice by a reflex act of a mans ways. 3. We may consider it as comprehending a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods Law, and then it signifies a knowledge of our selves compared with the Law, it hath knowledge of the rule, and so of what is duty and what is sin, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all it hath in it the knowledge of our selves and of our conformity or disconformity to the rule; <hi>Conscience</hi> then in this respect is a mans knowledge of Gods will and of himself as compared with it. 4. We may consider this co knowledge as it supposeth beside the knowledge of our selves, the knowledge of something taking notice of us, or of something deputed in us by God to keep a record of all our carriage and particular actions, and so it is looked on as some way different from us; hence it is called a <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the testimony of our conscience.</hi> Hence also a man will appeal to his <hi>Conscience;</hi> and it doth when in any measure in exercise, impartially and incorruptly bear witness, and a man<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To clear it yet a little further, there are in Conscience these <hi>Three</hi> things, 1. There is the laying down of some ground, such as the Law, or the word of God, by which it puts a man to tryal; which is, That we call the <hi>major</hi> or <hi>first</hi> proposition of the Argument: As we may see in <hi>Iudas</hi> when his Conscience wakened, it layes down this ground (which is done by light) he that is guilty of innoceat Blood, hath broken the Law of God, and may



<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41558:24"/>
expect horrible Wrath. 2. There is an assuming, which is the <hi>minor</hi> or <hi>second</hi> Proposition of the Argument, or the <hi>Assumption,</hi> if the man be guilty of such and such sin; As thus, But I <hi>Iudas</hi> am guilty of Innocent Blood, and have broken the Command of God, (and this the Conscience by it's Testimony confirmeth) Then 3. It draweth the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> and speaks forth the mans Lot, and gives out his Doom, what he may expect; as in the present instance; thou <hi>Iudas</hi> mayest expect horrible Wrath from God, this Conscience applyes, and layes home unto him; every Conscience hath these <hi>Three</hi> in less or more. The way of Conscience its Reasoning and Concluding, is different from a mans Knowledge and Light; For a man may see Sin and not be touched with it: It d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As to the <hi>2d.</hi> The <hi>use</hi> of Conscience, or the <hi>Ends</hi> wherefore God hath put this in Men and Women, which I shall draw to <hi>Three</hi> heads; that may be as so many <hi>Reasons</hi> of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. He hath done so for this end, that by it he may keep up his Soveraignity, Power and Terribleness; and keep men under the awe and dread thereof; For this which is called <hi>Conscience,</hi> will make the sto<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

When the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> bring a women taken in adultery to Christ, intending thereby to trap and insnare him, He sayeth, <hi>He that is without sin amongst you, let him cast the first stone at her;</hi> Whereby their Consciences were made to bear such faithful Testimony against them, and to carry such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with it, that they were all forced to steal away one by one; and yet they needed not to have thought shame on account of any thing we hear men could have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged them for; But Conscience had such an awe and force on them, that there was no resisting of it. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-history does also tell us that such is the power and force of Conscience, when it is awaked, that it will make <hi>the knees to smite one against another,</hi> even of a <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and will make a <hi>Gouernour Felix to tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> end is, That God may hold Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at their duty, in going about these things which are commanded and prescribed by him, and in abstaining from forbidden sins; For, if there were not some awe from Conscience, what extravagancies would they loosly run into, who have no fear of God and of his Word? And thus Conscience hath a force to put men to duty, in these respects. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It discovers Duty, and holds it before them, when the Lord hath commanded to Pray, read the Scriptures, to keep the Church, and wait upon Ordinances dispensed there; to keep holy the Sabbath day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conscience puts a man in mind of these, and when he neglects any one of them, will say to him, thou shouldest be in another place, or about other work; so when <hi>Davids</hi> heart smote him, it helped him to see his Duty. 2. There is an obligation to Duty laid on by Conscience, so that the man cannot shift it, he



<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41558:25"/>
cannot, he dare not say, such a thing is not my duty, for Conscience beareth it in and layeth it on him convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3. There is an efficacy in Conscience to pouss to duty, from this comes that restlesness and disquiet that is often in Men and Women, when duty is omitted that they can have no peace till it be gone about. 4. Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence inviteth to duty, by promising peace upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it: On the other hand, Conscience hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to restrain from Sin. 1. By discovering such and such a thing to be Sin, and though the Soul would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding endeavour to digest it, yet Conscience makes a challenge to go down with it. 2. By threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sinner when it's warning is neglected, and not taken; telling him that he shall repent it one day, and that it will make him repent i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 3. By taking away the sweetness of Sin, and leaving a sting in place of it; as when <hi>Achab</hi> killed <hi>Naboth,</hi> it said, <hi>Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?</hi> And from this arise challenges, and fears of the execution of threatned Judgements, which quite mar the comfort the man expected, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such and such a thing; in all which it keeps a majestick and stately divine way becoming Gods deputy, and bears witness for him against the Sinner.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>3d.</hi> end is, To abbreviat (as it were) Gods process in judging men, to justifie and clear him, and to make way for his Sentence whatever it be; 1. It conduceth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

It citeth him to compear and answer for neglecting such and such a duty, and committing such and such a Sin, and he connot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly shift compearance. 3. When he doth compear, it giveth in a L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41558:26"/>
such and such circumstances. 4. It serveth to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yea in place of a thousand witnesses, and there is no denying or shifting of what ever it beareth witness to; All which we may see in <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. who say one to another, <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought us and we Would not hear, therefore is this distress come upon us;</hi> The Law discovereth that it was a Sin, Conscience challengeth and accuseth, they are cited, the accusation is given in and proven, this and this they did, and did it with all these circumstances; not a pitiful word that <hi>Ioseph</hi> spoke, nor a tear that he shed in the anguish of his Soul, beseeching them to desist, but they remember it now; and there is no shifting of the challenge and accusation, nor covering of it, as they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to their aged Father <hi>Iacob;</hi> but they must needs now take with all, and confess we have sinned, and <hi>are very guilty concerning our Brother,</hi> &amp;c. 5. It passeth Sentence, and in this respect, the heart is said to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> when the thing is evil, and to absolve or <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,</hi> when the thing is good, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21. 6. When it hath Sentenced and Condemned, it leaveth not the man so, but goeth on and executeth the Sentence, and turneth a gnawing worm to bite and gnaw, and as an Executioner to Buffe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and Smite, to Damp and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Man; Thus ye may see how useful Conscience is to help forward Gods Judgement, and to vindicat him in his Sentence: And as it is thus with a guilty Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, so it is with a Conscience absolving, it will absolve when men condemn as we may see in <hi>Paul</hi> here; when men give in a lybel and accuse, it will discharge, as <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. <hi>Men and brethren I have lived in all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God untill this day:</hi> and when Conscience hath absolved it maketh cheerfull, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conscience,</hi> &amp;c. And 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 20. <hi>If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God:</hi> So then we see Conscience hath these <hi>Three</hi> great uses and ends, 1. To keep people in



<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41558:26"/>
awe of God, and of his greatness, and to keep them in mind that they must give an account to him. 2. To hold them at their duty, and they should be very loath to contradict it. 3. If duty be neglected, to record all their faults, and to accuse and sentence them therefore, and never to leave pursuing them, for Conscience will continue as a worm in hell gnawing for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First Use</hi> serves to bear in this truth on you; that there is such a thing as Conscience, the most ignorant and profane and haughty of you all, whether young or old, one and other of you have a Conscience, that taketh particula<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> notice of every thing in your walk, that record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, that accuseth or excuseth; and though ye take not head to it now, ye will one day be made to know it; take it therefore for a certain truth, that ye have such a thing within you, that ye have a Knowledge with your Knowledge, even a Conscience that remembreth when ye would forget.</p>
                  <p>The minding of this is useful, 1. To make people cast out with Sin rather then with their Conscience. 2. To make them wary that they take not liberty in secret to Sin. 3. To make them take kindly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs for Sin; Remember therefore that there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in every one of you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ye will possibly think it needless to press this, and I wish it were so, but we may shortly point at these evidences, to prove that many on the matter think they have not a Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, That they take so little pains to prevent a quarrel from their Conscience; how many omit, balk and step over Dutie, and go on in Sin? Which they durst not do if they believed that they had a Conscience. 2. The few challenges that most have under many Sins, and their living in such peace and security, as if they had not a Conscience to disquiet them, many Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know, and are as little acquainted with challenges and convictions, and stand in as little awe of Conscience as if they had none at all; Hence we use to say, that such a man has not a Conscience, because, though



<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41558:27"/>
he have it, he regards it not; and such a m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n has a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, because he maketh use of it, and listens to what it says. 3. That people seek more to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in outward and seen Duties, than in inward and secret ones, and look more after mens Approbation then Gods, and lean more to, and lay more weight on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward testimonies from men, then to, and on inward ones from their own Conscience. If Conscience were really believed to be, there would be as great aw of God, and as great loathness to Sin in secret, as before many witnesses.</p>
                  <p>But ye will <hi>Object</hi> and say, seing every one hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, what can be the reason that many care so little for Conscience?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. What is the reason that men care so little for God? If they care not for the Lord and Master, it's no wonder they care so little for the Deputy and Servant; shall we therefore think that there is not such a thing at all as a Conscience in such? No, by no means; it will prove indeed, that they slight Conscience, but not that they want a Conscience. 2. There is in many men a contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with and provocking of Conscience, which in Gods righteous Judgement maketh a silent Conscience; when the Lord maketh Conscience quick, and sets it on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and check for Sin, and men do not listen to it's checks and reproofs, Conscience offendeth, and will not reprove: Conscience being Gods Deputy, taketh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from him, and when God will <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot vouchsafe a word of reproof on a man, neither will it; <hi>Ephraim is joyned to idols let him alone,</hi> saveth the Lord, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 17. And from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21. We may see the cause why God giveth up the heathen <hi>to a reprobate mind, to do things that are not convenient,</hi> To be their going cross to the light of nature, and their natural Conscience, and not only doing things sinful, but taking pleasure in them that did them; therefore they are given up to do greatest things without check or challenge: Hence it is thus in part at least, with many Professors within the visible Church, for



<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41558:27"/>
thwarting with Conscience; and indeed a silent and dumb Conscience is a great plague, for if it cease to be a reprover, and speak not, men, nay, even godly men, may and will sleep on, as <hi>David,</hi> after the going over the belly of his light, and blunting the edge of his Conscience slept long enough, till Conscience at last roused him up: Hence also the Apostle speaketh of some Consciences which <hi>were seared with an hot iron;</hi> which is not so to be understood, as if Conscience were flesh, or of a fleshly substance, only he maketh the comparison, that as a mans flesh is sensible of, and affected with the prick of a pin, so is Conscience with Sin, while tender; But as the flesh of a Man or Beast, when it is seared or burnt, a considerable thurst will not much, if at all affect it; So is Conscience, when stupified, and made sensless, by multiplied Sins against light, it groweth so cauterized and seared, that hardly any Sin, or challenge for Sin is felt. 3. Men want not a Conscience, though they hear it not always speaking; for Conscience may often be speaking when they take not head to it; As is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, for that which is the Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> evil of a natural man, may sometimes be the sore and dangerous sickness and distemper of a child of God; And though Conscience may speak but softly for a time, yet thereafter it will speak louder, and make it known that it spoke when it was not listened unto: The day cometh when the Books will be opened, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will speak plainly, smartly, and home, and it concerns you all to know, that Conscience is not absent when it is quiet; but that it will speak, and speak to purpose in due time, and that as a party with whom there is no Trysting till it come before the great Judge, and then it will give in what it hath to say; and it will then be evidently known that there was a Conscience in the prophanest person, who most cauterized it, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the belly of it's Light and Suggestions.</p>

                     </hi> This was his great Work, and it is indeed a sweet Work, yea a short sum and compend of a Christians Life.</p>
                  <p>When we discoursed last from this Text, and had drawn some general Doctrines from it, for clearing the words, we spoke more particularly to this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> viz. <hi>That there is in all men and women a conscience that taketh notice of every piece of their carriage, and is accordingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and affecteth men for it;</hi> Some thing which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth them as it is affected; if their carriage be good it speaketh good to them; if evil, it speaketh evil to them, Hence its said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> Something also was spoken to what Conscience is, and what is its office: We shall now add a <hi>third Doctrine</hi> (though it be not the third in the order that we proposed the <hi>Doctrines</hi> at first) which is this, <hi>That Christians ought so to walk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea if they be tender they will aim and endeavour so to walk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in nothing they may give their conscience offence.</hi> The foregoing Doctrine is common to all, <hi>viz.</hi> To have a Conscience, but this to walk friendly with the Conscienc, so as not to offend or wrong it, is not common to all, but peculiar to him who is a Christian in earnest; as the Apostle speaketh of himself in the preeceeding <hi>Chapter, ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Men and brethren, I have lived before God in all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science until this day,</hi> (supposing him to mean since his conversion) and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of our conscience,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>We trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly:</hi> and his pitching on this as a great ground of his consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in straits, is a clear evidence that it is not a common thing, but peculiar to the tender Christian: Hence is the

                  </p>
                  <p>For further clearing of this point, we shall shew <hi>First,</hi> What it is not to offend the Conscience. 2. That a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ought to walk (and if he be tender, will walk) so, as he may not offend his Conscience. And 3. Make use of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>For clearing of the <hi>first,</hi> we shall shew 1. What offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Conscience. 2. What it is not to offend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The <hi>first</hi> of these may be comprised in these <hi>three</hi> generals; 1. That whatever is sin against God offenneth the Conscience, for Conscience being God Deputy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute by him, and sustaining his place, and <hi>vicê</hi> in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Soul to give sentence for him, whatever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends and wrongs God, must also offend and wrong the Conscience; and though every sin doth not always at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sensibly and feelingly affect the Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it maketh way for that, and proveth to be an offence and wrong done to it, in that it layeth the ground of a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. 2. That is an offence and wrong to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which is against light and knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though the impulse of Conscience, according to that light, be not always so vigorous, yet where there is a thwarring with light, there is a daring of Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a contradicting of it, and (as it is <hi>Rem.</hi> 14 22.) a man then <hi>conde<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>neth himself in that which he alloweth,</hi> and layeth the ground of a challenge against himself in that wherein he hath light and clearness. 3. Conscience is offended or wronged when any thing is adventured on that is contrary to the Impulse of it; as when Conscience sayeth that such or such a thing ought to be done, and we notwithstanding leave <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>ot to be done, and yet we do it: since Conscience (as we said before) takes notice of all a mans thoughts, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,



<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41558:30"/>
words and ways, to give in a word for God, when that which it says for him is slighted, it cannot but be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and wronged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Not to offend, but to keep friendship and a good understanding with the Conscience, supposeth and taketh in, these things, 1. To have the judgment clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed anent the mind of God; for though Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be above us, yet it is under God, and therefore it ought to be informed from his Word; and we lay a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block before it, when we endeavour not to have the eye single (as the Lord speaks) and the understanding clear. 2. To listen and lend the ear to hear what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sayeth, and after deliberation to be sweyed and determined according to what it saith, in doing or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, for unless we take heed to the voice of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we know not when we please or displease it. 3. To ply and steer a straight course according to the dictate and direction of Conscience, to take orders (to speak so) from it, so as when Conscience pointeth at such and such a thing as evil, to stand and sist there, without daring to meddle with it, or move towards it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when it holdeth forth such or such a thing to be a duty, straight way to give obedience to it; herein mainly consisteth a good Conscience (considering it with respect to its exercise, when once made good) to have our Conscience saying nothing against us, and without having ground to say any thing against us; when it cannot challenge us and say that it injoyned us to do such or such a thing, and that yet we did it not, or that it injoyned us to forbear such or such a thing, and that yet we went on to the doing of it, so that when we come before God it may have nothing to reprove or challenge us for, nothing to condemn us in; but as it holdeth out our duty to us from the Word, just so to endeavour to behave in all things.</p>
                  <p>For the 2d. thing proposed to be spoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Believer ought, and if he be tender, will walk so, as he may not offend his Conscience; These <hi>three</hi> things will confirm it. 1. The very nature and office of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;



<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41558:30"/>
If so be that Conscience speaketh for God and is appointed by him as his Deputy, to be a remembrancer of Duty, and a restrainer from Sin, then the awe of God and love to him will make a man that is tender, walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the directions of Conscience; hence it is that <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. the commands that are laid on for Gods sake, are also laid on for conscience sake, <hi>Wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake;</hi> that is from the awe of God, that putteth us to our duty, and from respect to Conscience his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in this respect the voice of Conscience is the voice of God; for as a man cannot be tender who refuseth to hear the Word of God, so neither can he be tender who refus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to comply with the directions of his Conscience speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind of God to him. A <hi>second</hi> reason is drawen from the great advantage that floweth from the testimony of Conscience; it giveth much quietness and sweet peace in all straits and troubles, and much confidence and holy boldness in approaching to God, <hi>If our conscience condemn us not,</hi> (says <hi>Iohn) then have we confidence towards God;</hi> In a word, whatever condition a man can be in, it proves his friend, nay his best friend. A <hi>third</hi> reason is taken from the great prejudice that cometh to a man through his thwarting and coming in tops with Conscience; he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that sweet inward peace that passeth all understanding to keep and garrison his heart and mind, whereby he is much exposed and laid open; God looketh terrible-like upon him, and he hath no access to him with boldness and confidence; when the Conscience is disquieted, troubled, and as it were through other, or confused, and fears arise, and challenges are wakened therein, these threaten a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from God, and portend a storm of wrath to follow: hence is <hi>Davids</hi> complaint, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 3. 4. <hi>When I keeped si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, my bones waxed old through my roaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> &amp;c. and his lamentation throughout the 51. <hi>Psalm;</hi> and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks very weightily, <hi>If our heart condemn us. God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things,</hi> where he plainly insinuats, that the Heart or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science



<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41558:31"/>
its condemning, is the forerunner of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and an evidence of it; and that withal the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, as more absolutely infallible, so more terrible then the former; where these three go along together, it is impossible where a person is tender but he will be loath to top or thwart with his Conscience.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Uses</hi> which we proposed to speak to in the <hi>Third</hi> place, they may be drawn to these <hi>fou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> 1. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and instruction in the matter of Duty. 2. For tryal, and to evidence who are sincere Believers. 3. For reproof. 4. For exhortation; there being need of all these, especially to such Christians who take but little heed to their Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Use</hi> sheweth what is Believers duty; they should by all means learn to know and take up what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science saith from the Word of God, and labour to have their Conscience well informed; and take notice of what it speaketh ere they do any thing, and what are Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thoughts of it, after it is done, and accordingly to be affected, determined and swayed. It is true, the Law of God is the supream rule, and to be hearkened to in the first place; but that which we are now speaking to, is, concerning taking advice from Conscience, which 1. Doth make the Law speak more sensibly, lively and aloud, then before. 2. It maketh it speak more plainly, for when peoples reason will be ready to shuffle by a word, that sam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> word coming into, and taking hold of the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will become more clear and convincing, and it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the understanding, being thereby made more single, to take it up better. 3. It maketh the man more impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, when the Word cometh not to his judgment only, neither will he leave the Word with his light and reason simply- nor to debate with his inclination and affection; but putteth the Word and his Conscience together and taketh the meaning of it some way immediatly from his Conscience, it maketh him single and unbyassed (as I said before); and sometimes a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Conscience will speak when the judgment hath little or nothing to say; so it



<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41558:31"/>
decideth often betwixt the opposite reasonings of the judgment for both sides. 4. The advice and dictate of Conscience is much more powerful then that of the simple judgment and reason, and adhereth better and more close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then affection or inclination; Conscience being more directly Gods Deputy, and in a more immediate subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sticketh more <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enaciously by duty; and it being as a check to our humours, and as a Compass to steer our course by in all things, we are to be swayed by its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; hence some who can almost debate nothing in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet will not dare for Conscience to do such a thing.</p>
                  <p>Some necessary <hi>Questions</hi> relating to practice arise from this <hi>Use,</hi> which we shall speak a few words to. As 1. If any other thing beside Conscience may have an impulse to duty? 2. If other things may have an impulse to duty (whether it be credit, interest, inclination, will, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,) how may the impulse of these be decerned, and differenced from the impulse of Conscience? 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dictates of Conscience may always be followed, seing its impulse may be wrong? 4. What should be done in such a case, and how may we difference what is right? 5. Whether a man and his Conscience may be friends and agree together in a wrong cause or practice?</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>first Question,</hi> Whether any thing beside Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science doth or may pou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to duty? We answer affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, Many things may court us which by their impulse do often <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hwart with Conscience, hence is the inward combat in the Christian betwixt the Flesh and the Spirit; the Flesh doth pouss to one thing, and Conscience to the contrary; therefore <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. it's said, <hi>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these two are contrary one to another;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaketh of <hi>a law in his members rebelling against the law of his mind, and leading him captive to the law of sin in his members;</hi> more particularly these things (as we hinted before) may have an impulse toward the doing of duty, As <hi>first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Mens credit, hath a strong impulse, where any thing crossing it, is apprehended to occur. 2. Mens



<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41558:32"/>
interest hath often an impulse, so as to carry on a selfish design, it will make gain seem to be godliness. 3 Mens natural inclinations, will and affections, have an impulse also, and the impulse of these will sometimes be exceeding like to the impulse of Conscience, and here we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these <hi>three</hi> things which they have influence upon. 1. They may have influence to mar a mans light and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his understanding, as it is said of a gift, <hi>It blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the understanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> so mens credit, interest, and natural inclination, may in a sort bribe the understanding and blind the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment insensibly, and the man not know of it distinctly at least. 2. When they have perverted the judgment they may engage the affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and these drive violently. 3. If the man yield not to such a thing, his credit or interest will vex him like Conscience, and take rest and quiet from him; as we see in <hi>Herod, Matth.</hi> 14. 9. who when the dancing Damsel suited for the head of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist, was sorry</hi> (or grieved,) <hi>nevertheless for his oaths sake, and for them who sat at table with him, he commanded it to be given her;</hi> Folk would have thought that it was his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that made him sorry, but indeed it was not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science but Credit; therefore it is said, <hi>not only for his oaths sake, but for them that sat at table with him;</hi> it's like if his oath had been been given in privat, Conscience would not much have troubled him; and while it's said he was <hi>sorry</hi> or grieved, it sheweth plainly that his Credit suffered him to get no rest until the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll turn was done; under pretext of keeping his oath; <hi>Herod</hi> was predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly swayed by these who sat at Table with him, and would have it thought that he was to be excused because otherways he could not forsooth keep his oath, who yet had broken many an oath, and made no bones of them.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>second Question,</hi> How may the impulse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science be known and discerned from the impulse of Credit Interest, inclinations, Will and Affection? <hi>Answer,</hi> By the Word, <hi>To the law and to the testimony, Isa.</hi> 8. 20 Conscience is subject to that, and Conscience never rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily



<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41558:32"/>
pouseth against duty holden out by the Word; Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would never bid <hi>Heroa</hi> take away the life of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man. 2. If a man be dark and doubtful in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, Conscience as Conscience is always single; but Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, Interest, and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> like, have always some by-respect, which stealeth in and drowneth Conscience, representing to it that such and such loss or prejudice will follow on such a thing: Interest and Reputation will make a man say, I would no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Light, by thinking that which is wrong to be right, 2. In respect of Practice in application of the Rule: And therefore it is needful to speak a word for clearing of both; And <hi>First,</hi> In the general, when we say that men should walk according to their Conscience, we understand it of a Conscience well informed, and in the exercise of Duty, as knowing its Masters will and doing it; for a wicked man may have a good Conscience in respect of Light to tell him what he shall do, and to challenge him when he doth wrong, though yet he will not obey it; Therefore we say for a man to have a good Conscience, is, to have a well informed Conscience, and doing duty accordingly.</p>

Sort is a <hi>Scrupling</hi> Conscience, which differeth from the former in this, That it is clear in the main of duty, but scrupleth and is unclear in some accidental thing, that goeth along with it; As for instance, when one would pray, and apprehendeth that in praying he will take Gods name in vain, because it may be some blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thought is injected into his mind; or when a man is about some necessary duty of his lawful calling, and hath some thing like an impulse of Conscience to pray, which haunteth, and some way vexeth him; This is a scruple, but upon a light ground, and hath little or no reason for it; yet it is born in with violence, and therefore in this case, a man is oblidged rather to go over the scruple and follow his duty; for, although he should endeavour to satisfie his Conscience, by reason in this case, as in the former; yet when the duty is clear, he

                  <p>It is not of these Consciences that we mean, when we say that ye should so walk as ye give not offence to your Conscience in any thing; the Conscience of many speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but alace they stop the mouth of it; therefore take every sort of Conscience to the Word, and suspect that Conscience that is silent when the Word speaketh.</p>
                  <p>A 4th <hi>Question</hi> is, Whether a man that hath an erring Conscience may not have peace and quietness? If so, how may that peace and quietness be discerned from true peace of Conscience? (where also the 5th <hi>Question</hi> is somewhat at least indirectly touched on.) <hi>Answer,</hi> A Conscience, may be pleased while it is erring and in a wrong course, but it cannot have true peace; even as we may please our Brother when we flatter him in his sin, and please him



<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41558:37"/>
not to his edification; so a man may have not only quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but a sort of delight and sainness in an erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but no true peace, because it wanteth the Word of God for its ground; even as an hardned Conscience may have quierness and yet want true solid peace; as when Conscience is mistaken or in an error, and agreeth well with the mistake or error, it will be well pleased; so when it is humoured and applauded, it is well pleased, and will make the man think that he doeth God good service, while in the mean time he is doing nothing less; yea it will have a sort of delight and fainness flowing from the delusion of its light, and will make the poor man to be well pleased and satisfied when he gets that which he is seeking, to succeed and go with him.</p>
                  <p>But how shall it be discerned? <hi>Answer</hi> 1. It is suspicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like when the Conscience is overwell pleased, and when Conscience and mens humours are both pleased together, and when corruption doth not side and take part against it, this (I say) is a shrewd evidence that Conscience is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; for when a man is going aright about his duty, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, will be against him; but when all is silent it is no good token; when <hi>Paul</hi> is a delighting himself in the law of God, there is a law in his Members rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law of his Mind, and leading him captive to the law of Sin in his Members. 2. It may be known by this, when Conscience hath more contentment and peace, and greater delight and fainness in such or such a particular supposed duty, then in all other duties; as for instance when a man thinketh nothing of but undervalueth Infant-Baptism, and must needs be baptized over again; and when he is re-baptized, he hath more satisfaction and (as he thinks) more comfort in that Duty and Ordinance, then in all other duties he goeth about, (though his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing be indeed no duty called for from him), that is an evidence of an erring Conscience; for if it were the peace, comfort and satisfaction of a well informed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he would have comfort, if not alike comfort in all Duties and Ordinances; so when some men have more

It may be known by a mans more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary frame and way, it is hard to say that Conscience putteth a man to such or such a thing, and to change his way in such or such a particular indeed to the better, when yet it doeth not set him on endeavours in the strength of Grace to change his way and life in the general tract of it; for as true Grace is uniform, so a well informed and truely good Conscience, makes a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an universal and uniform change in his way; and without all doubt it is as clear a duty to pray, to search his Conscience, to walk without giving offence, to hear the Word, to meditate thereon, to injure no man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet he will be strick in such a particular, but prayeth no more, waiteth no more upon Ordinances no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he had wont to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this looketh very like an erring Conscience, for (as I said just now) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science maketh not a man to change in one thing only, but it puts him to endeavour also a change in all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beware of such deceit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, for Conscience is much abused in this time; it is indeed an excellent thing to keep a good Conscience and void of offence; but it's a desperate thing to make a Shoe-horn or Stalking-horss of Conscience, to make it subserve our own humour, and the carrying on



<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41558:38"/>
of our own particular Interest; or to leave the Word and to pretend Conscience, and to be swayed by Interest, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of Conscience: There is great need then to look well to the Word, and to have the Word and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science going hand in hand together; to keep near God, and to walk in holy fear that Conscience have not any thing wherewith it may charge us justly.</p>

                  <p>THere are many sad mistakes about a Christian life, and the serious and zealous following of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for men either diminish from Holiness as to the extent of it, or dispense with and take a liberty and latitude to themselves in the following of it.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Text</hi> we have a short and sweet sum of <hi>Pauls</hi> life, (an excellent copy and pattern of a Christian walk and conversation,) wherein he giveth us a view of these two. 1. Of his aim and design, to walk so as he may have a Conscience void of offence toward God and toward men; and that in an universal extent <hi>always,</hi> or at all times and in all things. 2. Of his manner of prosecuting it, <hi>Herein</hi> (saith he) <hi>do I exercise my self:</hi> he is seriously taken up with it, it is his great business, his <hi>one thing</hi> as he calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>We spoke of these two generals. 1. That there is in all Men and Women a Conscience that taketh notice of their actions, and is ready to be offended with their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages.



<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41558:38"/>
2. That Men and Women, and more especially Believers, ought so to live, and if tender, will aim so to live, as they may be friends with their Conscience, and that there may be good terms and a good understanding betwixt them and their Conscience; that their Conscience may have no challenge against them in any thing of their walk either toward God or toward Men: This is clearly and convincingly holden out in <hi>Pauls</hi> practice here, whose great aim, design, and endeavour was to walk so, as his Conscience might have nothing to say against him in duties relating either to God or to Men, in secret, in private, or in publick; This we prosecuted a little, and shewed you, that there is a tye and obligation lying on men so to walk and to follow (not an erring and deluded Conscience, but) Conscience rightly informed, pousing, accusing, or excusing according to the Word, for it is Conscience so qualified that is the rule subordinate to the infallibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating rule of the Word.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Uses</hi> of the Doctrine (as we shew) are <hi>four,</hi> the 1. For Instruction. The 2. For Tryal. The 3. For Conviction or Reproof. The 4. For Exhortation. We spoke a little to the <hi>Use</hi> of Instruction the last day, to which now we add; that if men should so walk as their Conscience may have nothing to charge them with, nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to cast up to them wherein they have thwarted with it; then every mans design in his Christian walk ought to be as extensive as his Conscience is in its office, either in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, or in accusing or excusing; otherways he cannot have peace in his way, if he disperise with himself in any thing which his Conscience doth not dispense with him in; and it will be impossible to have solid peace if he do otherways; so then the walk of a Christian ought to be equally and exactly extended (no less then is the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) according to the rule of the Word.</p>
                  <p>Beside what we said on this before, anent having clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from the Word in the Judgment, and hearkening to the voice of Conscience rightly informed; We shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

pray was this, but Conscience un-informed in, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the righteousness of God? from which ignorance of Christs righteousness, and of the way of coming to him, it came to pass that <hi>they went about to establish their own righteousness:</hi> So then the natural man, or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, when he hath come the length of some honest meaning, is disposed to think that he hath done very well and that he hath a good Conscience; yet though he may have a good Conscience in some respect, or in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects mentioned, and the like, yet to have it simply, and positively from solid and good grounds, giving him a good Testimony, is impossible; and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath not the Word going along with his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in reference to his whole carriage, and in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the principles, motives, ends and designs of his actions testifying for him, and therefore I say, he hath not the Testimony of a truely good Conscience.</p>

In respect of its <hi>rise,</hi> there is a defect in the Judgment, for if the eye be blind, if the understanding be dark, the Conscience must be so too; <hi>They have</hi> (saith the Apostle of the <hi>Iews) a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and being ignorant of the righteousness of God, they go about to establish their own righteousness;</hi> However zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous they were of God, or others, such may be, yet they are ignorant in three thing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, 1. In the extent and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meaning of the Law; supposing (for instance) that a man keepeth the <hi>Sixth</hi> Command, when he is not guilty of any gross act of Murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Seventh,</hi> when he doth not actually commit Adultery, or Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not knowing or considering that a look arising from the flame of lust within, is a breach of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and so proportionably in other Commands: Even as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> conformed the Law in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof to their own practice, and not their practice



<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41558:44"/>
to the meaning of the Law. 2. They are ignorant of the way of Gods righteousness, and of that which, giveth the Conscience solid ground to speak peace; many if they have an honest meaning in their praying, reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, waiting on publick Ordinances, if they put their bodies to some sort of pennance, or be ready to give if it were the half of their estates to have their souls safe, and if they have a sort of seriousness in all this, think that all is well with them, and that they have a very good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if this peice of ignorance were well discerned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one soul out of Christ would have peace, because none out of Christ have solid grounds of peace, for none have their hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience but these that are in him. 3. They are ignorant of their particular case, they know not what sins they are guilty of, nor what Conscience sayeth of them, they think it speaketh better things to them then indeed it doth; some guess at it, some mis-interpret it, and some repe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This then is the first defect, <hi>viz.</hi> a defect in the Judgment. The <hi>2d.</hi> Is a defect as to singleness and sincerity in the natural mans best condition, such are never single when at their very best, even when they are most serious in Prayer, they are but going about to establish their own righteousness; when they fast, and give alms, and the like, it is that they may have some ground for a good opinion of themselves, or that others may have a good opinion of them, being always acted from selfy motives and for self-ends.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>3d.</hi> defect, Is the want of unbyassed Affections, these being partial and byassed will put the man to reason and dispute for the silencing of his Conscience; and this eye not being single the whole body is full of darkness; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections being inclined or sweyed to this or that side, they will seek to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Ye may remember the point we spoke a little to last day, was, That Believers ought, and when they are right, will have it for their exercise and study to have a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence toward God and toward Men; whence we drew this <hi>Use,</hi> That it is an evidence of a sound Believer when right and in a good frame, even to be thus exercised; a tender, lively, and good frame of soul <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In clearing of this <hi>Use,</hi> there are some <hi>Doubts</hi> that arise on the one side when Conscience speaketh good to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son



<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41558:46"/>
without a warrand, in which case it is very dangerous to take direction from it; and some <hi>Doubts</hi> arise also on the other side, when Conscience doth challenge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, when there is no ground for it; something there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be spoken for clearing and solving both the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>The last thing we left at was, That seing some natural men, civil moral men and hypocrites may think they have a good Conscience, that they are right and have the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of it, how shall that testimony be discerned? or wherein doth it differ from the testimony of a truely good Conscience, that giveth a Believer ground to draw this conclusion from it, that he is real and sincere in the work of Grace?</p>
                  <p>For clearing of this matter relating to these Consciences, that speak good when there is no ground for it; There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of persons that fall here, and are thereby culpably accessory to this delusion of and from their own Consciences, 1. Some fail in mistaking Duty and the rule of Duty, supposing that to be an acceptable duty which is but the shadow and appearance of duty; and this makes all self righteous-men and legal-hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes who thwart not the dark or dim light of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but rather follow and comply with it, to think that they have a good Conscience: as it was with <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion. A <hi>2d.</hi> sort are these who take with sin, but think that they have a good Conscience, and on this ground their Conscience speaks peace to them though it hath no warrand to do so, supposing themselves to be Believers, on that ground Conscience speaketh peace to them when it hath no warrand nor are they Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: And thus alace! many that are reputed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others to be Believers, fail; these are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous hypocrites, as the others are legal hypocrites; and this kind of Conscience may be called a presumptuous Conscience, that speaketh peace and applyeth mercy when it hath no ground for either. In answer then to the <hi>Question,</hi> we shall give some differencing Characters



<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41558:46"/>
or characteristick differences betwixt the Believers good Conscience, and these other sorts of Conscience, some whereof agree more to the one sort, and some more to the other, and some to both, but take them together.</p>
                  <p>The Characters are these, 1. A really good Conscience is not easily attained nor maintained, it putteth a man to considerable exercise <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re he come at it, and to no less how to keep it. <hi>Herein do I exercise my self,</hi> &amp;c. saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle; security and negligence are no good toke<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s; there are these <hi>two</hi> things that a man of a good Conscience is exercised in. 1. To prevent the ground of a challenge from his Conscience, by endeavouring to give it no offence; against which the presumptuous hypocrite sinneth, who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth that he hath peace and it may be, thinketh much of it, and yet is not troubled nor taken up how to prevent the giving of offence to his Conscience, nor his meeting with a challenge from it; the legal hypocrite also sinneth here, in bounding and limiting his Holiness to such or such a small measure of it, without so much as aiming any further. 2. He is exercised to satisfie his Conscience when it is offended; hence is the application to the blood of sprinkling, the exercise of repentance, the self-loathing, and sharpness of challenges, that Conscience hath with it until it recover, even such exercise as will in a manner <hi>break the bones</hi> and <hi>turn the moisture into the drought of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. this good Conscience cannot look on sin and not be troubled; and therefore they who ordinarily and habitually can look on sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble or sorrow, and judge it a very easie business to quiet and stop the mouth of their Conscience, who speak peace to themselves when lying still under guilt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of and unremoved, carry about with them a shrewd token of no good Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> Character whereby it may be known, is, the mean and way that a man taketh to quiet his Conscience when it is wakened; A good Conscience as it yieldeth a man peaceand testifyeth well concerning his state; so that peace riseth not so much from this that he hath no sin, as from



<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41558:47"/>
his flying to Jesus Christ for the pardon of sin; he may have peace as to his sincere and universal aim at Holiness, and as to his honest and serious endeavour to abstain from every known sin, as it was with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 18. 20, 21, 22. but as to the satisfying of Divine Justice he hath hath no peace, but in resting on Christs satisfaction alone; for though his way may be and is good in respect of his single following of duty, for he readeth, prayeth, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet corruption in a great measure polluting all these works and duties of his, as to the acceptation of them on their own account and for themselves; he finds that they are in some respect but dead, as wanting much of the soul and life of them, neither can he have peace till he betake himself to Christs blood: though he were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating every day, praying every hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he hath no peace in these till Christs blood speak peace; as we may see in <hi>David,</hi> who though he had peace intimated by <hi>Nathan,</hi> yet is not thorowly quiet for all that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prayeth <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Cause me to hear the voice of joy and gladness;</hi> there is no healing of his wound till a word from God himself do it: It is on the contrary an ill token, when a Conscience seeth sin, and can speak peace to it self on this ground, that there is mercy in God; and yet never applyeth the blood of sprinkling, to purge it from dead works; nor seeketh to have the Word spoken as it were from Gods own mouth: and on the other side the legal Conscience will make amends to God, will give him Sacrifices enough, and perform many duties to him, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his acceptance only on account of these, and that is as ill a token; but a good Conscience resteth not on any of these; but though it hath the sacrifice of a broken and contrite spirit to offer to God, yet it doth not rest on that nor on any duty, but is put beyond these, to rest on Christ and on his Sacrifice, <hi>Purge me with hyssop.</hi> &amp;c. saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51. And this is a clear and certain differencing mark, even to consider well whereon Conscience resteth for peace after a challenge, and to make sure that it resteth thus on Christ.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41558:47"/>A <hi>3d.</hi> Character is, That a good Conscience will both challenge and speak peace at one time; it can stand up and defend it self against a challenge; thus when the Law on the one hand comes and charges it with many defects in duty, and denounceth wrath against it because of these, it will humbly take with them; and yet on the other hand, in the very time it can betake it self to Christ and produce a word of peace that it hath ready at hand from him; this we may see in <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>I was</hi> (says he) <hi>before, a blasphemer, a persecuter, and injurious: but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy.</hi> It is an evil token when men either have only challenges and no peace, or only peace and no chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges at all; as it is also an evil token to offer to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace by shifting challenges; or to give over pressing after and maintaining of peace by giving way to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges: But it is a good token when Conscience can take kindly with and be humbled under challenges, and yet debate against them so as to keep and maintain peace, and can give a warrand for its doing so, which is indeed a great practick in Religion; we may see a clear instance of this in <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

him, he will with <hi>Iudas</hi> run and hang himself, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then abide that tormenting Conscience of his, terribly denouncing war and wrath from God against him.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>4th.</hi> Character is, That a good Conscience will love to entertain and welcome a challenge, but an ill Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot abide nor endure a challenge, and if it could, it would have Conscience always silent and quiet, when yet it should not be quiet, neither hath it any ground to be so: He who hath a good Conscience is glad to have sin discovered and Conscience kept waking; he thinketh a sanctified conviction of sin a valueable mercy; and the reason is, because he aimeth not so much at this to have peace in himself, as to have a good and solid ground of peace betwixt God and him, and to remove what may mar it; whereas the Hypocrites great design is to have peace on any terms and by any means, and therefore when a challenge cometh closs and home to him, it is quite marred; It is on this ground that a tender soul will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly aggrege sin, and even foster a challenge, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth, <hi>Psal.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>5th.</hi> Character or Difference is, That a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence maintaineth its peace both from the Law and from the Gospel, and will needs have peace in some measure in respect of both, else it will not be satisfied; The evil Conscience again taketh its peace from the one and not from the other, and so taketh a wrong rule or ground for founding and trying of its peace; An honest man that hath a good Conscience, hath respect to the Law and will not thwart it; yea, the challenging and condemning part of it is welcomed, and the threatnings of it have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on him to make him fear; and as he respecteth the Law, so he respecteth the Gospel, and looketh well to Believing, Repentance, Self-searching, Examination, Meditation, and to his manner of performing these and

of all his other duties, that none of them come in the place of Christ, or get any thing of that which is his due; and though he seem to himself to have faith in Christ, if he endeavour not to have Holiness going along with it, he dare not speak peace to himself: But on the contrary, the legal man or law-conscience, if it be in good terms as he supposeth with the Law, it looketh not to the duties of the Gospel, whether the man be indeed fled to Christ, or be in good terms with God through him; and on the other hand, the presumptuous Conscience when it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Law and the threatnings thereof, it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And in the by, ye who think ye have good Consciences, try them by this mark, if ye walk humbly under Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-convictions, taking with them, and if they be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to you as well as a word of peace.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>6th.</hi> Character or Difference, is, That a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is holily jealous and suspicious, while an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is presumptuously confident and bold; we say a good Conscience is suspicious, and therefore is often put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it self to proof and tryal, taking the sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the rule and trying it thereby, and taking the answer on deliberation, and not off-hand or by guess; because it knoweth Conscience is but a servant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will try if it speaketh its masters, even Gods language; to this purpose saith the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified;</hi> it will either have Consciences sentence and Gods sentence going toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or else it will reject and cast it; whereas the most part of men satisfie themselves with the sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and look not after Gods sentence, and mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Conscience and take its first word (as it were) and put it not to the tryal: Ah! is not this true of many of your Consciences? ye think ye have peace and that all

matters are clear and well betwixt God and you, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing ye be secure, ignorant or profane, but when do you put your Conscience to the tryal? ask your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if in all the Word of God peace be spoken to the Wicked, or to any that is not sincerely aiming and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to be holy? consider that word <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>The Lord will speak peace to his people and to his saints;</hi> there is not one word of peace for the profane and unholy: How then can your Conscience possibly speak peace? if it presume to do, it will most certainly beguile you; and therefore as ye would not be deceived, sollow not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lay weight upon every word that Conscience speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as to your state, especially at first, but try it by the Word; or take its sentence to God and to the Word, and see how he approveth of it, and how his Word doeth warrand it; for (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 12.) <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, that are not cleansed from their filthiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet on this side a <hi>2d. Question, viz.</hi> If Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may not only think it self to be right, but think so in a high degree, so as even to be perswaded of it, when yet it is wrong? <hi>Answer,</hi> Without all question it may; And here we may speak somewhat of a <hi>deluded</hi> Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is a Conscience that not only is wrong, and erreth, and speaketh good when there is no ground for it; but a Conscience that hath these two things beside in it, 1. It hath a perswasion that it is right. 2. It hath the affections somewhat stirred by it, and a sort of joy in the thing, whereof it is perswaded; It's (I say) a Conscience that not only speaketh good without ground, but hath a perswasion that it is right, and a kind of joy in it's way: That there may be, and is such a Conscience among the generality of Professors cannot be denyed, and is clear from what the Apostle says, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>This perswasion cometh not of him that calleth you;</hi> There is a perswasion, and yet not of God; and for the other, to wit, That there may be a joy in the thing, see <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>O foolish galatians who hath bewitched you?</hi> They had a



<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41558:49"/>
sort of conceit and fainness even to a kind fascination and Bewitching conceit, of their being right, neither was there any dealing with them to draw them off that way: There are <hi>Four</hi> sorts of these Consciences among Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, according to <hi>Four</hi> several rises that they have, none of which will warrand them to think themselves to be right. The 1. <hi>Rise,</hi> is, from laying too much weight on supposed reason; There is a kind of delusion that ariseth from this ground; which was it wherewith the <hi>Galatians</hi> were carried away, having heard first from the Gospel, of the righteousness of Faith; And thereafter, from some false Teachers, of the righteousness of the Law, as necessary to be added to it, in the point of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; They thought there was good reason for such a Doctrine, and that no loss nor prejudice could come by it; and therefore they did joyn both together. The <hi>2d. Rise,</hi> Is, when men lay too much weight on great, though yet but common Gifts, as on liberty in Prayer, and warmness of the af<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ections therein, on Preaching notably, and one standing it out in sharp Tryals with the approbations of others, it may be even of the best, or when they have been helped to do some extraordinary things, as in the Primitive times, some Professors were helped as Gods Instruments to cast out Divels, to speak with tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who yet were not sound at the heart; it is on this ground that Christ goeth, when He saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 27. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>Many shall come to me in that day, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord, we have prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and done many wonderfull works:</hi> All which are (as I just now said) but common Gifts, though some of them at least, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and when men come to have any measure of these beyond others, they will not be beat from it, but will go to death with it, that all is right with them: The <hi>3d. Rise,</hi> is from some supposed spiritual sense and comfort, and from some flashes of joy; These temporary Believers spoke of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to some tasting of the good Word of God, and of the



<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41558:50"/>
powers of the World to come; such as once come this length, do what they will, and live as they will, have it (as it were) alwayes sounding in their ears, nor suffer they it to go out of their heads, that such and such a day they met with God, and that he spoke peace to them, and therefore they are perswaded that matters are right betwixt him and them; and yet all this while they may be unsound at the heart, The <hi>4th. Rise</hi> is, From folks habituating themselves to speak good to themselves, and from maintaining their presumption, and dulling and deadning their own Conscience; whereupon, in Gods righteous Judgement, Conscience becometh a plague to them, so that they will dispute and debate with and against any Minister, Neighbour, or Friend, that would convince them of the evil and danger of their State and Condition; and the heart being by them, thus deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, speaketh and pleadeth for them, and deceiveth them back again, they are honest <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>olks, and were never heard with their Neighbours, none have any thing amiss to say of them, and their own Conscience justifieth them, and what should more? Thus having put out their Light, and blinded their own eyes, they have constrained, and some way necessitated their Conscience to cheat, deceive and beguile them: Such as these are spoken of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44: 20. <hi>He feedeth on ashes, a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> The heart is ordinarily taken (as was hinted before) for the Conscience in the Old Testament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Iob</hi> said, <hi>His heart should not smite him while he lived;</hi> And it is said, <hi>Davids heart smote him:</hi> Now such a man as is here spoken of, his deceived heart, or deluded Conscience turneth him aside, so that he cannot deliver his soul, that is, he cannot winde and extricat himself out of that thicket of self deceit, so far as to bespeak himself thus, is it not a lye that I am lipning and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to? And yet this is it that many of you have for a good Conscience, even a deceived heart, or a deluded Conscience; speak to you who will, or what we can, it

is in some respect impossible to put you off that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ancie, and to awake you out of that dream, that you have a good Conscience: And the reason of this delusion is, that men take not the ground of the Sentence of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from God, according to the rule of his Word, but from their own misled Reason, or from some common Gift, or from some piece of sense, or some opinion and fancie of their own heart, that is in some sort deceived by them, and deceiveth them. Now all these Delusions may be in these <hi>Three</hi> respects, 1. In respect of things Doctrinal; A man may be perswaded that Truth is an Error, and an Error is a Truth: 2. In respect of matters of <hi>Practice;</hi> A man may take an evil Turn or Action for a good one, and have a sort of perswasion that it is so, as the <hi>Iews</hi> had in killing the Apostles; who <hi>thought they did God good service,</hi> as the Lord foretold, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 2. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In respect of a mans estate, who thinketh he is in friendship with God, when indeed he is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he draweth his Conclusion from wrong premisses, either failing in the <hi>major</hi> Proposition, laying down a wrong rule; Or in the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition, applying the Rule to himself partially: these things ye should take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you, in what we are to say further on this point.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> of a deluded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, beside these forementioned, of a Legal, and of a Presumptuous Conscience, which may be also Marks of this, it hath these <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> especially, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. 1. A certain frothiness of Spirit, or a light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled frame; The light that a deluded man hath in his state or way, is but like a Dream, that hath no reality in it. <hi>He feedeth on ashes;</hi> and such an one will some way make more Conscience of, and take more pleasure in that wherein he is deluded, then in any other P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ece or Practice of Religion, as it was with the <hi>Iews,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting the Apostles; and with the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> in seeking to gain a <hi>Prosylite,</hi> and yet in all that they do, they are but licking froth or s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um, <hi>Ephraim feedeth</hi>

                     <hi>on wind, Hos.</hi> 12. 1. What exercise of Conscience they have about Religion, is without any sanctifying effect, it stricketh not at the body of Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Godliness; it is readily some frivolous thing, that they are so much taken up with, and are so eager in the persuit of, which proveth but wind and ashes, to whom it may be, in some respect, said, as the Apostle doth to the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Ye began in the spirit, and seek to be made perfect in the flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Second</hi> mark of this, is; There is alwayes in such a Conscience, an un-distinctness, as to the ground whence the mans consolation floweth, or there is much more supposed peace, comfort, joy and satisfaction, then he can give any solid reason for: And they are hugely disproportioned to the foundation they are built upon, ask an hypocrite, what is the ground of his so firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and of the comfort and joy resulting there from? He will readily answer, I think it is so, or I hope it is so, or, if he come to be somewhat more particular, in the account he gives, it will very readily be to this, or some such purpose, God hath been very good and kind to me in such, and such Providences, he hath bestowed on me such and such Gifts and Benefits, which yet are but things external and common; or he will, it may be, say, I prayed to God in such and such a strait, and he heard, and delivered me, and I take that for an earnest that he will hear me also for heaven and eternal Life; as if <hi>Achabs</hi> deliverance from a temporary judgement on his humiliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been to him indeed the earnest of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Or, it may be he will further say, God hath keeped me from many sins, and bestowed many blessings on me, (which he may do unto, and often doth to meer natural men) and therefore he will be merciful to me; such conclusions are broader then the Premises, and the Superstructures then the Foundations; and yet, alace! the perswasion of many is built upon such sandy Foundations, and is therefore but a delusion, since it hath no solid bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: Thus some who are carried away with an error,



<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41558:51"/>
will say they cannot defend, nor debate for such a thing, but they are perswaded of it, as if a well grounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion could be without all reason.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Character, is, That a deluded Conscience can never abide, or endure to be contradicted, or put to a tryal, if any man shall say to such a person. that he or she is deluded, they will be ready to hate him; thus it was with the deluded <hi>Galatians</hi> to whom the Apostle is constrained to say, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</hi> They will readily cast out with their greatest and best friends, and with the men they were wont to love most, when they gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say them in their delusions, as <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth in the forecited place, <hi>I bear you record, that if it had been possible you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would once have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me, and am I now become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</hi> It's an evil token, when a man now hateth another whom he loved before, and on no other ground, and for no other reason, but because he contradicteth him, in that particular wherein he is mistaken.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>4th</hi> Character is, (which is of some affinity to the <hi>2d.</hi>) That as a deluded Conscience is frothy in its comfort, so it turneth a man forthie in his practice, he is much more concerned, and zealous in smal and minute things than in those of far greater moment; as the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth the <hi>Galatians</hi> were, where he sayeth to them, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Are ye so foolish, that having begun in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ye are now made perfect by the flesh?</hi> He straineth at a guat and swalloweth a camel; and is not so much taken up with the whole of Religion, as he is with that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing wherein he is deluded. he hath more love unto, and sympathy with these that are of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion in that particular, then with all the rest of the Lords people that are sound and right; The <hi>Galatians</hi> could not deny, but that <hi>Paul</hi> had more grace then many, or all of these Teachers that courted and wooed them so much into that error, and yet they cooled in their affection to him, and were fond on them.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41558:52"/>A <hi>5th.</hi> Character is, That a deluded Conscience, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ordinarily bitter and cruel in the effects of it; as it is proud and vain, so it will persecute to the death them it differeth from; hence were the Persecutions of the Apostles, and of <hi>Paul</hi> especially; and we have seen it in poor deluded souls, who have thought themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged to slay all that were against them, or differed from them in these their delusions; some what of this bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirit accompanied the delusion of the <hi>Galatians;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle sayeth to them, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>If ye bite and devour one another,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh to the same purpose of such persons, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>If ye have bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not against the truth, this wisdom descendeth not from above.</hi> Bitter zeal and strife is an evil token, and a bitter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is readily no good Conscience; when a man sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himself to be in the right, is carried on with a spirit of bitterness (though in other cases, bitterness, through the power of corruption may kyth, yet it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to delusion.) It floweth from pride in such persons, exalting themselves above all others; Therefore as soon as they are deluded, &amp; go wrong, they must have a Church by themselves, and will joyn with no other persons, in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an communion, but such as are of their mistaken opinion.</p>
                  <p>But a <hi>Third Question</hi> ariseth here on occasion of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>viz.</hi> whether Believers in Christ need to be afraid of a deluded Conscience? And whether they may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, and that with a sort of delight and satisfaction, that they are right when yet they are wrong? (the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter branch of the Question necessarily supposeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which needeth not therefore to be particularly spoken to) We <hi>Answer</hi> with a distinction, that a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be mistaken and deluded in a particular, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deluded as to his gracious state, because, being indeed a Believer, its a most true and certain conclusion which he draws concerning his being in a gracious state, though possibly as to some of the grounds whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it, he may be mistaken, or he may draw it from



<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41558:52"/>
wrong grounds; yet I say in some particulars he may be deluded; as in taking such or such an error to be a truth; and so the first <hi>Three</hi> grounds and rises of a deluded Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we form erly assigned, may agree to him: As, he may lay too much weight on carnal reason, and on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gifts, as some of the <hi>Galaians</hi> did and the Apostles themselves were in hazard to do, and therefore our Lord saith to them <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Rejoyce not in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but that your names are written in heaven;</hi> he may also lay too much weight on sense or comfort; and the reason may be, because when God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously condescendeth to give them now and then some proof that he loveth them, they being in so far deserted, draw a conclusion quite cross to the design and end of that manifestation, as if he approved them in that particular wherein they are mistaken; for as a Believer when he is right may think himself to be wrong, because of the want of sense, so by the rule of contraries he may think himself to be right, because he hath much sense, when yet he may be wrong: I shall for further clearing, instance it in <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six</hi> cases: As 1. When a Believer hath been in some tender frame, praying to God sincerely and hath gotten a hearing, and when some smiling providence meeteth him, and inviteth him to side with such or such a thing, he is ready to think that God calleth him to that thing: or it may be the Christian after Prayer meets with a Scripture that holdeth out that thing which he hath been praying for, whence he rashly draweth the conclusion that he will obtain it, and is ready to think that therein he walks according to reason, if the thing look rational like to him, and suit the matter of his Prayer; we may see something of this, or very like it in <hi>Samuel,</hi> if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the 15. and 16. <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> together; in the end of the 15. <hi>Chapter</hi> he hath very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been praying, when he mourned, and <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 1. he is sent by God to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to anoint one of <hi>Iesses</hi> sons to be king; and when (<hi>vers.</hi> 6.) he looketh on <hi>Eliah,</hi> he presently and somewhat rashly, yet very confidently saith,



<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41558:53"/>
                     <hi>Surely the Lord's anointed is before him;</hi> he having been praying, and the thing looking so rational and purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, was perswaded that he was right, but the Lord reproveth him, and saith to him, <hi>Look not on his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, nor on the height of his stature, because I have refused him; for the Lord seeth not <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t may a tryst of Providence be mistaken? I was in Prayer and such a word met me, and such a Providence occurred to me, and did cast the ballance. A <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>d.</hi> Case is, when a thing representeth it self to the Believer, not only as lawful and honest, but as conducing much to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and to the good of his work, and he meaneth well in it, how ready is he hence to conclude, that he is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to such a thing, and that it is his duty, when yet it is not so: we may see something of this in <hi>David,</hi> who 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 1; 2, 3, and 4. having a purpose to build a house to God, proposeth the matter to <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, who without consulting God, off-hand saith to him, <hi>Go, do all that is in thine heart, for the Lord is with thee;</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding though God loved the thing, and approved of it in its self as a duty; yet it was not Gods mind that <hi>David</hi> should perform it, nor that <hi>Nathan</hi> should have so positively encouraged him to it; hence when a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in it self is pleasing to God, and may be for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, some good people may think it to be their duty, whom yet God never called to such a thing; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to aim to be a Minister of the Gospel is a good thing in it self, and one may have a sort of impulse to it, who yet may not be called to it. A <hi>3d.</hi> Case is, when Believers inclinations and affections are exceeding much towards such or such a thing, very readily there-from they will come to have a sort of perswasion in their Conscience anent that thing; as for instance, when they love one sort of life beyond another, which is not simply unlawful, or one Child beyond another; as we may see in <hi>Isaac</hi> his strong inclination to bless <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 27. we conceive the good man went not against the light of his own Conscience



<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41558:53"/>
in the matter, but he loved him excessively, which made him take the less heed to what otherways Gods promise and way of dealing with his sons might have taught him; even when he is about to die (when men use to be most single,) he is by his excess of affection carried on that same way, though doubtless not inrending to cross Gods purpose anent <hi>Iacob.</hi> And if Imight instance it (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being mistaken by any) in this particular, which doth not seldom come to pass, when two Parties are mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choice each of other for Marriaga, they may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think, but some may be perswaded that they are called to marry such an individual person, because inclination and affection setteth them on, when yet there may be no such call of God; and so it may be in reference to other things. A <hi>4th.</hi> Case is, when Believers think that Gods Interest and their own interest go joyntly together in such and such a thing or practice, though their own interest swayeth more with them then Gods interest, yet they will be ready to alleadge that they care not so much what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their own interest, but they cannot endure no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I do well</hi> (saith <hi>Ionah) to be angry to death;</hi> and he would do nothing but die, and even in that evil frame of spirit he adventureth to pray to God that he would take away his life; for all which passion and precipitation he alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a regard to the great concern of Gods glory, as if by that dispensation his truth and faitfulness would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on, while yet in the mean time, respect to his own reputation that he thought would run a considerable risk and hazard, had thereby for the time a prevalent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on him; and the great impatiency for the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Gourd, says plainly that his own interest lay there, and his being so very ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

greater matter; Thus it was manifestly with godly <hi>Baruch, Ier.</hi> 45. where regard to his own interest had too great a stroak on his fainting and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighing, for which he is sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly checked, <hi>Seeks thou great things for thy self? seek them not;</hi> though no doubt he wanted not respect to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick interest that was now going to ruine in all appearance. A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>5th</hi> Case is, when Believers seem to have or indeed have greater manifestations of God then ordinary, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by while it may be he is only approving and encouraging them, as to the main, they are then in hazard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he is approving them in some particular thing that was never in his mind. As we may see in <hi>Peter,</hi> who <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. at the transfiguration being trysted with a glorious manifestation, draweth this conclusion, <hi>It is good to be here, let us build three tabernacles:</hi> it might have been thought that he would not have mistaken and gone wrong then, by any time, and yet even then he doth so: There is a very common ground of mistake amongst Believers, who if they win at liberty in Prayer about such or such a thing, and get as they think Gods countenance in the duty, they are then very ready to conclude that God certainly approveth of the thing, when yet it may be otherways; but suppose it be so that thou art indeed countenanced in thy duty, yea though thou wert upon the mount with Christ, it will not prove that God alloweth the thing, though he thus manifest his respect to thy self. The reason is that which is said of <hi>Peter, This he spoke not knowing what he said.</hi> A <hi>6th</hi> Case is, when Believers impulse of Conscience proceedeth from zeal without light, or when their light is not proportional to their zeal; for as there may be in Hypocrites light without zeal (which light doth not readily keep them from miscarrying,) so when the judgment of a Believer is mis-informed, and zeal driveth him without light, he then very readily mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries; as we may see <hi>Acts</hi> 21. and 20. <hi>Iames</hi> saith to <hi>Paul, Thou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seest brother how many thousands of Iews there are that believe, and they are all zealous of the law,</hi> &amp;c. their zeal was such for the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that



<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41558:54"/>
neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor any of the other Apostles could get them taken off; and <hi>Paul</hi> was forced to stoop to them in many things, when it might in reason have been thought that they should rather have ceded to the Apostle; Thus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers when not well informed, but having an honest zeal for God, are like a Ship that hath more sail than ballast, and so cannot well bear up into the wind, nor steer a straight and steddy course; and from this honest zeal of theirs they may err and go wrong, yea even be displeased with others, that will not go along with them in their Error: As all these are incident to Believers, so they would watchfully take heed that in these and other such cases they give not credit to, nor lay weight upon all that their Conscience saith.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fourth Question</hi> arising from the former is, Whether it may be thus with a Believer, and yet he be in a good frame? <hi>Answer,</hi> If we mean <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> good frame universally, so, he cannot be; but although he be in many, ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in most things in a good frame, as both himself and others may think, and have good ground to think so; yet he may go wrong in a particular, and in so far he is not in a good frame, as in the instances given before. 1. He may have an honest mind and meaning. 2. In other things he may be very observant of and tender in duty very tractable and obedient to the faith of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keeping the Church, hearing the Word preached, given to Prayer, and to wait on all Ordinances, as no doubt these believing <hi>Iews</hi> were, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 3. he may be in some measure in a praying frame, yea praying in or about the very time he miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, as we see in that forecited <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nstance of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. compared with 16. who had been presently praying and offering sacrifice, when he drew that conclusion touching <hi>Eliah; Ionah</hi> also was praying in that fit of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered passion, and content to die, and desirous to be in heaven, which supposeth some clearness of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; for it cannot in charity be thought that the godly man was desperate or durst so go to God, and yet he was no doubt wrong. Yea 4. He may have great manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

(as we see in <hi>Peter</hi> on the mount) and yet go wrong in a particular, as he did; This sayeth that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as-well as others, should walk in humility and fear, and never be over confident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not sure, in vain that they are bidden <hi>work out the work of thier own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling;</hi> And all men should be very warry unless it be on good grounds, to draw conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the goodness of their estate especially, wherein these greatly failed, who are spoken of, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Because I am innocent, surely his anger is turned away from me.</hi> Only <hi>here,</hi> take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> differences betwixt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions that are in Believers, and these that are in Hypocrites, when they go wrong. 1. In a Believer it is in some particular, and not as to their state, as it's in the Hypocrites perswasion. 2. It's in some accidental or accessory thing, and not in fundamental Truths <hi>3ly.</hi> It is readily and more ordinarily in some thing not simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in it self evil, but in something only that they are not called to of God, though good in it self; in these most readily, and ordinarily, (as I just now said) they may go wrong and stray; but yet they may do so, even in some other things at fits, or under some violent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. We shall close up all at this time with these <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five</hi> Words of Direction.</p>
                  <p>The 1. whereof is, that which we hinted at before, That Believers would walk softly, humbly and in fear, and not be too confident of themselves, or of their own strength; for though they may warrantably be humbly confident that they shall be carried through without, at least final erring in any fundamental truth necessary to Salvation; yet they may slide in a particular practice, or in a point of truth in such things as are (to say so) accessory, and not absolutely necessary; and therefore they should walk in fear, and be war of a despising, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring, and condemning humour that useth to go along with them, who think themselves to be right, and others to be wrong; As the Apostles exhortation is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. 2<hi>dly.</hi> Believers had not need to be rash or hasty, in



<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41558:55"/>
any thing, since much of their erring, whether in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or practice floweth from their haste, and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in drawing conclusions; Whereas, if they patiently waited on God, and considered calmely, and at leasure, they might get another Answer; But we often lay down our Conclusion, and then begin to Try (which is a very preposterous course) Whereas we should first try, and then conclude. <hi>3dly.</hi> Believers should be exceeding se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, not only in trying the thing, but in trying their singleness in it; Considering that oftentimes there is somewhat beside awe of Conscience, that swayeth them in such and such a particular (if they could discern it) such as interest, affection, or the like. <hi>4thly.</hi> They would also carefully observe, and beware of the bitter fruits that accompany delusion in others, which (though they come not to that hight, yet) may come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable hight even in them, such as are severe censuring and judging of others, bitterness, frothiness, <hi>&amp;c. 5thly.</hi> And in a word, They had need to lippen and trust to God, more then to themselves, according to that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exhortation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5 <hi>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding; in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths;</hi> That other word which we have, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. <hi>v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 26. would also be considered, and seriously pondered, <hi>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool, but who so walketh wisely shall be delivered:</hi> Let all learn to be humble, tender, and sober; And God bless what hath been said for this end.</p>

And herein do I exercise my self to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THere is no truth that will be more readily granted then this, which we proposed from these Words, namely, <hi>That all men, and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Believers ought so to live, and walk as in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give their conscience cause of offence:</hi> And yet if we shall impartially put the matter to tryal, there is ground to fear, that the life of many will be found to be nothing else then a continued lie, and practical contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the profession of this great Truth.</p>
                  <p>Because this is, (as we said) so tender and tickle a subject, and because there is so great need to be clear in the true meaning of it, we have been constrained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our purpose, to propose, and answer several <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,</hi> and to move and dissolve several <hi>Doubts,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to make the fairer and easier access to the <hi>Use;</hi> It being so very ordinary for people to think that they have a good Conscience, when indeed they have it not; and so to baffle (to speak so) and abuse Conscience (that should be the most powerfull provoker to a tender and circumspect walk) as to make it a ground of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and un-tenderness.</p>
                  <p>We spoke a little the last occasion to that <hi>Question,</hi> whether not only un-regenerat men may think that to be Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is not? But also whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident even to Believers themselves to think, and that

with some sort of perswasion (I will not say with such grossness of delusion as may be in others) that they are right when yet they are wrong? In answer to which we shewed you, they might, and instanced several Cases, wherein.</p>
                  <p>Now though the last branch of the Question hath its own great difficulty to conceive of it a right; yet since it is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or our edification; (fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> if Believers may mistake, much more may others,) and since it will make way for confirming a subsequent Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a most difficult, exercising, and up-taking thing to keep a good Conscience; and since also it hath very great influence upon, and is very useful to our whole life, it being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the main scope of the <hi>Text,</hi> to press the keeping of a good Conscience, and the sum and substance of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an walk to do so, we shall yet proceed therein a little further, and it will not, we hope, be found to be an impertinent, or wide digression, soberly to do so. That then which we spoke a little to, and will now further prosecute, is, That Believers (though not in reference to their state, yet) in the matter of duty (for both in thinking that to be truth which is not truth, and that to be duty which is not duty, Conscience acteth as the Judgement is informed) may err and go wrong.</p>
                  <p>In prosecuting of this, we shall <hi>First</hi> confirm it from some instances. <hi>2dly.</hi> We shall touch on some Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or aggravating Circumstances of the thing, though not so much in reference to the sinfulness of it, which will make it the more wonderful. <hi>3dly.</hi> We shall give some reasons of it. <hi>4thly.</hi> We shall speak a word or two to the <hi>Use</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>For the 1. That Believers may thus go wrong, we shall confirm it from 4. Instances; The 1. whereof is, That frequent and famous instance of Bigamy and Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, or marrying of two or of moe wives, in the Old Testament amongst the Fathers and Saints; we are far from aggredging their failing in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from making it in them so very odious, yea, we think it may be in some



<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41558:57"/>
respect justly extenuated, and far removed from that degree of sinfulness that it would be among us, and might possibly in some cases had a Dispensation in them; Yet considering 1. The nature of the thing, and the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of marriage, and that of <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. That he made but one man, and one woman for the man, <hi>that he might have a godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seed,</hi> neither can the multiplication of mankind have sufficient weight to make it simply to be no sin. <hi>2dly.</hi> Considering the frequency of it, or its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in so many, that it became almost ordinary; And <hi>3dly.</hi> Considering the effects that followed on it, <hi>viz.</hi> The many discontents and heart-burnings amongst the Wives and Children in the Families of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> It cannot absolutely be excused, in all Cases and Circumstances, else it should make an extraordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensiation (if indeed it was) to be very ordinary, which we have no warrand for. A <hi>2d.</hi> Instance is in <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, who were (no question) gracious men, (as the Lords accepting of them, and <hi>Iob</hi> for them, <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 8. sheweth) yet that they Erred, and were wrong in a Truth in their Judgements, is clear from <hi>v.</hi> 7. of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the Lord telleth them that <hi>they had not spoken right as his servant Iob had done;</hi> And that they did very un-tenderly handle <hi>Iob,</hi> is also clear. The <hi>3d.</hi> Instance is in the Apostles and Disciples of our Lord, They were Believers no doubt, according to Christ's own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 8. And yet we will find them in several things thinking themselves to be right, and that with some sort of perswasion, when yet they were wrong; As in that one tenet concerning the nature of Christ's Kingdom, which they fancied was to be with some earthly Grandour and Pomp, and wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected some Worldy Credit, and Greatness; and in that of <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. 22. <hi>Be it far from th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>stone thee, and wilt thou go up thithe?</hi> And yet how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full this was to Christ, is clear from the whole strain of the Gospel, and from his checking of <hi>Peter,</hi> at that rate of holy severity, saving <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Telling them, <hi>That they knew not what they asked;</hi> And, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. He declareth to them that <hi>it was not for them to know the times and seasons which the Father had put in his own power.</hi> A <hi>4th.</hi> Instance is that which was the very common Tenet, and Opinion of Believers in the Primitive times, among the <hi>Iews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz</hi> That the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was not fully abrog<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ted by the coming of Christ, and is clear from <hi>Acts</hi> 21. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. and 10. <hi>Chapters,</hi> and that there was much un-clearness, in the matter of Christian Liberty; they being some way rooted in their Opinion, anent the distinction of Meats and Dayes, thinking that it was not taken away; And though the Apostles determined it, yet they could not easily be brought off from it.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>2d.</hi> Take some aggredging circumstances, which will make this the more wonderfull. As 1. That Believers may Err<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be mistaken, and go wrong, when in a very tender Christian frame; As is clear in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited instances of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Iob's</hi> Friends, and of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Believers</hi> in the Primitive Times, for, will any I pray deny, but they were in a good frame, when they had so much Liberty in Prayer, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such successe waiting on it? so that the Devils were subject to them, They were also singularly daut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and dandled in a manner, by Christ Jesus himself; and had so much access to God, and so much of his countenance, yet continuing still for a great while in some of these their Errors, and Mistakes. 2. That this may be, not only among the more common sort of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but even also amongst the most eminent; for, are there any more eminent then there we have named<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Patriarchs, Apostles</hi> and <hi>Dis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

36, 39. What the particular was about which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test was, we shall not offer now to decide; it is sure in the matter, one of them was wrong, and it is like both in the manner, and yet both though themselves to be right. 3. There may be mistakes in very concerning and important Truths: Is not that a concerning Truth, about which <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends disputed with him, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would not temporally plague a godly man? And was not that a concerning Truth anent the nature of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wherein the Disciples were mistaken and wrong? And if we speak of matters of Fact, was not that of the Fathers, and other Saints, in the matter of Bigamy, and Poligamy a concerning thing? yet all of them thought themselves to be right, neither did they, (for any thing we know) go against an explicit challenge of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in that matter. <hi>4ly.</hi> It is not one or two, but many that may be under such mistakes, many of the Fathers were mistaken, <hi>Iob's</hi> Friends were so, all the Apostles were so, many thousands, yea, ten thousands of the <hi>Iews</hi> that believed (as it were almost all the Believers of that Countrey) were so, being all zealous of the cerimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law, when yet it was abrogat. <hi>5ly.</hi> They may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fervent and forward, &amp; in that wherein they Err, very bent on it; how vehemently and eagerly did <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends pursue the Dispute, to beat him from a sound principle which they held against him? how serious were the Apostles in these things wherin they erred? How zealous were these sound believing <hi>Iews</hi> for these Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, even after the matter was otherwise determined by the Apostles? And how hot was the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul?</hi> Even so hot, that they parted company. <hi>6thly.</hi> They may continue in such mistakes, notwithstanding many evidences that might serve to bring them off, and against many relevant reasons given them to the contrary, how many un-answerable arguments were adduced by <hi>Iob</hi> to perswade his Friends of their mistake? And yet had not the Lord himself immediately interposed, it's like they might have dyed without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with it; How often did Christ refute that Opinion touching the nature of his Kingdom, by preaching of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and of the necessity of his Death, by telling his Disciples expresly, that his Kingdom was not of this World, and that they behove<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? And yet notwithstanding of all this, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their Error, not only while Christ was with them before his Death, but even after his Resurrection, as is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. And we know what were the decrees of the Synod held at <hi>Ierusalem, Acts</hi> 15. Concerning Christian Liberty, and how it was told the Believers in that time, <hi>That an idol was nothing,</hi> and yet they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to their mistake about their Liberty, and thought still something of the Idol, As <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 19: 19. <hi>7ly.</hi> Their Error, or mistake may be continued in long, and Believers may not only fall hastily, or on the sudden, in an Error of Judgement, or into a wrong practice, but they may live, and ly long in it; It's like that of <hi>Iobs</hi> Friends ended not in a day, nor in a moneth; and that of the Fathers was for many years together, and that also of the Apostles was for several; yea, they may continue so long, that they may die in it, and never come to so much clearness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as once to know that they were wrong; though I say not, that they may die in such an Error and mistake, un-pardoned, yet they may die in unclearness, as to the things being an Error, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to their Salvation, having an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative and virtual repentance of every thing that is wrong and sinfull in them, and so of all among the rest; As the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and many Believers in <hi>Pauls</hi> time went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who, yet very probably did die without coming to be clear in that particular wherein they were mistaken, or differed from others, who were in the right: shall we think that two godly men, living and dying in some difference of judgement, about somewhat not necessary <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41558:59"/>
may not die in that wherein they lived so long, though indeed at death they may come to be more impartial in weighing the grounds of the difference, and mistake. <hi>8ly.</hi> This may be for some generations; as was that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and so it may continue not only in mens own lifetime, but in after generations the mistake may be propagat; as in the Primitive Times, some of their debates were not soon altogether hushed and worn out.</p>

                     <hi>3dly.</hi> These things being wonderful in themselves, we shall come now to enquire a little into the reasons of this, and they are of <hi>Two</hi> sorts. 1. Some speak sinful infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in men, even godly men. <hi>2dly.</hi> Others speak So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity in the holy God</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>First</hi> sort that speak infirmity in us, and are culpable causes of the thing, They may be these, 1. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and Unclearness in the Understanding and Judgement, for the most eminent Believer in his best Condition <hi>Knoweth but in part;</hi> and as his Judgement is mistaken, so readily will his Conscience be, which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth or excuseth according as the Judgement is informed; Conscience pre-requireth, and some way pre-supposeth Knowledge; And therefore the man that wanteth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is called <hi>weak,</hi> so the Conscience of the <hi>weak</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is spoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. that is, <hi>weak</hi> through want of Knowledge. <hi>2ly.</hi> The best and most eminent Believers have a remainder of Corruption in them; and therefore are in hazard, and in a manner ready to side with, and intertain a mistake, if Believers were free of Corruption, it might be thought impossible that they should thus Err, but that will not be till the Soul be separated from the Body; so long as Corruption remaineth there will be a hazard, and readiness in so far, and in some things to mistake, and to follow the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiding of a mis-informed Conscience. <hi>3dly.</hi> Believers are sometimes rash and hasty in drawing a sudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, and too negligent in previous trying; taking that for Gods mind, which is not so indeed; as may be

                  <p>But because we see that such <hi>Questions</hi> are almost endles, and know not if it would be to your Edification to propose moe of them, we have resolved to break them off abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and shall only speak somewhat in answer to an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> or <hi>Question</hi> which cannot well be passed by, and it is this.</p>
                  <p>Can that be a mark of Sincerity, to endeavour to have a Conscience void<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of offence, seing even Believers may often have ane evil Conscience? How then, I say, can it be a mark of Sincerity, and of a sound Believer, to have a good Conscience?</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Answer</hi> to this, we shall <hi>First</hi> shew, how Believers may be said to have an evil Conscience? 2. How it is not in-consistent with the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> nor with the <hi>use.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the 1. We would distinguish <hi>Three</hi> things in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, in reference to their Conscience. 1. Something wherin their Conscience may justly challenge them. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> something that their Conscience without ground may challenge them for. <hi>3ly.</hi> Something that may be taken for the language of Conscience, which indeed is not, by which the Conscience may come to be mistaken.</p>
                  <p>1.

If we take it to be ane evil Conscience, that is not only silent and mute, and ceaseth to be a reprover, for even gross Sins; but also, when wakened, justly challengeth, accuseth, and condemneth for them; a Believer may fall under it both ways, as we may see in <hi>Iosephs</hi> Brethren, and in <hi>David,</hi> who had ane evil Conscience, the first way when it was a sleep, and the second way after it was wakened; though ane evil Conscience considered with respect to the second way, belongeth properly to this head. <hi>2ly.</hi> If we look on ane evil Conscience, as its

When our Inc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, that he is right in nothing; and very ordinarily it is thus with Believers that are not so clear, distinct, and strong in their Knowledge and Faith; When Conscience sayeth, that such or such a thing is wrong, they are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all things are wrong, and nothing right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one thing is wrong; So when Conscience pointeth forth such an end, not only to be lawful, but even laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we may be ready to think, that it allowe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d so to shew how this is not in consistent, neither with the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> nor with the <hi>Use;</hi> We say then. 1. That it is neither of these two last sorts of things we spoke of, that is meant, when we say that an endeavour to keep a good Conscience in all things, is a mark of sincerity; for we speak of a Conscience that mistaketh not, and of a



<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41558:65"/>
Person that doth not mistake his Conscience; And therefore though Conscience prejudge a man of the comfortable application of this Mark, yet it ceaseth not for that to be a Mark. <hi>2ly.</hi> When we speak of it as a Mark of Sincerity, we mean not so much of a persons actual attainment, as of his sincere endeavour; when he dispenseth not with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in any sin, nor in the ommission of any known duty, but is aiming honestly in every thing, to approve himself to God, as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>We trust</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly;</hi> The Testimony is founded more on the sincere aim and endeavour, then what is actually attained. <hi>3ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> In the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we said, A Believer in a good frame, will so aim to live as he may have a good Conscience in all things, and the Objection supposeth only, that when he is not in a good frame, he cannot have a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and that we grant; for he may indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his carnal frame and walk, spoil and rob himself of the comfortable application of this Mark, and so there is no inconsistencie here. <hi>4ly.</hi> This standeth firmely as a truth, that though a Believer had many other Marks, yet they cannot bear him comfortably through, if he want this sincere endeavour to keep a good Conscience; And it is so very necessary to a Christian walk, that a Believer dare not conclude his sincerity, when he (contrary to his light) dispenseth with himself in the commission of any known sin, or in the ommission of any known duty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>3d. Use</hi> is of Reproof and Conviction; If so be Christians ought <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

speak loud, when Sickness and the Cross cometh; As we see it did in <hi>Iosephs</hi> Brethren; in such a case, many of you will find that Conscience hath been much slighted; O! when Death shall come and stair you in the face, what a terrible thing will a guilty Conscience be found then to be? The terror of mad Dogs, of wild Boars, of felrce Lyons, and Tygers, will not be so terrible as an evil Conscience will be, when awakened, and having death at it's back; Nay, suppose that Conscience should not be awakened while ye are alive, and in this world, but that ye should slip, and sleep away like Lambs, <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no bands in your death,</hi> and that ye should die ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded of all men; yet what will ye do with your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? or how will ye stand before it, when ye shall be sisted before Gods Tribunal, and when the Books shall be laid open? Are there not many now in hell, who, if we could hear their language, would very readily bid us, beware to thwart with our Conscience, and to make it our enemy? Wo to them that take an evil Conscience with them to their Grave, it will be a worm that will gnaw eternally, and an inward poyson and Venom Stinging, Burning and inflaming the very bowels (as it were) and all that is within the man, beyond what is here conceivable. We would therefore earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech, and obtest you soberly to think on it; for there are many of you whom this Challenge, and Reproof will reach; And if we should say otherwise to you, who never had it for your aim, to keep a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and who were never exercised to, nor seriously taken up with Religion, we would but cheat and beguile you: Is it possible that ye can thwart with the Law of God, and not also thwart with your own Conscience? or can you thwart with your Light, and your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be still silent?

It needeth not at all to seem strange, seing God and his Word are thwarted with; will they think we stand in awe of Conscience, who stand not in awe of God, and who do not lay weight on his Word, to regulate their Conscience by it? This is the great ground of peoples thwarting with their Conscience, and of their regardlesness of it, even their not standing in awe of God. <hi>2dly.</hi> The most part never consider their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Conscience, nor what is the consequence of thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, or of going cross to their Conscience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that they care not what Conscience sayeth; is there any considerable number of persons, who think that thwarting their Conscience, is such a terrible thing, at it is indeed, and as one day it will be found to be? Many had rather have a very little money in their hand, then the Testimony of their Conscience; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlesness ariseth from the ignorance of it, and of what great concernment it is. <hi>3ly.</hi> Men, even by accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and habituating themselves to thwart with their Conscience in lesser things, do, by little and little stupify, and in a manner, put out the life of their Conscience, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

if they have been a while in the Church, and will seek to stop the mouth of their Conscience with that at night; for they could not at all keep quarter (to speak so) with their Conscience, if they had not some form of Religion; And therefore they will (to speak so) be brave Religious men in some things, that they may get a Dispensation to themselves in other things. But none of these will be found Law-byding, when God cometh to reckon. <hi>6ly.</hi> People in a sort bargain with their Conscience, like these spoken of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>They make a Covenant with death, and are at agreement with hell;</hi> and (like <hi>Naaman,</hi> if that was indeed his meaning) they will yeeld Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence such or such a thing, but no more; They must have a Dispensation in, and a liberty of making Reservations, and Exceptions, of some one or moe things; Though this may not always be done distinctly, formaly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly; yet it is so on the matter, implicitly and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively; <hi>But that Covenant with death</hi> however made, directly or indirectly, <hi>shall be broken,</hi> and <hi>that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with hell shall not stand,</hi> and <hi>the hail</hi> of Gods wrath <hi>will sweep away the refuge of lies;</hi> and Conscience will speak at last, but not with, or under such covers of fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, that men now wrap themselves in: Therefore I beseech you dally not with Conscience, for it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of it, when it is wakened, as it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who acteth in, and by that Conscience.</p>

                  <p>For the 1. It includeth these <hi>Four,</hi> which should go along in your walk; 1.

that will not quiet the Conscience, if ye study not to be right in the manner, and to do it for the right end; The want of these requisit qualifications of accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Duties, will make such things as are lawful on the matter, turn to be grounds of challenge from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: But somewhat to this purpose hath been spoke of before, therefore it hath now been but touched.</p>

                  <p>COnscience is in it self a most excellent Gift of GOD, given to Men, having an excellent nature, being waited with many Rare and choice Uses, and Advantages throughout their whole Life; and when it is rightly used, it is one of the special Freinds that men can have on earth, and one of the great things that this Gospel, and the preaching of it aimeth at; even to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and help them how to come at a good Conscience, and how to keep a good correspondence with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, so as they may be comfortablie assured, that they indeed have this good thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is called a <hi>good Conscience;</hi> Yet when Conscience is abused, or not made right use of, it turneth to be one of the greatest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends and enemies that men have in this World, nay in that World which is to come.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41558:72"/>Having spoken somewhat to this before, and in the last Observation that we drew from the former Text, which was, that men ought to walk so, as not to offend their Conscience in any thing; we shall now speak somewhat to one Direction and help that is greatly, if not mainly contributive and useful in order to the attaining of that notable end; which is this, That men who aim to walk an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably to that Rule, so as in nothing they offend their Conscience, had need to observe carefully the language of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>It is not our purpose to stay on the particular conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the scope of this Scripture, nor so much as to name, let be to prosecute all the points of Doctrine that may be drawn from it, but only to discourse a little from the Words inclosed, and shut up within a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> as they relate to our end and design.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> then in a word, The Apostle is here putting a difference betwixt external service, and the internal power and efficacy of the work of the Spirit of God on the Conscience; And when he is speaking of Baptism, he giveth this Caveat and Advertisement, That it is not the washing of water in that Ordinance, that reacheth the great end of it, <hi>But the answer of a good Conscience. 2ly.</hi> He sheweth that the differencing, and March-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Character of the one from the other is, in what ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the Conscience giveth concerning the thing that the man is about; and declareth that it is not simply a good Conscience, but the answer of a good Conscience that giveth ground of Hope, and boldness of Confidence to obtain the Promise.</p>
                  <p>From the Words these <hi>Three Observations</hi> arise clearly, <hi>First,</hi> That there is a faculty in Conscience, that is able to give <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne answer to a man concerning his spiritual state and condition, and concerning his Actions; So that if the question about these, or any of them be put to the Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It can return answer, and signifie it's sense, and give it's verdict concerning that which it is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about; The <hi>answer of the Conscience</hi> implyeth so much.



<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41558:72"/>
                     <hi>2ly.</hi> That the answer of the Conscience is different and distinct from the outward answer of the mouth or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; for a mans mouth and profession, and the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ingadgement that he cometh under in Baptism, or any other Ordinance or Duty, may say one thing, or give one answer, when the Conscience may say another thing, or give another answer concerning the mans since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the thing. <hi>3ly.</hi> That the answer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, That is, ane answer from the Conscience on good grounds testifying a mans sincerity, is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and comfortable thing.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>First</hi> of these, that we intend to speak a word to at this time, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a way of getting an answer from the Conscience, and of understanding it's mind about any thing that men shall put to it: Or thus, Conscience hath a way of making known it's mind, and giving an answer about any thing that is put unto it: These words <hi>Answer of Conscience,</hi> implyeth so much (as we said) especially being distinguished from the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall service, and administration of Baptism spoken of in the words before; And it is yet more clear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how the scop runneth in comparing of these two together, <hi>viz.</hi> The verbal restipulation of these that are come to age, and the inward answer of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; There is the Gospel on the one side requiring such a thing, and the answer of the Party Baptised on the other side; and the Apostle maketh the answer of the Conscience distinct from that, though sometimes it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth along with it; so that a man will not answer more clearly to the thing then his Conscience will, when it is seriously put to it.</p>
                  <p>This might be branched out in these <hi>Three,</hi> 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a mans state. 2. In respect of some truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the hearts imbracing of it, 3. In respect of some practice or duty that a man is called to: all these do fall under the answer of Conscience, when it is questioned about them; but it is the last of them that we intend to speak to, <hi>viz.</hi> it's answer as relating to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians



<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41558:73"/>
duty and practise, about which Conscience being asked or posed, is able to give him an answer; which I shall clear from <hi>Two</hi> Grounds, and then come to the <hi>Use.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 1. Ground is taken from the Nature of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we some way explained, when we began to speak of this subject; Conscience being deputed of God, in man to take strick notice of every piece of his walk and practice, and being <hi>the candle of the Lord, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the inward parts of the belly,</hi> to let men see what God calleth to, and to put them in mind their duty: This (I say) being the office of Conscience, and the end why God hath placed it in men, it is no doubt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with such a facultie (if we may speak so) as to be able to give an answer concerning what it is queried about.</p>
                  <p>More particularly it hath a <hi>three-fold</hi> power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a mans way; and thus it represents God in <hi>Three</hi> of his Attributs. 1. It hath a power of counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, advising and carving out of a mans duty; So that when he doubteth what is to be done, Conscience hath a power to advise him, and give him an answer; And this is called the <hi>dictating</hi> of the Conscience, answerable to the <hi>Soveraign authority</hi> of God, whereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all his creatures; to whom Conscience is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat; in which respect men are condemned for thwarting with their Conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judgement of God, that they that commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them:</hi> Here is Conscience dictating to men, what they should do before they do. <hi>2ly.</hi> There is a Power, or something in the Conscience, that goeth along with a mans acting, or that waiteth on him in the time of his acting in Duty; And this especially, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Testifying</hi> of Conscience, or it's <hi>bearing witness,</hi> concerning the sincerity, or un-soundness of the Act; Not on<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

floweth immediately from the Conscience joying with, and backing the Word; Now if the Conscience had not a direct, and distinct language, or answer to give to men about their actions, there could be no such effects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Uses</hi> are <hi>Two,</hi> The 1. for Direction. The 2. for reproof; The <hi>Use</hi> for Direction, is, That seing there is such a thing as the answer of the Conscience, whereby it maketh known it's mind, when it is asked concerning our way, we ought, if we believe that we have Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to put them to answer, and to observe what they say, and what answer they return; If Conscience hath a Language (I say again) let us put it to speak out, and let us be very ready, and attentive to hear what it speaketh.</p>
                  <p>To clear this a little, We would consider that there are <hi>Two</hi> things in a Christian walk, in reference to this correspondencie which a man should keep with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, The 1. (which is universal and irresistable) is, when the Conscience asketh men, or putteth questions to them, such as, Why did you this or that? Why did you leave this or that undone? As it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Asking no question for conscience sake.</hi> That is, asking no question for answering of these questions which Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will ask. The <hi>2d.</hi> is, When men ask questions at their Conscience, to prevent it's questioning of them; as indeed we should be taking pains before hand to know, and take up the language of our Conscience concerning our practice in this, and that, and the other particular that it may have no just ground of Challenge against us.</p>
                  <p>I shall instance this in <hi>Three</hi> things, and hold at the <hi>First</hi> for the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. We should observe the language of Conscience before we put our hand to any Duty. <hi>2ly.</hi> We should observe the language of Conscience in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi> or in the very time of our going about Duty. <hi>3ly.</hi> We should observe the language of Conscience concerning Duty, when we have done and gone through with it: In

which my meaning is not, 1. That we should in clear and necessary Duties start, or put questions; but that in things indifferent, in their own nature, and in such Duties as are necessary, and do <hi>semper,</hi> or ever oblidge, though not <hi>ad semper,</hi> or in all differences of time, but only <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> now and then, to wit, at due and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable times; or as to the right timing of these necessary Duties, (for every thing is beautiful in the season there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) Wherein a great part of our work along our whole life lyeth, the answer of our Conscience should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: For though many conditions, stations and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be lawful, yet Conscience decideth, whether I be called to such and such a station and condition of life, and whether such a thing be a Duty to me at such a time, and how it ought to be gone about, as to the manner. Neither. <hi>2dly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Do I mean, that we should, in these things expect any extraordinary thing, or somewhat more then an ordinary impulse of Conscience, laying on a sort of constraint or necessity on us, in an immediat way, which would be dangerous; But my meaning is shortly this, that there is a possibility in Gods ordinary way to know, what Conscience sayeth, to them that will observe the answer of it, both before, in, and after Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that we should aim, and endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand and take up that.</p>
                  <p>For further clearing of this <hi>Use,</hi> we shall speak a little to some <hi>Five</hi> or <hi>Six Questions:</hi> As namely, 1. What this answer of Conscience is? <hi>2dly:</hi> How the Conscience giveth it's answer? <hi>3dly.</hi> What is called for from men, to find out this answer? <hi>4ly.</hi> How this answer of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be discerned? <hi>5ly.</hi> If this answer of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be discernible at all times? <hi>6ly.</hi> What is to be done in such cases, wherein the answer of Conscience is not so clear as men would have it?</p>
                  <p>For the 1. What this answer of Conscience is? I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> in short, That it is distinct from a mans inclination, from his affections, and from his naked Judgement or Light; There is something in a mans natural inclination,



<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41558:75"/>
that is ready to swey him to this or that, but that is not Conscience; There is also something in a mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as in that which he feareth, or desireth, and loveth, that may swey him; neither is that Conscience but often that which is contrary to Conscience; There is likewise something in mens Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Conscience differeth; because an natural, and un-regenerat man, that maketh no Conscience of his wayes, may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing have a light in his Judgement, by which he is put to come to Church, an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> possibly to pray, and do other Duties; and yet it may be from no answer, or dictat of Conscience, that he doth these Duties: We conceive therefore that this answer of Conscience, is something different from, and beyond either Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Affection, or bare Light; and that it is Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science going joyntly together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or some conclusion drawn from the Word (for we are speaking here of Conscience as it is in people living in the Church, under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Word) that such a thing is Duty, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science thereupon putting on to it, or a conclusion drawn from the Word, that such a thing is a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereupon deterring from it; Thus it differeth from Light simply considered, in as far as it is a Conclusion drawn from such grounds as the Judgement, or Light in the Judgement layeth down to, or before it; It is an answer that not only hath Truth in it, which may be from light; but its ane answer as having a truth in it that is drawn from such a ground warranding such and such a practice; Conscience looking on it, as Gods mind, for directing it in it's Duty, and on that account putting on to it.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>2d. Question,</hi> How the Conscience giveth this Answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or how it maketh it's sense and language of things known? In <hi>Answering</hi> to it we would be sober, and not curious, no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> more particular then we have ground for; In short then, we conceive that there are these 4. wayes, how, and whereby Conscience giveth It's answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to let people know when it is pleased or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased. 1. When it bindeth and tyeth such or such a word, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mporting such or such a Duty on a man, that he



<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41558:75"/>
can no way get himself rid of; nor it shaken off, as when he is disputing and debateing within himself, whither such a thing should be done or not done? Conscience answereth on good ground, and either biddeth him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain or do; and hath a pou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s with it, because the word of God commandeth, or forbiddeth it, and this is not only because there is a word for it, or against it; but clear light drawing a conclusion from such a word, whereupon the Conscience bindeth it on the man, so that it cannot be got shifted, nor shaken off; For we know that men may know many Duties, and yet not do them; and upon the other hand, that men may be stirred, or poussed on to do that which it's not Gods mind they should do; so then it is the answer of Conscience, when the Word, and the Conclusion of Conscience are connected, and joyned together; so as the one is the ground of the other, and floweth from the other; and this is the most special way how Conscience maketh it's sense of things known; The Word of God being the rule of Conscience. A <hi>2d.</hi> way, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by some secret discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or restlesnesse in the Conscience, if a man do such a thing as is not Duty, or if he do not such a thing that is pointed out to him to be Duty, either through ignorance or inadvertancy; The Conscience then as it were, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the man with Challenges, disquieteth, and maketh him restlesse till he practise such a Duty, or abstain from such a sin; And this we find to have been often in the Saints recorded in Scripture, they having had no rest till such a thing was done, and such a thing abstained from; which floweth from the nature of Conscience, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing, or breeding discontent, because of un-answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse to the Rule. <hi>3ly.</hi> Conscience hath a way of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying it's mind, by making some impression of terror, to back and second more than ordinary convictions of, and threatnings, and challenges for sin; When sin is committed, Conscience convinceth and challengeth; when this doth not the turn, upon the back thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the threatning, and some fits of terror; sometimes



<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41558:76"/>
the threatning is conditional, sometimes the perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certification is added; sometimes again the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the threatning will be more sensible, sometimes more insensible: When Conscience giveth advice, and dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Word, it maketh use of the Commands; but in the sense we are now speaking of, it maketh use of the threatnings; As for instance, It's said in the <hi>thrid Command; The Lord will not hold him guiltless that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his name in vain;</hi> Now for any degree of this guilt, Conscience challengeth, and when that is slighted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Conscience goeth on, and maketh the threatning terrible; for challenges bear in convictions of sin, and convictions represent the threatnings as more terrible; and threatnings bear in the apprehensions of wrath; and hence is the exercise of Conscience in some that wakneth, and raiseth a terrible storm in it. A <hi>4th.</hi> Way, How Conscience giveth it's answer, and maketh it's mind known, is by an inconceivable inward calmness, peace, serenity, and tranquillity in the Soul; So that when a man reflecteth on his doing of such and such a thing, and comparing it with the Rule of the Word, findeth it agreeable to the same, all his terrors evanish, his mind is calmed, and he findeth much sweet Peace, Delight and Acquiesence in the thing; this is nothing else, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science giving it's answer: all which had great need to be carefully compared with the Word of God, and that his mind therein be very clear; because, as there may be much bastard peace on the one hand, so there may be many groundlesse challenges on the other, which are not to be taken for the language of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>3d: Question,</hi> What men are to do, that they may find out, and get a clear answer from their Conscience? or what is called for from them, to find out the answer of Conscience? We shall <hi>Answer</hi> this in these <hi>Three;</hi> 1. Something is to be done before we put our selves to the search, or Conscience to give it's answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Something must accompany this Duty. <hi>3dly.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is called for after this Duty is done. 1. We are to



<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41558:76"/>
do something before we put Conscience to it to give it's answer. And 1. It is necessary, that men be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Truth of the thing in general; for to come blindly to Conscience is to tempt it, and make it a snare to our selves; Therefore (I say) we should be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end that Conscience may have ground to give a clear answer; For our Conscience is like the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and our understanding like the <hi>Advocat,</hi> that maketh the Cause known; And if all things <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> for, and against, be not proposed and discussed by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat, Conscience, which is the Judge cannot give a distinct answer or verdict; This is the reason why many Consciences do err, because there is not pains taken to inform them. <hi>2ly.</hi> When the Judgement is informed, men should put the Conscience to it to answer; They should not content themselves with this, that they have filled their heads with so many Arguments for such a thing, but should let them sink down to the Conscience, and study to know what Conscience thinketh of them; For Conscience (as we said before) is some way beyond bare Light; therefore, when we have gotten Light in a thing; we should not hold there, but take it aside, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the matter to Conscience; As the Word is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Commune with your heart upon your bed;</hi> There is a communing with others in speaking with them, a communing with Books i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> perusing them, a communing with our Inclinations and Affections, and taking notice what they would be at; and a communing with our Light, if we be clear in the thing; But beside all these, there should be a communing with the heart, or Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; which we conceive is often neglected, and men often start, and strick in with things without deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, thinking if they have Light for such a thing, that it is enough for making such or such a thing to be Duty: It is true, ane Argument from Light may induce to the thing, yet we are neglective, when we bring it not to the Conscience. <hi>3ly.</hi> Men should bring things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to the Conscience, we should take heed that we



<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41558:77"/>
we be not pre-occupled, or prejudged, lest we get ane answer according to our Idol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as we should beware of byassing and bribing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: <hi>If the eye be single, the whole body will be full of light,</hi> but if the eye be not single, darknesse may be had from the Conscience in stead of light: Not that in clear things, that are Duties at all times, we should be sticking and mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nclineth to, and saith, whither it inclineth this way or that way: As when we ask a Question at <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, we use to be silent till they answer, so should it be here; And if Conscience seem not to speak, we should wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t on, and not be hastie; especially, we should look well that we distinguish betwixt Inclination, the Affections of Fear, Passion, and the like, and the answer of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Lest we take the one for the other, we should both take heed that it be Conscience that answereth, and that we take up the meaning of Conscience, it's answer aright: in order to which there should be a quieting, and hushing of all things within the man, that there be nothing to disturb in taking up the mind of Conscience, or that may prejudge Conscience in speaking, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's answer. <hi>5ly</hi> When Conscience hath spoken, we should put its answer to proof and tryal, and see if it be the answer of Conscience indeed; We should take the answer of Conscience to the Rule of the Word, and see if it be agreeable to the same; even as we should take our Light to Conscience, that Conscience may testifie of it, so when we have gotten ane answer from Conscience, we should take it back to Light, and see how it agreeth with the Word; for there is a great correspondence betwixt



<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41558:77"/>
these two, Conscience and Light, Conscience serving to ballance Light, and Light to confirm Conscience, which being Gods Deputy, set up in man to speak his mind, ere we can follow ought as the language of it, we should ask for his warrand; And if it produce no word for the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of what it saith, we should not take it for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of Conscience, or at least it should be looked upon, as a mistaken answer; Hence it is, that some when they get a little lightning after prayer, and do not put it to the tryal, and yet rest on it as ane answer of Conscience, are mistaken; Yea, this is the reason why many of Gods People, who have some access and liberty in their addresses to him, are mistaken; for it is not access to him, nor liberty simply that warrandeth Conscience to speak, but the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>4th. Question,</hi> How this Language of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may be discerned, and distinguished, or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from mens Light, Inclinations and Affections, of fear or desire, and liking to be at a thing; Which will stir and make restless, as well as as the Impulse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? We <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. The answer that Conscience giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is alwayes from the Word, if it be right; and upon that account, that the Word warrandeth it, it not only sayeth, that such a thing is agreeable to the Word, but presseth to it, because agreeable thereto; As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to allude to that Word, (if not more) <hi>He that giveth to a disciple a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple, shall not loss his reward;</hi> We may give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to a man that is a Disciple out of pity, or on some other natural, or moral Considerations and Relations, and Light will direct to that, and the natural Conscience may pousse to it; but to make it the answer of a good Conscience, it requireth a <hi>Re-duplication,</hi> that we give to him, as, or because he is a Disciple, and member of Christ; so one may Pray, and come to Church, and have an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41558:78"/>
account; The reason is, because Conscience presseth to obedience on that account; but Light, Inclination, and Affection, presse to obedience on another account, as from some selfish Motive, or Consideration, supposing it to be a Duty. A <hi>2d.</hi> way to discern it's answer, is this, Light, Inclination, and Affection put to the thing in the general only, but the answer of Conscience respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the circumstances of the thing; Conscience doth not only say, go and Pray, but Pray in this manner, to wit, with Faith, Love, Fear, Reverence and sincerity of Heart; The reason is, because Conscience considereth the Duty, as circumstantiated in the Word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's answer is no broader, nor narrower then the Word is; Whereas, when a man is put to such a thing from Credit, Fear or Desire, his practice is extended no further then to such an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> end; Credit, fear of Loss, or the like, (if he have any regard to circumstances) Levelleth and Moduleth him in all the circumstances of his acting; So as he may attain that which driveth him on to such a Duty; but when Conscience putteth to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that God may be obeyed, and peace in Him injoyed, it regulateth the man in all Circumstances of his Duty, in order to that end; And this is the reason why some are so soon, and so well satisfied with Duty, others are never throughly satisfied; because the one goeth about Duty for the fashion, to guard against, and hold off chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, or for some other sinister end, and so is still driven on from such a principle, and for such ends: But the other goeth about Duty, in obedience to God, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AT a former occasion, we proposed this <hi>Doctrine</hi> from these Words, That the Conscience which is in men hath a way of signifying it's mind to them concerning their actions, to let them know when it is satisfied, and when dissatisfied, and to give them some sense of them, called, <hi>The answer of the Conscience:</hi> The <hi>use</hi> of the Point was. That if it be so; Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should, in all their Carriage and Actions indeavour to know what sense Conscience hath of them; They should ask advice of Conscience, and take it's answer before they Act, in the time of their Acting, and when they have done Acting.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:41558:79"/>In prosecuting of this <hi>use</hi> (which is the main thing aimed at) we proposed for clearing it, 1. What this Answer is? Which is especially to be looked to, not as determining simply what is right, and what is wrong, for that is done in the Word; but that in things lawfull and in those Duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that (as was said) do not oblidge <hi>ad semper,</hi> or in all differences of time, we are by the Answer of Conscience to try our particular call to them, the right timing of them, and the right maner of going about them.</p>

                  <p>There are yet <hi>two Questions</hi> remaining, for further clearing of this <hi>use,</hi> to be spoken to. 1. If even when men are desirous to know the Sense and Answer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, it may not be silent, and no distinct clearness attained to, whither they be called <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> such a thing, or not, or how they are to go about it, or how it should be timed? <hi>2dly.</hi> If Conscience may sometimes be silent, or at least not answer so clearly, what then is to be done in that case?</p>
                  <p>As for the 1. We shall <hi>Answer</hi> it in two <hi>Assertions,</hi> and then clear them.</p>
                  <p>The 1. <hi>Assertion</hi> is, That sometimes in Gods wise, holy, and soveraign Providence, and in his secret, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and mysterious way of ordering things, it may so come to passe, that men may set themselves to enquire at Conscience, and yet after inquirie not find, at least for a time, so clear an Answer, as to warrand and direct them what hand to turn to.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d. Assertion</hi> is, That sometimes Conscience may speak, and answer clearly enough; and yet men from some one tentation, or sinful distemper or another that they are under, and from negligence, and sinful inadvertancy, in taking heed to the answer of Conscience, may think that



<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41558:80"/>
it speaketh not clearly, when it doth, and thus be le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t in the dark; So that Conscience is not alwayes to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if it answered not, when we think so.</p>
                  <p>For clearing of the 1. of these, That Conscience may be silent, or not speak so clearly, even when inquired at; we suppose it is clear, not only from the experience of all generations, wherein Believers, (if put to speak) would declare, that they have sometimes been very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of Light and Clearnesse concerning their being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to this, or that Place, Station, or State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Life; As also it may be, as to the way and time of performing some called for Duties, and yet have not attained to clearness therein: This one thing will both clear, and give the reason of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Conscience being Gods Deputie, whereby his mind is made known, cannot speak, when he keepeth up himself; And seing he may, and will, now and then keep up himself for a time; Conscience, during that time, may, and must be silent; because Conscience cannot speak, but according to his order; And there being wise and holy Reasons moving him (to speak so) to keep up his mind; and that he may, in some sense and respect, deal with others, as it's said he dealt with <hi>Saul</hi> (whom, in a great strait, he refused to give answer to, either by <hi>Dreams,</hi> or by <hi>Urim,</hi> or by <hi>Prophets</hi>) so as not to give them clearness, by one means nor another; neither from his Word, nor by their Conscience, as calling them to such or such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing; it is no marvel, that in such a case, men be in the dark, and that Conscience keep it self silent. Yet <hi>2dly.</hi> For clearing the Matter further, ye would consider <hi>two</hi> sorts of Causes that this proceedeth from, some whereof are <hi>Culpable,</hi> and sinful on our part, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing this as a just punishment of some former sin, or of some present evil, and sinful frame: other some are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign on Gods part, yet tending in his secret provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to promote some designs of good to the Person, of a Believer: as to these Causes that are sinful, and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable on our part, we shall instance them in <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Cases.</p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:41558:80"/>As, 1. When there is a sinful Ignorance in the Persons, who desire to be clear in such or such a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; Through that their ignorance, they are not in case, clearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and distinctly, but rather very darkly, and confusedly, to propose the matter to their Conscience, so that their Conscience cannot give them a distinct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: For Conscience is, (as I said before) as a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and our Light is as the <hi>Informer,</hi> and as a Judge cannot well decide in a matter, when the Case is confusedly proposed to him, so no more can Conscience, when it wanteth Light: And hence, oftentimes persons in whom there is some zeal, and good affection, are left much in the dark, because (to speak so) they know not the Laws and Practiques, on which Conscience proceedeth; Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. It's said of some, that their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science was weak,</hi> because their Light was weak and dim.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> Case is, When men, in seeking the Answer of their Conscience, do bound and limit it; They either do not fairly and fully propose the Case to Conscience, or they come not to it with ane absolute submission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be throughly informed by the Word) concerning the thing they would have clearness in; and therefore they take the Answer in part, or but a part of the Answer, and suppose the rest, or leave it to Conscience to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; as when men first resolve to do such or such a thing, and leave only the timeing of it to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Here the Conscience may be limited, and made indistinct in it's Answer, because it is prejudged and left free; It might <hi>possibly</hi> have been somewhat, not al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Where they do not say at first, shall we go up, or shall we for-bear? but first they say, <hi>who shall go up?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>third</hi> Case is, When Conscience is provoked by mens former miscarriages, then it may be silent, and not answer: Now the Conscience may be provoked these <hi>

to consult Conscience, but at some particular, and solemn times only, and when they are brought to some pinch, or put to a stand; but as for the ordinary course of their Life, they follow Inclination, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Light, without advising with Conscience; In that case, when such persons come to advise with Conscience, and to seek clearnesse from it, about such a thing; the Lord may say to them, as he did to his People, <hi>Iudges,</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Go and cry to the gods whom ye have chosen,</hi> go advise with them; or as <hi>Elisha</hi> said to the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 3. 3. <hi>What have I to do with thee? get thee to the Prophets of thy father, and to the Prophets of thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Even so, if Conscience be passed by, and miskent by People in the ordinary course of their life, it will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily misken and slight them, when they are in a strait, and come to seek Counsel and Clearness from it, and will, on the matter say to them, ye followed the counsel of flesh and blood, in your ordinary walk, and course of life; therefore in this particular, I will not answer you, go and seek Clearness from them whom ye use to consult. <hi>2dly.</hi> Conscience is provoked, when me have formerly thwarted with some clear intimations, or answers of Conscience, and have some way <hi>detained the truth in unrighteousness,</hi> making, as it were, a Prisoner of it, and setting a guard of corrupt affections about it; when such come again to enquire at Conscience, what they shal do in this, or that particular, they may justly get such ane answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is given, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Because I called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ye refused, I stretched out my hand, and no man regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ye set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof, I will laugh at your calamity, they shall call, but I will not answer:</hi> I gave you answers before, and ye thwarted with them, therefore when ye seek again, ye shall get none: And hence floweth much blindnesse, and be nummednesse of Conscience in men and women, because they put out the eyes thereof, and frequently repell, and beat back what it sayes, or answers; so that it becometh cauterized, and the feeling of it weareth almost, if not



<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41558:81"/>
altogether, away; and it speaketh very little, or none at all to them, being so much baffled, and blunted with many repulses: We may add this <hi>Third</hi> way, how it is provoked, and that is, when it's askings are slighted; It asketh us why we do such and such a thing, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear such and such another? and we slight what it saith, and ly still in sin; Is it not just that Conscience pay us home in our own measure, and refuse to answer us when we ask it?</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Sinful Cause on our part, of the silence of Conscience, is, When men come not singly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in a Spiritual Frame to Conscience, to seek it's answer and advice, but either have an<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t up before their eyes, and are almost already determined in the thing; or else they bring with them some one or other lust un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of; Hence it comes to pass, that though they think themselves submissive in that particular, and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may some way be so, yet not being absolutly submissive in all, Conscience keeps silent; To the former, the Lord some way sayes, as he did to these men, by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> chap. 14. 2, 3. <hi>Son of man, these have set up their idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their face; should I be inquired at all by them?</hi> When men come to seek Light, and bring their Idols with them, the Lord that speaketh by the Conscience, will some times, in that case, not suffer it to speak a word. The other is like that which we have, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer;</hi> When men come in a profane temper and frame of Spirit to God, and are not single, and (as I said) absolutely submissive, Conscience will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; For Conscience hath not one word to speak, but to them to whom God speaketh.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fifth,</hi> And last Case is, when men are driven, and stirred up to seek to know the mind of Conscience, from a corrupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or selfie principle, and for such or such a selfy end; As for instance, when men seek clearnesse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution from their Conscience, anent such ane estate of

Life, such a calling or station, or anent the undertaking of such a journey, or voyage, and are not put to seek that clearness anent them, out of respect to the honour of God, but from respect only, or mainly to their own interest, profite, pleasure, or credit; As it was with <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 22. 10. That which did put him to ask Gods counsel, was not regard to the honour of God, but love to <hi>the wages of unrighteousness,</hi> as <hi>Iude</hi> calleth them: And here many fail, and make a silent Conscience, when they are seeking clearness; Which may be known by this, that they would never ask, if it were lawful for them to take such a calling or place, or to ingadge in such ane imployment, except some pleasure, preferment or gain led them to it; And the reason why they ask the advice of Conscience in the matter, is not that they may be the more stirred up, to improve such a place, imployment or state of life for Gods honour, but that they may with more quietnesse, freedom and confidence, follow their design, and come by their end; neither do they intend singly (if at all) to follow the answer of Conscience, but would rather have Conscience to follow them; as is clear in <hi>Balaam;</hi> Therefore, when the Answer cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Inclination, or Affection, or to the selfie end, that they have before them, they will ask over again, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did; Hence <hi>Iames</hi> sayeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 4. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask a miss to consume it upon your lusts:</hi> As men may seek to be assisted in the performance of Duty, for the praise of men; so they may seek to have Conscience to be on their side, to prevent a challenge from it; And that they may intertain a carnally confident expectation of what they would be at: Thus carnally profane and wicked men have often sought advice of the Lords Prophets, as they did, <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. 1, 2. In these, and the like cases, men may take pains to know the mind of Conscience; and yet the Lord may make it to keep silence, and not to Answer them, or, if it do; <hi>to answer them according to the idol of their own heart.</hi>

                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Another sort of Reasons may be drawn from Gods <hi>Soveraignity,</hi> so ordering it for his own wise, and holy ends; to wit, for the good of his People, and his own Glory: as he afflicteth them in other things; though not without sin in them, yet not alwayes with respect to their sin; As we may see in <hi>Iobs</hi> tryal; Even so when they are taking pains for clearness of Conscience, and to get Gods mind in such a particular, he may, and sometimes doth blast all their pains, so as they attain not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired clearness in it, I say in such or such a particular; because (as was hinted before) the main bussinesse of their eternal state falleth not under these debates; and this we say he doth in his Soveraignity, for these and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lack their dilligence. <hi>3dly.</hi> He doth this for tryal; to make discovery of the unsoundness of some, and to prove the sincerity of others; he will, by suspending Light and Clearnesse in such a particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take a proof of folks tendernesse, whither they will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, while they are unclear, or, whither they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenderly go on; It being a main thing that maketh tryal of mens tendernesse, when God, by this means, layeth, as it were, a Bond and Restraint on us, and so putteth us to it, to try whither we will hold here, or proceed further; if there be tendernesse, it will appear in such a case; This discovered <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 6, 7.

A <hi>5th.</hi> and last end is, to draw men to more immediat dependence on himself; that when Conscience is silent, they may come to him, and count themselves to be so much the more in his common, and debt, for any Light that they shall win at; and be made to know, that Conscience is but his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: all this is clear, frow Gods way in afflicting his People, and from many instances in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The other Assertion that I proposed to speak a word to, was, That though it be sometimes thus, That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is silent, and speaketh not, at least, so soon, or so clearly, when it is inquired at; yet it is not alwayes so, but sometimes, nay, often Conscience will speak, and answer clearly; and our unclearnesse in that case, may proceed from some one tentation or other; or from our own sinful distemper; or from our negligence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertancy, as I shall shortly clear in some cases.</p>

lyeth one way, and the answer of Conscience sweyeth another way; as suppose gain to be on this side, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science speaketh Duty to be on the other; Interest will say, that such a place, calling, or station should be taken and ingadged in, because it hath gain, and preferment with it, but Conscience sayeth, it should be forborn; And here Interest sustaineth the Dispute, and carieth it on toughly, and pertinaciously, against Conscience, with plausible Arguments, that side and sute well with, and much please, and gratifie our flesh; which yet might be very easily refuted, if Interest had not the great hand in proposing, and managing them; Hence the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d.

We should aim to know, if our unclear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in such a particular, proceed from the silence of Conscience, or from some Tentation, or distemper of Spirit in us? <hi>2dly.</hi> Whither it flow from a sinful Cause on our part, or from Gods Soveraignity? <hi>3dly.</hi> We should learn how to apply our selves aright, to take up these causes. <hi>4thly.</hi> What it is that we should do, when none of these are discerned? <hi>5thly.</hi> What it is that we should do, if our unclearnesse and darknesse continue? or what general grounds may warrand us in our choice? or, how we ought to make use of these general grounds, when we cannot take up Particulars?</p>
                  <p>For the 1. Direction in such a Case, we say, when men have unclearnesse, they should inquire, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

to him, and profitable to our selves; concerning which councellours we may not only safely, but with highest assurance, say, that they are happy, who hearken to their Advice and Council.</p>
                  <p>That which we have have been speaking of from this <hi>v.</hi> Is the right way of discerning the Advice and Counsel which the Conscience gives, That so we may be the more able clearly and distinctly to follow it.</p>
                  <p>And in prosecution of this, ye may remember, we came to answer that <hi>Case,</hi> or <hi>Question,</hi> what men are called to, or what maybe their duty, when, after some pains taken to know Consciences, Advice and Counsel, they do not discern, and take it up? Seing experience tells us, that sometimes there may be Darknesse, even when men would have Light; In <hi>Answering</hi> of this, we gave you this <hi>Direction,</hi> in the first place, after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of some things, for clearing of it; That such as are thus in the Dark, would once put themselves to it, to try whither their Darkness proceed indeed from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or from some Distemper, and Tentation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, letting, and hindring them from taking up that which Conscience sayes; till once this be clear, men cannot make great progresse, for if they should studie to have Conscience speaking, and yet have their own ears stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, this seems to be but lost labour; There is some other thing called for, that once they may be in a quiet, and composed Frame, to hear what Conscience sayes to them.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>ad.</hi> Direction, for Answer to it, is, When men cannot discern any Temptation, or Distemper in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but that they are content to hear what Conscience would say to them, and yet cannot take it up, then they would set themselves to try whither that silence proceeds from some sinful Cause in themselves, justly procuring that silence of Conscience, as a punishment to them, or from some Soveraign Cause in God, ordering that silence to try them, and to humble them, and that they may, by being keeped a while in the mist, more singly give proof



<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41558:87"/>
of their dependency on him: For, as in other affictions so in this, sometimes God will exercise his Soveraignity, and if it be once known to be for tryal, the thing that we are called to, is sweetly silent submission to God, and allowing him so to dispose of us as he pleases; As that Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. <hi>v.</hi> 10. holds forth, <hi>He that walks in darkness, and sees no light,</hi> let him in that Case, <hi>stay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on the Lord;</hi> He may be keeped quiet, and from thwarting with God, if he can take up that to be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; But if some sinful Cause hes procured this, Men are put to it, as they would not ly under any effects of Gods anger, to be dealing with him, to have that cause, that hes brought it on removed, that in due time, this sad effect of it may be removed also. It is true, that as in other Cases, so in this, it is not Ordinary nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for God to afflict His People with Darknesse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some sinful Cause; And we may easily know, that among men, who have corruption in them, there is no tryal that comes on them, but there is some cause in themselves, that may procure it, and so may keep them in the dark if God should narrowly mark it: And hence we may gather, that it is very difficult to discern rightly, by clear evidence the one of these from the other; Yet we think in every case it is not absolutly necessary, for godly persons to conclude a designed controversie for sin, though they can never go wrong to take with sin, albeit yet they would not alwayes bind it on God, as if he were quarrelling for it, though he might very justly do so.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we shall offer <hi>Four</hi> Differences, and then qualifie them, and give some Directions, how to walk in every one of these Cases.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Then, We conceive, when the silence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and Gods refusing to intimate his mind by it, proceeds from a sinful cause procuring it, in a Person, it will readily look more horrible like; and will have some impression of anger on it, when it comes out with such a word, as that, <hi>

                     <hi>gods which ye have chosen,</hi> &amp;c. And there is good reason for this; that if it be an effect of sin, or of anger for sin, it should look liker anger, then when it is an effect of Gods meer Soveraignity, which may stand well with his being in good terms with that person whom he so tryes. <hi>Secondly.</hi> We think the hiding of Gods face, and silence of Conscience, when it proceeds from sin as the Cause, readily point out some particular ground of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for which the Conscience keeps silence, it hath a word of reproof with it, for some particular fault, as in that same place, ye have done this, and this sayeth the Lord; <hi>Though I have brought you out of the land of Egypt, yet ye have served other gods, therefore now I will deliver you no more;</hi> Conscience though it will not, in that case give an answer to the thing that is asked at it, yet it will give a reason, wherefore it answers not, and will point at somewhat, that may make it known, that there is just ground for it's keeping silence: <hi>Iob</hi> being thus smitten in holy Soveraignity, Sayes to God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 2: <hi>Tell me wherefore thou contends with me;</hi> He is indeed now somewhat jumbled, being exercised by the Soveraign Holy Lord; and his exercise is not so much, for this and that sin, in particular, as to know wherefore God deals so with him. <hi>3dly.</hi> When this silence of Conscience proceeds from a sinful cause, it leaves the Spirit of the Person in a far greater distemper, and confusion, then whenit proceeds meerly from Gods Soveraignity; For this having it's rise from Sin, it hath the greater influence to the stirring of corruption; Therefore in such a case as this, men are much disposed to sret, as ye may see in <hi>Saul.</hi> and others, who were ready. when God answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not, to take another, and sinful way of their own; But when God exercises in Soveraignity, as the Conscience hath readily more quietnesse, so there is more sweet Submission and Patience. <hi>4ly.</hi> Persons would take a reflect look on the frame of their own hearts, before their darknesse came on them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

That they were sadly surprized in that distemper; but if it come on them at such a time, when they have a Testimony within them, that they were making Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Duty, it would seem to say, that God is not looking so much at their sin, as to some Sovereign end, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Though it may be so for a time, yet if God remove the exercise, he will make it otherwise, he will compose the heart, and make the exercise effectual for that, for which he sends it; As ye see in the case of <hi>Iob,</hi> who, though he was somewhat discomposed for a time, yet before God leaves him, he calmes him, and makes him lay his hand on his mouth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 40. and 42. <hi>3dly.</hi> That even then, though persons may discompose, and put themselves through other, because they have not caried suitably, and fair under the exercise; yet there will be some honest Testimony of Sincerity, when they look back to their carriage before, and even in the time; for Soveraignity in such exercises, will not prejudge his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples interest in him; Therefore ye see, that <hi>Iob</hi> is clear, and resolved in this, that he will retain his integrity.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we would come to shew you what is meet to be done, in this case, Which, though there may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable difficulty to come by, yet a Believer should not be idle, when his Conscience keeps silence; Therefore I would give you these <hi>Three</hi> general <hi>Directions.</hi> 1. That Persons would endeavour to compose, and calm the frame of their own Spirits under that darknesse, be from what cause it will; if it be from Gods Soveraignity exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; This is suitable, that we study to comply, and strick in with these ends, and designs that God drives at, in exercising us so, such as, the humbling of us, the emptieing of us of all self-conceit, the making of us to loath our selves, so as to say with <hi>Iob, Behold I am vile,</hi> The clearer knowledge of our own feeblenesse and sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, our making greater account of Light, and coming at a more near closse and constant dependance on God; whatsoever that exercise proceed from, this is alwayes a Christians duty; And we have it warranted to us from <hi>Iobs</hi> example, and from the Churches example, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> general Direction is, That whither God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stite for sin or not, yet we would take a look of our own



<pb n="137" facs="tcp:41558:89"/>
carriage, that we may see what sin or sins we can find out, that might have been ground for him, thus to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with us; that so we may repent of them, obtain his Peace, and recover his favour and friendship, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to these sins; This sure cannot be any bad fruit, whatsoever be the cause from which it proceeds; because though God take not such narrow notice of our sin, yet it well becomes us to take such notice of it, ye see <hi>Iob</hi> doth this, when he sayes to the Lord, <hi>Thou makest me to possesse the sins of my youth;</hi> We would look well to this, and set our selves seriously to have our peace made up again with God, and to come by the intimation of the pardon of these particular sins, that if so be, our dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse continue, we may have some quietnesse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this may also be the way for wining to the other; it is sure, very suitable, that when a Person is in the dark, as to some one particular duty, soberly to consider how often Conscience spoke, and I took but little notice of it, how little Conscience I made to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise clear duties; and therefore I am justly bemisted, and in the dark, as to this, this helps to humble. There are these <hi>Three</hi> things we would have you to look back on, when we call you to reflect in such a case on your wayes, <hi>First.</hi> Look back, and see if there was not something amiss before that darkness came on, that might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, and drawn on this, as a chastisment of that; And here you would go back, if it were not only some few years, but seven years, and moe too, and see what sins, and sins against Light in particular, ye have fallen in; And how, when Conscience did challenge for the same, ye took but little notice of it; If I say it were after seven years, yea thrice seven (as <hi>Iosephs</hi> Brethren were made to do) ye would call these sins, or that sin again to mind. <hi>2dly.</hi> Look well if ye have been serious in searching out the mind of Conscience, and if ye have taken pains to use all means to get Light; ye want Light, and it may be ye have not studied to be well acquainted with the word, nor have been single in prayer to God.



<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41558:90"/>
for obtaining of it; ye would also look, if there hath been any defect in advising with Conscience, or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning the case to Conscience, and discovering the same, ye would endeavour to amend it, and to make a new addresse, as it were to your Conscience before God, for finding out Light. <hi>3dly.</hi> Look back on your carriage, since that darkness began; for Christians may possibly have been in a tender frame, when this darkness came upon them; yet because they get not Light so soon as they would have it, and because the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ord keeps up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for a time, it may be their impatience has broken out, and there has been sinful wrangling with God in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and the heart hath been somewhat raised, that he should deal so with them, especially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen they have found that they have been honest in the main; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this was in <hi>Iob,</hi> who took on him, under his dark exercise (as himself confesseth) to meddle too much, and too boldly with Gods secrets, that were too wonderful for him; It may be often thus with Believers, who, though they may be in a good frame, and keeping up the peace when the dark exercise comes on them, yet confuse themselves by other miscarriages under it, and by their carnalnesse in reference to it; Whereby it comes to passe, that the exercise that at first came from Gods Soveraignity, turns in the continuance of it, to be for their sin a chastisment, which they are made to take with, whither they will or not; We think this was <hi>Iobs</hi> case, and he was made to take with it, ere the exercise was removed from him: These things ye would look to, and reflect on them, that you may know how to apply your selves accordingly, and to do as they shall call you, and as the case requires.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> General <hi>Direction</hi> is, That however things be, persons that are in the dark, and yet would be clear of Gods mind about such and such a Duty, would be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well about them, that they may see, if there be yet any present thing called for from them, if there be any thing left undone which they may do, and which they



<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41558:90"/>
should do, for finding out Gods mind; and they would go throw Gods appointed means, and throw them again: There are <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four particular</hi> Directions in this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> one, <hi>First,</hi> Such as would be at the knowledge of Gods mind, would betake themselves to him, and stir up them<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eves to be at more immediate nearnesse to him; That when the Conscience speaks not to them, they may go to the Lord himself, to get some word of answer from him, as <hi>Habakkuck</hi> did, <hi>Chup.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1. While he says <hi>I will get me to my watch tower,</hi> &amp;c. The Prophet had his own darkness there, and was in some little dump, the vision did not speak for the time, what course takes he in this case?

                        </gap>ow,</hi> they would (as I said) welcome that, and make use of it; Thus it's said of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 11. 8. That <hi>by faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called of God, he forsook his countrey, and went out, not knowing whither he went;</hi> sometimes God will call a person to go this step, and he will not for the time, let him know where the nixt shall be; he should lift as it were, that foot, and make that step, while he hath Light, and so on, from one step to another, till the darknesse make him stand still. The <hi>Third</hi> Direction, is, That though we come not to clearness at the first, yet we would wait on, and not be hastie; It's a notable follie, to be either rash in acting, or hastie in giving up with God, when he will not speak to us at the first; my meaning is, That we would neither do the thing that we are in debate about before we be clear in it, for that is to do doubtingly; neither should we give it over, but should be waiting on in renewing our applications to God, till he think meet to speak to us; <hi>The vision,</hi> (sayes the Lord to <hi>Habbacuck) is yet for ane appointed time, though it tarry, wait for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it;</hi> There are some times that God will only say this much to a person, wait, and that is an answer; more will come to the waiter in due time; and we may be encouraged to wait, if we will consider, that honest waiters have a promise of Light: If one should say here, I am in the mean time sadly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised; I <hi>Answer,</hi> it may be meet thou should be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, that exercise may be good for thee; Nay, it may be thou makes a piece of exercise to thy self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou wouldest know more then is his mind, thou shouldest for the time know. The <hi>Fourth</hi> Direction, is, There would be silent stouping to, and reverend ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wisdom, and Soveraignity of God, in ordering darknesse in such a particular, which is not a necessary duty; so that the person cannot stir, nor move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; It may be for the good of the party, that he is thus, by this darknesse restrained, and hedged in, which, though it be not now known, may be made known, hereafter, to satisfaction.</p>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:41558:91"/>It may yet be enquired, when there is silence in the Conscience, as to such or such a particular, if there may not be use made of general Rules given in the Scripture, for directing us in our walk? And if Conscience may not have peace, in walking according to these Rules? No doubt, for keeping a good Conscience, we would, in our respective Stations, and Capacities, learn by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious reason (that is reason drawn from Scripture grounds) to order our Conversation so, as the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may have nothing to say against it; As for instance, suppose a person be debateing, whither <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And for your better help herein, I shall <hi>First,</hi> Touch on some general <hi>Rules,</hi> that the Scripture layes down, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we would walk. <hi>2ly.</hi> I shall, offer some helps, how to collect and apply, from these Rules. <hi>3ly.</hi> I shall shew the warrantableness of quieting our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in walking according to them; <hi>First,</hi> then I shall name <hi>Four</hi> general <hi>Rules,</hi> to which we would have ane eye in reference to lawful things; The <hi>First</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is set down, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 30. <hi>Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God;</hi> We should choose that state of life, and calling (and so in other such things) that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce most to the glorifying of God; So we are to enter in the Dispute, or Debate, whither may this or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute most to that end, and accordingly the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may well rest quiet, if it once come to any clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that this, or the other contributes most to Gods Glorie, therefore it should be followed. The <hi>2d.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Let all things be done to edifying;</hi> There is a difference between things lawful, and things expedient, or edifying, <hi>All things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not;</hi> Sayeth the



<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41558:92"/>
Aposile, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 23. There is an expedience, and regard to the edification of our selves, and of others, that we would be sweyed with; as whither the doing of such and such a thing, at this time, or another will edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others most, and profit them most, as to the saving of their souls; or help our selves most, in the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some Lust, or in furthering of us to some D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie; Here Conscience is to close with, and to cleave unto that which is most edifying. A <hi>Third</hi> General <hi>Rule</hi> is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. Where, when the Apostle is shewing them a way how to walk (as we suppose) in the same kind of things; <hi>Whatsoever things,</hi> saith he, <hi>are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, pure, lovely, and of good report,</hi> (To wit, with those that are able to judge a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight, of things that are so) <hi>think on these things;</hi> There are many things lawful, that are not honest; many things lawful, may not have a good report; and many things that are lawful, may not be lovely; Now, when two lawful things are before us, we would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which of the two are most Christianly honest, and most Lovely, which of them hath the best report, and is best thought of among them that can discern best; and though a thing be lawful in it self, yet if it be not honest, and of a good report, it may give cause of ill speaking, that is not to be allowed; As for instance, suppose in the matter of Marriage, there be two single people, it is lawful for them to Marie; Yet suppose them to be unequal, as to their Rank and Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one a great Man, the other a poor Woman, and despicable, or contrarily; or vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unequal, as to Age or Parts, and accomplishments; and that such a match is not honestly reported of; Or is not counted gracious and tender like in a professo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Religion, Man or Woman; though it might be simply lawful, yet in that case, He or She is to walk according to the Apostles Rule, even according to this Rule: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumstances, I grant, will very much vary the the case; Yet that Rule would be still tenderly looked to. A <hi>4th.</hi> General <hi>Rule,</hi> is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17, and 20.

His at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing his Conscience not simply, but as it's sanctified by the Spirit. <hi>2ly.</hi> It not only imports Sanctification in the habit of it, but in it's exercise also; for he knew that a mans attesting of his meer natural Conscience is not of such value, it being a thing that may be easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, and go wrong; but sayeth he, <hi>I attest my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the holy Ghost,</hi> and as acted by him; There is a difference betwixt a renewed, and unrenewed Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and a difference betwixt a pure Conscience and a defiled one, <hi>To the pure</hi> (sayeth the Apostle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15.) <hi>all things are pure, but to them that are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure, but even their mind and conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is defiled; Pauls</hi> appealing his Conscience, is as it's opposit to such a Conscience; There is also an evil and a good Conscience, as these words lately spoken of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21 <hi>The answer of a good conscience toward God,</hi> clear; There is likewise a cauterized Conscience, and a tender Conscience: yea, there is some difference of Consciences among Believers themselves; some Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are weak, some strong; some are sleepy, some waking, some are secure, some in the lively exercise of the Grace of God, and acted by the Spirit, according to the will of God; and this is the Conscience meant here.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>5ly. Observe,</hi> That there is no Testimony of a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that can be satisfying, but the Testimony of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sanctified, and in a sanctified frame; therefore he thinks it not enough to say, <hi>My conscience beareth me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> but he addeth, <hi>in the Holy Ghost;</hi> And in that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.

                  <p>
                     <hi>6ly. Observe,</hi> That sometimes, and in some Cases, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may very warrantably attest their Conscience, and appeal to it's Testimony; some Believers in the old Testament, and some in the new have done it: Tho (as we said before) the attesting of Conscience be a very grave and solemn thing, and would not be used at all times, and in all cases, yet at some times, and in some cases, it may be warrantably used, when rightly gone about: I shall name <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Considerations, or Cases from the Text, for clearing of it. 1. Conscience may be attested, when the matter that we assert, requireth such a solemn attesting of it; And these things concur here to clear, that the matter wherein he attesteth his Conscience, is such, For, 1. It is a thing that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gods Glory not a little, that his Servant and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not walking according to the flesh, 2. It tendeth to the edification of others; for if he had not removed



<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41558:98"/>
the prejudice that the <hi>Iews</hi> had at him, it might have marred their receiving the Truth from his mouth. 3. It tendeth to his own vindication, in as far as it tendeth to the former two ends, and he will not suffer any blot to ly here. 4. That which he asserteth, is a thing not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and could not well be otherwayes made out; and in this so great and grave a matter, he spares not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test God, and his own Conscience. 2. Consider the manner of his proceeding; It's spoken in the sight of God gravely and soberly, <hi>I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not, my conscience bearing me witnes in the holy ghost;</hi> He doth not rashly, and abruptly break out in it, as many do. <hi>3ly.</hi> Consider, that he is most clear in the thing, ere he attest his Conscience, he was sure that it was no lie, and that he had no mixture of untruth in it; yea, he is so clear that he dar swear it, and take Christ, and the Holy Ghost to witnes in it: When men dar not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test God in a matter, they should not attest their own Conscience in it, except they think that God will say one thing, and their Conscience another, which is contrary to the nature of Conscience; Men will say many things lightly, supposing them to be true that they will be loath to attest their Conscience in, till they be very clear, and sure that they are true. <hi>4ly.</hi> Add this Consideration, that it is done, when he is in a holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and lively frame, <hi>My conscience</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me witnes in the holy Ghost;</hi> To attest Conscience in a carnal frame, is as unsuitable, as to rush in rashly, and unmannerly before a grave Judge, to crave a Sentence from him; If our frame be not right, Conscience will never speak out an approving Testimony to us in that particular which we assert, and attest it in; For though, as to the matter it be true, and no lie, yet as to our circumstantiated attesting of it in so ill a frame, it will not approve us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>7ly.</hi> In the general, <hi>Observe,</hi> That Conscience it's Testimony, when warrantably made use of, is a thing very useful, refreshing, and comfortable to a Believer;

There is nothing readily, that more comforts him in a strait<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it's a singularly good back-friend; Therefore, when <hi>Paul</hi> hath few other friends, he maketh use of this, and findeth much peace and comfort from it; And hence he sayth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conscience,</hi> &amp;c. To clear this in a word further: it is in these <hi>Three</hi> Cases exceeding useful, 1.

Chap</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 21.) <hi>then have we confidence towards God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Use</hi> serves to teach us to be much in love with such a way, as we may have the Testimony of a good Conscience in it; and to be much in love with such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as may give us such a comfortable Testimony in all our straits and difficulties.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, we shall speak to that which we mainly aim at, in these <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five Observations;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then <hi>first,</hi> What <hi>Paul</hi> is about here, he is asserting a truth, <hi>viz.

                     </hi> And he attests his Conscience that it was so, and that he was honest, and sincere in asserting it; Whence <hi>Observe,</hi> That there is no action of a mans Life, but Conscience hath a concern in it, and hath something to say to him concerning it; if it



<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41558:99"/>
were but the speaking of a word, let be the doing of any bussiness, Conscience hath alwayes something to say for him, or against him; So that we may confidently say, there is no action of so little moment, in thought, word or deed; as, whither a man be called to do, or forbear, to speak, or to be silent, but in all these, Conscience hath a sense and consideration of it, and a Testimony to give for, or against the man about it. I am not now speaking of things sinful, or unlawful on the matter, but of such things as on the matter are lawful; As when a man speaketh truth; whither he speaketh it truly, and with an honest intention or not, Therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> is speaking a truth here, he looks to his Conscience, and hearkens what it sayeth: Put these <hi>Four</hi> together, and ye will find it clear, that a sanctified Conscience, in a sanctified and good Frame, will alwayes have something to say, for, or against a man, in every thing that he goes about; I say, a sanctified Conscience, in a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Frame, because that is the Conscience we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and the Conscience that most compleatly discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it's duty. 1 If we consider this, That there is no humane action, but God hath given man a Rule, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how it shall be ordered, how he shall eat, and how he shall drink, how he shall plow, pray, hear, read, confer, how he shall walk in Company, and out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, how he shall go about the Duties of his Calling; and it prescribes the manner of doing these things, as well as the matter; Therefore, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, That the action be gone about in the right manner, as such a particular action or duty is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done; As for instance, if it be a word of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, or Admonition given by us to another; that it be given prudently, lovingly, and tenderly; or what ever the action be in reference to others, that our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of going about it, be such as may adorn the Doctrine of Christ, and make the action to shine the more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly to others, because of our suitable way of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; that we may have a Testimony in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and may gain them, or further gain them to the love of God, and of godlinesse: But this cannot be so well instanced in particulars, because several duties require their own suitable way of performing of them. The <hi>4th.</hi> thing that must go along, with every Action, is, That it be mixed with Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Not only the Faith of such an Action being good, and lawful in it self, (for that is alwayes presupposed) but these two things here are further requisit. 1. That the Action, or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be gone about in the strength of Jesus Christ, so that it may have a Superiour Spiritual principle, to wit, Gods strength acting in it, and not our own simply; that croud of witnesses chronicled, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. are said to do all they

By faith,</hi> That is not only by Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exercised on Christ, for accepting of them, but also by Faith exercised on the strength of Christ, to be born through in the doing of what they did. 2.

                     </gap>e requisit, as any of the former; because, though a Person do that which is good in it self, and have all the other requisits to the Action, yet, if there be a falling in this, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not speak peace; <hi>By faith</hi> (It's said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4, 5. That) <hi>Abel offered a more acceptable sacrifice then Cain:</hi> Both of them offered things that were good, and yet the ones Sacrifice was accepted, and the others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; That which made the difference was, that <hi>Abel,</hi> in his Offering, exercised Faith on Christs Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he offered it not as a Satisfaction in it self to God, but with respect to Jesus Christ typified by it, which the other did not; and proportionally there is somewhat required of all these, and more especially of this last in all Actions, to make them truly Religious, and Christian Actions.</p>

peace to him; And though another man suffer the same very things, yet he may want that testimony, because he wants the grounds of it, his sufferings being destitute of the requisite qualifications: And therefore we would never think a thing to be of so little moment, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science hath no concern in it, we cannot do, speak, think, nor look, but Conscience hath some-thing to say of that deed, word, thought, or look, as it is circumstantiat; either to accuse, if not as it ought to be, or to excuse and approve, if right, as to its requisits.</p>

                  <p>CHristians who have such a vigilant and constant attendant as Conscience waiting on them, had much need of watchfulness, that they may be kept in some suitableness of frame for intertaining that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; Conscience its work, is not only to be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and deliberating what is to be done, but also to be waiting on when it comes to the acting and performing of what it hath been advising to; and it is indeed no less practique to carry Conscience along in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of duty, then it is in taking some pains to consult it, and advise with it at the undertaking thereof, so as we may be answerable to Conscience as to both; oft-times some pains will be taken in deliberating and advising with Conscience what and when we should do, when we will exceedingly relent in taking it along with us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: Whence it frequently comes to pass, that we lose the peace we gained in advising with Conscience at our undertaking the action, by not carrying it along with us in performing: This is the thing which we proposed to be spoken to from this <hi>verse, viz.</hi> The influence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Conscience hath on mens acting, and the respect that they ought to have to it, not only before they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any action, but in, and along the performing of it. The last <hi>Doctrine</hi> we spoke to from it was, that there is not any action of a mans life, but Conscience is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned



<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41558:104"/>
in it, and hath something to say concerning it, for or against him; If it were but the speaking of a word, or the asserting of any truth; as we see in this instance of <hi>Paul,</hi> his Conscience beareth him witness, it hath some-thing to say to him anent his doing it; We cleared this in several, yea rather in all sorts of actions that men have to perform; There being none of them of so little moment, so extrinsick, or so indifferent, but in the performing of them, Conscience ought to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, as having some-what to say for, or against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former. We shall now add some <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> more from the words; And the <hi>first</hi> (which we may either take as an <hi>Use</hi> of the former, or as a distinct <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation</hi> by it self) is this;</p>
                  <p>That men in the time of their going about any thing would advert and take heed to that sense which Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath of their actions; And seing it hath some-thing to say, they would be lending to their ear all along the time of their performing the action, and hear what it saith; As before they undertake, they would advise with Conscience that they be right; so in the time of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, there would be a reflecting on Conscience, to know its sense of our doing; <hi>Paul</hi> is now speaking and asserting somewhat, and he reflecteth on his Conscience to hear what it will say, and that he may get its testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that he is speaking sincerely; he is not now advising with Conscience, to know what he should do; nor to get its censure of what he hath done; but in the very time of his doing, he reflecteth and taketh notice what it saith; He asserteth that he is speaking truth, and taketh a look into his Conscience, to see if it be not so, that he is indeed speaking the truth, and truly; Or we may take the <hi>Doctrine</hi> thus, it is a main piece of a tender walk in a Christian, not only to deliberate with Conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he do any thing, and when he hath done it, to take its censure if it be rightly done, but also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon his Conscience in the very time of his doing of it, and to hear what it will say of that which he is now



<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41558:104"/>
a-doing, and of himself in the doing of it, And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this is one of the main things meant by the <hi>testimony</hi> of Conscience; When Conscience is put to it in the performance of a duty, to know what it will say concerning the man and his action; for if so be that Conscience hath something to say concerning every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for or against the man (as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Their Conscience bearing them witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another</hi>) Then it will clearly follow that it is a main piece of a Christians duty to keep fair with his Conscience here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to take good heed what it saith, in the very <hi>interim</hi> and mean time of his performing every action; Yea, it is not only a main piece of a Christians walk, but a main evidence of a tender walk in a Christian, <hi>viz.</hi> When he doth not only aim to be clear in undertaking a duty, but to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conscience along with him, and to know what it saith in following forth the duty. Take these <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> words for clearing it. <hi>First,</hi> Consider that the right performance of our actions and duties, or the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them such as they should be, dependeth very much on the nick of our discharging them; so that though a man should deliberat never so well before, if he be in a carnal frame, or have a selfie end <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

in the time of the action: And this is one great reason, no doubt, why believers have so little positive peace when they have done a good turn, because they do not advert what Conscience sayes to them, in their going about it; They are hereby also greatly at a lose, as to many sweet experiences of Gods kindnesse, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending in assisting them, and of their own singlenesse win at, through Grace in the performing of Duties: and we think also, that Christians living so much by a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive peace (to speak so) flows much from this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> Their little reflecting in the time of their doing Duty, (if once they be clear in the thing) whither they be suitably serious, and sincere in it; and so letting the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty go by, they are not so throughly clear in these things, that are evidences of a positive peace, in doing of such a duty rightly, as they might otherwayes be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>The <hi>First Use,</hi> Serves, to give you an evidence, and mark of a tender walk, and of a man that is tender in his walk; he is such a man that will not only ask his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ere he begin an Action, but when he is a doing of it, what it thinketh of it: There are <hi>Three</hi> things that a tender Christian will reflect upon, in the time of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Action or Duty; 1. He will reflect upon his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performing it; whither it be a natural Action, such as Eating and Drinking; a civil Action, such as Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Selling; a Religious Action, such as Praying, or hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will look that in them all he be single; that his Eating and Drinking be to fit him to serve God; That in his Buying and Selling, he seek not only his own things, but the good of his Neighbour, as well as his own good; That in his Praying, or Hearing, he be sincere, that it be in Faith, and according to the will of God, <hi>&amp;c. 2ly.</hi> He will reflect on himself in the performing of his Actions, that he be in a right frame; that he be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and sincere, that some awe of God, and of a good Conscience be on him, that his Spirit be sober and composed, that a carnal frame steal not in upon him, in the time of his doing a warrantable Action, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded



<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41558:106"/>
Duty, because that will marr it. <hi>3dly.</hi> He will reflect upon his Conscience, that he may hear what it sayes of the Action; He will not, as it were, take his Testimony from himself, but Conscience being as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct thing, some way from himself, he will hear what it sayeth; As <hi>Paul</hi> doth here, it is truth which he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and he speaketh it in the right manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet he taketh a look of his Conscience, if he be doing so in very deed, to wit, sincerely, as in the sight of God; yea more, he taketh the Testimony of his Conscience, if it be not so; And thus here he looketh not to, nor reflecteth on his Conscience, to alter any piece of his way, but to have it's sense of that piece of it; He gathers, that the Action is good from the Word; and he inquires if he be, and collects that he is right, in the performance from his Conscience, testifying according to the Word; so that he will not trust himself, but goeth to Conscience, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more impartial, to take it's Testimony: The reason then (as I said before) why few Christians have solid peace, is this, if the matter of their Actions be good, and if they can answer their light therein, they reflect but little on their Conscience, in the performing thereof, and therefore want much of the peace and consolation that might otherwise accompany them in their Actions, and when they are done, and over: and this evidence of tendernesse kythes rather, when a man is in the Act, then either before or after; for fear, or awe may make a man seek Light before an Action, and a challenge may put him to reflect, and examine when he hath done; But here mainly lyeth the evidence of sincerity, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, when in every step all along the Action, or Duty so far as is requisit, and humane infirmity will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, he taketh heed what he is doing: and, as we said the other day, That it was an evidence of a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to be alwayes medling in every thing that a man doth; So we say now, that it is an evidence of a tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er man, to listen and hear what censure his Conscience passeth on him, in performing his Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:41558:106"/>The <hi>2d. Use,</hi> is for reproof; Ah! may we not find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by overly reflections, if we did advise with Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at our undertaking of such a work or Duty, that yet in the time of doing it, there was but little reflecting on our Conscience, if it did bear us witnesse of our sincerity in going about it; How many times will Men and Women be found Eating, Drinking, Buying, Selling, Going or Riding a lawful Journey, speaking of a Sermon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet in these Actions, but seldom, or never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, if they have the Testimony of their Conscience, that they are right in their going about of these things? Can this, I pray, speak a tender frame, that is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glective of Conscience? It is certainly an evidence of ane untender Frame in Believers; and where ever it is habitual and regnant, it is an evidence of an evil state; For, if one be a tender Christian, when should his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science be tender, if not in the nick of the performance of an Action? For that is the time when he will, or should be levelling, least he miss the mark: and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how fickle, and unconstant he is, and that he hath a heart like an unsteady hand; how should he guard against it's levity, and unstablenesse?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>3d. Use,</hi> Is of Exhortation, to advert more to this Testimony of Conscience, in performing Duties; O!

And <hi>3ly.</hi> I add this, If <hi>men advert to it, and if it be asked;</hi> because it hath something to say alwayes, yet men will not hear, nor know what it sayeth, except they advert well, and reflect, and take good heed to it.</p>

                     <hi>3ly. Observe,</hi> That it is very strengthning, confirming, comforting, refreshing, and satisfying to a man in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Action, to have the Testimony of his Conscience for him; This beareth <hi>Paul</hi> through here, amidst all challenges that might have been raised, from seeking of himself, or from following revenge, in what he asserts; There is no such thing, saith he, my Conscience beareth me witnes of the contrary: It's not a mans Action simply, that will give him boldnesse, confidence and comfort; for several persons may concur, in one and the self same good Action on the matter; and yet some may have a good, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

grounds, it is Gods Testimony; Now when a Debate ariseth in a man about any of his Actions, the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is the partie arraigned the Challenge, or Tentation, is the party accusing, and Conscience is as the Witnes, or Judge that decideth, and being un-byassed, it beareth Witnes, and passeth the Sentence truly, and impartially; It (as it were) sayeth, it's true, he said such and such a thing, and that sincerely; and I know that his thoughts and intentions were honest; and thus Conscience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the Debate in his favours, if so be he hath it on his side; and so confirms, and comforts him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Use</hi> is, To exhort you to lay more weight on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and on it's Testimony, and less weight on any other thing; for it will not be your good meaning, nor good hopes (as ye use to speak) but a sanctified Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in a sanctified Frame, that will be found fittest to decide in any Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly. Observe,</hi> That the Testimony of Conscience speak ing for a man, and his performing of a good Action on the matter, are separable; That is, a man may do that which is good in it self, and yet not have a positive and approbative Testimony from his Conscience concerning it; otherwayes <hi>Paul</hi> needed not to have attested his Conscience, if he had not known, that Conscience it's Testimony might have been separat from what he speaks; It's well enough known, that he was saying, his heart was grieved for the rejection of the <hi>Iews;</hi> but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was, if he had said it honestly and sincerely; and he asserts, that he hath Conscience it's Testimony for that, as a distinct thing: There are but too many proofs of the truth of this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> are there not many, who speak good words, and do good deeds on the matter, who yet have not a good Conscience in the speaking, and doing of them? As it's said of <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:41558:108"/>
in the performance of it: This will be further clear if we consider these <hi>two</hi> things. 1. That there are many things that concur to make an Action Truly, and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly good, such as we spoke of the other day; many care for no more, but that the Action be good for the Matter, but it's moreover requisit, that it be good as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performance, that it be from a right motive, to a right end, done in Faith, by strength drawn from Christ, and with an eye to acceptance on his account, a corrupt end in Prayer, in coming to the Church to hear, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, or in any other Duty, will spoil the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>2ly.</hi> That there are different Rules to try these by; there is one Rule to regulat us, in the matter of our Actions, and another to regulat our manner of going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; and a good Conscience looketh to both these Rules; And if anyof the requisit qualifications to the suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and acceptable performance of them, be absent and wanting, in so far Conscience will withhold it's positive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Testimony: a good Conscience it's Testimony is like the harmony of a well tuned Instrument; It's one thing to have all the strings on the Instrument, and another thing to have them all in tune; when it is not rightly tuned, though it have on all the strings, it cannot give a sweet, nor harmonious sound; so is it with the Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Use</hi> is, For exhortation to watchful advertance in every thing to Conscience it's Testimony: Seing there are many that do good on the matter, who yet want it's Testimony, it becomes us to be the more watchful to keep a good Conscience; and seing that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science it's speaking for a man, and giving him it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probative Testimony, and his doing that which is good, on the matter, are not only separable, but are often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually separated, the one from the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but even in regenerat men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as fr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41558:109"/>But it may be <hi>Asked</hi> here, What is the reason that it is so difficult to keep a good Conscience, and to carry it along with us, in the very <hi>interim,</hi> mean time, and nick of performing the Action, above, and beyond what it is, either to deliberat and advise with it before we do, or to reflect after we have done?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Answer,</hi> And give these <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> Reasons of it; The <hi>First</hi> whereof, is drawn from the necessary concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of so many things that must go together, in the performance of an Action; Which makes it easier to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve before doing, or to reflect after doing, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.

A declining humour (to say so) or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, whereby we are given to backslide, or turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side like a deceitful bow, that keeps bensel while the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is a drawing, and when it is at, or in the very letting off, starteth aside. <hi>2ly.</hi> A levity, and unsetlednesse, even such that the weather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cock is not sooner, and more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whirled about, by the least wind, then we are by the least breathing of the air of Tentation; So that were we just now in a good and suitable frame for Duty, ere we be aware, we fall off; and a good Conscience requireth a composednesse and stayednesse of Frame. <hi>3ly.</hi> A rashnesse, and hastinesse, or precipitance, which makes us, that so soon as we are clear in the thing, to rush for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to think all is done that is requisit; so that we wait not to carry Conscience along with us, in our performances; which rash precipitant, and hasty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or distemper maketh us often miscarry; As <hi>David</hi> sayes of himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </gap>ching through a Chapter of the Bible; and from trifling in other duties; Why? because we have our Conscience to answer to, and its good testimony to wait for; This is that which giveth holy boldness to a Christian, when 1. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that what he doth is right for the matter. 2. When he taketh good heed to what Conscience faith. And 3. When he hath its good and approbative testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: And we think that this is much of what that Text, <hi>Act</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 16. aims at; and is the main thing a Christian should exercise himself in, even to have the testimony of his Conscience, for him in this, and that, and the other duty, nay in every duty, to have its good testimony, when he beginneth, when he goeth on in it, or in the time of it, and when he hath closed it; This is it (as I have often said) which furnisheth him with holy boldness and confidence, and giveth him much sweet peace and serenity in his mind, that who ever and what ever speak against him, he is at a point that he is right, having the well grounded testimony of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for it.</p>
                  <p>But it may be <hi>questioned</hi> here, How is it possible for a man to carry a testimony of his Conscience along with him in every action? Can he alwayes be reflecting on every word he speaketh, and on every action he putteth his hand unto? For <hi>Answer,</hi> we would <hi>first</hi> distinguish betwixt an explicite and actual inquiring at, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Conscience, and an implicite and habitual inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at, and reflecting on it; and betwixt an explicite and actual, and an implicite and habitual testimony of the Conscience; And then apply it to the particular answer, that then is an explicite testimony of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when it doth actually, expressly and down-right speak its mind; and that is an actual and explicite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on Conscience, when a man doth indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and down-right put himself to it to inquire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences



<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41558:110"/>
sense of his action: An implicite and habitual testimony of Conscience is, when Conscience is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes actually, observably, and expressly speaking by a positive approbation; Yet it is so indirectly, virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and on the matter, and is ready actually to do so, when put to it. And an implicite and habitual refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on Conscience, is, when men are not alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and expresly asking their Conscience what it saith; When yet they do it implicitely, virtually, and on the matter; and are in a readiness to do it actually, when put to it: Which may be illustrated by the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude made use of before; The habitual and explicite testimony of Conscience, and reflecting on it, is like the putting of an Instrument of Musick in a right Tune, and then we say it's in Tune, though none be playing on it; because it is ready to give a distinct and harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sound, having all the Strings right in tune; an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and actual testimony and reflecting, is like a mans striking or playing on the well tuned Instrument, and bringing out actually the just Musical sound, that was habitually in the tuned Instrument before.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply this particularly in <hi>answer</hi> to the <hi>questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> We say, 1. That in <hi>three</hi> cases an actual and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite testimony of Conscience, and reflecting on it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is necessary, 1. As to a mans undertaking of any action or duty, that he be clear in it, that it is a duty 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In reference to the thing when done, because it is that which giveth him peace; for a mans reflecting on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and its testimony here, is like playing on the Instrument. 3. It's necessary as to a mans stare. But 2. We say an explicite testimony, and actual inquiring at Conscience is not simply necessary alwayes along the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or duty, or it is not simply necessary, that a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually reflect and have a testimony from his Conscience alwayes, or in all difference of time along the action, though habitually and implicitely he ought: for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a good Conscience, is like to that general Precept spoken of before, anent doing what ever we do to the



<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41558:111"/>
glory of God, at the principal end of all our actions; and that is founded on this; Where it is not necessary, that all along the action or duty, in all difference of time, or in every moment (as I just now said) we should have actual and explicite thoughts of this end, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods glory; but if this end be intended in the whole current of our life habitually, and actually in the entry of every particular action or duty, though there be not actual and explicite thoughts of it alwayes along the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we may warrantably expect on Christs account Gods approbation, as doing to his glory: So is it here; As when a man undertakes a journey to such a place, It's sufficient before he set out, he actually and explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind that place, and that he do so now and then by the way, and especially if he observe any turning off, or hazard of going out of the way, or if he hath not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten gone that way before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he have not actual thoughts of it all along everystep of the way: But to clear this in a word or two further, we conceive that these <hi>three</hi> particularly are necessary for keeping a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, 1. The habitual Testimony of Conscience, that is, that a mans Conicience be alwayes in a readiness to give him a good testimony; Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <hi>three things.</hi> 1. That he be right in the matter of his practice, that it be nothing sinful that he is about. 2. That he be right in the frame of his spirit, spiritual, stayed and composed. 3. That he be carefully watchful to prevent what ever may ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his peace, and to guard against what may distemper and discompose his spirit; and that withal he be studious to keep his Conscience in a good temper or tune (to speak so) that it may be in readiness to give him a testimony when he calls for it: These <hi>three</hi> are necessary (I say) in every particular action for keeping of a good Conscience, that a man be in a thing that for the matter is right; that he be in a composed and suitable frame; and that he be watchful against any thing that may hinder or distemper him in prosecuting that action. 2. Though an explicite and actual testimony and reflecting, be not alwayes, or in



<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41558:111"/>
all difference of time necessary; yet it would be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the more frequent, readily the better; Though (for instance) in every word of Prayer one cannot actually reflect on himself, nor look after the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Conscience; Yet in intervals this may be win at, and would be endeavoured: It's in this case some way as it's in reference to that command anent <hi>praying alwayes,</hi> or <hi>without ceasing,</hi> though we cannot pray alwayes actually, or continually without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor are we obliged to do so; yet we should be frequent in it, and intermix all our actions with short ejaculations to God, and alwayes keep our selves in a praying frame: So though we cannot alwayes be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly putting Conscience to it, yet frequently we should, and more especially, if we be about a duty that is more difficult and tickle; and wherein we are very ready to go wrong, and so to lay the ground of a challenge; or wherein Gods honour is some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what more then ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned. 3. It's required here, that we seriously endeavour to keep things right, and be weeding out (as it were) what is wrong, as we find Conscience hinting to us; for the frame of our hearts (as hath been said) is very unstable and fickle, we would therefore be often mending and righting it; as a man doth with a Watch that is easily distempered, he often looks to it, and puts it right: Or it is here as it is with a Pilot who steereth a Vessel that is very easily by a little wind put by her course, he beareth up closs in the eye of the wind, and when he finds her never so little off her course, he steers about again till he set her right; or to hold us at the former comparison of an Instrument, to preserve which in tune, it must not only be at first tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered to a just and harmonious sound, and struck upon to give out that sound; But when a man hath played a while upon it, he must be tempering and tuning it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong hands (to say so) screwing up this and that, and the other Peg, as the strings slack their benfil, else it will not be kept in tune; Even so while we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring

to keep a good Conscience, some one Peg or other (so to speak) will readily still be a-unfixing, and we would study to bring things back to their right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and watching that carnalness creep not in upon us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Use</hi> of the Doctrine in a word is, partly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for neglect of this walk, partly to exhort to the diligent and tender practice of it, even carefully to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to Conscience, and to endeavour to be in good terms with it, in performing every action; in eating, drinking, in bargaining, buying, selling, in riding a journey, in hearing, praying, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and not only to hear what Conscience hath to say, but to walk so as Conscience may speak good to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give us its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving testimony for helping us to keep this good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with our Conscience in all our actions, which hath so great a stroak upon a Christian walk, upon a chearful and solacious Christian walk; we would now add these following <hi>directions</hi> to those formerly given to the same purpose; The 1. whereof is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of actions or duties, we would be very deliberat, clear and fixed. 2. We would study to walk soberly, and composedly, and to be alwayes in a good frame; Rashness, precipitancy, hastiness, inadvertency, levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and untenderness, are very cross to these <hi>two</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; as is also parting with Conscience as it were in the way, and not bringing it up with us. 3. We would be much in ejaculatory Prayer, frequenting Gods Throne much, often darting up blinks unto him, and into our own selves, and our Consciences, intermixing these. <hi>4ly.</hi> We would be much in self examination; This is in some respect, the Life of a good Conscience, for where there is not self examination, or reflection, we either are not right, or else know not if we be right, and no thanks to us, if we be not wrong. <hi>5ly.</hi> We would study to have an holy indignation at, and a strick watch set against the very first risings of any thing, that may in the least offend Conscience; Alace! We oft times observe not our own

declinings, and fallings from a good Frame; nor the stirrings of some one Lust and Corruption, or another, which would be resisted in the beginning; for the one of these weareth out the other. <hi>6ly.</hi> As we would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, if we would have a good Testimony from our Conscience, much singlenesse and sincerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the whole of our walk; and would in every duty, indeavour to be setting our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the sight of God, and under his all seeing eye; nothing more marreth the Testimony of Conscience then unsinglenesse, and nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributs more to it then singlenesse; It's a good word that the Apostle hath, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> last. <hi>We are not as many, which corrupt the word of God, but as of sincerity, as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ;</hi> Preaching is a good work, yet there were many Preachers that had not a good Testimony from their Conscience, in that good work; but <hi>Paul</hi> had it; and that which made him to to have it, was his sincerity and singlenesse, that he spoke as before God, in the sight of God, without a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asse, or any allowed carnalness in his end: if we could preach, and pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and live and walk thus in all our Actions, O!

Having already spoken of what use should be made of Conscience before, and in the time of our doing any thing; we have now chos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en these words, to shew what use should be made of Conscience in reference to what is past: Not to stand on every thing that might be observed from them, we shall astrick our selves to this scope, <hi>viz.</hi> To point out the right use making of Conscience, it's sense and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Way and Actions, after they are past; and the Duty of a Believer in trying his bygone course of Life, and every part thereof, as to Conscience it's Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of it, or as to what Conscience can say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>1. Then <hi>Observe</hi> but in passing, That Conscience can signify it's mind to a man concerning his Actions, and Conversation of a long time past, so that though he hath been in such a Countrey among such a people, about such and such an Action many years ago, Conscience reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, hath a facultie (to speak so) of signifying it's sense thereof, as of every other Action of his Life; much of <hi>Pauls</hi> time was now past, and a part of it in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry at <hi>Corinth,</hi> yet looking so far back, his Conscience gives him this Testimony. Which will be further clear, if we consider, <hi>first,</hi> The experience and practice of the Saints, in attesting their Conscience, in past, and in long since past Actions; Na<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It's clear also, from the Office of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; which (as we shew) is not only to dictat, and to be an observing companion, but to be a Judge; which

these, for they go alwayes together when a man is right; His examination of himself, and of his way, the examination of his way by his Conscience, and his self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging; yet they may be some way differenced: self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination is more large, and extensive, taking in the whole that a man is concerned in, his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

very helpful to other duties, contributing much to the reaping of those advantages that are to be had by them.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>Observed</hi> the other day from these Words, that a tender Christian will be often reflecting on his way, and taking notice what Conscience sayeth of it; and spoke somewhat to <hi>two uses</hi> of the point, as it cleareth a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duty, and giveth an evidence and proof of a tender man.</p>
                  <p>We shall now proceed to speak to other <hi>two;</hi> The <hi>first,</hi> and principal whereof is this, If it be a main plece of a tender Christian walk, to be often examiningour selves, and trying what sense Conscience hath of our way and actions; then it serveth for <hi>Exhortation</hi> to all men and women that would live tenderly, to be putting this in practice, as a main piece of a Christian and tender walk, as a main duty called for from them, and as a main evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their tenderness; That is, to be often seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reflecting on their bygone way, to be often bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their thoughts, words, and actions before the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Conscience, for this end, that they may know what it sayeth of them; Not only to be deliberating, and advising with Conscience before they undertake any Action, and to be watchful in going about it, but to be reflecting when it is done, if it be rightly done, and so as Conscience may testify for them concerning the same: This is <hi>Pauls</hi> practice here, <hi>This is</hi> (sayes he) <hi>our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, the testimony of our conscience;</hi> Which supposeth that he hath been laying his way before Conscience, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it said of it, and that he hath received Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence its Testimony concerning it. That which we would in a word here commend to you, is, that Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

them before the Word, but further, when their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the Rule of the Word are laid together, to hear Conscience its Sentence anent their performing of the same.</p>
                  <p>We shall not insist in particular explication of this Duty, ye have heard somewhat spoken of it these dayes past; If we could but gain this much of you, as to have you throughly convinced, that somewhat lyes on you, in reference to the examination of your hearts, and wayes as to things that are past, and to get you in good earnest, ingadged to make more Conscience of this Duty for time to come, it is the great thing we aim at; and if your Consciences were once duly convinced, and cleared of the necessity and usefulnesse of the Duty, and ye brought to be in love with it, ye would through grace be easily led on to the particulars requisit to the right way of performing it: Seriousnesse in, and affection to the thing would supply the roume of many directions; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would now earnestly press it upon you, to take sometime for this duty of self-searching, and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as for prayer, hearing, conference, and other such Duties; and to be as holily solicitous, and desirous to know when ye have done any action or duty, whether it be right or wrong, as ye think ye should be careful to advise before ye do it, that it be good upon the matter; sure the awe of the Majesty of God, and of your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his Depute, and a just regard to your own peace, should incline, swey, and determine you to the one, as well as to the other.</p>

                  <p>And <hi>first,</hi> It may be <hi>objected,</hi> that this is a very hard and difficultly practicable thing, we cannot do it, we dow not do it, it will not go with us, and indeed there is naturally in us all an aversness from nothing more than from this: And we conceive that who ever will essay it in earnest, will find it to be a difficult duty indeed, more difficult and harder to be gone about, then either Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hearing of the Word, or conference on a spiritual subject; It being a duty wherein the inner man at the Bar of Conscience, and so in some respect at the Bar of Gods Tribunal, is exercised and taken up; which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it difficult even to them that would sain go about it: We shall therefore in <hi>answer</hi> to this <hi>objection,</hi> 1. speak something in general. 2. We shall speak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary to some directions or helps, for making it easie. In general, We say, 1. That the Duty would not be scared at, because of it's difficulty, for the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Duties that have the greatest influence on the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of godlness, that strick most at the body of Death, and are most discriminating characters of the godly; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and we would love them the better, and prefer them in some respect to others, that are more easie, and which Hypocrites, and meer Formalists may go about; and indeed such a one is this (as hath been shewed) And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore we have the greater reason to press towards the practice of it. <hi>2ly.</hi> We would say, that though it be difficult, yet ye would essay it; and if ye do so seriously, and in the strength of Christ, ye will find it go far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more easily with you, then possibly ye expect; And the truth is, that as to these Duties, that are more inward and spiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is called for from us, is our essaying of, and putting hand to them, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously necessitating our selves to it; which, if we do, we have them, and this in particular, laid before us, in the Promise, As <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63. <hi>That thou mayest remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and be confounded,</hi> &amp;c. and 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31. <hi>Then shall ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your own evil ways, and doings that were not good,</hi> &amp;c. And so particularly we come to speak in the <hi>2d,</hi> place, of the <hi>Directions</hi> and <hi>Helps</hi> for making it easiy. The 1. whereof, is this, That we would essay it with an eye to the promise; for indeed this, and all other Duties ly in Promises; and albeit we cannot pray a right without the Spirit, yet we will essay it on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; Even so should we do, as to this Duty, how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult soever it may be. <hi>2dly.</hi> And yet somewhat more particularly, we would endeavour to have a sober, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and sanctified frame, in the undertaking and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of this Duty; when our Spirits are Carnal, and Discomposed, and when there is a noise and clamour of worldly lusts swarming within us, it is no great wonder though we essay it, that it go not with us, but miscarry in our hand: We would therefore abstract, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selves, as in Gods presence, and study to have our hearts in a sanctified frame; as the Church doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

not to examine himself; and yet he must either think this; or else he sayes on the matter, that he eares not whether he be right or wrong, which indeed the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of many sayes plainly, or he must examine to find out what is right, and what is wrong. <hi>3ly.</hi> I would ask you, do you think that your Conscience will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes quiet, because ye command it not to speak; or rather, is there not a time coming, when it will speak, whether ye will or not? or do ye think, because ye have no remembrance of your faults, that your forgetting of them now will blot them out of your Consciences Register, or rather should ye not judge your selves, that ye may not be judged?

piece of godlinesse in particular, that lyes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously tender ordering, and disposal of all our actions in order to wining at the joyful Testimony of our Conscience concerning them, hath much difficulty in it, as being contrary to the natural levity, wavering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability of our hearts, and mightily opposed by Satan, as gready prejudicial to his interest in the Soul, yet it is so very excellent, and so exceeding useful, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Christian (as we made appear from our last discourse on these words) that all the difficulty of it may be the more easily digested; It hath (as the other duties of Religion have, when rightly gone about) its reward in the bosome thereof; O! what sweet peace, what strong consolation, and what unspeakable joy hath the Apostle here, from the Testimony of his Conscience after discovering his actions, to be so ordered, by this serious Self-reflection, and examination? whereof spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice would be taken; We shall therefore now proceed to <hi>Observe</hi> some things more particularly from the <hi>Text,</hi> to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> then <hi>Observe,</hi> That when Conscience is well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mans way, it will give a Testimony for him; or when Conscience hath put a mans way to proof, it will not only, in the general speak its sense, but when his way is well ordered, and squared according to the Rule, and he in his design is found straight, and to have taken his aim right, Conscience will, after Examination, excuse, and bear him witnes to his joy: Thus is <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with here by his Conscience, <hi>This is our rejoycing</hi> (saith he) <hi>the testimony of our conscience;</hi> Which is not simply Conscience speaking, but Conscience speaking for vindicating him from these aspersions that were cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or <hi>excusing</hi> him (as the word is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.) And testifying that he was not the man that some men counted him to be; He had this Testimony, <hi>That in simplicity, and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the grace of God he had his conversation in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more abundantly toward them in Corinth;</hi> Which

after search he found to be so: That which we spoke of the nature of Conscience makes this out; for Conscience, when right, speaks of things as they indeed are, and holds forth the mind of God, and gives sentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; when he is well pleased, to declare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce pardon and peace; and when he is displeased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to declare anger, and (as it were) to denunce War.</p>

                     <hi>This is our rejoycing</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the testimony of our conscience;</hi> There is nothing more heartsome, refreshing and cheering to a tender walker, neither can there readily be any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on this side hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, more solacious and joyous to him, then when he hath examined his Conscience, to find it testify for him; This is the great ground of <hi>Pauls</hi> joy and rejoycing; though he lived in the midst of manifold temptations, and tribulations; and was accounted to be the most contemptible of men, <hi>Even as the filth of the world, and the off-scouring of all things;</hi> Yet he had solid peace and joy on this ground, that when he looked back on his way, in the discharge of his Ministry, his Conscience bare him witnes, that he had been single and faithful therein; And as it was thus with <hi>Paul,</hi> so it hath been with many of the Lords people, who have humbly boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rejoyced in this Testimony of their Conscience within, when men have spoken evil of them, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reviled them without.</p>
                  <p>For further clearing of this point, we would consider a little, 1. Some particular Cases, wherein this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Conscience proves in a special manner refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

and rejoycing. <hi>2ly.</hi> We would consider the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grounds, and attendants of this refreshing and joy; whereby we will easily see, that this Testimony of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for a man, upon the search of his way, is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly good thing; for before a man search his way, he cannot solidly acquiesce in the Testimony that Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gives of it; nor can look on it as well grounded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not, nor can be sure whether there be any ground and warrand for it, or not; whereas, when he hath suitably searched for the ground and warrand, where they are, they will readily discover themselves to him.</p>
                  <p>As to the particular <hi>Cases,</hi> wherein this Testimony proves singularly refreshing and joyous, they are these, and the like, 1. In a Case of external crosses, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the World; none of these much move a man, that hath this Testimony of his Conscience, it gives him sweet peace amidst them all; We see what mighty trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>Paul,</hi> was under, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26, 27. Yet he can, and doth rejoyce in the midst of them. 2. When external crosses and losses have sad aggravations attending them, such as the contempt, and reproach of the men of the World; when he is calumniously represented, as one that turns the world up side down, and who is deservedly so dealt with, Conscience its Testimony in that case gives him peace, quietness and joy; which is the very case wherein the Apostle here rejoyceth on this account. A <hi>3d.</hi> Case is, When inward challenges, and temptations accompany outward afflictions, when these are mustered up before, and make an assault on the poor afflicted man, and when there are some fearful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of Gods displeasure born in upon him; Then, O! then Consciences Testimony gives wonderful quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; as we may see it doth to holy <hi>Iob,</hi> who sayeth, in this case, <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live;</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. throughout; and sure it must be solid, and well-grounded quietnesse, rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and repose of Soul, that calms a man in this case. <hi>4ly.</hi> When the person draws near unto death, and when this <hi>King</hi>

It hath with it inward quietness, strength and comfort; The well grounded approving Testimony of the Conscience, calms the heart amidst all storms of outward troubles, or of inward challenges, and tentations, and puts them all to silence, it doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the heart to bear out in what ever tryal; it proves not only comfortable in the holding off challenges, but hath a joy and refreshing, flowing immediately from the very Testimony it self, even a singularly sweet joy, that floorishes, and flows over and above these; and keeps the heart in a calm serenity; <hi>The peace of God,</hi> (sayeth the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7) <hi>shall guard your hearts and minds through Christ Iesus;</hi> Consciences Testimony warrantably speaking peace, is like a garison planted about the heart, keeping it as an impregnable and invincible strong Hold, or Fort; So that no troubles, nor temptations from without, nor stirrings of Corruption or Challenges from within, do sooner (to say so) set out their head, but it overmatcheth them, and preserves the heart quiet in despyt of them all. <hi>2ly.</hi> This does also accompany this Testimony, as a ground of joy, even the clearing up of the persons interest in Christ, and the evidencing of their sincerity, and the truth and reality of the work of Grace in them; Which is very strengthning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting; when a man hath put his way to the tryal in the court of Conscience, and found it to be squared accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly.</hi> This Testimony gives boldnesse and accesse with confidence to God, to go heartsomly and familiarly to him in prayer under the multitude of temptations, crosses and reproaches; and is not this ground of great refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and joy? When a man may go to God, and pour out his very heart in his bosome, may not only tell him what he needs, but also expect a gracious hearing, and return from him, in whatsoever is needful; <hi>If our hearts</hi> (sayes <hi>Iohn</hi> 1 <hi>Epistle Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 22.) <hi>condemn us not, we have confidence towards God, and whatsoever we ask<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do these things that are pleasant in his sight;</hi> Though the man be empty-handed for the time, and hath not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whereupon he can be for the honour of God, either by suffering or doing, he may with humble boldnesse, present his suit to God, and expect from him whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good, and needful for the man himself, and what ever may be for his own honour in him, and by him.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>First Use</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> serves for exhorting, and beseeching you all to study, and be in love with a good Conscience; its unknown, what solid sweet peace and joy ye may have by it; O! Endeavour through Grace, to be so tender, straight, and upright in your aim to have a good Conscience in all things, that when ye reflect on your way, ye may have its good Testimony; There will most certainly be more peace found in this, then in the greatest abundance of all earthly comforts, though combined together at their very best; Can any of these calm a mans mind in a storm of challenges for sin, and of the terrours of death? Do they not often ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave men in greater anxiety, and perplexity, then if they had never injoyed them? Yea, often in the very mean time of these injoyments, and in the midst of the carnal joy and laughter that results from them, <hi>the heart is sad,</hi> through the want of the Testimony of a good Conscience. Therefore we exhort you, in the Name of the Lord, as ye would have a pleasant and cheerful life, and a comfortable and joyful death, labour to have a good Conscience in all things, that when ye reflect on it, it may testify for, and speak good of, and to you; This (as <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes) <hi>Is a continual feast</hi> in Life, and a soveraign cordial against the terrour of Death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d. Use</hi> serves. To let us see the rise, reason and cause of the great anxiety, perplexity and vexation, that is among most men, so that they toil night and day, and have no satisfaction; its even this, that they do not seek after the peace and joy that are founded upon, and result from the Testimony of a good Conscience; no wonder that such persons live, and die utter strangers to all solid peace and joy, which only grow on this Root: This is a main cause also of the little peace, and great heartlesnesse, that is among even Believers themselves, that either they are not so seriously endeavouring to have the Testimony of a good Conscience, or they are not so



<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41558:141"/>
careful to draw their rejoyceing from it, but are unten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their walk, or are as so many Bees fleeing from this flower to the other of worldly injoyments, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to suck some sweetnesse, and satisfaction from them, and doe not, as it becomes them, reflect on Conscience; that they may have a Testimony of sincerity from it; and that on that ground, they may be quiet, cheerful, and joyful.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>3d. Use</hi> Serves, To discover to us, what mighty prejudice flows from, and follows upon the neglect of a tender walk, which layes the ground of this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and on the neglect of self-examination, a main piece of a tender walk, which helpeth to draw forth this Testimony; and therefore, as ye would have this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the refreshing peace, and joy that flow from it in Life and Death, and as ye would have a heart ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily triumphing over all crosses and difficulties, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tribulations, design and indeavour more through grace, to have a tender walk, that ye may lay a ground for this Testimony; and study to be more frequent in Self-examination, that thereby ye may extract, and draw it forth clearly, and convincingly for your peace, comfort and joy: Could many of you be but once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, to prove, and make tryal, what a comfortable thing it is, to have Conscience by this Testimony smil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on you, ye would be more in love with it, and with the serious exercise of godlinesse, and particularly with Self-examination, that make way for it, However, we are perswaded that ere long, the day will come, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of youshall be made to know the truth of all this in your sad experience, when death shall stair you grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the face, and when ye shall neither be able to send nor to flee; O! of what excellent worth will the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good Conscience then be found to be, hearing witnes to men, concerning their honesty, sincerity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse, and the tenderness of their walk; many of you will find it, though ye believe it not now, when ye shall be eternally deprived of such a Testimony; ye shall



<pb n="242" facs="tcp:41558:142"/>
then be made to know to your everlasting cost, that the rejoycing of heart flowing from this Testimony of a good Conscience, is infinitely preferable to all the worldly injoyments, and delights of the sons of men: I would beseech such of you, as think your selves to be wise in this world, to study to be wise in this great point of wisdom; If ye want this Testimony, when it comes to the last reckoning, ye will be for ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and will never through all eternity once smile for joy, but weep and gnash your teeth, for the gnawing pain, that the never dying worm of an evil Conscience shall cause to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly. Observe,</hi> That a man that would be throughly acquainted with his way, and clear in the Testimony of his Conscience concerning it, would be particular in the examination thereof; or thus, he would not content himself with a general confused tryal of it, altogether at once, and in the bulk, but he would try it by parts, and parcels; Thus it was with the Apostle here; when he sayes that he had <hi>the testimony of his conscience, that his conversation was not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, in the world,</hi> he subjoyns, <hi>and more abundantly to you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;</hi> And so descends to the particular, that was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie betwixt him, and these big talking Doctors, that made it their great businesse in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to derogat from the just repute of his Person, and Ministry, and tells them, that he had the Testimony of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence concerning his upright and faithful carriage, in preaching the Gospel to them in particular: When I say, that persons would try their way by parts, or pieces, I mean, that they would try their particular actions, and behaviour in such and such places, at such and such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular times of their Life; because by this means, they come to a more distinct knowledge of their carriage and way; and it is impossible other wayes, when men take up their way together by the lump (as it were) that they can win to distinctnes; which they must needs be at, in some measure, ere they have a well grounded

                     <hi>4ly.</hi> Considering these words as spoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> who takes much pains to prove and clear his condition, and speaks of this Testimony, as of a great matter he had attained to, <hi>Observe,</hi> That it is not easie, but very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, even for a man that hath taken pains in searching himself, to obtain the Testimony of his Conscience for him in a particular; Its not so smal a matter, nor so easie a businesse as many suppose it to be; its not only a great and difficult businesse to follow the search rightly; but it is so likewayes to find things right, and to win at the Testimony of Conscience, as to this, and that, and the other particular: If it were not a great and difficult busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Paul</hi> would not lay such weight on it, as he doth.

From which premises (to speak so) he draws the refreshing conclusion of his joy and rejoycing: Now if we look to all these, or to any one of them, whether to the rarity of it amongst most men, yea even amongst Believers, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; or to the exactnesse and tendernesse of walk that is requisit to be the ground of it; or to the great difficulty that a man will find in coming at a through search of his way; or to the diligence and single<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If it be so (which is the <hi>

                  <p>Now if we will all seriously reflect, and look about us, how few, how very few are there to be found, who can answer these questions affirmatively, in any accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able measure?

And yet when all this is some way done, ye must yet answer <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Questions</hi> more, ere ye can have solid peace and joy, from the good Testimony of your Conscience. 1. Whether were ye proud and conceity in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such and such duties? For, if that dead Flee come in on the doing of the best duties, it will make all to stink: and yet oft-times Christians spoil their duties, and very much deprive themselves of the joyful Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Conscience, even when they have been right for matter and manner; by their being vain, conceity and proud of them.</p>

                     <hi>2ly.</hi> Whether have ye washen your best duties in the Blood of Christ? For if this be wanting, it will greatly marr your peace and joy; Now I would again ask you, if ye can say, that your duties have been conform to these requisits? If not, how is it that ye are so secure, and can alleadge that ye have a good Conscience? or how can you so confidently expect peace and joy from <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ts Testimony? or think ye nothing to prostitute, and (as it were) to make a bachel of this excellent thing, the Testimony of a good Conscience, as if ye could take it up (in a manner) at your foot? Ah! is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can make a crack in, or a breach upon your peace of Conscience? ye will possibly say, that ye have all sinned; if so, how can ye have peace to ly down in sin? It is true, the simple having of sin, when it suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably affects, should not quite marr and bereave a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Testimony of a good Conscience, where Grace is in the truth of it, and there is sincerity, and singlenesse, in endeavouring to be in case affirmatively, in some measure to answer the questions before proposed; but the utter neglect of these things, a conniving at them, and indifferency, whether the requisits be or not, a not wrestling, and striving in the strength of Christ against sin, and to get duties suitably performed, in the same strength, a not seeking to have mens best duties washen,

                  <p>We spoke before to you of the great refreshing, and joy which the well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>grounded Testimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science yeeldeth, and of the great difficulty that there is to attain, and come by it, as being the result of much diligence, labour, and pains in solid answering of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny questions.</p>

                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:41558:147"/>Before we proceed any further, there may arise here a <hi>Doubt</hi> or <hi>Objection,</hi> which would be cleared, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>viz.</hi> If a particular search, and examination, as to every action and duty be necessary, yea, if it be possible, ere the Conscience can give a good Testimony? and if so, how a person can possibly have peace, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his bygone way, when, in seeking to review it, and to reflect upon it, he finds it impossible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine every action, and the circumstances of it? We conceive it to be necessary, to <hi>answer</hi> this Doubt, or Objection, though we confesse, it is very difficult to do it, to full satisfaction, there being especially, extreams upon both sides, some being ready to take an undue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and latitude to themselves, on the one hand, when any allowed qualifications are offered; and others being in hazard to faint, and be discouraged on the other hand, if the matter be kept in a peremptory state, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due qualifications and cautions; And yet we are sure, that the right preaching of the Gospel (if we could win at it) will neither louse reins to lawless and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul liberty to carnal persons; nor make sad the hearts of these that ate gracious and tender, nor put them on the rack, nor involve them into a labyrinth of inextricable intricacies, and perplexities. For <hi>answer</hi> then to the <hi>Doubt</hi> or <hi>Objection,</hi> 1. It is indeed expedient, so far as a Believer can win in self-examination, to reach his particular actions, and the particular steps, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of them, wherein <hi>Iob,</hi> and others of the Saints, have win a great length, and the expediency, if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of it, appears from this, because, by this means, Believers win to more distinctnesse, and stayednesse in up-taking of their case. <hi>2ly.</hi> We think that the distinct examination of all particulars in a mans life, and of the several questions that Conscience may propose concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, is not possible in it self; and therefore not simply necessary as to the makeing of this duty practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; for if we could possibly (as we cannot) go through all our Actions, and all the circumstances of



<pb n="254" facs="tcp:41558:148"/>
them, through out our whole way, it would take up more of our time to examine, then we have for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: if we should be put to reflect particularly on every thing that we have done, on what hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and on what hath been omitted, and the several aggravations, and circumstances of every one of these, and to go through every one of them, according to the exact Rule, it would take us many dayes; yea, if the Conscience should give way to scruplousness in this, there should alwayes be an examination of our examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which yet may, and in some cases ought to be) and so on <hi>in infinitum,</hi> that there should never be an end of this work, to the exclusion of others, clearly called for, which cannot be: That is not then (we conceive) the Lords end, in pressing on us this duty of Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; whereby he designes to extricat the Souls of his People, out of disquietnesse, and not to involve them further in it. Yet <hi>3ly.</hi> We say, that its necessary, as to Believers peace in their duty, that they examine the series of their way, though they cannot reach every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action, or all its circumstances; and that they think no duty to be so clear, nor any sin to be so little, as resolvedly to passe it, without reflecting on it, so far as is possible: and in examining the series, and tract of their way, They would consider, 1. The matter of their actions, whether it was good and approven of God, or not. 2. The manner of them, Whether they have endeavoured to do things after the due order, and in the prescribed manner. 3.

There are some things or actions and duties that more eminently concern a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers peace, or disquietness; his peace if rightly gone about, and his disquietness if otherwise; Some things whereby God is in an especial manner honoured, and the Believer himself comforted, if he carry rightly; and God highly dishonoured, and the Believers Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence greatly wounded, if he miscarry; we may instance it in these solemn Ordinances of the Lords Supper, of times of Humillation with Fasting, of publick, or secret personal Covenanting with the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the like; as here <hi>Paul</hi> reflects particularly on his Ministry among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and on his way in it, as being of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and sayes, <hi>that it was more abundantly to them ward:</hi> thus it is in hearing the Word; in Prayer in our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,



<pb n="256" facs="tcp:41558:149"/>
and in secret; in conferring to edification on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, after we have heard them, or to any spiritual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; in sanctifying the Lords Day, and such others; For in these Duties the rule binds some, nay more strickly; God being in them in a more especial manner honoured or dishonoured; and there is readier access to a challenge, if the person be wrong; and to peace and comfort, if right in these. <hi>2ly.</hi> There are some things that are more tickle and difficult in respect either of the nature of them, or in respect of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inclination to miscarry in them; as for instance, when a man in providence hath been cast into a place and company, where he was crouded with snares and strong temptations, he would there examine more particularly, that nothing have stuck to him that may be ground of challenge against him; so in publick imployments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men are exposed to many temptations and snares, especially when there is somewhat in their own tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, inclination, or humour that disposeth to yield, comply, and miscarry; they would there be the more particular in their examination; thus <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>Ps.</hi> 18. That <hi>be had not wickedly departed from God; that he was upright before him, and had keeped himself from his iniquity;</hi> There were some sins that he was not in such hazard of, as he was of others; and as he hand guarded more against them, so he takes a more particular view of these sins that his natural temper inclined him most to, and that he was most in hazard of: which we would take notice of at all times, but especially in these times wherein men hazard on many things, hand over head, and as it were by guess: So when a man knows that his humour and temper disposes him to be rash and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant, hasty and passionate; when he hath been in company with others, when he may have had more than ordinary occasions of provocation, he would there more particularly look back and see what his way hath been, or what hath escaped him in such company.</p>

tryed: and we take this to be the reason, why the Apostle instanceth here so particularly in his Ministry amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> because his carriage in it was controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the false Teachers there, as if he had not been faithful, zealous, and single in it. <hi>Lastly,</hi> When we speak of Believers more particular trying of their way, we mean not only as to these things that are more dark and unclear, but also as to these that are most clear; for even in these, after exact examination, we may find out ground of challenge for what is wrong in our end, or in our manner of doing; and distinct ground of peace, for what is right; that we may be able with some solid confidence to say, this was wrong, and I have reason to be humbled for it; and this was right, and I may be quieted and comforted in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>5ly. Observe,</hi> That though it be a difficult thing to win to a well grounded refreshing testimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, yet by a tender Believer, it is through grace attainable; <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of it here, not only as a thing that he aimed at, but as that which he attained; the experience also of many of the Saints does prove, that it hath been win at; as we may see in <hi>Iob, David, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> and others: It is moreover clear from the effects that have followed on it in them, such as peace, joy, and rejoyceing; all which clearly hold forth so much, that a Believer in his walk may win to a well grounded, and heart-chearing testimony of Conscience for him; if he be tender and watchful in his way to keep a good Conscience, and diligent in self-examination, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and impartial in putting things to a proof, whether they be right or wrong.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>use</hi> of this Doctrine serves for instruction, to let us see, that to win at such a Testimony of our Conscience is possible; and from the consideration of the possibility of it, it serves also to encourage us to seek after it: If Conscience be made of self-examination, it is not a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, hopeless, and desperat business, as many take it to be, who think (and it may be they have just ground



<pb n="259" facs="tcp:41558:150"/>
for that thought, having so evil a Conscience) that it neither will, nor can speak good to them; but it will certainly speak, when there is ground for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>6ly. Observe,</hi> That a Believer who hath the testimony of a good Conscience, would take with it, acknowledge it, and rejoice in it; <hi>Paul</hi> having, and finding this resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Conscience, ownes it, expresseth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, and avoucheth it. That which I mean here is this, that a Believer would no less take with Conscience its testimony, when it speaks for him, then he takes with a Challenge when it speaks against him; and would be as well comforted by the one, as he is humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other: the experience of the Saints clears and confirms this, <hi>Hezekiah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> David, Paul</hi> here, and others of the Godly have comforted themselves from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good Conscience: we will not, we dare not say, that it is either the greatest or most ordinary fault; but we are sure, it is a fault incident to Believers, that they do not (when studying to have a good Conscience in all things) take more with, acknowledge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themselves in the testimony of their Conscience; partly thinking that it is presumption for them to own it, or to comfort themselves in it, partly thinking that something else is more suitable for them; and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them rather to be humbled, because of the many evils that they find themselves to be guilty of, then to be thus comforted; thinking that they have never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for a testimony of Conscience for them; which were very hard for Believers to conclude, for it were on the matter to deny that they have any thing of the grace of God in truth; for as far as Grace is in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, they have ground for this Testimony of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for them, and so good ground to be comforted, and made joyful from it.</p>
                  <p>But for prosecuting and clearing of this; we shall give you some <hi>Rules</hi> or <hi>Cautions,</hi> which may serve as so many Directions to walk by in this matter, for preventing of mistakes; The <hi>First</hi> whereof is this, that the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of a good Conscience to sojourning and militant Saints, doth nor flow from perfection in holiness; otherwise <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Paul, Hezekiah,</hi> &amp; others, would never have had it: but it flows from reflecting on the general tract of a mans way, and his finding it to be in some measure straight before the Lord; as we see it did in <hi>David, Ps.</hi> 18. 21, 22. and <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> is, That the testimony of a good Conscience may be, where there are challenges for sin; there may be in one and the same Believer, a just challenge for what is wrong, and a good Testimony for what is right; and as he should not on the one hand refuse to take with the challenge, so he should not on the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline embracing the good testimony: as the Lord teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es plainly in his way of dealing with the Churches of <hi>Asia, Revel.</hi> 2. and 3. Where, when he reproves them for what is wrong, he also commends them for what is right; teaching Believers thereby to distinguish well betwixt these two; and so to take with a challenge from Conscience for that wherein they are wrong, as not to refuse its testimony for them when they are right; for the Conscience will always have somewhat to say to such in reference to both these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that resolve (as it were) to admit only of challenges, and of nothing but pure challenges, suppose themselves to be lying still in their natural and unrenewed state; and they that would be at an absolute and entire good testimony without any challenges at all, must look for that only in Heaven; where all the godly will most certainly have it to their joy unspeakable, and eminently full of glory; and it is a very shrewd evidence of an unsound state; and of a persons being under the power of delusion, to imagine, that he hath only such a testimony alwayes, without any challenges for sin at all, while he hath still a corrupt nature within him, as all other mortals have.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>3d.</hi> is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That in the self same action, a Christian may, and readily will have both a challenge and a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony;

a challenge for something wrong and a testimony for something right therein; according to that word of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Hear the prayer of thy Servant, and of thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who desire to fear thy name;</hi> He, no doubt wanted not challenges for short-comings, yet he had a Testimony from his <hi>desire to fear Gods name;</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. The Apostle sayeth, <hi>we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly,</hi> and yet there was so much corruption remaining in the eminently holy man, as to raise challenges on him, as we see, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. But he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what is right in his own condition, from what is wrong; we would not therefore think, that we cannot have a good Testimony from our Conscience, except there be absolut purity in the duty, or action; This were, as if a man should say, I have no faith, because I have a mixture of unbelief with it; or I have no sincerity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have a mixture of hypocrisie with it: we know that Saints use to distinguish, and put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these, as that poor man did, who sayes, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>I believe, Lord, help my unbelief;</hi> as another may say, I have much hypocrisie, yet I have some <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, That there may be a good Testimony of the Conscience, in a particular action, when as to the action, complexly considered, a Believer may see ground to be humbled; there being two parts in him, the renewed, and un-renewed part; sometimes the corrupt and un-renewed part may so restrain him, that he cannot do that which he would; and yet he may have some peace here, in as far as according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed part, he allowes not himself in that prevailing of the corrupt and un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> renewed part, but is afflicted with, and protests against the same; so the Apostle sayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15, 16, 17. <hi>That which I do, I allow not; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

at holiness and a conformity to God, and suffers him not to think it enough to have no challenge, but to try if there be ground for it.

A <hi>fifth</hi> ground is, That when all this is in some

measure win at, a man be making Conscience of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and searching himself, and reflecting on his way, that he may know that it is so; for though <hi>Paul</hi> had his conversation <hi>by the grace of God, in simplicity, not in flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisdom</hi> &amp;c. yet he had not this joyful testimony of his Conscience till he put it to proof, and found it to be so indeed; and if he had not done this, he had not had Consciences good Testimony. A <hi>6th</hi> and last ground is, when all this is done, that a man be denyed to it, and lay the weight of it only upon, and give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it altogether to the grace of God; that he single himself out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exclude himself from having any praise of that which he hath attained to; therefore the Apostle here attributes all to grace; as he doth in like manner. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>I laboured, sayes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>) is, That a man that endeavours sincerely, and seriously to keep a good Conscience, may yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

be exceedingly mistaken, and mis-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the world; <hi>Paul</hi> here found it needful to clear himself thus, which he needed not to have done, if he had not been much mistaken, and mis-represented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly. Observe,</hi> That a man under many mistakes, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations, and reproaches, may have a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; so that a man is not in reference thereto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leidged to stand to others thoughts, and judgement of him; Thus <hi>it was a smal thing for</hi> this same Apostle, <hi>to be judged by mans judgement;</hi> As he tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3. Therefore ye would beware to lay weight on mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, mis-representations, or false reports of men; since a good report, and a good Conscience go not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes together; <hi>Paul</hi> went through good report and ill report, and digested all these things; so that his peace, and the Testimony of a good Conscience were not thereby marred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly. Observe,</hi> That clearness as to a good Conscience under mistakes and reproaches, is a great and notable ground of con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly. Observe,</hi> That when men meet with many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and walk in a way that is attended with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of snares, they need more then a guessing or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural un certainty, as to the Testimony of a good Conscience anent their being right; even a-well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certainty and perswasion; <hi>Paul</hi> doth not say here, we suppose or hope (as many of you understand hope) but <hi>we trust,</hi> or are firmly perswaded; men would study alwayes to be clear in what they do, but

more especially, when their way may be offended at, and they reproached on account thereof; and most especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as to that part of their way, that is like to be most offended at.</p>
                  <p>More particularly from these words considered as a reason of the fore-going exhortation to pray for him. <hi>Observe,</hi> 1. That a man who hath a good Conscience, and is most clear in it; doth ordinarily lay most weight on prayer, and is most in love with that sweet exercise; so that he will not only pray for himself, but will also desire others to pray for him; Its never a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in a man, that makes him slight prayer himself, or the prayers of others for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly, Observe,</hi> That a man that hath a good Conscience, will desire, and think himself concerned to endeavour not to be mistaken by others; he will not boast of his good Conscience, not caring what others think or say of him; but will seek to remove any offence that may be taken at his way, or that may give any the least ground to make his integrity to be called in question: as <hi>Paul</hi> doth here, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Where he sayeth, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>I am become a fool in glorying;</hi> but adds <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>but we do all things</hi> (and so this amongst the rest) <hi>dearly beloved for your edifying;</hi> And the reason is, because a man of a good Conscience will not only study to be tender in his walk, so as himself may have peace within; but will also have regard to the Conscience of others, that they may not stumble and sin, nor the way of God suffer, when he may prevent it; and its a sure evidence of an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntender Conscience, when men care not who stumble at their way, or how others account and esteem of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly. Observe,</hi> (Which is of affinity with the former) That a man that endeavours to have a good Conscience, and to be clear that it is so indeed, will be very desirous to have a room in the prayers of others of Gods people; Or such a man is one that will not lippen to, &amp; lay weight upon his own prayers only, but will also highly prize

Christian fellowship, and desire to have the benefit of the prayers of other Christians: <hi>Paul</hi> seldom misses this in his Epistles; so <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. and <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. He is much in putting and pressing them to pray, and to pray and strive for him together in prayer: The reason is, because a man of a tender Conscience hath a kindly sense of his own infirmity, and a great desire to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the way of holiness, and at much injoyment of God; and would therefore <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ain have a lift from every one that can help him; such a man hath a native exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in pursuing, not only after fellowship with God, but also with his people; Whereof this is a main part: And though these may be looked at, but as little things, yet if we compare our selves with the Rule, and with the practice of tender Christians; we will find consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able defects, as to a good Conscience in them: There is a sort of disdain, or shame in many, to seek the help of others prayers, as if it supposed their being assaulted with some un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>couth temptation; or the prevailing of some gross corruption; or the lying on of some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>heard of Cross and affliction; but the single design of having a good Conscience, and of getting it intertained, would put us, not only to pray our selves, but also to desire the help of the prayers of others: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, this is a most certain truth, that as a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is not attained without prayer; so its not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but by prayer: And its indeed a wonder how many can boast of a good Conscience, and yet neglect prayer themselves, and undervalue the prayers of others for them.</p>
                  <p>But it may be <hi>asked</hi> here, 1. What influence hath a Christians good Conscience, in laying on the duty of prayer on others for him? 2. What influence hath a good Conscience, to perswade others to the performance of this duty for the person that hath it, more then for others? Our speaking a little to these <hi>two,</hi> will lead us in to the discovery of some notable advantages, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a good Conscience.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>2d.

We <hi>answer</hi> 1. That Christians would not limit their duty in prayer only to these; For we see, <hi>Moses, David,</hi> and many others of the Saints, pray for such, as had no good Conscience; so that we may warrantably pray for others though not having a good Conscience, and may hope to be accepted therein; and that our praying for them shall not be without fruit, and benefit to our selves at least. Yet <hi>2ly.</hi> There lyes a greater ty, and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on us to pray for them that keep a good Conscience then for others; even as there doth, <hi>to do good especially to these that are of the household of faith;</hi> The communion of Saints here binding and linking (to say so) more straitly and strongly; So we are (I say) proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably more strictly tyed to pray for sincere seekers of God; as the Apos<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All these serve to commend the great advantages that attend the having of a good Conscience, and to lay a strong obligation on us to pursue after it; and they may some way direct us how to walk, so as we may attain, and entertain a good Conscience; and they may withal help to make some discovery to us, if we be tender in our walk. But we come now to the Apostles assertion, <hi>We trust</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>we have a good conscience:</hi> from which we would observe a few things, wherein we shall be more general, 1. Then <hi>Observe,</hi> That there is a very great difference betwixt Consciences; some Consciences are good, some evil; some are clear and pure, some are unclear, impure, and defiled; As the Apostle shews,

As to the persons present frame, there must be Spirituality, Singleness, and some measure of Tenderness; otherwayes it will much obstruct this perswading testimony; for its not enough, that a man has been tender, if he be not in some measure so now; <hi>Paul</hi> sayes here, <hi>We have</hi> (not only we had) <hi>a good conscience. 3ly.</hi> There must be some deliberatness, and determinatness of his purpose, and resolution to walk with God for the time to come; for if a man do not dedicat and devot himself to the study of holiness for the future, though he be supposed to have had never so much of it in his by-gone life, this firm, and comfortable perswasion will be much marred and obstructed: So then these <hi>three</hi> must here go together, <hi>viz.</hi> Holines in a mans by-past life; holines in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent frame, and holines in his purpose for the future:

Here, that an honest and good Life, or Walk, and an honest and good Conscience go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; There is alwayes a suitableness betwixt the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a persons Conscience within, and the ordering of his Walk and Conversation without; Or thus, as a mans life is, so is his Conscience: If the Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be honest, then a man may have, and hath an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and good Conscience; but if his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation be untender, dishonest, profane and louse, he cannot possibly have a good Conscience, as the Apostle plainly affirms, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 15. And the reason of it is clear, because Consciences well grounded Testimony must be according to Truth, and speak out the thing as indeed it is; and as when the thing is ill and wrong, it cannot speak peace and good; so when the thing is right, it will not speak ill.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Use</hi> of it, do not separat these things which God hath conjoyned; Think never to have a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when ye have not an honest Conversation: It may be found without the accomplishment of a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent search, that many do presumptuously and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly speak and boast of a good Conscience, when there is nothing in their Conversation that looks like it, let be warrands it; but if ye would certainly know the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of a good Conscience, take it from <hi>Paul,</hi> it is even <hi>a living honestly:</hi> I would only here have you to take this Caveat in the by, when we say that a <hi>good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and an <hi>honest life</hi> or walk go together, we would not have you to look to the connexion of these <hi>two,</hi> so severly and rigidly, as if there could not be a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but where there is an honest walk in its perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without all slips or failings; for we are now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a deliberat, fixed, and settled purpose, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere indeavour to live and walk honestly; which may

consist with slips and fallings of infirmity; This <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to live honestly</hi> can never be separate from a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: Neither would we have you thinking, when a Christian miscarr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es in his Conversation, that he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover a good Conseience: There are two wayes whereby a Believer may come to quietness in his Conici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 1. By the exercise of Sanctification which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a Challenge; and that is it which the Apostle speaks of here, and <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. and it is that which we mean in the Doctrine. 2. When he fails and misca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there is a recovering of quietness, and of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Conscience, by the exercise of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epentance and Faith, sprinkling the Conscience with the blood of Jesus; Which flows not so much indeed from the mans holiness and tenderness, for preventing of a Challenge, as from Justification, and the right that the Soul gets to pardon of Sin thereby, wherein the Blood of Christ removes the Challenge and quiets the Conscience; and a Soul may have the one of these, when to its sense it wants the other; or hath indeed but little of it; It may have some comfortable clearness of interest, or at least the faith of it, when it has in some respect an ill Conscience; as we may see <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. So up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other hand, we conceive it is not impossible for a Believer to have some tenderness, and a testimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from his Conscience, when he is much in the dark, as to his interest in God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> From <hi>Pauls</hi> knitting of these two together, <hi>viz.</hi> A good Conscience and the qualification of it, an honest walk. <hi>Observe,</hi> That such as would confidently assert, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to themselves this Testimony, that they have a good Conscience, would do it on well qualified grounds and evidences; therefore the Apostle here does not content himself simply to assert it; and generally, wherever he asserts this, he holds out something of his practice, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that he was not mistaken, nor presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his asserting of it: If we consider the extremities that men are disposed to run into, in this matter,



<pb n="290" facs="tcp:41558:166"/>
some too soon, and too easily assuming to themselves this Testimony of a good Conscience; others again in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>More particularly, It may be <hi>asked</hi> here, what is the qualification, or evidence, whereby a person may clear, and prove that upon good and solid ground, he assums to himself this Testimony of a good Conscience, and may not scrupulously reject it? The Apostle holds it out in these words, <hi>willing to live honestly;</hi> and ye may take it in this <hi>Observation,</hi> That a firm and settled serious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of universal holiness, and honesty in our life, and walk, hath great influence on the peace and tranquillity of our Conscience; and is a good evidence of a good Conscience; and withal a choice companion, that waits continually on it: I put these <hi>three</hi> together, as included in the words, <hi>in all things Willing to live honestly;</hi> The latter words respect the former, the design being as broad as the effect; and the former prove the latter, the study of universal holiness, a willingness to live honestly. 1, then we say, That this universal honest design is the companion of a good Conscience, it waits alwayes on it; or a good Conscience and this go together, he that hath a good Conscience is honest in his walk, and he that is honest in his walk hath a good Conscience. <hi>2ly.</hi> We say, that it is an evidence of a good Conscience; for, if they only have this good Conscience, who are honest in their walk, then where this honest walk is, there must be a good Conscience. <hi>3ly.</hi> We say, that it hath much influence on a good Conscience, its in some sort a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of it, in which sense, a good Conscience is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ect of an honest walk; so that the more honest a man be in his walk, the more quietness will he have in his Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Because the Doctrine is very broad, and affords much

                  <p>1. Then for clearing the Doctrine by parts; in it we take in these threeingredients, to make up the evidence of a good Conscience. 1. That a mans walk be honest <hi>2ly.</hi> That it be an universal honesty in all things. <hi>3ly.</hi> That there be an willingness, or hearty purpose towards universal honesty, whereon the great stress of the quietness of a persons Conscience lyes, <hi>viz.</hi> The sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the purpose, or a heart-willingness: And we may consider all these, either <hi>negati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That on the matter, it be in things allowed and approven of God; For there neither is, nor can be any honest liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except our supposed duties, and our practices be allowed and commanded of God; and here a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or an honest mind, if the thing thwart the word of God; will not prove honesty, because, as to the matter it is not right, as <hi>Paul</hi> shews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.

when Christ tells him, <hi>If he would be persyte, he must sell all that he hath, and give to the poor, and come and follow him;</hi> And so puts him to a proof of his willingness, by putting him to will the mids, as ever he would come by the end; It's said, <hi>He went away sorrowful for he had great possessions;</hi> He was loath and unwilling to want hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he was as unwilling and loath to forgoe his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and at length, in this debate and strugle, his wealth prevailed, and carried him quite off from Christ; alace!

                  <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> that we proposed last, was for directing us how to keep a just mids betwixt those two extreams; and its this, That where there is a sincere willingness to be universally honest in the whole of our Conversation, It hath great influence on the peace of our Conscience, Is a notable evidence of a good Conscience, and a choice companion that waits continually on it: <hi>Paul</hi> here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts



<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41558:172"/>
his tranquillity of Conscience on this ground; and withal explains and qualifies the same, by telling us that <hi>in all things he had a willingness to live honestly:</hi> Now because this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is of great concernment to Believers in Christ, as to their solid peace and comfort; and deals with several sorts of men; some of whom, as <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> rejecting any such evidence, and disputing against the possibility of universal sincerity; so that according to them there can be no solid conclusion drawn hence for the comfort of Believers: Others, such as <hi>Hypocrits,</hi> snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this consolation, when they have no honesty in their walk; and a <hi>third</hi> sort (better disposed) who from seen defects and failings in their walk, refusing all the consolations that flow from this ground; say on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the weakning of their own hands, and to the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and discouraging of their own hearts, that they have nothing of this honesty, nothing of this <hi>willingness to live honest by;</hi> We insisted the more on the clearing of these <hi>three</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine:</hi> 1. What is meant by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Walk. 2. What is meant by universal sincerity, or honesty in our Walk. 3. What is meant by this <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to live honestly, which is the base on which the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of a good Conscience doth mainly lean, and the very hinge on which it is mainly turned, as being the greatest evidence of sincerity: We shall yet premit some things further for clearing of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and then we shall confirm it, which is in substance, and in short this, That a man who hath an universal willingness to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, may have Calmness and tranquillity of Conscience, though there be many things in his life, for which he may very justly censure himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First.</hi> Then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it be premitted, that when we speak of this calmness of Conscience flowing from the universal honesty of a persons Life and Walk; We mean nor, 1. Such a perfection of calmness and tranquillity as may stand before Gods Judgment-seat; for though we were in case to say with the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>That we know nothing by our selves; yet are we not thereby justified,</hi>

                     <hi>but be that judgeth us is the Lord;</hi> who is greater than our Conscience, and sees many things in us, that we see not selves: Who ever therfore supposeth such a perfection, can never have calmness of Conscience while he lives in the World. <hi>2ly.</hi> Nor is this such a calmness as prevents all challenges; a man may have challenges of Conscience and yet have a good Conscience. Neither <hi>3ly.</hi> Is it such a calmness, as under it Believers have no ground for, nor use of Repentance and Humiliation; nay Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is not only consistent with this calmness, but it is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mean of it, and a main ingredient in it; its a thing whereby in part it is both attained and entertained; The kindly Gospel-exercise of Repentance for sin will not break our peace, but very readily vacation from this exercise will do it to purpose: And therefore we would carefully distinguish betwixt Repentance, Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Self-loathing for sin, and the marring of the peace of our Conscience; Yea there may be much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise wrestling and fighting inwardly in the Spirit of a Christian, and yet considerable calmness of Conscience in that same condition: for that which gives peace, is not so much the want of all exercise of mind, as a suitable behaviour under that exercise; As we may see in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> who though he was deeply exercised, and sorely combatted with the remainder of a body of Death within him, as he gives a lamenting account. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.

This peace and calmness that we speak of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may consist with the indwelling of corruption, though not with the reign and dominion of it; I say with the indwelling of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where the stirrings and actings of it are (as it were) protested against, groaned under, and opposed; as it was with this Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the law of his members rebelling against the law of his mind,</hi> yet maintains his peace; because this peace is grounded, not so much on the intire and absolute Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over Corruption, as on a real hatred of, a real enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at, and a real fighting against it. 3. This peace and calmness may consist, not only with corruption indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but sometimes with the prevailing and captivating power of corruption; which is also clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where the law that is in the Apostles members prevails so far against the law of his mind, that it leads him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the law of sin that is in his members; and yet he hath peace; the reason is, because this peace does not only flow from the event of the wrestling or fight, but also from the Christians not yielding in the fight, though he be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivat, and from his entring as it were a dissent from, and protestation against the captivating power of corruption; Therefore (saith he) <hi>The thing I do, I allow not and its no more I that doth it, but sin that dwelleth in me</hi>) Not, but it was he that sinned, but he allowed it not; Nay (as I said) he protested against the prevailling of sin in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; Therefore the words in the Original are, <hi>The thing I do, I know not,</hi> that is, I will not in some respect own it for my deed; and on this ground he maintains his peace, and from it draws his consolation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>There is therefore now <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Conscence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wasting-sins, that raise a storm and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest in the Conscience, such as were <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murder, <hi>Peters</hi> denyal of his Master, and the like; Which though they may consist with an interest in God, standing still inviolated and not nulled; and though peace may be recovered by the renewed exercise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance toward God, and of faith toward the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; yet for the time of the prevailing of such sins, and before such exercise of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith and Repentance, they are to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believers Conscience as boisterous Winds are to the Sea; we do not therefore admit of all sorts of sins to be consistent with this Peace and Tranquillity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; but such only as are sins of more ordinary infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against the Souls actual dissent and protestation to the contrary. 2. We would beware of such Aggravations of sin, that make little sins (little I mean comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to become great sins; a man may be captivat by some sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet retain peace; and yet these same sins in another person, by reason of some grievously aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating circumstances, as if they be committed deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and out over the belly of Light, and of Checks and Challenges, may much waste his Conscience, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound and mar his peace: In this respect (I say) though the sin in its own nature may be lesser, yet it is greatned by these and such other Aggravations: They are strictly and properly sins of infirmity, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doth not consent to, wherewith he is surprised, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which he fights and wrestles, seeking after, and



<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41558:174"/>
longing for Victory over them, and with which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no truce, even when they prevail; as for other <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ins they will very readily mar the Believers Peace and Tranquillity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> being thus qualified and guarded on all hands, we shall now at length proceed to the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which is, that wherever there is a sincere wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to be universally honest in our Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, there is good ground for peace and calmness of Conscience; or it is an evidence of a good Conscience and a companion of it.</p>
                  <p>It may be confirmed from these grounds; 1. Either we must say that no Believer has ever had Tranquillity and calmness of Conscience, which were absurd; or we must say that these who had it, did attain to perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and needed no Repentance, which the forenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Instances of most eminent Saints, as of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> will confute; or if we can say none of these <hi>two,</hi> we must needs assert the <hi>third,</hi> viz. That a Believer on his sincere design to live honestly in all things, though he come not up the full length he should be at, may have Peace. 2. That which hath quieted many Believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, may be a ground of calmness and quietness to us; for as the ground and cause is common, the effect must also be common; But on this ground many Believers have been quieted before us, Therefore we may likewise on it quiet our selves: If we look thorow the Scriptures, we will find the Saints thus quieting and comforting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; What is the ground that <hi>David</hi> comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 21, 22, 23. Is it not on this? <hi>I have keeped the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my God;</hi> This sure is not absolute perfection that he means of, for we know he had many defects and failings, but sincerity; for, says he, <hi>All his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were before me;</hi> he had honestly designed the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them all; <hi>I did not put away his Statutes from me;</hi> he balked none of Gods Statutes; <hi>I was also upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and I keeped my self from mine iniquity;</hi> The



<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41558:174"/>
strain of his way was honest, and his slips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and failings were (hitherto its like) of infirmity, and therefore he has Peace: We may see that it was thus also with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah, Isa.</hi> 38. with <hi>Iob chap.</hi> 31. and with <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3. Who was not perfect already, but pressing hard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. A 3. ground of Confirmation is drawn from the Scriptures giving such Characters and Descriptions of Believers, and affirming such qualifications of them; on account of which they have a testimony from God, and ground of holy boldness in their pleadings with him; all which look to their honest willingness and sincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after perfection, and not to their attainment of it; as we see in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who thus speaks to God, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy Servant, and of thy Servants who desire to fear thy Name;</hi> Where we have the asserting of an interest in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of a kindly relation to him with holy boldness; And yet they plead not a perfection in the fear of God; but a desire to fear him; Their desire, design, resolution and endeavour, was to fear him; So <hi>Matth</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Lord to be <hi>blessed who hunger and thirst after righteousness;</hi> Which speaks plainly no absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; And say they, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. <hi>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forsaken thee, nor dealt falsly in thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> Though they had many infirmities and failings, which they did not deny but take with; yet they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly avouch adherence to God and to his Covenant, so as they did not forsake him, nor deal treacherously in it; they assert their sincerity in cleaving to him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all that came upon them: This ground is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made use of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. and particularly <hi>vers.</hi> 6. Where the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayes, <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed when I have respect unto all thy Commandments;</hi> as if he had said, my Conscience shall not blush, nor be confounded, but have confidence and quietness, though there be not a perfect up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coming in obedience to all things command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if I have a respect to all, and an honest design and purpose to be at all. 4. it cannot be otherwise, if we

That God <hi>accepts of a willing mind, according to that which a man hath, and not according to that which he hath not;</hi> If a man improve well, seriously and sincerely the outward things given him, though there be some provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential obstruction to the performance, yet on account of his honestly willing mind, he is graciously accepted; Which holds proportionably in other points and parts of obedience; Thus the Lord says, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>I will spare them as a man spares his Son that serveth him;</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 13. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Children, so doth the Lord these that fear him;</hi> The force of the comparison shews that things are not at perfection in them, for then there were no need of sparing or pity; but as there is such compassion in a Father, that though his Son cannot perform things commanded him exactly and perfectly; yet if he be readily and honestly doing what he dow, he will spare and pity him, and he would be an unnatural Father that should do otherwise; So will I do says the Lord with my Sons that serve me: and in this respect the ground of a mans peace and calmness, is not any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute perfection in himself, but Gods Covenant and free grace, and his way of dealing with his own Children, who will in some cases say nothing against them, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is not allowed to say any thing, where he says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The 1. <hi>Use</hi> of the Doctrine, serves to shew us, That it is a tenet contrary to Scripture, cross to Believers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, and to the nature of hollness, and that withall makes way for lousness, to say that there is nothing in in sincerity, and willingness to live honestly, that can give a Believer quietness, and calmness of Conscience; which <hi>Antinomians</hi> (on the matter at least) to skar, and fright Believers, not from peace of Conscience, but

They say, that none at all wins to this universal willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or sincerity: But for <hi>answer</hi> (as we said before) we speak not of universal perfyt willingness, but of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere real willingness; There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt universal honesty up at perfection, and an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after universality of honesty; and its the last that that we say, a Believer may have, and hath (when in case) in its more lively exercise. <hi>2ly.</hi> (Which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the former) They say, That a natural man may have this willingness, and so it can be no ground of peace to the Believer: But for <hi>answer,</hi> we speak not of what a natural man may think he has, but if the qualifications of this willingness (whereof we spoke the last day) be remembred, and well considered, it will be found, that no natural man hath it, neither can have it while he is such; We speak not of what a demented person may fancy he hath, but of what a sober and composed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hath.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d. use</hi> serves to discover the great unsoundness, and strong delusion, that is in the conclusion, that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites (the second sort of persons whom this Doctrine deals with) are disposed to draw from it; who are ready to blesse themselves, and to think and say, Well's us that there is such a truth as this; for though we fail and come short in many things, yet we have a good mind, and meaning; and under this specious, and plausible-like pretext, they shrewd, (and as it were) hide all their voluntary neglects, and ommissions of these things which they are called to, in the practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in living honestly, in order to winning at this solid peace and tranquillity of a good Conscience; But let me ask such, have ye the qualifications which we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed of this willingness? Is it a willingness that carries you forth towards coming at the mids, to will holiness,



<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41558:176"/>
as well as at the end to will happiness? and that carries you towards the mids, <hi>viz.</hi> Holiness for it self, and not for heaven or happiness only? is it an habitual willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and not by fits and starts? is it single, and not mercenary, nor crooked? And is it effectual, and not sluggish? Though God will graciously accept of willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where persons are honest and sincere in their aim and endeavour, notwithstanding of much failing and short-coming; yet where men allow themselves in their short-comings, he will not there accept of willingness: Therefore that word <hi>opportunity,</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41558:178"/>
And I do in the Name of the Lord solemnly Charge such of you whose hearts were never towards holiness, that ye presume not to meddle with the Consolation that waits on this honest willingness, or this willingness to live honestly; and if any such shall offer to drink it, God shall make you with pain, even to renting (as it were) of your very Bowels, vomit it up again, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence shall be utterly rejected, and root you out of your Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>The 3, <hi>Use</hi> serves to clear, ease and comfort, these that design and endeavour to be tender in their Walk (the <hi>third</hi> sort of persons, with whom we said this <hi>Doctrine</hi> deals) who will be ready to <hi>object,</hi> alace we have much corruption, and many failings and breakings forth of that corruption: We shall not deny but take for-granted what ye say; yet your great corruption, and many sins should put you to the serious exercise of Repentance, and self-loathing, but should not where this willingness is, break your peace; because Conscience should pity where God pities, who pities his honestly willing people as a Father pitieth his Children. But such will further <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> Ah! our sins have sad aggravations, we know we are wrong, and in ill case, and yet we some way ly still, at least do not effectually bestir our selves to win out of it: For <hi>Answer,</hi> I would enquire, do you allow your selves in that? There is great difference betwixt your knowing that ye sin, and your sinning willingly; <hi>Paul sees a law in his members rebelling against the law of his mind,</hi> and yet says, <hi>what I do, I allow not; for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I know not: I</hi> shall readily grant that there would be much honesty, singleness and humility here: Yet God allows peace on a poor captive sinner, who knowing the thing that he doth to be ill, yet approves it not, nor himself in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But such will yet again <hi>object,</hi> How can we have peace, so long as we have sin in us? For <hi>answer,</hi> I would say, That its one thing to have peace with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and another thing to have peace with Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;



<pb n="315" facs="tcp:41558:178"/>
Corruption and Conscience are as two contrary parties; a man may be in league with the one party, when he is pursuing the War with the other; yea, except a man have War with corruption, he cannot have peace with his Conscience; And though when two parties are in confederacy, a third may come and beat the one of the two off the Field, yet that will not dissolve or break the League, except there be a willing yielding toward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the contrary party; yea, fighting still, and refusing to yield when the beaten party is weak, is the greater evidence of honesty; so is it when Conscience and we are in League together, though corruption beat us, if we yield not, it will not break peace; as it was with holy <hi>Ioh, chap.</hi> 31. who will do nothing that may wrong his Conscience; and though corruption should sometimes prevail over him, who hath made a League with Conscience, yet he will not submit to it as his Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lawful Soveraign; and so long as it is thus, it will not break the peace; yea, there may be a good testimony of Conscience under such a sad and wrestling exercise: And though we would not have every Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, base complyant, or run-away, to meddle with this Consolation; Yet sincerely-willing Souls, that are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their outmost to maintain the fight, and to keep the field, and yet fall under a surprisal, and get some defeat, may warrantably lay claim to it, though with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and self-loathing; and may have some peace and calmness in this, that they had not a voluntary hand in their own defeat; Whereas he that is not serious in the fight, can have no such ground of peace, because he has been complying with, or conniving at Corruption, or not seriously striving, nor protesting against it; but where there is a testimony that none of these things are, the League and Covenant that is betwixt the man and his Conscience may stand, and he may have, and ought to maintain his peace.</p>
                  <p>That we may come to a close of this Discourse and <hi>Text,</hi> take some <hi>Characters</hi> of this willingness to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,

where its sincere: And 1.

Because of a dead principle they proceed from, they flow from man that is dead by nature, as to any spiritual life, <hi>dead in sins and trespusses;</hi> and even the sins of Believers themselves are such, as proceeding from them, in so far as they are not quickned and renewed. <hi>2ly.</hi> Because of their demerit, and that which they deserve, which is eternal death; final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance wherein, doth at last most certainly bring on eternal death. <hi>3ly.</hi> Because, though a natural mans performances were never so specious and splendid, yet before God, they are but dead, like a carcase that wants life: So that though the greatest heap of prayers, and of other duties, should be found with a meerly natural man, they are but like to these Apples, which (as its storied) grow at, or about the <hi>lake of Sodom,</hi> Which appear beautiful to the eye, but so soon as they are touched with the hand, they presently fall into ashes; so the very best of natural mens works, how shineing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are but dead works before God; Therefore (by the way) ye would know, that there is a great difference betwixt <hi>dead works</hi> and <hi>living works;</hi> And that there are many things that present fair &amp; are pleasant to look upon, which yet defile the Conscience; ah!

before pure, It becomes now like a person that hath the Botch, and many Boils and putrifying Sores running in him: Only we would distinguish here betwixt this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Conscience, as it is total in an unrenewed man, and as it is partial in a Believer, a Believer may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in Conscience, when he is offended and stumbled, so as to be tempted by the example of others to do some thing, wherein he is not clear, as some were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>verse</hi> 7, and 10. His Conscience is thereby mudded, jumbled and troubled, and his peace marred, yet he hath not a total and universal defilement of Conscience; And therefore the effects of that uncleanness, polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defilement follow not totally and universally oh him.</p>
                  <p>I shall only say for <hi>Use of this:</hi> 1. O! that ye knew what an abominable thing sin is, and how dreadfully dangerous it is, thereby to defile and pollute the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is the most noble thing in you; sin would sure be more abhorred and fled from: Its really a wonder that men should love <hi>dead Works</hi> so well, when there is no Botch nor Plague so infectious and contagious, so hurtful and destructive to the Bodies, as it is to the Souls of men. 2 This we may also see, that its no marvel that men who are given to sin, be hard to be wakned and reclaimed; for continuance in sin makes the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence full of holes as it were, that all slips and falls thorow it; or (as the Apostle speaks) it makes the Conscience to become cauterized, fenseless, and feelingless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the flesh is, that a Chirurgeon designs to consume away; so I say, continuance in sin, deadens and eats out the very life and feeling of the Conscience; though it will be found to be a Conscience still, and a Conscience that will speak, and speak aloud one day, albeit in Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgement, it be silent now. 3. We may also see here the reason why many persons are so very filthy, that sin becomes a delight to them, so that the sin that others could not sleep with, they cannot sleep till they get it committed; because thorow a custom of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

                     <hi>2ly. Observe.</hi> That a man before he be purged by Christs Blood, hath his Conscience wholly defiled; Not only in part (as we said of the Believer) but wholly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be in Christ, and be purged by his Blood, he is like that wretched Infant described, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 5. which description sets forth to the life, what these people were before God entered in Covenant with them, <hi>cast out in the open field, to the loathing of their persons, unsalted, and unswadled, with their navils uncut, wallowing in their own blood, and having no eye to pity them;</hi> And thus are all men and women, without exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before they be in Covenant with God; they are wholly in a state of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciliation and enmity with God; whose Law does not only condemn this and that work, or deed of theirs, but all of them as but <hi>dead works;</hi> Their very state and person is condemned; their peace, if they have any, is no solid peace, none of Gods peace, for <hi>there is no peace,</hi> nor ground of peace <hi>to the wicked, sayes my God, Isai.</hi> 57. Their inclination is wholly depraved and corrupted; all their Thoughts and Imaginations are evil, only evil, and continually evil, as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. and as that often cited emphatick word is, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. <hi>To him that is defiled and unbelieving there is nothing pure:</hi> Every practice of his, &amp; the use of every thing is to him impure, and his very <hi>mind and conscience</hi> is totally <hi>defiled.</hi> And this will be yet more clear, if we consider; 1. The case that the man is in, who is not in Christ; he is without God, without hope, under his curse, and the condemnatory sentence of his Law; and can a man possibly have a clear Conscience that is under Gods curse, and hath the Sentence of his Law, standing over his head unrepealed? Therefore he is said <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. to be <hi>condemned already,</hi> and to have the <hi>wrath of God abiding on him.</hi> 2. If we consider that a man in this condition is under the dominion of sin, he is a captive of it, and of the Devil at his will, as it is 2 <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 2. 26, So that there is scarce any motion, or temptation to sin, but he hearkens to it, and complys with it; his



<pb n="330" facs="tcp:41558:186"/>
heart is open to swarms of lusts, and as a Cage to unclean and foul Spirits, Legions of Devils in a manner haunt him: Now if such a man can have a clear Conscience, ye may easily judge; and yet such is the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of every man by nature; and therefore when Christ speaks of the Renovation of a man, he sometimes calls it the casting out of the Devil, importing thereby, that every man in nature is a common receptacle as it were to Devils.</p>
                  <p>The 1. <hi>Use</hi> of this serves to teach us, how we ought on the one hand to loath the state of Nature, and how on the other hand we ought to love and long after a state of faith in Christ Jesus, by whom only our natural state can be changed: Is it not a wonder, that so many rational men and women can live and ly still in their Natural state without minding or looking after a change? Considering that this stands recorded of, and against them, <hi>That their very mind and conscience is defiled,</hi> and that with <hi>dead works;</hi> and that all who are not in Christ are so defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vile and abominable, that the most stinking dunghill is not so loathsom, as the Consciences of such persons are; O! What heaps and dunghils of Lusts, what pudles and myres, what kennels and sinks of pollution, and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and poisonable filthiness are there? What noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and poisonable sins are drunk down with pleasure as so much sweet Wine? all which are kept in <hi>retentis</hi> by the Conscience, never one of them is forgotten, though for the time, the Conscience by its silence, is suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have forgotten them; yet it will set them all in order, marshal them all (as it were) in rank and file against the persons who shall be found out of Christ, in a most formidable manner; it will not suffer one sin, nor so much as one aggravating circumstance of any sin to be forgot. It will bring forth all, and charge them home furiously and irresistably; This in Gods holy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice will be the use of Conscience to all such persons; Its not like a Conduit or Pipe, that takes in at the one end, and lets out at the other, but like a standing sink, that

                  <p>The 2 <hi>Use</hi> serves to let us see, what a poor and sory ground the most part have for their peace of Conscience; we may in truth wonder how it comes to pass, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you can have any peace, having such a puddle of filthiness within you; If it be true that <hi>your mind and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is defiled</hi> (which are the best things ye have); and one day will clearly and convincingly make discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the truth of it; O! how much hypocrisie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption will be found to be among you, in stead of true and solid peace? with which ye have nothing to do, so long as these Whoredoms and Witch-crafts (to say so) of filthy sins, are with you unpurged away by the blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The 3. <hi>Use</hi> serves to demonstrat, and clearly to hold forth the absolute necessity of Jesus Christ, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent worth and matchless excellency that is in him, that even when a man is thus defiled and polluted by sins these <hi>dead works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> there is access by his blood, to get the Conscience purged; and this is the thing that we would mainly point at from these words (and which we intend, God willing, afterward more largely to insist in) not only the necessity of coming to Christ; but of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly that ye are got out of black Nature into him,

roar against men, as a lyon, and tear as it were the very caul of their heart; Then, O! then they who would never be perswaded before, to believe what an evil and defiled Conscience is, nor what the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of peace with God, and in the Conscience is, shall be made to their eternal prejudice to know the truth of both.</p>
                  <p>In both these places now read in your hearing, the Apostles scope is, to commend the transcendent worth, and matchless excellency of Jesus Christ, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable efficacy of his most precious blood, from this noble, notable, and non-such effect of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else can lay, or allay the storm, and tempest of an evil Conscience, nor purge it, from these defiling <hi>dead works,</hi> this blood can do it to purpose, and effectually, when applyed by Faith; when no legal Sacrifice, nor washings, <hi>that sanctified only to the purifying of the flesh,</hi> could reach, <hi>perfyting the comer thereto, as pertaining to the conscience,</hi> (as its said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 9.)

                  <p>We left the other day at speaking somewhat to that natural pollution, that throughly affects the hearts and Consciences of all men, before they be by the blood of Christ purged; and the Apostles taking such pains to hold out this, shews plainly, that it is a matter of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est concernment to Christians, to know the way how to get their Consciences purged from that deep defilement of sin wherewith they are polluted; for is it not his manner to insist in any thing that is not of concernment to the people of God, who will readily from the sad and doleful experience of their own pollution, be induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think that this truth is such, and ought to be esteemed so by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly. Observe,</hi> That there is nothing that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should more aim at, and endeavour more to be in the

practice of, then to be following that way whereby they may get their Consciences purged, and more particularly these who have had their Consciences again defiled, after that they were once purged; no main infected with the Borch or plague hath more need of cleansing from it, then the man whose Conscience is infected, and defiled with the dead works of sin, needs to have it purged from them by the blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>We shall but very briefly (to make way for that which we would mainly be at) hint at <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi> from both these <hi>verses</hi> now read, put together; <hi>first</hi> then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Observe,</hi> from <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 22. That a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science not purged by the blood of Christ, is a very evil thing: which we will find to be a very sad truth, if we consider the unpurged Conscience, either as its awakned or as its not awakned, but asleep, which is ill both ways; Its ill, if it be awakned, and the terrours of God be fresh upon it; who can express, or adequatly conceive the terribleness of such a case? The spirit of a man may sustain his infirmity, and wrestle through many crosses, but a wounded, a wrath-wounded spirit, or an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, rouzed by the terrours of the Almighty God, who can bear? This hath made some, with <hi>Iudas</hi> the trai tour, rather to choise death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a violent death inflicted by their own wretched hands on themselves, then life; whereby they have desperatly run themselves under the wrath of God to the full, O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> poor silly miserable shift, and evasion, to flee from some smaller fore-parties (as it were) of the wrath of God on earth, into the very strength, and main battel of it eternally in hell, this is infinitely worse then to leap out of the water into the fire; Nay some of the most eminent Saints, by the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling but of some hot scalding drops of Gods fatherly wrath and displeasure have been brought neer the length of wishing rather for strangling (though mercifully keeped from it, and made to abhorre it) then life; As it was with non such holy <hi>Iob,</hi> who looked on death, a violent death as an easie matter, be what it was to be

under the sense of wrath, and to be set up as the mark for Gods arrows to be shot at, the venome whereof, to his apprehension, drunk up his Spirits; though all the while he was kept up in the faith of his interest in God, and of his love to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To his purpose, <hi>Human</hi> heavily complains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. <hi>I am afflicted, and ready to die from my youth up, while I suffer thy terrours, I am distracted;</hi> If it be sometimes done thus in the green trees, even the greenest, what shall be done in the dry?

design that carries on both parts of the bargan: And now putting all these together, may we not most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently say, that there is notably good ground for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conscince of a sinner, that by faith betakes himself to the blood of Christ; and that such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may with well-grounded Confidence hope for, and certainly expect pardon and absolution, as if in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect he had never sinned.</p>
                  <p>We cannot now insist to speak to the <hi>Uses</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> only from this we may clearly see, 1. How much sinners are oblidged to God, and to the Mediator Jesus Christ; and how poor, sorry and miserable a life, and how comfortless and cursed a death we should have had, if he had not laid down a way for purging the Conscience from dead works; even this excellent and wonderful way by his own most precious blood: And therefore defiled and guilty sinners would endeavour to make this Doctrine very dearly welcome, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 15. When in a transport of holy admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he cryes, <hi>This is a faithful saying, worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,</hi> that <hi>Christ came into the world to save sinners;</hi> O! Believers in Christ prize his grace highly, and bless him heartily, even with all that is within you, that ever the thoughts of this way of relief, for lost sinners were in his blessed heart. <hi>2ly.</hi> Since it is most certain, that naturally we all have evil Consciences, through the debt of sin, and defilement of dead works; and that through the blood of Christ, if we flee to it by faith, and take hold of his satisfaction, we may get our Consciences purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our debt as certainly payed as any mans debt is, who hath in his Charter-chist, the discharge of a Sum he was once owing. Then let me beseech you for the Lords sake, to make this your great work, to get the application of this blood made to your Consciences, and to have it on good grounds made sure, that ye have, by faith made application of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye may not live and die in a conjectural and guessing uncertainty about it; O!

through all eternity is it, to have your defiled Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences sprinkled with that blood; if it be of concernment to you, to have access to lift up your heads with joy, and your faces with boldness in that day, when the hearts of many shall fall them, for fear of those things coming on them, and their knees shall smite one against another, when their faces shall gather paleness, and they shall weep and houl desperatly without all hope; Then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it is of your concernment, of your incomparably great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est concernment to get your Consciences sprinkled with this blood; otherwayes be assured, live as ye will, and die as ye may, this defiled ill Conscience will cleave to you, as a girdle doth to the loins of a man, and it will yell and roar on you, with unconceavable terror and torment: It will then be known, and acknowledged by many, to their everlasting shame, and loss, and to their endless terror and torment, that there was a greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning truth in this <hi>Doctrine, viz.</hi> That the only way how to get a defiled Conscience purged from dead works of sin, is by the blood of Jesus Christ.</p>

here to these <hi>Hebrews,</hi> of the excellent advantages which they had in and by Jesus Christ (whereof he gives a short summary and abridgement, <hi>v.</hi> 19. 20, 21.) drawes thence a pathetick exhortation by way of conclusion, that Believers would make use of, and improve these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and priviledges, in a confident approaching to God, <hi>Let us draw near</hi> (saith he <hi>v.</hi> 22.) <hi>in full assurance of faith:</hi> But because there are <hi>two</hi> things that readily stand in the way of Believers their coming to God, he casts in <hi>two</hi> requisit qualifications of their coming, for removing these obstructions, and to let us see, that though he allow of the well grounded confidence of faith, yet he doth not allow of carnal presumption in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God.

               <p>This Phrase of having <hi>the conscience sprinkled,</hi> is an allusion to that which we have, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 7. and 13. Where the Lord being to smite all the first-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to prevent the falling of the stroak and plague on the <hi>Israelites,</hi> he appoints them to kill a Lamb, and to sprinkle the Lintel and Door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> posts of their Houses with the blood thereof, that when the destroying Angel passed thorow to smite the first-born of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he might pass over their houses, that were so sprinkled: and the force of the allusion is this, Mans Conscience in a natural estate, is like that destroying Angel, and as <hi>Israel</hi> be-sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled the door posts of their houses with the blood of the <hi>Paschal Lamb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> so he would have them to be-sprinkle their hearts with the blood of Christ, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 14. and 12. <hi>v.</hi> 24. And then their Conscience will not smite them to their hurt, but they shall be past over as the <hi>Israelits</hi> were passed over by the destroying Angel.</p>
               <p>In the words then these <hi>two</hi> are clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. That the Conscience of a person un-reconciled to God, is a mighty fearce, and terrible pursuer, ready to seize on him, as the avenger of blood did on the Man-slayer, or as the destroying Angel did on the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> And, O! but it be a dreadful thing to be obnoxious to Gods wrath, and to the challenges, accusations, throws and pangs of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that hath just ground of a quarrel against a man;

who hath nothing wherewith to answer its challenges, and accusations. <hi>2ly.</hi> That the efficacy of Christs blood is such, that it is able to purge the Conscience of such a man that fleeth to it, and to fence and guard him against the wrath of God, and the challenges and accusations of his own Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that as it hath no just ground to pursue, so it being Gods Deputy, it cannot, neither will pursue him as Gods enemy, it having no warrand from him as its Soveraign to do so; but as the sprinkling of the houses of the <hi>Israelits</hi> with the blood of the passe-over Lamb preserved them from being plagued or hurt by the destroying Angel; so there is an efficacy in the Blood of Jesus Christ, to purge and pacify the Conscience of the person, that in good earnest hath believing recourse to it, to preserve him from the stroak of Gods justice and wrath, and from the pursuit and accusations of his own Conscience, I say when it is had recourse to, actually applyed, and made use of, by Faith.</p>

and ward off challenges, so as they may not wound and quite marr peace; as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2. It might have been said to him, Thou hast been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of <hi>a body of death,</hi> and that <hi>with thy flesh thou servest the law of sin,</hi> and is not that a grievous challenge against thee?

I, by faith, am fled to Christ for resuge, and so am in Christ, and therefore there is no condemnation to me: and indeed, when ever challenges come in from sense, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence put through other, or mingled together (as it were) blown upon by temptation, which will pursue the Believer hardly; Its needful to reason from the grounds of faith, to ward off the blow, and to queit the Conscience: And this, though it be a reflex act of faith, which does not justifie, yet it serves to reason the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science into peace and calmness; and there is need of faith acting thus reflexly, though not (as I said) to justifie, yet to bring home the peace and comfort of Justification, and renewed extracts, and intimations of pardon. <hi>3ly.</hi> Its necessary that Believers quiet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves positively, by comforting &amp; confirming themselves In the faith of what the promise speaks, and in the hope of what they have to expect: The difference betwixt the former and this is, that in the former we draw home answers from the grounds of faith to ward off the dint, and bitterness of challenges; but that is not enough throwly to calme and settle the soul, therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is also needful, that the soul positively draw in peace and consolation to it self by believing; Which (as it is, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.) <hi>is able to guard the heart and mind through Christ Iesus:</hi> and we conceive this to be <hi>Davids</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.

promises, and on the blood of the <hi>Messiah</hi> to be shed, and by wrestling for the intimation of pardon, and peace, he labours not only to get his Conscience calmed, but even filled with consolation; and because the promises are often somewhat wersh and tasteless (to say so) if not seasoned and quickned by Gods voice going along with them, and putting favour and life in them; This is <hi>the voice of joy and gladness,</hi> which he would so fain, <hi>hear:</hi> Therefore the Believer insists with God thus, to be-sprinkle his Conscience; and as he looks to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and blood of Christ for Justification, so he looks to it for calming of the Conscience; and this is in effect to be beholden to free grace, as for pardon of fin, so for peace and calmness of Conscience; without which any other thing will not do the turn.</p>

as the blood of Christ hath efficacy and worth, and as far as the promise extends it self, as long and as far may the Believer reach his faith for coming up to bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and confidence; although for his humiliation, and keeping humble, he may possibly never win at, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his former confidence and boldness; yet looking to the grounds of faith and hope, he may, and ought to study to streach his faith to the attaining of it; <hi>4ly.</hi> He may, and should thus endeavour confidently to draw near to God, when challenges are quick and very sharp; yea, when the challenges of Conscience are sharpest and most peircing; though challenges were as so many troups of horses rushing in on him, and the Conscience were like a Lyon rampant, standing with his claws ready to to tear, he may and should (humbly taking with guilt) step to confidently, and make application of the blood of sprinkling; and indeed this is the very time when in a special manner he should do it; as it was in the case of the man-slayer, when he was most hotly pursued by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of blood, that was the very time when he was called to flee, and with greatest speed, to the city of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; and the allusion is made to this purpose, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>That by two immutable things</hi> (sayes the Apostle) <hi>Wherein it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation who are fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before us;</hi> When may they have consolation and strong consolation? even when they are fleeing with the greatest haste to the clay of refuge, its then that the gates of the city are cast widest open to them; when was it that <hi>David</hi> made his most earnest and humbly-confident addresse to God for <hi>the joy of his salvation?</hi> even when blood-guiltiness was stareing him in the face, and when his very bones were in a manner broken, and when to his own sense, his grace was very much, if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gone, and when he had (as is were) forefaulted his right to consolation; yet even then he comes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, draws near to God, humbly maintains his interest in him, and pleads for former manifestations upon the

                  <hi>5ly.</hi> The Believer may and ought, thus to make humbly-confident application to God throw Christ, when he finds, to the great grief of his soul, an exceeding in-disposition to duty; when his praying, repenting, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> goe not with him, as he would fain have them; if there be a real fleeing for refuge, to the hope set before him, he may and should, even in that case step forward, and draw near with humble bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; hence, <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51. Prayes not only for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, but for the lively exercise of grace, while he sayes to God, <hi>Creat in me a clean heart, renew a right spirit within me, and uphold me with thy free spirit:</hi> The sense of sin, and exercise of repentance being real and serious, the exercise of faith is then surely native; and will readily, looking to Jesus, go over all that comes in the way of it: In a word, its then when the humble Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may <hi>draw near with full assurance of faith;</hi> even when he hath the real sense of his sin, and danger, and flees unto Jesus Christ for refuge, he is then warranted to run to the city of refuge, and may confidently go on in his errand, <hi>viz.</hi> To get pardon of sin renewed, consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion restored, and his spiritual frame righted: Its no doubt a foolish conceit, and a prejudicial mistake, for troubled sinners, first, to seek after peace, and then to make application to Christ, or to think that first they must have all the requisits of a good spiritual frame and grace, in the liveliest exercise before they adventure to draw near to God with confidence; I grant these are very desirable, and the souls desire after them very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; yet if the Believer resolve never to draw thus near, till he be as he would be, when shall he do it? What if <hi>David</hi> had stood and stuck at that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51? He might have been keeped a-back, and so been unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen all his dayes; but knowing the way of Gods Grace, and the nature of his gracious covenant made with his people, he steps humbly, yet confidently forward in the exercise of faith out over the sense of guiltinesse, and all the aggravations of it, over relapsing in sin, over in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,

               <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> To wit, the excellency and efficacy of it, it may be seen in these <hi>four,</hi> 1. In the noble and notable effects that it produceth, or that come by it, even all the great things contained in the promises touched on before; such as pardon of sin, grace to subdue it, friendship, and peace with God, fellowship with him, conformity to him, the hope of heaven and glory, the sweet serenity, tranquillity and peace of the Conscience; its as a <hi>hiding place from the wind and rain, and a covert from the florm,</hi> yea, even as <hi>the shadow of a great rock in the midst of a weary land;</hi> when the soul sorely beaten with the storm of challenges, and of the apprehensions of wrath comes under the shadow and shelter of this, it presently finds ease and repose; what shall I say? what can I say? words here may be swallowed up, from this proceed all the glorious priviledges of the people of God possessed and expected, in hand and in hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Its excellency and efficacy appears in this; That it hath procured these things, <hi>to sinners,</hi> to them that had an unclean and polluted Conscience; for who is it, I pray, that may thus draw near to God with full assurance of faith? It is not such as never had an evil Conscience, but such as having an evil Conscience, flee unto this blood, and get it sprinkled therewith; its these who had their Consciences <hi>defiled with dead works;</hi> and came to it, and got them purged from these dead works. <hi>3ly.</hi> The excellency and efficacy of it shines furth in the tenderness of the <hi>Person,</hi> that applyes the remedy to such a loathsome sickness, and otherwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable desease, or by any other hand but Christs; <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
