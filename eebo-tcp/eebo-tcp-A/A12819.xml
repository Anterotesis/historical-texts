         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Vnderſtander.</head>
            <p>VNderstander (for,
to euery Reader I
write not) beholde
this Booke with a gentle
eye, and entertaine it with
fauour. It was penn'd by
him who had rather ſay,
<hi>Eſt iudicium in nobis,</hi>
than <hi>eſt furor in nobis.</hi>
Winke therefore at the
want of witte thou ſhalt
finde; ſince it is a worke
<pb facs="tcp:26328:7"/>
of iudgement onely. As
for the Aſſes of the Age,
I care as little for their
cenſures, as their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Though they can pick
out good ſenſe, yet they
will not; contrarie to the
equity of a Reader; who,
in a place doubtful, ſhould
ſtriue to vnderſtand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cry out, <hi>Non</hi> ſenſe.
They little knovve, that
hee, who writes in euery
thing properly, ſhall neuer
vvrite anie thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly.
If I were diſpoſed
to carpe, I doe not thinke
there are ten lines in any
booke extant, out of which
I would not pick ſomthing
<pb facs="tcp:26328:7"/>
to cauill at. My greatest
comfort is, I neuer yet
ſaw any carper that had
any iudgement. VVhich
vvhoſoeuer wants, lacks
the very ſalt of wit: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, whatſoeuer is
read, lies ravve, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted.
But, that which
makes mee moſt merrie,
is, that ſome of our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
puppies thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
worthy to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vvith the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke,
auncient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours;
vvhoſe vvittes
they come as ſhort of, as

Authours, vvhome
<pb facs="tcp:26328:8"/>
they doe as little vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
as they doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
If they had but

vvith their manie
vvordes, they might (I
confeſſe) rubbe-out rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
vvell, amongst
coxcombes, that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of no higher mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
than themſelues. But,
as they are, I vvould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
them to content
themſelues vvith their
Iigge-learning: in which
when they haue knowne
all they can, they then
knowe iust nothing; and,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>opero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sè

<pb facs="tcp:26328:8"/>
not this out of Spleene,
for the wrong they haue
done mee: for, my ſpirite

This little leane dwarfe

Great <hi>Alexander</hi> was a

though he had often met
Death face to face, yet at

            <p>THis day, this day,
am I to ſpeake of
Calumny, and to
draw and lugge this Vice
into the light. Thou
God, who art goodneſſe,

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:26328:74"/>
bee a light to the ſteps of

of all vices the greateſt

that I may inſtill inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and humanity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Humanity; winning
men to ſhew honeſty,
peace, &amp; charity, in their
liues, diſcourſes, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
Calumny I heere
define to be, <hi>a guilefull,
priuie wounding, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
of anothers
fame, either in word, or
with penne.</hi> Calumny is
ſo called <hi>a caluendo:</hi>
which (being an olde,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:26328:74"/>
and obſolete word) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
as much, as <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,</hi>
or <hi>deceiue.</hi> For, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
in generall, lieth,
and beguileth (as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
I will ſhew) and
deriues her authority fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lying, and deceiuing. The
Graecians named her
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and that, verie
properly: becauſe ſhee
pearces, ſtickes, &amp; ſtrikes-through,
with the all-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
dart of her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd
tongue. So that
Calumny hath two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ends: the one, to
deceiue; which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
conſider'd: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to hurt; which the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:26328:75"/>
Graecians oft obſerued.
O Vice of Vices! and yet
in theſe Times what is
more frequent? what
more inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of publique, and
priuate ruines? I may yet
adde, and ask, what hath
beene more neglected by
moderne, and antient
Writers? Wherefore,
ſince there is not any one
found (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of it, or againſt it; I
hope, this Treatiſe of it
will not bee vnprofitable
to you, nor inglorious to
mee, who firſt beginne
to lay it open, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:26328:75"/>
it with my plaine
ſtile. Three principall
things then there are,
from which the preſent
diſcourſe muſt be deriu'd.
Firſt, I will ſhew how fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and loathſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
is; ſecondly, how
pernicious; thirdly, how
to be auoided. Whilſt I
ſeuerally diſcourſe of
theſe, ſomewhat amply,
and acutely, I ſhall deſire
this faire Audience, not
onely to lend mee their
minds, but their eares;
and to fill and guide the
ſailes (as I may ſay) of
my Oration, with the
<hi>Zephyrus,</hi> or gentle gale
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:26328:76"/>
of their loue-breathing
thoughts.</p>
            <p>As for the filthineſs of
Calumny, it cannot bee
more cleerely prooued,
than by this two-folde
argument: to weet, that
it ſelfe, and all thoſe in
whom it dwels, are moſt
loathſome. The perſons,
that harbour it, are bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with theſe three
markes; baſe, idle, prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
So truely, by mee
termed baſe, that I deny
not only any good, but
any indifferently good,
or lofty ſpirit, euer to
haue been blemiſht with
this blot. Examine the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:26328:76"/>
olde, and theſe our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
Times, and you
ſhall neuer reade, ſee, or
heare, that any haue
beene prone to this vice,
but onely ſad, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne
natures, envying
others and diſtruſting
themſelues; whom me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<hi>Saturne</hi> hath
blaſted with his ſtarre.
Did you neuer ſee little,
cowardly dogs barke at
gueſts, that durſt not bite
beaſts? Why, ſuch are
theſe worſer ſort of men;
who are borne onely to
hurt and vexe the harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
I ſay, they are borne
to that end; becauſe they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:26328:77"/>
doe ſo leane, and incline
to this vice, that they are
neuer quiet, but when
they haue made others
vnquiet. Their ſecond
marke is Idleneſſe: than
which nothing is more
apparent; ſince the firſt
ſparke, and tinder of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
is Sloth: for, no
man will haue leaſure to
enquire into other mens
affaires, who is deteined
by his owne. In ſluggiſh,
and droniſh people, this
godleſſe Goddeſſe takes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vp
her lodging, and there
laies the foundation of
her kingdome. Hee that
denies this, let him but a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:26328:77"/>
little frequent the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Princes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces
of Pleading: in
which, occaſion &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Calumny is daily,
and aboundantly, ſowen
by thoſe, who make this
their only buſineſſe, <hi>To
walke and talke.</hi> VVhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
is publikely, or
priuately done, is there
cenſured, and ſcourged.
The Prince, &amp; his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours
are ſaid to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe:
one man is ſaid to
haue done this; another
man to haue ſpoken that.
To conclude; no report
of any man can ſtand
with them vnblemiſht,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:26328:78"/>
and vnſlandred. And if
wiſe, and experienced
men did this, I could the
better beare with it: but,
now, men not only moſt
idle, but alſo moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
do buſie themſelues
in thoſe things, to whoſe
height, their ſenſe, and
vnderſtanding will not
reach. As in a ſhip an
vnskilful paſſenger is not
to bee endur'd, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
&amp; chides the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
when he himſelfe
will lend hand neither to
the Rudder, nor to the
Ore: ſo alſo, vnto vs, theſe
emptie veſſells muſt
needes bee moleſtfull,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:26328:78"/>
which ſound moſt, and
haue leaſt liquor in them.
To be briefe; their laſt
marke is prattling. And,
indeede, how ſhould
they be other? ſince it is
proper to theſe babblers,
not only to ſpeak much,
but much euill. Haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you at any time
ranked your ſelues with
thoſe head-ſtrong vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
people, who haue,
as <hi>Pindar</hi> ſaith, vncurbed
mouthes? If you haue;
tell me, was not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of their talke
not onely of ſome body,
but againſt ſome body?
ſurely, it was. For, they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:26328:79"/>
vent things, both heard,
and vnheard; mingling
things true and certaine,
with things vaine, and
vncertaine. And, as in a
lake of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> call'd <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaltes,</hi>
nothing ſinks; but
vvhatſoeuer is caſt-in,
ſwimmes vpon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the water: ſo, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
goes to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of their boſomes;
all things keep the toppe,
and ſlote ouer. But, to
ſay the truth, how ſhould
they fauor others, when
they cannot ſpare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues?
For, it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this diſeaſe, to
make them raile againſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:26328:79"/>
themſelues, when they
haue nothing to ſpeake
againſt others. As in an
extreame &amp; long dearth,
our bodies, for want of
nouriſhment, feede vpon
themſelues: ſo falles it
out with them.</p>
            <p>I haue now ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcourſed vnto you
of the Minions of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny:
I will therefore
(as order requires) bring
her ſelfe vpon the Stage,
with her owne true cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
I confeſſe, all
vice to be deteſtable, vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and loathſome; but,
this aboue all other:
vvhich doth not onely
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:26328:80"/>
reigne in filthy people,
but is alſo begotten, and
borne of loathſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
The Poets faine
their <hi>Chimaera</hi> to haue
three bodies. They fain:
but, I dare ſweare, that to
the compoſition of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
the mixtion of
three vices is neceſsarie.
For, Lying, and Enuy are
her Parents; and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
her Nurſe. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with your ſelues,
vvhat a faire infant this
muſt needes bee, which
receiues her beeing from
three ſuch foule vices. I
ſaid, and ſaid truly, that
Lying was her father; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:26328:80"/>
it inſpires and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
Calumny: which
without Lying, langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,
hauing neither life
nor ſoule. What Backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was euer yet content
with the naked truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
which of them vvas
euer yet pleaſed to call a
figge a figge? And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
hee cannot chooſe
but doe ſo; in that hee
hath no power to hurt,
nor can attaine to his
propoſed end, if he keep
himſelfe within the limits
of truth. Therefore hee
addes to euery thing and
as that ſound of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Valleies (which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:26328:81"/>
wee call Eccho) returnes
wo or three words, for
one: ſo he doubles things
heard, and ſeene. Haue I
in a word or two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of any man? hee
wil ſay, I haue ſharply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
him. Haue I made
doubt of any thing? hee
will ſay, I haue carped at
all. Haue I my ſelfe ſome
doubtfull ſpeach, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
hee wil chooſe the
worſe ſenſe. In a word;
as the Phyſicians ſay of
their cupping glaſſes,
that they draw-out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
blood of all: ſo I
may more truly ſay of a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:26328:81"/>
Slanderer, that he neither
attracts, nor receiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing vnto him, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, that is not euill.
But, I would hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
onely: for, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
he addes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
thoſe things to
haue been done, &amp; ſpoke
by vs, which we neuer ſo
much as dream'd of. As
Spiders, with a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Art, bring-foorth
threds and cobwebs, out
of their bodies: ſo, hee
begets, and weaues ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſnares with his wit. I
haue truly &amp; ſufficiently
ſhewed, that Lying is the
Father of Calumny: it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:26328:82"/>
now reſteth that I proue
Envy to be her Mother;
who in the malignant
wombe of her wit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues,
beares, and at laſt
brings forth this impious
infant. This is eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
by the maners and
deeds of Calumniators:
for, they ſildome drawe
that fame-defacing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
vpon baſe people, &amp;
men of their owne coate;
but, vpon thoſe vvhom
they ſee to excell others
in vertue, in learning, or
in ſome other thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
admiration. As Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
doe not looke backe
for the laggers, but ſtriue
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:26328:82"/>
to out-ſtrip the formoſt:
ſo, Calumny purſues the
better ſort.</p>
            <p>It vvas obſerued in
the ſportes of old, that
Bulls would roare, and
wex enrag'd at the ſight
of any redde, or purple
thing; which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
are the moſt
faire of all colours: the
like may be ſeene in theſe
men; whoſe rancor is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp by Vertue.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, I added, that
Curioſitie was the Nurſe
of Calumny. And that,
very truly; ſith ſhe ſeeds
and foſters this Damſell
with the long ſought-for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:26328:83"/>
meat of ſpeeches and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.
Take her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and what can ſhe
doe? Shee will ſtraight
wex weak, faint, &amp; emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
hauing more will, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
power to hurt. For, ſhee
hath matter miniſtred to
her, by Curioſity: who,
dwelling neuer at home,
but ranging alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
enters not onely
the houſes, but the minds
of all men; beeing euer
watchful, neuer ſleeping.
It is ſhe, it is ſhe, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
reports together, &amp;
vents them to him that
next accoſteth her, ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him thus: Giue me
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:26328:83"/>
your hand. What news?
What's done at Court?
How ſtand the affaires
of England? Hovv, of
France? What doth <hi>Titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us?</hi>
What doth <hi>Seius?</hi>
Theſe things, &amp; other
of like nature, dooth ſhe
pry into, &amp; meddle with;
yet neuer growes ful, nor
ſatisfied. But, as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
and ſcabbed limbe
delights to bee ſcratcht,
and rubb'd: ſo ſhe itcheth
for ſharpe and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſpeeches. Neither
onely hath ſhee itching,
and greedy eares, but
quicke &amp; pearcing eyes:
which when ſhee opens,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:26328:84"/>
what is it ſhee ſees not?
Yea, euen thoſe things
which ſhee ſees not. She
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſearcheth into things
revealed, and vnreuealed.
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> the Emperour,
is reported to haue beene
ſo quick-ſighted, that he
could ſee as well in the
night, as in the day: but,
this may more fitlie bee
ſaid of Curioſity; in that,
neither darkneſſe, nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
can keepe-out her
all-ſearching ſight. Dooſt
thou ſhut thy doores? ſhe
will pearce throgh them.
Dooſt thou tie-vp thy
tongue? ſhee will prie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy boſome. Dooſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:26328:84"/>
thou ſhun the ſocietie of
men? ſhee wil neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
find thee out. As
Flies, and ſuch little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
can by no meanes
be kept-out; no more can
ſhee, by any Art. Shee is
ſole Queen of that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of the <hi>Curio's,</hi> whom
the Comick Poet verie
wittily thus paints forth;
<hi>They haue a great care of
other mens affaires. They
would ſeeme to knowe all
things; but, indeed, know
nothing. They know what
the King whiſperd in the
eare of the Queene; and
what</hi> Ioue <hi>diſcourſed of
with</hi> Iuno. <hi>Nay, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:26328:85"/>
is more; they know things
which neuer were, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time, I am
ſure, you euidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the vglineſſe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny;
which lodgeth in
baſe, filthy perſons, and
hath like Parents; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by Lying, brought
forth by Envy, &amp; broght
vp by Curioſitie. Come
on now, and follow mee
to the Miſchiefe that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
her: which I thoght
good to make the ſecond
part of my race. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I runne it, pauſe with
mee awhile, and refreſh
your minds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:26328:85"/>
The Miſchiefe in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
is Forcible &amp; Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable:
&amp; that ſo great (I
auerre it ſeriouſly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an <hi>Hyperbole)</hi> as I find
the like in no other vice. I
ſay, Forcible, becauſe ſhe
wounds deeply, &amp; priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Variable, in that (for
the moſt part) ſhe neither
leaues any thing, nor any
body, vntouched. Let vs
handle euery one of theſe
by themſelues. That ſhe
wounds deeply, the holy
Prophet wil witnes with
mee, crying-out; <hi>Their
teeth are darts and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes:
and their tongue is
a ſharpe ſword.</hi> Neither
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:26328:86"/>
is there any great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the words
of this diuine man, &amp; of
that Spartan, who being
demaunded whether, or
no his ſword were ſharp
enough, replyed, <hi>More
keene than Calumny;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
therby, that no
edge of iron and ſteele,
could compare in keene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
with the edge of the
tongue. VVhat cannot
this touch? or what tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
it, that it toucheth
not to the quick? As that
ſubtill force of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
pearceth through
euery thing: ſo, nothing
can be ſo cloſely ſhut, nor
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:26328:86"/>
ſo far remooued, but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
wil burn through
it. And this ſhe doth the
more effectually, in that
ſhee doth it priuily, and
(as I added) by treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
How can a weapon
bee avoided, that is not
ſeene? The clowds fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
vs of the enſuing
tempeſt; ſmoake of the
enſuing fire; a Spy, of the
approach of the Enemy:
but, the miſchiefe that
comes from a Calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
is ſudden, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected.
Dooſt thou
thinke hee threatens? he
then flatters. Dooſt thou
take him for thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie?
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:26328:87"/>
he will induce thee
to belieue that hee is thy
friend; and will firſt tie
thee with the ſnaring
praiſes of his tongue, and
then with the ſame will
wound thee. And as a
Scorpion, if thou handle
him, will ſeeme to play
with thee, till hee get
opportunitie with the
winding of his taile to
ſting thee: ſo, when thou
feareſt little hurt from a
Calumniator, hee hath
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> already harmed thee.
O deteſtable deceite!
which my Hiſtorian (as
from an Oracle) notes,
when hee ſaith, <hi>A mans
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:26328:87"/>
greatest enemies are his
greateſt praiſers.</hi> Giue me
poyſon openly, and I will
beware of it: but, if you
cunningly mingle it with
my meate, or drink, how
can I ſhun it then? The
ſame may bee ſaid of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny:
which may truly
be called, poyſoned ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<hi>It is not a thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi>
(ſaith ſingular <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt)
to a ſtout and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
man, to conquer an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting
enemy; but, good
men neuer ſuſpect, and
therfore neuer go about to
ſhun hidden &amp; vnknown
dangers.</hi> How Forcible
and violent the Miſchief
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:26328:88"/>
is which proceeds from
Calumny, hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
beene proued: you
ſhall now heare how Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
or diuers it is. It
doth hurt (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
in moſt matters,
and to moſt perſons; a
thing more remarquable
in Calumny, than in any
other vice. It hurts not
one, or two; but, many:
If I be luſtfull, two only
are contaminated with
the impurity of the
crime. Say, I am coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous:
it may be I cheate
three, or foure of their
money. If I be drunke,
perhaps I wrong ſome
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:26328:88"/>
man with blowes, or
with words. But, with
Calumny it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
for, ſhee ſpares no
Age, ſex, nor order; and
may rightly be called a
publique calamity, and
the <hi>Phaeton</hi> (if I may ſo
ſay) of the Earth's circle.
Who was euer ſo happy,
or ſo wiſe, that could
brag hee was ſafe from
her reach? There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any. Her tearing
teeth are whetted to hurt
all men; but, thoſe moſt,
who are of moſt merit.</p>
            <p>He that excells in any
thing, is ſure to be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-downe
by her. As
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:26328:89"/>
they, who pull-downe
houſes, doe firſt take a
way the pillars: ſo, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
(deſiring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
Mortality) firſt
ſeekes to ſupplant thoſe,
vpon whom the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good is builded.
Prudent, honeſt, and
learned men, are her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
enemies: whoſe
fame ſhee ſometimes
ſhakes with the engines
of reproach; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
againe, ſeekes to
ouerthrow it with the
cunning vndermining of
ſuſpicion. Neither onely
doth ſhe iniure &amp; wrong
ſundry men; but, in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:26328:89"/>
matters alſo. Nor is
there any thing deare
and pretious to a man,
but ſhe will be ſure with
her wiles either wholly
to bereaue him of it, or
very much to empaire it.
Doe riches delight thee?
She will, if ſhe can, diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
thee of them. Doſt
thou reioice in great ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and honours? Of
thoſe ſhee will depriue
thee. Dooth any man
place his felicity in his
friends? Here ſhee will
imploy her vttermoſt
art, and ſtrength; and will
ſeuer <hi>Laelius</hi> from <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,
Pylades</hi> from <hi>Orestes.</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:26328:90"/>
What is ſo pretious to a
man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his fame? which
to good men is aboue all
goods, and life it ſelfe.
For, riches, and life, are
things brittle, and flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
our goods going
often away before vs, &amp;
our liues alwaies with vs:
but, our fame is that
which doth eternize vs;
that only remaines, when
we are rotten. Why, this
fame, this treaſure of the
wiſe, this life-enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
gemme, Calumny
dooth daily ſeeke to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
and vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
For, becauſe ſhee
cannot hurt Vertue it ſelf
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:26328:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(the Chiefe-good in vs)
ſhe ſeekes to ouer-cloud,
and leſſen vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which are, as it were,
the ſhadowes, not the
very images of Vertue.
But, why talke I of men,
and humane affaires? O
good God! ſhee neither
ſpares thee, nor thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
For ſhee will finde
in diuine matters alſo
ſomething to debate of;
by which ſhe may offend
not only thine, but thee.
It is thy decree, thy
ſanction, that <hi>the ſecrets
of the minde be reſerued
for the moderatour of the
minde:</hi> neither are the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:26328:91"/>
ſtrings of the heart, to be
plaied vpon by any, but
by him that made them.
But, Calumny violates
this Law: for, now-a-dayes
(O hatefull daies!)
ſhee directs her eyes, and
tongue hither; prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this inmoſt Temple.
Shee cries-out, that this
man is not vpright in his
gouernement; that a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is not valiant; that
a third is a cloſe fellow,
and not open enough. In
a word; what remaines,
but that the thoughts, &amp;
meaning of our mindes
be ſummon'd to appeare
before this calumniating
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:26328:91"/>
Iudgement ſeate? <hi>Homer,</hi>
the true Prince (in my
iudgement) not of Poets
onely, but of all other
men (I vnderſtand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane)
faines a certaine
Goddeſſe, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Ate;</hi> from whom all

their ſourſe and deriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Vnder the couer of
which fiction, I aſſure
my ſelfe (as certainely as
I now ſpeak and breathe
that he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to touch

thus he deſcribeth her:</p>

            <p>Which toucheth not the

            <p>And hath hurt <hi>Iupiter</hi>

            <p>Anſwer me now truly,
and on your word. Was

who vvith more

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:26328:92"/>
that <hi>ſhee offendeth all.</hi>
Iuſt my doctrine; that all

<hi>ſhee hurts</hi> Iupiter

Theſe are but the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

beeing nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon

For, here is her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

            <p>Briefely, thus: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
deceit, oppreſsion,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:26328:93"/>
or villanie hath beene in
any Age, or in any Court
whatſoeuer, it flowed
firſt from this head, from

was it, that allured <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
to murther ſo
many of his deer friends,
but Calumnie? that
baniſhed <hi>Socrates</hi> from
his naturall life, <hi>Rutilius</hi>

as it were, vvith nevv
blood, and gaue life to
<hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and

hateful Calumny? And,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:26328:94"/>
not to ſpeake onelie of
former Times, this Age,
this miſerable Age, doth
ſufficiently teſtifie, that
thoſe flights, thoſe
ſlaughters, thoſe generall
calamities, thoſe Seas, &amp;
inundations of miſerie,
vnder which wee grone,
haue no other birth,
ſourſe, nor Generation,
but from the Riuerets
of Court-Calumnie.
Are your ſoules grieued,
that theſe arrowes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
ſtick in the bowels
of the Common-vveale?
Calumny fixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there.
That the fire of Ciuill
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:26328:94"/>

ſo many yeers? Calumny
did firſt kindle it. And we
neuer ſee, or haue ſeene,

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:26328:95"/>
You ſee now the Forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; Variable Miſchief,
atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny. Which
mee thinks our old <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
did well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
when they named
the father of all ſinnes, or
rather Sinne it ſelfe (that
Monſter from Hell) by a
Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
a <hi>Detractor,</hi> or one which
is accuſtomed to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate:
thinking (it ſeems)
that our moſt malitious
enemy could not bee
made known by a word
of more malice. Neither
did the ancient Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
with leſs iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
conſider her vnbridled
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:26328:95"/>
and ouer-maſtering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Who, when they
reſtrained all other vices
with lawes and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts;
to this one (which
I wonder at) they made
waie for her Cariere;
giuing her free ſcope to
be hurtfull. For, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
vp all the Nations in
the world; I am decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
if you name one, that
(with any ſanction or
penall Law) hath bridled
&amp; ſuppreſt it. The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
I confeſſe, were
wont to inflict <hi>Pecuniary</hi>
puniſhments vpon ſuch
offenders: the Romans
burnt them in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:26328:96"/>
heads with the letter <hi>K.</hi>
But, let not this lead anie
man into error: for, they
were onely ſuch as prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic'd
it in Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and in publike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations.
What then?
were they either ſo blind,

or ſo fooliſh, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of theſe: but, with great
iudgement &amp; diſcretion
they held any vice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhable,
which they

            <p>Small Riuers are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

to be ſecur'd againſt
all Calumny, he deceiues
himſelfe, &amp; requites that
of mee, which was neuer
in the power of man. Let
not <hi>Thales</hi> onely, that
Fauorite of Wiſdome,
but euen Wiſdome her
ſelfe, vndertake this task,
they can neuer performe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:26328:97"/>
it. What ſhall wee doe
then? I can onely ſuccor
thee with two bucklers,
to repulſe and giue abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the violence of
her charge. The firſt of
which is <hi>Innocence:</hi> the
other, <hi>Patience.</hi> Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
would avoid the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of this miſchiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathing
Goddeſſe, let
him aboue any thing
arme himſelfe with <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:</hi>
and indeed they,
which liue in integritie
of life, warines of ſpeech,
modeſtie of actions, why
ſhould they fear her? For
as no filth doth eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to ſmooth &amp; wel po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:26328:98"/>
places: ſo, no abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
ſpeeches can ſettle
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues on vnblemiſht
deedes. This hath bin
oftentimes a good reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
I ſhouldly, if I ſhould
ſay alwaies. I know well
that <hi>Tully</hi> writes, as fire
caſt into water, is in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
extinguiſhed: ſo, a
falſe accuſation on a chaſt
life. I wold to God, thoſe
wordes were as true, as
wittie: for, how manie
men, euen of the pureſt
and moſt immaculate
conuerſation, haue beene
wounded by this Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and will euer be ſo!
How many haue beene
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:26328:98"/>
wounded, euen to the
letting-out of the beſt
blood, and iuice of their
reputation! Neither is it
any maruaile. For, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
(as I ſaid before)
ſupports her ſelfe by Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And ſhe may doe it
ſafely; becauſe ſhee hath
but one iudge: and that
one, ſuch, as (for the moſt
part) neuer enquires fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but, belieues at
firſt. Wherefore, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
flatterer of a King,
ſaw further into this
matter, than did the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Orator: who was
wont to ſay, that <hi>nothing
was to bee ſpoken againſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:26328:99"/>
any man: for,</hi> ſaid hee,
<hi>though the wound may be
healed, the ſcarre will
remain.</hi> A ſhrewd ſpeech:
but (belieue mee) very
wittie; and which takes
his originall, and credite
from our owne natures.
For, it is grafted in the
diſpoſitions of many
men, not onely to giue
open, but credulous eare,
to al whiſpering reports:
and the more willinglie,
if they treat of any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
done, or to be done.</p>
            <p>Hee, whoſe chance it is
to be ſpotted, will hardly
waſh himſelfe cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
for, the ſuſpicion
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:26328:99"/>
will remaine, though the
crime doe not. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I did not vnwiſely,
to paint out Patience for
the buckler, wherewith
the innocent might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelues. The vſe
of Patience conſiſts in
bearing vneuitable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
courageouſly, &amp;
with a high creſt. <hi>Varro</hi>
was wont to ſay of an ill
wife, <hi>That either a man
muſt endure her, or ridde
himſelfe of her.</hi> Do thou
the ſame heere; tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
what cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-away.
What ſaid I?
thou ſhouldſt bear them?
nay, rather deſpiſe them.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:26328:100"/>
As a courageous Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſcorns the weak darts,
that (like haile) make a
light ratling round about
his Helmet: So doth the
wiſe, and fortified man,
all ſcoffes, and deriſions.
For, what can they take
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him? His good name?
That will euer be good,
amongſt good men. Can
they robbe him of his
Vertue &amp; his Wiſedom?
Thoſe are no way ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the will of man.
To conclude; when all
theſe carping detractours
haue ſpoke, and done
their vttermoſt, this man
of men (with a true and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:26328:100"/>
lofty courage) cries-out,
<hi>All that is mine I carry
with mee.</hi> But, thou wilt
reply, that the meere co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and appearance of
Infamie is to be feared.
If thou be guilty, feare it:
if not, why feareſt thou?
Apply it not to thy ſelfe;
and all is well. <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
the Cinicke (a man of a
towring wiſedome; who
therin not only exceeded
men, but almoſt equalled
euen the Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues)
was wont to ſay,
when the people mockt
him; <hi>They deride me: yet,
I am not derided.</hi> Do thou
the like: and ſo heare all
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:26328:101"/>
thoſe ſcoffes and ieſts,
broken (directly) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, as if they had
aymed at ſome other.
Calumniatours neuer
lightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne or ſcorn
any man, that hath not
firſt contemn'd himſelfe.
<hi>Marcus Cato</hi> (that Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
<hi>Socrates)</hi> hauing re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued
a blow from one,
and the party comming
afterwards to giue him
ſatisfaction, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſent him
away only with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere;
<hi>I aſſure thee, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
no ſuch matter.</hi>
O worthy man, beyond
other men! who thought
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:26328:101"/>
it a greater glory, not to
regard an iniurie, than to
pardon it. And, indeede,
if wee iudicially examine
them, how ſmal are thoſe
things, that do ſo much
trouble vs! For the moſt
part, no deeds at all; but
onely a fewe trifling
wordes, whoſe chiefeſt
ſtrength conſiſts alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
conſtruction. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to vnderſtand them;
and, withall, the ſcoffer
hath loſt the whole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and fruit of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely.
Theſe (gentle
Auditours) are the ſafeſt
weapons againſt Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:26328:102"/>
not thoſe, which the
vulgar fight withall; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and Reuenge. As
in trauelling, if a dogge,
or horſe daſh mee, I am
nothing mov'd at him,
nor ſtriue to doe the like
to him; but rather, rubbe
it off: ſo ſhould wee doe
here; accounting of them
as of Curres, and Iades:
whoſe iniuries proceede
not from iudgement; but,
from froward paſsion</p>
            <p>But, here I ende; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
down, and folding
together, the ſailes (as I
may ſay) of my Oration.
You haue heard three
things concerning this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:26328:102"/>
Vice: the Filthineſſe of it;
the Miſchiefe; and the
Remedy againſt it. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, in the name
of the immortall God, to
baniſh farre from your
tongues, and eares, this
infectious plague. For, he
offends, not onely that
vtters Calumnies; but,
he that heares them with
approbation. And as it is
impoſsible to handle hot
iron, with out harme, and
danger: the like alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
vs, in giuing aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to theſe fierie
tongues. I knowe well,
they will inſinuate, and
fawne vpon you; making
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:26328:103"/>
a ſhevv of Ioue in their
countenance, &amp; of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in their words: but,
belieue mee, they are
Aſpes, and Vipers; which
blowe-in their poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
through ſoft and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
kiſſes. Theſe I
hold not worthy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition;
but rather, of
dire imprecation: and
therefore, I pray, with
DAVID; <hi>Confound the
lying lippes, O God, that
ſpeake againſt the
Righteous.</hi>
