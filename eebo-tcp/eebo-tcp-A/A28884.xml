            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:47306:3"/>
other crimes and offences herein mentioned; for I doe aknowledge many to be pious and conſcientious men, who have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Biſhops yoake, nor received the marke of the Beaſt: But the generality of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being led by ſome few in every County (whoſe Oracles are at <hi>Sion-Colledge</hi>) are ſo ſetled on the lees of their old Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſubſcriptions, and in the courſes which they learned from their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
<pb facs="tcp:47306:4"/>
that they will not eaſily be removed. Nor have I much hope, that any of the Ring-leaders of this Faction, will hereby bee brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their errour, much leſſe to lay aſide their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full callings, which make them Lords over their whole Pariſhes, but rather expect, that ſome galled proud Parſons, Vicars, or Curates, or other inferiour Prieſts or Deacons (as they called them) will raile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me as one not fit to

            <p>I conceiv many will be ready to ſay, I trouble my felf too much to rake into the Dung-hill of Popiſh and ſuperſtitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies beeing dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:47306:6"/>
but therein I deſire to bee excuſed, beeing enforced thereunto by ſuch as I heard defend them in the Pulpit and in private, ſince they were Damned by Ordinance of Parliament. The defence of which (and of others their Popiſh Trinkets) is brought in to take away the ſcandal of their Popiſh callings from the Biſhops, and to juſtifie their former conformities, leaſt their Pariſhioners offended ſhould ſeek out other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,

               <p>We do not take the Tythes as by any judiciall or Ceremoniall Law, for they were payed by <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchizedech</hi> before the Law, and by Chriſt himſelf, and there is nothing in the new Teſtament for aboliſhing of them.</p>

               <p>I have no intent to enter into that controverſie, further then to let you know, that were it not for the upholding of the pomp and pride of the pretended Clergie, this could be no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie at all. For that which you ſay concerning <hi>Melchizedech</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> his paying Tythes to him before the Law, I conceive the Law was the ſame in ſubſtance in tradition before it was written; and without doubt <hi>Adam</hi> taught his ſons to ſacrifice, and inſtructed them in the things appertaining to the Worſhip and ſervice of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the tenth of the ſpoile of his enemies, and that freely; what is that to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47306:17"/>
of the Tythes of the fruit of the Land and increaſe of the beaſts, &amp;c. eſpecially you being no Prieſts after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech.</hi> And touching Chriſt his paying of Tythes (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have heard inſiſted upon) if it be taken in a proper or Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſenſe is a meer fable, for Chriſt had nothing of which he could pay Tythes, not ſo much as a ſmoke-penny or a garden-penny. And I do not finde he wrought any miracle to provide ought to pay Tythes as he did to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>

               <p>I could tell you of many evils which muſt of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch payment of Tythes, of which I will give you a taſte and omit the reſt: 1. Its a retaining of part of that Law which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47306:18"/>
by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 11, 12. If the Prieſthood be changed, then there is a change of the Law. 2. It upholdeth a main point of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is, that upon the ſame ground the Miniſters take the Tythes, the Pope as high Prieſt over the Clergy is to have the firſt fruits and tenths, and his Prelats their Procurations and Synodals. To ſalve up which, our State, not by colour of Divine Law but by humane law, gave theſe tenths and firſt fruits to the King. 3. Hereby is condemned the practice of all other reformed Churches, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a Nationall ſin, where the Miniſters are not thus maintained by Tythes, which is a very uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable cenſure. 4. If Tythes be due <hi>jure divino,</hi> then muſt the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Pariſhes be <hi>jure divino,</hi> elſe why may not the Tythes be divided to many Miniſters, as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly told you, and that ſome of you hold as bad as living upon ſtipends.</p>

               <p>I will not reaſon with you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether Tythes be due <hi>jure divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> you and I differ in our opinions.

               <p>I confeſſe that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel ought to live of the Goſpel, and to be honeſtly provided for, that they need not through want or neceſſity be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with worldly buſineſſe, but attend their Miniſtery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction: but to exact ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable maintenance ſavours too much of ambition and avarice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming the ſervants of Chriſt. I conceive the faithfull Miniſters are worthy of double honour, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47306:19"/>
Antichriſt is worthy of double puniſhment, not ſo much in kinde and number as in weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And if that will not content you, I affirm you are unlike to the Apoſtles of our Lord, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the primitive times, and ſavour of the leaven of Popery: as the Miniſters did in the end of the third and in the fourth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after Chriſt, who ſtrove for honour and dignity untill Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt came to his height. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what I now hear from you, comparing it with the practice of theſe times, <hi>I</hi> do conclude that it is not the perverſneſs and peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the people, ſo much as the pride and avarice of the pretended Clergie, which hindereth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and that I ſhall make appear unto you.</p>

               <p>I diſlike the name Clergie in your ſenſe, for if you mean Gods lot or portion, then are all Gods people properly ſo called. But (whatever the preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Clergie intend, I know not) it's plain that their pride and avarice is the cauſe of all the evils in the Land, as well Hereſies and Schiſmes in the Church, as troubles and diſtractions in the Common-wealth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>It may be giddy heads take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of offence (when none is given) to run out of our Church, and to move ſedition in the Common-wealth: but that is not the fault of the Clergy, but of themſelves, who are cauſleſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and I believe the Clergy are much troubled at it, that reformation goeth not forward, and that there is no better order in Church or State.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Firſt ſuch as were profeſſed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47306:20"/>
for Antichriſt ſo far as to bring in all his Ceremonies, Croſſes, cringinges, Altar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worſhip, and other bodily exerciſes and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions deviſed by the man of ſin to captive ſouls, and were fully bent to joine us to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and might probably have prevailed, but that the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was conceived danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and might have been a curb both to the Clergie and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Statiſts, who yet liked Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well enough, but feared the Popes Supremacy as it's feared in <hi>France.</hi> And I doubt not but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe men through Gods juſt judgement were ſo blinded, as to think they did God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in their ſuperſtitious waies, and by the proſecutions raiſed thereupon.</item>
                     <item>2. The ſecond ſort are thoſe dumb dogs and Idoll Shepherds who either could not, or would not preach at all, nor give any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47306:20"/>
alarm when the woolf cometh, and theſe were all ruled by the former as their Oracles and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</item>
                     <item>3. The third ſort are they who pretend more conſcience, and are more ſtrict in their lives, and more orthodox in their opinions then many others, and were ſo far inlightned as to condemn the two former ſorts (the one as too ſuperſtitious, the other as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) and well know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Ceremonies and other injunctions of Antichriſt to be naught, and yet ſubſcribed to all, and uſed many, but upon other grounds then the former ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might get into, and keep their Livings, and be capable of preferment; and theſe corruptions of the times they yeelded to (as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) for neceſſitie ſake rather then to leave their Miniſtery.</item>
                     <item>4. The fourth ſort are thoſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47306:21"/>
few faithfull men who ſtood out and (as much as in them lay) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſuperſtitions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times, and left their Miniſterie rather then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, having learned that rule of the Apoſtle, not to do evil that good may come thereof; and knowing that God hath no need of mens ſins to accompliſh his works.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The two firſt ſorts of theſe Church-men (as they call them) are caſhiered; the fourth ſort ſo diſcountenanced, that they either lurk in obſcure places, or are gone beyond the ſeas; for pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they meddle with none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The third ſort are the men for theſe times, who have ſo great influence upon all ſorts of men, that if the Parliament and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and all other men dance not after their pipe, they are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Schiſmaticks, Sectaries, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47306:21"/>
of the peace, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Reformation.</p>

               <p>I do confeſſe that in our Church there have been Miniſters of all thoſe ſorts which you have deſcribed: but the third ſort whom you ſeem to blame are they who ſuffered under the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the times, and yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Miniſtery, and ſubſcribed for neceſsity ſake, rather then the Church of God ſhould be deprived of their labours. Theſe now are, and then were, constrained to bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and heat of the day; and of this ſort (for the moſt part) are all the chief actors in the intended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we finde many of them have given a worthy Teſtimouy to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, and against the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of the times.</p>

               <p>I knew no neceſſitie there was for them to keep their livings upon thoſe terms. And for the Teſtimonie which theſe men have given, if you mean in writing, I think their Teſtimonie is partly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47306:22"/>
true and partly falſe. But verie few of theſe men ever gave teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie to the truth, ſo far as to ſuffer much for Chriſt, not ſo much as to hazard their Livings. It's an eaſie matter to teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Blaſphemies againſt God and the Perſons in the Trinitie, and againſt thoſe errors, which being repugnant to divers Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Creed, are declaimed againſt both by the Papiſts and looſe Proteſtants. But I never heard any of theſe men declaim againſt the corruptions of the times, nor confeſſe their own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in Symbolizing with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and receiving of the mark of the Beaſt, to the ſcandall of the Goſpel, and prejudice of the Church of God.</p>

not as any conjecture of mine own, but from the learned, and ſome ſuch as you cannot well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe their teſtimonie.

men, who muſt reforme, and teach the way to the people, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look for reformation: I told you they have received the marke of the Beaſt, as his vaſſalls and ſlaves, and have acted for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: not onely doing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themſelves, in ſubſcribing to, and uſing popiſh Ceremonies, ſuperſtitious, and humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions in the worſhip of God, having no foundation from the word of God, which is the rule of his worſhip: but alſo many of them have perſwaded others therein to tranſgreſſe, and by their examples have cauſed many to fall with them into the breach of the ſecond Commandement.</p>
               <p>For theſe ſins they have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted no repentance, nor given any ſatisfaction to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to this day: for which cauſe God will never honour them ſo far, as to make them inſtruments to reforme the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47306:26"/>
Churches. My opinion therein is grounded upon that Text of holy Scripture, <hi>Mat. 5. 19. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall break one of the leaſt commandements, and teach men ſo ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which I take to be meant of the Church of God, under the Goſpell.

But I muſt tell you your excuſe will not bear you out at Gods Tribunall. The very Popiſh Doctors and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law condemn pluralitie of Benefices in a Presbyter: men do not uſe to put away their wives,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47306:29"/>
nor take another to her, which formerly he had upon ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. The truth is, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel is meerly made a trade to get money; they preach for hire, run before they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, come in at the window like a thief, and preach according to their pay: provided they may have ſufficient to keep contempt from the Clergie; be as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the Popiſh Doctors, and able through their abundance to contend with their whole Pariſh, and ſwagger in their ſilks as their Predeceſſors did, they will be content,: otherwiſe they will tell you, you rob God in not paying their Tythes, and do not allow them honorable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

               <p>Touching their final eſtate, I will not judge, but leave that to Almightie God: yet this I dare ſay, none of theſe men are better then <hi>Peter,</hi> who once acted the Devils part: nor better then <hi>Aaron,</hi> who upon like pretence, as theſe men have, <hi>viz.</hi> neceſſitie or convenience joyned to make the golden Calf: nor are they better then their predeceſſors, whoſe mouths were ſtopped, and their judgments blinded with honorable maintenance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47306:32"/>
to put them out of their Living, which before they will looſe, the moſt will adventure their ſouls. And upon theſe grounds it is, that every one living within the compaſſe of their Pariſh, or their perambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation walk muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged one of their flock, and comming to Church, he is (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) a member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, how ignorant or wicked ſoever; or els how can they demand any Tythes or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from them. And for the ſame reaſon the Miniſters labor to preſerve their Pariſhes intire, and not to leave out any part thereof, leaſt they looſe the Tythe and benefit which comes by it.

there being conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times and places for ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious actions.

                     <item>2. Secondly, theſe funeral Sermons (or rather Orations) were firſt uſed by the Heathen, and then taken up by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who uſed at theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities to praiſe the dead.</item>
                     <item>3. Thirdly, thence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> came to pray for the dead, and to this day defend it ſtifly. And therefore as a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man once ſaid in a Sermon in

                     <item>4. Fourthly, now beſides this the corruption of the times are ſuch, that the gift for the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sermons, ſo blindeth the eyes of the Miniſters, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they alwaies finde out one thing or other, to commend the dead for, although moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly wicked (as what man in his ſickneſs, or at ſome other time, will not do or ſay ſome good) for which the Miniſter preſently (in conceipt) placeth the dead partie in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: to the woful hardning of the wicked (many of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors) in a courſe of ſin, when they hear as bad as themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the Miniſter, as a Saint departed, and a faithfull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the blinde

of Heathens; nor of all ſuch who profeſſed chriſtianitie were baptized, how wicked and lewd ſoever their parents were: or whither of the Church, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.

                  <hi>any, as profane or unclean: nor keep them from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: the Miniſter cannot do it of himſelf, without the Elders, (Church-Officers) joyn with him. Although the Miniſter know the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, to be prodigiouſly wicked or ignorant, and in all probabilitie eat and drink their own judgment, or damnation, he cannot keep them from the Sacrament: Such muſt be ſuſpended by the Church, before the Miniſter can refuſe to admit them; and untill then their children ought not to be denied the Sacrament of Baptiſme, for the reaſon before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</hi>

drink their own judgment for the reaſons aforeſaid: Although you have not the power of the Church-cenſures in your hand.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47306:54"/>
theſe Miniſters and the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries were as ſheep go to the fould, ſome good ſome bad, ſome learned, others unlearned, ſome Preachers, others dumb Dogs, ſome idle droanes, others more painful, ſome ſober and temperate; others given up to Luxurie and drunkenneſs, ſome Polititians; others morall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, ſome devout; others profane, ſome more Orthodox: others erronious and heretical, ſome more ſincere and Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; others wholly given up to ſuperſtition.</p>

               <p>I do confeſs of both ſorts of theſe Church-men there were, which have had their vices and vertues, ſuch as have been eminent for vertue and pietie, aad others infamous for wickednes. But wherein lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that you prefer one before the other, the worſe before the better.</p>

               <p>I prefer the Prebendaries in two reſpects. Firſt relating
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47306:54"/>
to their original or Inſtitution. Secondly to their practice and condition of life. For their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, I conſider theſe Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries as a civill ſocietie or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, as a Hall or Colledge in the Univerſitie, and ſo they were the Biſhops Councell or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtents, who was a Baron or Peer of the Realm having his place in Parlament. Secondly, and for their practice and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life as they were not, ſo they ſtood not as Miniſters ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as you call it) cure of ſouls, as the Parſons, Vicars, and Curats uſually had.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>This was not all their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or office; they pretended to be Preachers and Miniſters, and had much of the revenue of the Church in their hands.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs the Prebendaries as manie of your pretended Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie have had fat morſells for their little labour: But that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47306:55"/>
ſeemes to be the ſimplicitie or devotion of thoſe who gave it to them. Howſoever if they did any ſervice (as I told you what was their Office) it could not be expected they ſhould wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Biſhop as his Councell for nothing; eſpecially they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſupports of his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And the matter of that Hierarchie being to be upheld with ſo much policie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>Our Miniſters ſerve for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe, and therefore to be preferred before theſe Prebendaries: Is this all you can ſay for them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>No, I can ſay ſomething more, I told you what they were in their inſtitution poſitively; now I will adde ſomething of their negative righteouſneſs, which I formerly touched at, <hi>viz.</hi> They were not originally inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to ſtand in the roome of true Paſtors, As our Parſons, Vicars, and Curats were. They
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47306:55"/>
were only bound to preach (by themſelvs or others) certain Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons yearly in the Cathedrall, not pretending to any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorall charge: And ſo as they did little good they did little hurt. But when with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends they got Church-livings, and became Parſons and Vicars; they became more guiltie of the bloud of ſouls then ever their Prebends could have made them. Then they became Pluraliſts, idle droanes, Non-reſidents, kept out true Paſtors, made a ſtrong faction againſt reformation, and to uphold their Parſonages they joyned with the reſt to keep Chriſt out of his Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Now lay all this together, your Parſons, Vicars and Curats are of the deviſing of Antichriſt without warrant of the word, and are ſuch as I have deſcribed: The Prebendaries and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances are juſtly caſhiered,

               <p>I pray ſir forſake theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal and Popiſh names, for a great part of the Religion of Antichriſt is wrapped up in ſuch names of his Creation, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Abbots, Priors, Arch-Biſhops, Lord Biſhops, Deanes, Arch-Deacons, Chancellrs, Commiſſaries, Parſons, Officials, Vicars, Curats, Prieſts, &amp;c.</p>

               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall endeavor to let you know ſomewhat of that evill which I conceive of them.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, in their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and original (they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no foundation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) are of Antichriſts deviſing, and in their nature and uſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, or unlike to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, who are only Paſtors and Teachers. For their original, they grew up in this manner. The Dioceſan Biſhop (who in corrupt times was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have the care of all the Churches in his Dioceſs, which for the moſt part were endowed with all the Tythes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh) did uſually appoint the Preiſts or Miniſters, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were but the Biſhops Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates or Clerks.</p>

               <p>Now when the Biſhop had given
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47306:57"/>
to the Miniſter, the cure of ſouls and care of the Church with all the Tithes and profit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thereof, undiminiſhed by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, he was called the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Parſon, which verie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution being accepted, was an acknowledgment that the right to the Church was originally in the Biſhop, and that made the Parſon but the Biſhops Curate: or rather ſervant or Clerk: and ſo it continued until the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhopricks.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, the Vicar (as a Clergie-man ſaid) was created, or rather made by the Devil or the Pope: for when the Parſon grew too great, or the Patron had founded a Monaſterie, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperſtitious houſe towards the maintenance thereof, the tithes of ſeveral Pariſhes which formerly belonged to the Churches, were appropriated, and this was done by the Patron
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47306:57"/>
with conſent of the Biſhop, and the incumbent Prieſt, if there were any, and ſometimes this Appropriation was made by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Popes Bull: and then the care of the Church was in the Governour of the houſe (or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe according to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation) who ſerved the cure (as they called it) that is performed the Idolatrous ſervice by a Monck of their houſe who was called the Vicar: and to him there was allowed for his paines, ſometimes a ſtipend in monie, ſometimes the ſmall Tithes, &amp;c. ſuch a proportion as he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for with his Maſter, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the houſe: And when the houſe came to the Crown by diſſolution, it ſtood charged with that ſtipend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: or elſe the Vicar had the ſmal Tithes, or ſuch part thereof, as formerly was agreed for, and the Bulk of the Tithes became a Lay fee, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47306:58"/>
were ſold out, and enjoyed as the ſuperſtitious houſe held them, and the Compoſition or endowment of the Vicar remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo continues as his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this day for ſerving the Church, &amp;c. But uſually he had his inſtitution from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, the Curate grew in this manner; when the Biſhop held a Parſonage <hi>in commendam</hi> in his own hands, to augment his Biſhoprick, or a Parſon grew idle; or had ſeverall Church-livings; then they hired ſome inferior Prieſt for what they could to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the cure for a year, a moneth or as they could agree; and he was called the Curate, who came and went according to his pay, and at the diſcretion or will of him that hired him: and ſo he continues to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> tell you theſe things not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſuppoſe you know them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47306:58"/>
not, but to put you in minde how unlike theſe orders are to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel; for you ſee the Goſpel had nothing to do to approve or diſapprove of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Miniſter, Parſon, Vicar, or Curate, but all was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Pope (or in the Biſhop his Vicegerent) from whom the Biſhop originally received his power, which continued here in force for manie hundred years.</p>

               <p>4. And for the name Prieſt, its true it is a contract of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter; but as its uſed, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſignifies a Popiſh Maſs Prieſt, and is a a derogation from the Office of the Lord Chriſt; for <hi>I</hi> know none other ſacrificing Prieſt in Goſpel-ſenſe; but Chriſt who was the laſt Prieſt and the laſt Sacrifice.</p>

                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:47306:59"/>
                  <hi>evill in theſe nams, yet for offence ſake I ſhall be willing to leave them: and do conceive that the Miniſters of the Goſpel who are to continue to the perfecting of the Saints are properly Paſtors and Teachers, who ought to be maintained liberally, and to have all incouragement by payment of all things due unto them.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I have alreadie told you what I conceive of their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and particularly what I think of tithes: But there is one thing which I wonder at, why the Miniſters ſhould ſtand ſo much upon ſuperſtitious offerings and mortuaries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>They have been anciently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church: and although they of the Separation ſay they were the things of Idolaters, I doubt not but they may be uſed being converted from their Idolatrous uſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>As for thoſe offerings which it ſeems you agree to be Popiſh, as indeed the moſt of thoſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47306:59"/>
Offerings were, which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at the Altar (called the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarage of the Church) ſome to Saints, Idols, or Devils to whom the Churches were dedicated; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the <hi>Virgin-Marie;</hi> Some for Tapers and Lights, and other ſuperſtitious uſes; others taken from the Jewes by the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>I conceive all theſe unfit to be given to, or received for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: for that ſome things of Idolaters, not Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in State, as their goods and houſes may be made uſe of for maintenance of the ſervice of God: But thoſe things of theirs which were Idolatrous in State, that is, ſuch as were invented by Idolaters for perfecting their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and ſerved for no other uſe (as all Popiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and popiſh offerings) ought not to be uſed by Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And for thoſe Jewiſh offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it is no more lawful to uſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47306:60"/>
them to retain Circumciſion and other Ceremonies of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you be circumciſed Chriſt profits you nothing,</hi> Gal. 5. 2. for that the retaining of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is a forſaking of Chriſt, and makes us bound to fulfill the Law; and with that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jewiſh Ceremonies are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>And touching Mortuaries, they are a fooliſh and ridiculous offering, and were anciently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an amends and ſatisfaction to God (but they went to the Prieſt) to purge the guilt of the deceaſed; which he contracted by his non-payment of Tythes whileſt he was living, and ought as well as other Offerings be laid aſide; according to that, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bring the hire of a Whore, nor the price of a dog into the houſe of the Lord, &amp;c. And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols.</hi> Deut. 23. 18.</p>

               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>But now I pray you according to your <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>judgement, what muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all our Churches; It ſeems by your argument (if one may believe you) they muſt all be plucked down as the Browniſts teach, what ſay you to that.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the name CHURCH, in your ſenſe I do not greatly like it; for it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifieth a Companie, and is uſed for the companie of the faithful, yet for the preſent I ſhall admit the word by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie, to ſignifie the place of their meeting: And I do not conceive there is any neceſſitie to pluck theſe Churches, or meeting places down. I confeſs I put no holineſs in them, and think the Congregation may as well meet in any other convenient place: and that there is neither Legal nor Evangelical holineſs in them. And that plucking down all the Popiſh and ſuperſtitious
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47306:61"/>
and Monuments of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie (I do not mean the Arms of men of renown) and placing a faithfull Miniſterie, there is a ſufficient purging of theſe places to make them fit for the people of God to meet in for partaking of the holy Ordinances of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
               <p>Why ſay you ſo? Theſe Churches were founded by Papiſts and have been uſed to Idolatrie: And therefore you may as well allow of the things you ſpeak againſt even now, as theſe Churches, I think both ought to be allowed indifferently.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>I hold there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Firſt for thoſe I ſpake of formerly, we are ſure they were the inventions of the Man of ſin; and its poſſible to ſhew when and how they were brought into the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But theſe Churches (at leaſt manie of them) are more ancient then Poperie or Antichriſt; for its not poſſible that Antichriſt could come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

               <p>Why ſay you ſo? the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> did appeal to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in a caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Acts 15. and why may not we do the like?</p>

               <p>I deny that there was any ſuch Appeale as you mean; its true the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> in a caſe of conſcience did voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſend <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brethren to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with the Apoſtles, Elders, and Church there about that matter. And accordingly they received the ſentence and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Church, as well Brethren as Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which Apoſtles had extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of knowledge and revelation, and what they dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, was in ſtead of the written Word: We have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo gifted in theſe daies, but muſt have recourſe to the Law, and the Teſtimonies, the written Word of God.</p>

               <p>I am unwilling to tell you what I think of Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, Ile ſay nothing of it, but take thus much, mark the end and obſerve it. Theſe things the Claſſes, Synods, and Appeals can never profit the Church of Chriſt. The Appeals are in effect the ſame wee had before from the Arch-Deacon to the Conſiſtory of the Biſhop, from thence to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> then to the Audience, and then to the Delegates, ſo from the Congregation Presbyterie to the Claſſes, from the Claſſes to the Provinciall Synod, then to the Nationall. Here is work for the Civill Lawyers, to wyer-draw a cauſe (as a Proctor once ſaid) untill dooms day, if he lived ſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47306:64"/>
long. Theſe are not ſo likely to do good as the ſuperintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Biſhops, which grew up within the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt, and were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained as (was pretended) for a remedie againſt Schiſme and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, which yet proved more dangerous then the diſeaſe, and made way for Antichriſt the head of Prelacie. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion granted by King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight to the Lord <hi>Crumwell; Fox Acts and Monum. vol. 1. pag.</hi> 503. to viſit the Clergie. And the. High-Comiſſion <hi>(Stat. 1. Eliz. ch. 1.)</hi> granted in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raign, had as great ſhew and Probabilitie of doing good as theſe Claſſes and Synods. And for preſent I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive did ſome good: But when wicked men became High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, that proved a notable ſcourge to the godlie of the Land: And ſo will your Claſſes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47306:65"/>
and Synods in a ſhort time (when wicked and ambitious men get into the chief places and Power) prove as bad, if not worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be more then the High Commiſſioners, who were but two and thirtie. And this through the juſt judgment of God, becauſe theſe Policies are not of his appointment.</p>

               <p>Becauſe God never uſeth to bleſs means deviſed by man, to accompliſh his work in things appertaining to Religion: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they come in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with thoſe things which he hath appointed, when men's poſts are ſet up by God's Poſts, or when Go'ds means are laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. For example, God hath ordained his word and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church, to keep and drive out the profane, and to bring them to Repentance and amendment of life: Inſtead of theſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47306:65"/>
the State erected, or rather conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from the Papiſts the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Courts, or rather Baudie Courts whoſe Officers lived upon the bloud of the beſt, and the ſin of the worſt. I need not tell you what profit or rather hurt came to all ſorts of men by this means. To come a little nearer to that which hath a little more ſhew of State-Religion: The Parlaments of this Nation have made ſeveral Acts &amp; Ordinances for reformation of offences againſt profaning of the the Lords, day, and againſt ſwearing and drunkenneſs; but the Church-Cenſures have not been uſed for thoſe ends; See but the effect, what good theſe Laws have done, no reformation, much leſs any repentance in the Delinquents, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments touch not the heart- and ſoul: But for the preſent, cauſe the ſinner to rage and raile, and ſome to vow to be avenged of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47306:66"/>
thoſe who accuſe them, and ſome to ſin on purpoſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others who are more griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their tranſgreſſions then they themſelvs, or becauſe of the ſleight puniſhment appointed for expiation of ſuch offences; whereas if Gods waies were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, he would bleſs the ſame for the converſion and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as belonged to him, and the reſt would either be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reformed, or at leaſt left without excuſe: So then if theſe things be not of God, I ſhall expect no good from them. And can thoſe things which are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meerly prudential overtop thoſe things which undoubtedly are of divine inſtitution. <hi>The fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is wiſer then man.</hi>

               <p>They do much conduce to uphold their double honour which they labour ſo much for.</p>
               <p>I conceive the chief Engineers for contrivance of theſe things are the greateſt, and wealthieſt of the pretended Clergie, who have the greateſt power in everie Countie, which they extend to the utmoſt, having an oare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in everie boat, and they take themſelvs wronged, if they may not order or contrive all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, both concerning peace and war: nay and their projects reach verie far, take but a view of the late great deſignes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, beſides their ſecret intereſts in particular States-men, which they extended far, and wherein they prevailed much: Their publick preaching was almoſt nothing but Politicks in manie places; Their fear was (and yet is) that the Parlament and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47306:67"/>
Armie complying, would ſpoil their great livings and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their oppoſites more then they, and ſo the wheeles of their Chariots would fall of. This fear they tearmed the miſerie and danger of the Church (as the late Arch-Prieſt <hi>Laud</hi> did in a caſe not much unlike theirs) And their praiers and preaching muſt prevent it (if poſſible) and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their deſigne, which was: Firſt to raiſe a new war, and then to prepare the ſillie people to entertain the <hi>Scots</hi> (as avengers of the Covenant) to perfect that deſign which was to ſet up that Government and Platform which they had modelled as neer the Scotch faſhion as would ſtand with their honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and by their ſubtiltie and earneſtneſs they prevailed much upon the people, and manie of the more religious ſort believed them both in Citie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47306:67"/>
During this time they bent all their force againſt Rebels, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, which they ſaid did much endanger the Church (that is the <hi>Diana</hi> of their great Livings.</p>
               <p>Well, it pleaſed God (by part of that Armie of Sectaries whom ſome of theſe men had curſed, and ſcoffed at by the name of Saints) to fruſtrate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (by ſcattering the enemies Armie, almoſt miraculouſly) which was not prepared for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Church, as our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie told us, but to root out and deſtroie the godlie of the Land. But the ſnare is broken, and we are delivered, bleſſed be God; and there that deſign ended. Now theſe men fall to work afreſh, and if you will believe them, the Hereticks and Sectaries do again threaten the deſtruction of the Church of God: and more hurt comes to the Church by theſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47306:68"/>
Hereticks and Sectaries then did by all the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution: and accordingly the people in manie places begin to believe them as they did before. But the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where all their lines meet, and the Axis upon which they turn, is their honour and profit; for for if they can hold their own, they have and will have all the beſt livings, all the peoples heads under their girdles, and all the power in the Claſſes and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: and ſo upon the point the power of the Countie, and of the whole Common-wealth, and will without doubt reign in the Conſciences of all ſorts of men, and incroach upon the Temporal power as much as their Predeceſſors the Prelates did before: And this muſt needs conduce to their honour and profit.</p>

               <p>I do not judge all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but conceive many to be faithful: but I ſpeak of the moſt of thoſe whom you account the beſt, the Ringleaders, chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, and rigid of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Partie, whoſe preaching for the moſt part is but reading, and their Sermons for the moſt part Politicks, either concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monarchical Government, Libertie of the people, Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Lawes, Obedience to Princes, foundations of Government, Levying of Warre, disbanding of Forces, exalting the Clergie, payment of Tithes, puniſhing of other men of contrarie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the names of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Schiſmaticks, defence of Claſſes and Synods for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ends, under pretence of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, defence of their own Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47306:69"/>
to the Miniſterie, and other ſuch like tending to their honor and profit; And in effect their preaching it ſelf is but a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelvs, when they tell us of the great honor due unto them, and of their great labour: that they travel as thoſe that bring forth labour as the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, nay as under Rowers in Turkiſh Gallies, from whence one ſaid the Metaphor is taken: although there was no Turkiſh Gallies within the ſpace of 620 years after that was written. And of their honorable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which they plead for, All which are but meer Policies: and oftentimes with theſe things they mingle divinitie, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> doth Philoſophie with his Schoole divinitie. And upon the whole matter Preaching is made but a trade to get money, and to live by, and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſouls comes in but as a

               <p>Firſt for honour, it ſtood in this that they were the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of almightie God, and of the Lord Chriſt, the unerring Scribes and Pen-men of the holy Ghoſt, holy men of God, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47306:70"/>
are all in heaven. And for their labours I refer you to a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of them, left recorded by the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul. 2 Corinth. 6. 5. 11. 23. &amp;c.</hi> But above all their labours there mentioned, behold the ſufferings who (as the Prophets did) moſt of them laid down their lives for the Lord and his Chriſt, and for that truth of God which they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 37, 38. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 36, Where are any of theſe men who dare ſay this honour belongs to them, they have undergone theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or have ſuffered thus for the Lord Jeſus his Cauſe or truth.</p>

               <p>The firſt is this, when they are young and have little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, They make them a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47306:71"/>
common place book of the Bodie of Divinitie (as young Lawyers make them a common place book of the Law) And this they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of ſuch writings as ſuit beſt with their genius or fancie; the moſt fantaſtical, who would be counted moſt learned, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it out of the Schoole men (a ſort of rotten Divines) and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially <hi>Origen.</hi> The ſuperſtitious out of School-men, Poſtillers, and other Friars; the moſt diſcreet and ſober out of the writings of modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as <hi>Perkins, Ameſius, Chemniſius, Muſculus, Calvinus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus, Voſſius, Beza, Rivetus, Weames, Peter Martyr, Piſcator,</hi> and ſuch like. The more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort make uſe of <hi>Boyce's</hi> his Poſtills, or collect a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Sermons, either as they hear them preached: or as they think fit to cull them out of the great ſtore of Engliſh Books,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47306:71"/>
which are in everie place to be had. And this may be ſome two years work, and that is time enough: when this is done they are readie for a Church Living, and without doubt (as one of the ſons of the Prophets) have an eſpecial calling to preach. Then they come from the Univerſitie, and bring with them the curſe of <hi>Elie's</hi> houſe, crouching to ſome or other to put them into the Prieſts Office, that they may eat a morſel of bread (have a Living to maintain them and keep from want) or uſe their friend <hi>Symon Magus</hi> his wiſdom to ſhew an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of Angels, and by that means wrap for a thouſand bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſouls of men or more or leſs as their purſe will ſpeak. Well, the bargain is made, the man is approved of, rung into his Church, and gives great hope that he will be a peaceable man, and uſe the Pariſhioners well for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47306:72"/>
their Tithes. And ſo falls to preaching ſo ſoon as he hath had ſufficient time to fit himſelf, to ſatisfie the humours of his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie (which is a main Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie at the firſt.) And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (if he have not his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons alreadie written) he takes a a Text ſutable to his common place upon which he will preach, and writes his Sermon in a Book <hi>verbatim.</hi> Then when he comes up into the Pulpit; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of preaching he reads his Text, and all his Sermon out of his paper Book, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the credit of his Cauſe is bound up like a Bible; And this is the pains he takes, and is as confident that he diſchargeth his dutie as if he exerciſed all the gifts of the Spirit: and this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſerves for twentie Texts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to his common place: This courſe the moſt learned and Orthodox amongſt the rigid
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47306:72"/>
Presbyterials (whom I know) do take from day to day, ſome making better Sermons then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but generally all are tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe diſeaſes of idleneſs and hypocriſie in this reſpect. The idleſt and moſt unlearned reade over their tasks of Sermon, having but a certain number (as I have ſeen proved upon oath) and then begin again: And I once heard one that lately was a Miniſter in <hi>London,</hi> charge another that he never ſtudied, but on Saturdaie night wrote out of a book half an houres matter, and then reade it in the Pulpit on the Lords day, and another that he thought not of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon untill the bell ringed. And yet all theſe men in my knowledg paſs for conſtant preaching Miniſters, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Readers of Homilies nor dumb Readers of the old faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whereas indeed they that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47306:73"/>
thus read, are either ſuch as with the evil Servant and ſloathfull, hide their Talent in the Earth, or are not Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, not being apt to teach, and ſo not of Gods ſending, and without repentance ſhall have a reward according to theſe works.</p>

to that <hi>Acts</hi> 15.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47306:74"/>

               <p>It is their removing from place to place, for none other cauſe but caſe and profit.</p>

               <p>Its true, it is ſo to other men who remove upon neceſſity, or upon hard termes, as they do when they over-buy their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; for ſome of them are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to give a dog a cruſt of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47306:75"/>
their own afterwards. But the moſt take a wiſer courſe, never to remove but to a greater Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or for ſome great advantage one way or other: and upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remove commonly they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take the Summers profits of both Livings, or get ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help to bear charges. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they have commonly no loſſe in removing: and for the moſt part they double or treble their Revenue: And if not, they have this benefit, That when all their old Sermons are read over, which is commonly done in two, three or foure years, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſooner, then they are all new in a new Living; and then they confidently ſay them over again, which doth abundantly ſave their pains, and afford them leiſure to overſee their Tythes, to build, plant, take their eaſe and pleaſure, or follow any other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment beſeeming their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

and conditions. And this is the other ſhift of which I told you.</p>
               <p>Now I have given you my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherefore I conceive theſe men of ſo great honour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit intend no reformation.

               <p>I do not ſay ſo, nor do I believe ſo: but rather think that manie amongſt them are godly men who through incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs (taking things of truſt from the chief actors and forward men, and ſome meerly through ſimplicitie being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (as everie man is) to be perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of ſuch things as ſerve for their temporal good, eſpecially being controverted, and ſo manie ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til heads, ſome reputed for godly men imployed to defend them) have fallen into (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been miſled up at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie

in) theſe ſins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and thereupon they retaine the taſte of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were firſt ſeaſoned: everie man being unwilling to be accounted imprudent; which is argued by making retractations of former errours, and being alſo ſuſpicious and loath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine any new cuſtome, or to decline from the Traditions of their Anceſtors: eſpecially if they were reputed wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

they ſhould continue, but that there ſhould be a further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as appears by the verie Rubrick of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Common Praier-Book: and theſe had been ſoone aboliſhed but for the reaſons aforeſaid.

               <p>I had almoſt ſaid, the Mountains have travelled and brought forth a mouſe. I wiſh for their good, manie of them had leſs learning upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had more conſcience and honeſtie: And that ſome <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phnutius</hi> (who would not be lead by the multitude in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but convince them ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by Philoſophie but by the word of God) were amongſt them them, to ſtir up thoſe that are ſincerely godlie, who I doubt are but few; and thoſe wearied out with the noiſe of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47306:80"/>
of them who vex their righteous ſouls from day to day by their ungodlie deeds. And therefore not to trouble you further, I muſt tell you I do ſo far diſpair (not of any Synod, as one of the Fathers ſaid, but) of this Aſſemblie their doing any good in point of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That I hope and expect ſhortly that the Parlament will finde cauſe to ſend them away from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with a charge to preach abroad in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to leave Politicks and preach Chriſt, and ſo endeavour to prepare the people for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where their preaching may ſurely do more good then their State-Policie can do at <hi>Westminſter:</hi> And when that is done (if the Parlament by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and Praier will ſolemnly ſeek and conſult with God, and then adviſe with ſuch godly and learned men, who are no way

               <p>Well, what ever ſome others think in all places in this Land where Pariſhes are divided, there is either a lawfull Miniſter, or one who ſtands in place of ſuch who in ſome degree preacheth, or at leaſt publiſheth (by reading) the word of God, and adminiſtreth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the people: therefore in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie they ought to be accounted the Church of God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>The diviſion of Pariſhes, and ſuch a Miniſterie and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as you ſpeak of, are not ſufficient to give the Pariſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation the denomination of

a viſible Church of Chriſt. For then muſt almoſt all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations under the Papacie be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Churches: for amongſt them the Pariſhes are divided, and ſo they were in <hi>England</hi> almoſt 340. before any Reformation: And thoſe Popiſh Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had the word of God dailie read: nay and preached con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and expounded in manie places by their Friers and Poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as may be ſeen by their works in Print; Nay, and their verie Maſs-Books have much of the word of God in them: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt miſerably corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mingled with their own inventions.

               <p>If I ſhould admit the place that you call Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the meeting Place to have been built before Poperie, yet this proves not that the Congregation is a viſible Church: your ſucceſſion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47306:83"/>
hath had ſeveral interruptions and diſcontinuance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is to be conſidered that the whole Current of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie agree that the Romans commanded the better part of Brittaine from the time of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> until <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, which was almoſt five hundred years; and the tenth Perſecution about 337. years after Chriſt, during which time there were not above five of the Emperours who were either Chriſtians, or ſhewed favour to Chriſtians, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all the reſt firſt or laſt in their times were wicked Perſecutors, Heathens and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Idols, ſome of which by exquiſite Torments waſted the Churches of Chriſt, aud drove the Profeſſors into corners, they not daring to meet in publick. When the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire was broken, or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47306:84"/>
at leaſt was grown to an ebb, the Saxons invaded this Iſland, and about the year foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie the Brittains were beaten into <hi>Wales</hi> by <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> and thence grew the great Colledge of Moncks at <hi>Bangor,</hi> with whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>And the Saxons as well as the Romans were Heathens, and had their Idol Prieſts, Flammins, and Arch Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins (like the late Biſhops and Arch-Biſhops for dignitie and Power) and theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued until about ſix hundred years after Chriſt: where is now your Succeſſion?</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47306:93"/>
and is part of their Office, <hi>Mat. 18. 17.</hi> where the Church ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Miniſters and Elders, who are the repreſentative Church: for the reſt its anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

               <p>That queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, I will not enter into, but leave it to the learned, who have ſufficiently diſcuſſed it; But for my part I am confident no ſuch conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can be made of that place: for the Church alwaies ſignifieth the whole bodie, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and people, or the members diſtinct from the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>

               <p>This question being one of the principles upon which all the Controverſies between us, and the Independents are founded, I ſhall wholly wave you; you have heard my opinion in publick to which I adhere, and ſhall do untill I ſee better cauſe to alter my judgement.</p>

               <p>The Elders refer it to me to examine all thoſe who were to communicate the week before they came to the Sacrament, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I publiſhed my intention, not to admit anie who did not come to the Church at the time appointed to be examined.

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I queſtioned thoſe whom I ſuſpected to be ignorant about the grounds of Religion, and touching the nature of the Sacraments; and and for others whom I feared not, I did not examine them at all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of thoſe came to me, and others ſent in their names, and I entred them all in a Book, as well ſuch as appeared as thoſe who ſent in their names, and did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

But was this all you did? I doe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you and your Elders ſhould have informed your ſelvs whether ſuch as intended to communicate had ſet up Chriſt in their Families and places, in the exerciſes of Religion, and had ſhewed forth by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations the ſigns of faith and Repentance, theſe things are neceſſarie for all Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.</p>

               <p>Do you account this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial dealing ſeparating the precious from the vile, when none are refuſed: It is juſt as I expected it would be: this is but the Counterfeit of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and much like the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which manie in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have, for they have written divers Books tending to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſo it might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the ſtately Fabrick of their pretended Church, but might rather poliſh it by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away thoſe things which all men crie ſhame of, and which do therefore indanger their Church, the reforming of

               <p>Without doubt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſeeth how that may be provided for.

And theſe probably without anie addition may raiſe a ſufficient revenue for maintenance of a godly and able Miniſterie, through this whole Common-wealth, to preach the Goſpel to all who will hear the word of God.
