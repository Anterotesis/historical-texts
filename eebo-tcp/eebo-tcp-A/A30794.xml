            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His abominable Villain (as the ſequel of this ſtory will demonſtrate him) was born in <hi>London,</hi> traded ſome years in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> from whence he ran off, and on the 10. of <hi>April, Anno</hi> 57. arrived in this Colony.</p>
            <p>Here he ſettled with an active induſtry, but much addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Swearing, Curſing, and Drunkenneſs; and on the 15. of <hi>February Anno</hi> 59. was accuſed and tried for horrid Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, curſing the moſt bleſſed Redeemer of the world, with expreſſions unfit to be named but by Devils; at the inſtant recital of which in his Penance and Recantation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him by the Court, the very Foundation of the houſe wherein they ſate (I being then an Auricular witneſs) gave a fearful crack, to the terrible amazement of all the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46090:3"/>
Auditours. This dreadful ſignal of Divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wrought no remorſe in this vile Blaſphemer, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarding Scripture, and ſcoffing at Piety, entertained his hours of leiſure with Romances, and the Lives of ſome bold <hi>Romans</hi> and daring Valiant ones, which bred in him an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration (which he often uttered in his diſcourſe) how any man, endued with the leaſt reaſon or courage, would on any account ſuffer torment or publick ignominious death, when his own hands with a ſtab or poiſon could give him eaſe and remedy. Beſides, he would often plead that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in miſery might juſtly curſe and ſtab their parents who begat them to beggery. He had good natural parts, but low education, which (had he had Grace) he might have improved. His principles Atheiſtical; on ſome ſubjects he would diſcourſe very rationally, eſpecially on Planting, in which time and experience had tutoured him. By his knowledge in this he advanced his humble fortune, which increaſing, heightened ſtrange apprehenſions in him, at length more adapting him for Errantry than Planting; he would often ſay, that if he thought his labour and induſtry would not preſent him with more horſes in his Coach than the Emperour, he would never toil; and gave out, that as ſoon as his Eſtate enabled him, he would buy a ſhip, ſail to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and kill the Great Turk. That he ſcorned conteſts with private men, for he was born to blow up Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, deſtroy Kingdoms, &amp;c. and theſe and ſuch like ſwelling Vapours would often ariſe from the frothy brain of this <hi>Deſperado.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 4. of <hi>November Anno</hi> 63. he was exerciſing his ſarcaſtical wit to the prejudice of Captain <hi>John Parker,</hi> who retorting grated on <hi>Allins</hi> former blaſphemy: this begat a peek which ended in a Duel, and Captain <hi>Parker</hi> being wounded, <hi>Allin</hi> retires, expecting the iſſue; hearing no

danger, appears, and was bound over to Seſſions. Captain <hi>Parker</hi> afterwards recovering, <hi>Allin</hi> declared, that had he miſcarried, he would have erected a large pile of wood by his <hi>Negroes,</hi> and when throughly kindled, would have ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed himſelf, and run into its conſuming flames to prevent an ignominious death.</p>
            <p>On the 18. of <hi>November</hi> laſt His Excellency arrived in this River, to the unexpreſſible joy of all the Inhabitants, His Excellency under God being the foundation and eſſence of th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Colony. <hi>Allin</hi> was adviſed that His Excellency was informed in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> of his Blaſphemy and Duelling, and that ſtrict inquiſition was made what puniſhment he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for ſuch an accurſed crime, and whether ſince his penance and recantation he had expreſſed any remorſe and amendment, what life he had led, and how he came to be choſen a Repreſentative, and poſſeſſe ſome Offices of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in the Colony, it being a deſerved ſcandal unto it, that ſuch a known Blaſphemer ſhould be intruſted with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Dignity in it. <hi>Allin</hi> wrongfully conjectured that this intelligence was blown into His Excellency's ears by Captain <hi>Parker,</hi> whereupon he writes a very civil Letter to His Excellency in vindication of himſelf, utterly denying that he ever uttered thoſe accurſed expreſſions, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations were malicious, and as he pretended, by reaſon he had formerly committed one for drinking the Kings health, and that Captain <hi>Parker</hi> continuing his animoſities againſt him, had kindled his prejudice and diſeſteems.</p>
            <p>At Chriſtmas all the Gentlemen near his Excellencies Plantation were invited, <hi>Allin</hi> (though not called) intrudes, and on the morrow after Chriſtmas day His Excellency ſends for <hi>Allin</hi> privately into his chamber, tells him he had received his Letter whereby be had perceived his parts, and on that was very fit for the ſervice of the Country,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46090:4"/>
and ſhould be ſorry that this buſineſs, which he had ſaid he durſt not name, ſhould be proved againſt him; that he ſent for him, to let him know, he was not prejudicated, but muſt do juſtice; ſeveral people had complained againſt the lewdneſs of this Country, and not only Captain <hi>Parker,</hi> but ſeveral others told him of the buſineſs; that he never could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Captain <hi>Parker</hi> had any prejudice to the Country (as <hi>Allin</hi> had alleged) and for Duelling he muſt and would be ſevere according to the Laws, it preſerved mens lives, &amp;c. But that he had no deſign on his Perſon or his Eſtate; <hi>Allin</hi> replyed, that malicious times produced ſtrange effects, &amp;c. and as he was going away he asked His Excellency whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſtay was any thing offenſive; His Excellency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, he would not thruſt any perſon out of his houſe, but was no ways deſirous of his company, till the buſineſs was cleared. This private conference in his Excellencies cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was immediately penned by <hi>Allin,</hi> and found amongſt his papers. Immediately after this, <hi>Allin,</hi> informs ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his acquaintance of what had paſt, retires, and was ſhy of expoſing himſelf to the publick view; they all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that His Excellency had no deſign neither on his perſon nor eſtate, for if he had he would have ſecured him. Notwithſtanding all their good advice <hi>Allins</hi> obſtinate ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition falſly concluded, that His Excellency had a deſign upon his Vineyard (as he called it) and therefore would put him to death that it might be forfeited. This groundleſs apprehenſion made him deſperately mad, and guided by an Atheiſtical Tenet, deſigned a moſt murderous inveterated revenge on his innocent Excellency, and his own death. And that his deſigned malice might have opportunity to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his intentions, on the ſecond of <hi>January,</hi> after he had made a ſhort ſtiff Cutlaſh, exceeding ſharp, he commanded five Negroes and a Chriſtian ſervant to put ſome proviſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46090:4"/>
into his Boat with ſome Axes and Bills, and then called ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian ſervant, and told him, that if he heard he were dead, he ſhould take what he could get, and that he gave him his freedom. This done, he directs his courſe to the upper end of <hi>Parham</hi> Plantation, and near the open ground, not far from a path leads to <hi>Noctia,</hi> of an old ſaw-pit, he commanded his Negroes to build a Hut, and ſent ſome of them to obſerve whether any approched that place, and that they might be unſuſpected, ordered them to carry wood on their ſhoulders, as if they had belonged to a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion near unto His Excellency's Plantation, where he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times walkt with very ſlender attendance. Theſe recreations of His Excellencies gave <hi>Allin</hi> encouragement for his deſir'd conveniency, but divine providence ſtill ſteered His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency from that part, where this murderer expected him. On Monday the ſecond of <hi>January</hi> His Excellency viſiting a Neighbours Plantation, came home late at the landing place, <hi>Allin</hi> lay undiſcovered to murder him at his arrival, but a light, and attendance ſuddenly coming down to receive him, <hi>Allin</hi> at that time was diſappointed. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing His Excellency honoured a Neighbour with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, about two leagues from <hi>Parham,</hi> during his abſence <hi>Allin</hi> ſent a Letter by the hands of a Negroe Boy, but 'twas not left for, nor delivered to His Excellency that day, for it was late before his Bark returned. That night <hi>Allin</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for victuals, and ſaid, come lets eat a little before I die; his ſervant replied, I hope not ſo Maſter, I hope there is no cauſe or fear of death; I cannot tell anſwered <hi>Allin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next morning being the fourth day, <hi>Allin</hi> ſent a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very early, by the very ſame Negroe Boy, and charged him moſt ſtrictly to deliver it with his own hand; the l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

the Letter which was wrapped up in a leaf, and unſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo departs; His Excellency (becauſe to <hi>Allin</hi> ſtood on his juſtification, and pleaded guiltleſs, that the Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for which he was accuſed) had ſent for the papers out of the Records which concerned his tryal, and this morning about the time of the delivery of <hi>Allins</hi> Letter, received them, where he found three poſitive Depoſitions, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments, and the Penance enjoyned him by the Court for his blaſphemy: After this His Excellency ſhewed my ſelf, and Major <hi>Baniſter</hi> (as he was walking in his Plantation) none attending him beſides our ſelves, <hi>Allins</hi> Letter, with what impudency penned, the inſerted Copy will evidence, and diſcourſing of him, His Excellency averred, he need not have any ſuſpition of him, for he intended him no injury, but he was bound for to take cognizance of his fearful Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and to ſearch what judicial proceedings there had been about it, for ſuch a buſineſs as this, being of a moſt dreadful nature, ought not to be ſlubbered over; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all informed us, that for his ſatiſfaction he had ſent for, and that morning received all papers relating thereunto. And as for his Duelling which <hi>Allin</hi> ſo much feared to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for, he intended not to queſtion him upon the late ſtrict Act, being it was never publiſhed nor known here, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>His Excellency had ſummoned the Council here to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him this evening at <hi>Parham,</hi> at which time as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to walk to his Wind-mill, near the place where <hi>Allin</hi> lurked, arrives ſome Gentlemen of his Council which prevented him, had he gone, <hi>Allin</hi> had at the place attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to murther him. The uſual hour for evening Prayers being come, all went to divine ſervice in an upper dining Room, where my ſelf, Council, and ſeveral Gentlemen of the <hi>Colony,</hi> beſides Domeſtick Servants, attended His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.

I do humbly beg, deſire, and expect, that you will by my Boy the bearer ſend me your general pardon both for Words, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and Duels fought with Captain <hi>Parker,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for this way of asking it, alſo a pardon for Captain <hi>Parker,</hi> &amp;c. If you do not ſend me this pardon full and large, remember that you will be guilty of all the bloud that I ſhall ſpill, and miſchief I ſhall act, which ſhall be as great as ever was acted by the inſtructions and hands of a private man; upon the reception of which I will lay by my Arms, and come in to your Lordſhip with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubmiſsion, &amp;c.

                  <p>My Lord, but the very laſt night at your coming aſhore I had your life in my hand, my ſword drawn, and as much courage as ever <hi>Caeſar</hi> had, and my convenience was ſo great, that I was overcome with the advantage, my reaſon overcoming my paſsion, and telling me I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lay an higher obligation upon this Nobleman, than by now paſsing his Life: and therefore (my Lord) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber however you deal by me, you met with a generous Enemy. My Lord, to conclude, if you ſeize my Boy, or that you force him to confeſs any thing, or that he be not with me by the ſetting of the Sun, or that he bring me no anſwer, I will conclude that you intend to deſtroy me, or at the leaſt put ignominies upon me, which I will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; I will renounce all Allegiance, revenge my ſelf on all my Enemies, then kill my ſelf.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46090:7"/>His Letter was too large and too impertinent to be all inſerted in this ſmall Narrative, but theſe are the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial parts; But moſt of theſe Rants in their ſeveral Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs were not written in his laſt Letter to his Excellency, for had they been ſent, a cautious care had been taken to have prevented his deſign of Blood on his Excellency.</p>
            <p>This night he lay in torment, with the anguiſh of his wound, which cauſed a violent Feaver. He repented for nothing but that he had not killed His Excellency; and curſed the Coat which he wore (which was one of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, that he might be the leſs known) that dulled his ſword from entring deep enough into his body. His Excellencies Chaplain giving him ſome ſpiritual advice, he bid him talk to the rabble, and not to him.</p>
            <p>He gloried in the action he had committed, but grieved it was unſuccesful; and being by an intimate acquaintance interrogated of his Complices; he anſwered, He ſcorned any man ſhould ſhare with him in ſo noble an action. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded whether he deſir'd any thing to diſpatch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he anſwered, He could do that at any time: and about 12 at night, the Marſhal being gone out of the room, he drew forth a Piſtol (which was ſuppoſed to be tyed to his thigh) charged up to the Muzzel, clapt it to his Breſt, ſtruck fire but 'twould not go off; he then called to a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel to ſpare him a ſtick of fire to light his Pipe, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, he clapt the burning cole to the Pan, but all would not diſcharge the Piſtol, which then diſcovered, was taken from him.</p>
            <p>Being deprived of his Inſtrument to murther himſelf, he in vain <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ollicited the Marſhal privately for another, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing obſtinately unrelenting, and grieved at nothing but that he had not murthered His Excellency and butchered himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46090:7"/>On the ſixth day he was ſent down to the Gaol with a ſtrong Guard, and ſeemed chearful when he was put into the Boat, but had not gone above two Leagues, when feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death approching, but undiſcernably to the Marſhal and Guard, he diſcourſed a little, and was immediately ſeized with internal tortures, and in a ſhort time became ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and expired. His carcaſe was delivered to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gaol, where I commanded ſeveral Chirurgeons to diſſect him, and narrowly obſerve whether he had taken any poiſon in his Maw. They found a Pill of <hi>Landocum</hi> undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, ſome digeſted, and ſome that had paſſed into his Inteſtines. This was privately given him by one <hi>Serjeant</hi> the Chirurgeon that dreſſed him, enticed thereunto by a Diamond-ring and ſome ſmall preſents, who now in durance too late bewails his folly.</p>
            <p>The Jury of Inqueſt found <hi>Allin Felo de ſe</hi>; and becauſe ſuch an unheard attempt merited an unuſual puniſhment, his naked carkaſe was ordered to be dragged from the Gaol by the common Hangman, and Negroes, to the Pillory at the Town of <hi>Toorarica,</hi> where a Barbicue was erected; his Members cut off, and ſlung in his face, they and his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els burnt under the Barbicue, with a ſeditious paper which he had left to be publiſhed after his death, his Head to be cut off, and his Body to be quartered, and when dry-barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued or dry roaſted, after the <hi>Indian</hi> manner, his Head to be ſtuck on a pole at <hi>Parham,</hi> and his Quarters to be put up at the moſt eminent places of the Colony.</p>
            <p>The Pole to be of the moſt durable wood, to the future terrour and curſed example of ſuch incorrigible Villains.</p>
