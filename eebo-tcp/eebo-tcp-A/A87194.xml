         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Parliaments Reformation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any men, both of Quality, and others, doe approve, that the imployment of the poore, the ſuppreſſing of idle Counterfeits; and the education of all poore Children, (whereby that none may goe about begging or live idle in the ſtreets,) is a very good work; but ſaith ſome ſhew us which way we may begin it, and what we ſhall do to bring it to paſſe.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, it muſt be a Parliaments power and command, to carry on the worke? My reaſon is; becauſe the major part of people doe never move to any good work willingly before they are commanded; and the command muſt be upon a penalty too, elſe they will doe little; now conſider, who can impoſe a command on the Subject for the carrying on of a good worke, and to lay a puniſhment upon the neglectors of the command; but a Parliaments power.</p>
            <p>When once Authority and Power is gotten from the Parliament, and put into the hands of honeſt Gentlemen in this City of London, and ſo throughout the whole Kingdome for the carrying on of the good work generally; or elſe if the Honorable Parliament pleaſe to commit it to the Presbyters of every Claſſe throughout the Kingdome, and they to aſſiſt the Deacons, it will be carryed on with more care, and more eaſe, to the joy of all godly people.</p>
            <p>Authority being granted; there are 4. things for the Commiſſioners to conſider on, for the eaſie carrying on of the weighty and godly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of relieving, and Reforming the poore of our Kingdome.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The buying or building of houſes for that purpoſe.</item>
               <item>2. The raiſing of ſtocke.</item>
               <item>3. Finding out imployment to imploy young and old.</item>
               <item>4. Ordering ſuch a godly and politick government; that the godly and laborious poore may be countenanced and cheriſhed, and the idle, and wicked poore ſuppreſt.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. For houſes, it is needfull that two ſorts of houſes be appointed in every Claſſe: that is, a workhouſe, and a houſe of Correction, thoſe two
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113751:3"/>
houſes will be uſefull in every Claſſe, for the relieving, and reforming all ſorts of poore.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A common workhouſe for all ſorts of poore to reſort unto, I mean old and young, the old ſome of them, will be uſefull to teach the young, the young ſhall have that benefit to be taught to write and read a part every day, beſides doe ſome work to helpe relieve them; here will be the benefit, the Children that lye all day in the ſtreets in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, curſing, and ſwearing, are now kept under a godly government, which is an excellent ſtep to Reformation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In caſe any ſhould be ſtubborne, and will not take paines nor live orderly and peaceably, that then they be ſeparated and ſent to the houſe of correction, there to remaine in hard work, and hard lodging, till he or ſhe promiſe amendment, and when he is diſcharged, he ſhall not goe whether his luſt, as the manner is now, being diſcharged, but ſhall return to the workhouſe from whence he came, by this meanes wickedneſſe will be kept in ſubjection; and this project will either reforme them that are ſtubborne, or make them run the Country.</p>
            <p>Alſo if we conſider the great neceſſity of houſes or Churches in great Pariſhes, where there are little leſſe then 30. or 40000. people, how ſhall one Church or houſe receive them all, in ſuch a caſe many workhouſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout London will be very needfull to keepe people together vnder go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on the Sabboth day, as on the weeke dayes; this deſerves a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration from the Parliament for the good of the peoples ſoules, and the preventing of Childrens playing in the ſtreets and beggers begging on the Sabboth dayes; So much for houſes: Secondly for ſtocke.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the raiſing of ſtock; To raiſe a ſtock to imploy the poor, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Country may eaſier doe it then the Cities, in regard the Law provides them materials with little charge of mony; I mean Hempe and Flax which the Law enjoynes them to ſow; but many pariſhes either for want of skill, or will, makes them ſow none, which is a great wrong to the Common-wealth, and makes our poor to go almoſt naked.</p>
            <p>And whereas many if they ſowe it, know not what to do with it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for want of skill or will, therefore I conceive if every Claſſes did keep a magazin or ſtock of mony or materials; then whatſoever hempe or flax were ſowne within the Claſſe, if any did want skill or time to manage it, they might then bring it to the Magazin and there they ſhould be payd for it, either in mony or cloth, and whatſoever cloth was made, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Drapers in the County to buy it, to the end that they might not be wrong'd, by taking away their Markets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:113751:3"/>This will raiſe ſtock, to imploy our poor and ſave our mony in our Kingdome <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reported above a Million of mony goes out of the Land yearly for Linnen Cloth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Clothiers in the Country that make broad cloth and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, do imploy abundance of women and Children, which is a great helpe to the ſtock in every Claſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of Collection, and by way of charitable gifts, by dying men and women there is ſome ſtock more or leſſe in every Country pariſh, to helpe imploy and ſuccour the poor.</p>
            <p>Having ſhew'd how the Country may have helpes to raiſe a ſtock to imploy their poor, I will ſhew how the City of London may raiſe a ſtock with eaſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Parliament will be pleaſed to grant an Ordinance for a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection within the City of London and 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. mile about; and this mony to be imployed for the education and imployment of all Souldiers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe many of them, as well Widdowes as maim'd, have a great charge of children, and are very poor, not able to ſet their Children to Schoole.</p>
            <p n="2">2. One halfe yeares exciſe hereafter, when things are overpaſt.</p>
            <p>That which is given to the poor, is lent unto the Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The 10. or 20th part of Biſhops Lands, and ſuch like to maintaine Engliſh School-maſters, for the well governing of all ſorts of poore Children.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all charitable gifts in every Claſſis, may be enquired after, and brought to a bank, and the Elders to ſee to the managing of it in every pariſh within their Claſſ; for ſome pariſhes in a Claſſe, may have many gifts, and ſo raiſe a great ſtock, there it lyes dead, becauſe they have but few poor to imploy it, other pariſhes within the Claſſ have many poor, and out little ſtock, and therefore many of them go a begging, but when the pariſhes joyn together within the Claſſ, they will remedy wandring begging.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A weekly meale for one moneth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A voluntary collection twice a quarter at the Church dores, the Miniſter perſwading all Journy-men and Maid-ſervants that care not to ſpend a ſhilling or two vainly, (many times) may give ſomething out of their vain expences; let them remember that God gives them health and ſtrength to get riches, therefore ſpare ſomething to helpe breed up poor Children, and remember, that if they mary, and have children, their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113751:4"/>
children may have the benefit of Teaching in the work-houſes, therefore let them be the more liberall to ſo good a worke.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That all penall monies ariſing from Drunkards, Sabboth-breakers, Swearers, and Adulterers, which amounts yearly to a great ſum in this City and Suburbs, may be brought into this charitable Claſſicall ſtock.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A fourth part ariſing of the forfeitures and ſtreſſes from the Tenant to the Landlord; Alſo the 4th. part of the forfeitures of the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Ale-houſes, and of all other Recognizance, which part will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a great ſum by the yeare.</p>
            <p n="9">9. A penalty of mony, upon exceſſive pride, and exceſſive health-drinkings, which threatens the judgments of God upon King, Parliament and Kingdome, that the Honourable Parliament will conſider of it, and ſuppreſſe it, for the honour of God who hath done great things for them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If this work be religiouſly and carefully carryed on; many at their departing this life will be very liberall to advance and hold up ſo good a work of this nature, which is the only means to reforme wandring beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo much for raiſing of ſtocks in City and Country; the next is imployment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The imployment that is moſt needfull to imploy the poore of a Kingdome. I conceive the only imployment principally is to make choice of <hi>Maries</hi> part, which is an earneſt endeavoring by faith and obedience to gain a portion in Chriſt, for the eternall happineſſe of our Souls; The next kind of labour that I account next beſt is that, that brings food, and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſuch like comforts, as plowing and feeding of Cattle, f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhing, fowling, gardening, planting and graffing for fewell, Timber, and fruit, all which (by Gods bleſſing) brings a plenty to Cities as well as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and if God bleſſe the labours of all theſe, we are never like to ſee a famine. Alſo if men would be but moderate, and not ſurfeit, and be drunke and abuſe the Creature, it would be better for their healths, and better for their families, and ſave as much, which they drinke waſtfully, or ſpue up, which would helpe reliev hundreds of poor Children in work-houſes.</p>
            <p>As the labours of the Country is in the fields and gardens; ſo the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the City is in their houſes, as ſpinning linnen and woollen, knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, weaving, ſowing, with Shoomakers, Taylors, and ſuch like; Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers and Taylors if they are good husbands, they are needfull profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a Common-Wealth, and can get their living by Sea, or Land
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113751:4"/>
which many other profeſſions cannot doe, as Silke-Weavers and ſuch, a Trade that brings neither food nor Rayment in City nor Country, and ſo I have done with the profeſſions and imployment for ſoule and body in City and Country, I will ſpeake of the laſt which is like a wall to a City, that keepes all in peace; and that is called GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For the order of Government for young and old to walk by, muſt be by a Law and a Rule printed in a faire Table, to the end that every work-houſe may know the mind of the PARLIAMENT, how they would have every one to walk by, to the glory of God, the honour of King and Parliament, and the joy of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That every one walk, holily towards God and Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Carefull and Laborious for the good of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And if any one refuſe, to walke after this rule; but will walke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely, contenciouſly, and idly, then, in ſuch caſes the Miniſters and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to have power to ſend ſuch perſons to the houſe of correction, and there to abide till he doth promiſe amendment; then to be diſcharged at the Seſſions by the Juſtices, upon promiſe that he will live orderly and painfully in the work-houſes.</p>
            <p>But in caſe, ſome will not be reformed, neither in work-houſes nor houſes of correction, that then the Magiſtrate may have power to ſend ſuch perſons to Sea that are fit, to the fiſhing trade, or otherwiſe, or to the Plantations to rid the Land of ſuch Brambles, and this is better, then to ſuffer them to live in miſcheif, and hang them at laſt; peradventure God may be gracious to them, and we uſing all wayes and means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them may prevaile with God.</p>
            <p>And whereas I have ſet down wayes in ſome part, for the raiſing of ſtock, imployment of the poor in City and Country, and for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of young and old in a godly, peaceable, and laborious way, or elſe to be ſent out of the Kingdome, all this good can never be brought to paſſe without the power and aſſiſtance of the Parliament by Ordinance: So I conclude with my prayers to God for the proſperity of this worke; and that God will unite King and Parliament, to carry on his holy, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and charitable work, that the poore children unborn may praiſe God, for the Parliaments preſervation, and the Kingdomes Reformation, for which we owe to God praiſe, and prayers, and all Spirituall ſervice.</p>

               <p>The way to reform wandring begging, and other wickedneſſe in our Kingdom is, that a care may be taken to breed up 3. ſorts of Children.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Children of careleſſe Parents that ſuffer their Children to live in much wickedneſſe, and they take no care to breed them up in the feare of God.</p>

                  </gap>, if the Parliament will ordain by a new Statute Law, that all Claſſes throughout the Kingdome ſhall be injoyned upon penalty, to provide a certain number of work-houſes and Bride-wels to reforme rude ungodly Children and idle people, Commiſſioners to ſee it done according to the mind of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>It is conceived that theſe 3. ſorts of Children are the greateſt part of Children in the Kingdome, and moſt of them are like to be come wicked members to the Common-wealth without this Government.</p>
