            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE same day that the <hi>English</hi>
Armie had met with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
at <hi>Swords,</hi> there were
some Ships sent to relieve
<hi>Tredah,</hi> which arrived verie
safe there, and relieved the Town though
with much hazard. For the enemie at their
entrance upon our Harbour, discharged a
thousand shots at the ships; But they made
way into the Town, without any losse, and
killed threescore of the enemie. That same
night, by the treacherie of the Townsmen,
five hundred of the Rebels entred the
Town, but alarum being strucken by the
<hi>English,</hi> they bear the enemie out of the
Town, and killed above two hundred of
them, without any considerable losse on the
<hi>English</hi> side. Sir <hi>Henry Titsborne</hi> made three
or some severall sallies out of the Town up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62228:3"/>
on the Rebels, and upon those sallies killed
six hundred of them, without any consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
losse.</p>
            <p>The Correnet of Sir <hi>Adam Lofties</hi> his

night following a thousand of the Rebels
lying at <hi>Kilmakeweeke,</hi> sent M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dudley Lofties</hi>
word, that they would soon assault the Castle
of <hi>Ratfarnham;</hi> but being well informed,
how well the Castle was furnished, with
men, and munition, and victuals, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
their attempt.</p>
            <p>Msr. <hi>Dudley Loftie</hi> Sir <hi>Adam Lofties</hi> second
sonne, now Captain of <hi>Ratsfarnham</hi> Castle,
doth rather wish then fear their approach.

               <hi>Rebock</hi>-hill, within three miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> they
descried them from off the plotform, and saw
them at a far nearer distance, (and do confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
say) they were marching by above
foure houres.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ianuary</hi> the twentieth, the <hi>English</hi> Armie

Sir <hi>Adam Lofties: Kilmaheweeke</hi> and <hi>Killake</hi>
two <hi>Irish</hi> towns, all within the compasse of
foure or five miles at furthest at <hi>Dublin;</hi> This
was purposely done that the enemie might
not harbour so nigh <hi>Dublin.</hi> This is all the

            <p>BEfore I had well ended my Letter, <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyne</hi>
(distant from <hi>Dublin</hi> six miles) was
burnt by our Troop, which was the seat of
an ancient Lord Baron, and a strong peece of

be! For two <hi>Spanish</hi> Priests are taken, who
brought Letters (as credibly is reported) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
that there is aid coming from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke,</hi>
I meane Armes: I would to God there
