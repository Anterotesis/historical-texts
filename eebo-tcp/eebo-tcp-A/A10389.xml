            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the <hi>former,</hi> I dare not seem to instruct that knowledge to which I confesse I owe mine.

For, as touching my knowledge (if it be any) in the tongues, the common influence of your example, and your benigner aspect upon my meane endeavours made me first able to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am bold to call it a worke of <hi>obedience,</hi> as being first occasioned by some speeches, which, however they proceeded from you, were received by me in the nature of a command: your wish in generall that such a thing were done, my obligations made me construe to an injunction of doing it.

            <p>I Have something to informe both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Author, the matter, and the translation of this discourse. For the first, that he was a <hi>French</hi> man, and a Lawyer, none will doubt but such as will not read; and that he followed the Court, and was of some eminency there, is sufficiently evident from one <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ad fin.</hi>
               </note> passage of this worke. But as for his religion, though not absolutely certaine, yet, his many protestations make it more than probable he was no profess'd Protestant. Hee protests frequently not to meddle with controversies of faith, but points of Law and policie; not to oppose the Canons, but Decrees of the Councel of <hi>Trent;</hi> not to wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in behalf of such as have separated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (Protestants) but of good <hi>Catholiques,</hi> (hee meanes Papists.) And therefore I have adventured to allow him the name of <hi>Catholique,</hi> with the forename <hi>Roman</hi>; which they of that party will, in spite of all contradiction, needs pin upon their owne sleeves. For I am indifferently confident that for outward communion hee was a member of that Church, some of whose faults are here required to a reformation. As for ought that may bee surmis'd to the contrary, it will not worke much upon any that knowes the libertie of that people, who were never throughly broken to the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Rome, I am domiti ut pareant, nondum ut serviant;</hi> and which hath ever bin more eminently conspicuous in those of that faculty whereof the Author is confessedly one. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb facs="tcp:16652:4"/>
those many other writers which hee every where urgeth, and of whose testimonies the whole work main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consists, were in their times (ancient Councels and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers excepted) all, or most, knowne Papists: though some of them in these later daies have bin shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censured for Schismaticall, because not altogether so transcendently Papall. Now for the furth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; it hath cost me some diligence to draw this <hi>Apelles</hi> from behind the curtaine.

Now <hi>VVilliam Ranchin,</hi> (whom I conceive to be the man) was in his time a Doctour of Law, Counsellour to King HENRY the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> sometimes Fiscal Advocat in the Court of Aids at <hi>Occa,</hi> and afterwards A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>turney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the Soveraigne Court of Aids at <hi>Montpelier</hi>; one who by his workes in that kind hath deserved well of his profession. Thus much of the Author.</p>
            <p>As for the Work it selfe, it is now almost forty yeares since it was first published; the copyes are growne very rare and (it may be, therefore) deare even in <hi>Paris</hi>: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the love of their friends or the malice of their enemies hath made them so, I know not. It does strongly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the rights of Christian Princes and the liberties of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches from the grand and yet growing usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Popes, and the bold attempts of pretended Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels. It shews the many hot skirmishes which Princes have beene put to for the preservation of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and how loath they were to part with them. It points at the meanes whereby the State spirituall stole up by degrees to such a height of temporall greatnesse. It un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the shame of that Popish <hi>Helena,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>; by laying open the many nullities and injust pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of it. It shewes the weake, the no effects of those
<pb facs="tcp:16652:4"/>
strong hopes of a reformation from it: and makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that what by the patients was so earnestly desired as a remedy, was by the fraudulence of the Physician turn'd to a worse disease. It fairely acquits their rejection of that Councell for matter of Discipline, (and why not therein ours for matter of Doctrine?) from the imputation of Schisme, as being driven to the necessity of abrogating that excessive power of the Pope, which hee could not bee brought to moderate: being both forced to shake off that heavy yoke which his ambition was unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, so long as our patience was willing to endure. And (though it be besides the purpose, if not against the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Authour) it ministers just grounds of questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the absolute infallibility of Popes and Councels in matters of faith. Who both joyntly and severally (it is to be fear'd) have been too dareing to entitle the Holy Ghost to their many weakly probable opinions, if not some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Whence it is that the present Church is as much pester'd with a glut of Councels, Canons, and Curses, as the Primitive was with heresies: under the weight of which burthen many weaker consciences, if they doe not quite sinke, cannot chuse but groane. Whence it is that the modest and sober libertie of re-examining any thing which hath been once decided, is utterly excluded: which notwithstanding most good men have in all ages beene willing to tolerate, many to desire, and some few bold to make use of. Amongst these few we may well reckon this Author for one. Far was He from the high un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablenesse of those fierce and fiery spirits that scorn to goe to Heaven in the company of any that are called here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>: that pronounce upon all men according as they find them devoted to this their <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; making lesse conscience of a text of Scripture than a Canon of <hi>Trent</hi>; and like their heathen fore-fathers, <hi>Non alios judices quàm seipsos patientur.</hi> Lastly, this work presents us with many remarkable passages concerning our own Nation; where we may read our present h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ancestours miseries: for amongst all those authentique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which are here recited of the Popes usurpations, I doe not finde any more wofull tragedies of his tyranny than such as were acted upon our Stage. No higher tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyes erected to his ambition, than here. No more rare examples of a devout abused patience, than ours, till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme necessitie made us despaire into fortitude; when the avarice and exactions of <hi>Rome,</hi> having left us nothing else, to her griefe and our glory, at last robb'd us of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience too.</p>
            <p>Besides these there are other considerations in the work it selfe, which (it may bee) wrought a far far better judgement than mine owne to the approbation of it. In submission to which I have taken the paines to make it speake <hi>English</hi>; and that's all. For as for the quotations, (which might haply be expected from me) my other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments would not allow me strictly to examine them all, but so many as I sought did sufficiently confirme my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Authours fidelity in the rest. For adding more testimonies of my owne out of other authors in the like kinde and to the same effect, however I could fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have done it, yet I obtained so much of my selfe as to forbeare: being much abhorrent from ingaging my selfe in a quarrell of this nature, and creating an adversarie where I might fairely chuse to want one. For my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, I confesse, upon a second review, I finde I have been somewhere too pedantique and precise in keeping to the phrase of my Authour, and otherwhere I meet with a litle <hi>Patavinity</hi> of my owne. But for this I must tell my <hi>Pollio</hi> it was neither necessitie nor chance that cast me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; for I am here of his minde, <hi>Qui non ignoravit vitia sua, sed amavit.</hi> My greater feare is lest there be somethings in the matter which may bee lyable to a juster exception. Which, however they might have beene omitted by the Authour, could not so fairely bee left out by the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: This castrating of dead Authours being a piece of politique cruelty, which himselfe <note n="†" place="margin">

Church, and (I hope) is rarely practised in ours. I doe not deny but here are, amongst many which I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, some passages which I had rather excuse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> such as need not be approved, yet might well enough bee prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Wee allow a stranger more libertie than a native: and in this consideration I held it a piece of injustice to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, so much violence to my Authour as to subdue him wholly to our domestique customes. Hee still speakes <hi>French</hi> in part, and retaines a few markes of his birth and breeding: yet such as can bee no eysore to those that will observe withall, how, when he barely relates the Lawes of his owne Countrie, he neither censures nor sets rules to ours. For what concernes the distinction of jurisdictions, there is a vast difference betwixt their State and ours. Here, though they are conveyed in severall channels, yet they are all derived from the same fountaine, the King. Whereas there, the Pope shares it with the Prince; and not content with his part, will needs ingrosse the whole. Hence those bitter complaints of the Authour against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Iudges, which, when he drives the naile up to the head, fasten lastly all upon his Holynesse. Thus farre I thought fit to fortifie against future mistakes; knowing that what was well meant might be ill taken; and that it is not ever in the fates of innocency to bee exempt from misconstruction. For other peccadillos I am not very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to excuse them; hopeing that the judicious Readers will not much bogle at them, and the ordinary (it may bee) never observe them; nor doe I meane they shall bee beholding to me for the knowledge of them further than by this intimation: which perhaps may whet some dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler capacities to a sharper enquirie after them, such as thinke they are bound in conscience to finde a crime, because I confesse the possibilitie of a fault: and will be ready to straine at Gnats, who without this caution would have swallowed Camels. And yet I feare there will not want some among them that will receive those things with applause, which I desire may passe with
<pb facs="tcp:16652:6"/>
pardon. Nay (it may bee) if the Authour were que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd for some places, the <hi>most</hi> (I doe not say the <hi>best</hi>) would bee content to absolve him, if not ready to reward him. But the Translatour professeth his name in another cense; and is not so sollicitous to please <hi>those,</hi> as answere <hi>these</hi>: to whose graver judgements hee submits both himselfe and these his weake endeavours, in a modest confidence of their candid interpretation.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT to the READER, prefixed before the FRENCH Copie.</head>
            <p>THis Booke is not for those that have made separation in point of Religion; but for such good Catholiques as desire to see an holy reformation of it. Here you shall finde the demands that were put up to that end at the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Princes, not Protestants, and the small regard that was had of satisfying them. Here you shall read the tricks that were used both in this and some precedent Councels, to wave that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation which was so earnestly sought after: and withall you shall understand a good many of the points wherein it consisteth. The method which the Authour hath used, may bee set downe in few words. Hee makes two kinds of nullities; one in the forme and manner of proceeding, [which he delivers in the first Book]: the other in the matter. And these later consist either in denyal of justice [which is handled in the second Book;] Or in the injustice of the Decrees themselves: concerning which he sets downe two maxims. The first, that they advance the Pope to an unlawfull power, stripping Councels, Clergy, yea Kings and Princes of that authoritie which belongs unto them, to transferre it upon the Pope; [and this is proved in the third, fourth, fifth and sixt Books]: The second, that they pull downe the honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Christian Princes, and Secular powers: [which is treated
<pb facs="tcp:16652:7"/>
of in the last Book]. See here the subject wherein many learned men, both Devines and Lawyers have travailed long agoe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the names of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and such as embrace their doctrine, were ever heard of: which doctrine is not here defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor shall you find any thing that concernes them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The ancient liberties of the Church are represented here in divers passages, the very same with those that carry now the name of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church; whither they made their retreat when they were chased out every where else: yet not without danger of being lost, and that not in part but in whole, by a blow from <hi>Trent.</hi> VVhich would plunge us again into those miseries, wherof our Ancestors begun to bee sensible long agoe: which they have left unto us by tale upon record, in the ancient Histories and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of our Kings, the Rolles of the States General, the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances of the Courts of Parliament, and many other ancient Monuments. Nor doth it lesse concerne the interest of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Lord the King; whose honour and dignitie are shamefully disgraced, his authoritie vilified, his power rebated; with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall prejudice to all the <hi>French,</hi> who in particular are egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wronged in divers things, as may be fully knowne from this discourse. You must further observe that the Authour was not willing to meddle with what properly concernes divinitie, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to transgresse the bounds of his profession, or speake any thing upon this occasion of those demands which were made, by Catholique Princes in this Councell, touching the reformation of abuses about Images, Pilgrimages, Reliques of Saints, keeping of Holy dayes, convenience of the marriage of Priests, Communion in both kinds, celebration of divine service in a vulgar tongue, and such like; contenting himselfe with a bare mention of those demands, and no more.</p>

               <p>THE Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> was called of purpose to reforme those abuses of the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which were the occasion of that Schisme under which wee now groane:<note place="margin">The occasion of c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Popes turned the Cat in the pan, and caried the matter so handsomly, that in stead of a naturall birth, the Councell was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a monster; and for a Canon or Synodicall Decree, brought forth a Papall Bull: in stead of an extirpation of abuses, a nursery of errours: a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation, for a reformation: a source of injustice: an authentique title to <hi>legitimate</hi> all the usurpations that ever the Popes have made upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church and other Ecclesiastiques; upon Emperours, Kings, and Common-wealths, with their officers, liegemen and subjects: in a word, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Christendome, with all the Estates therein, as well Temporall as Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. To the holding of this Councell they were in a manner compelled by

(what time <hi>Adrian</hi> by his Legat at the Diet at <hi>Norimberg</hi> engaged his promise for it) till 1546. still giving out faire pretences, and studying for new occasions to delay it: posting it from one to another, and passing it over as a debt to their successors. Yea and even after they had set about it, they managed it so, that they kept it low, betwixt living and dying for eighteene yeeres, taking their time of purpose that they might levell their stroke right, wherein they have outstript the choicest masters of that art in <hi>Palestine</hi>; they have good reason to understand this passage. Many of their predecessors had left their weapons there; many had received blowes and mortall wounds there. <hi>Germany</hi> was fatall to them, and the remembrance of the Councels of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> madded them; when they thought upon the deposall of so many Popes; the discipline whereto they were made subject; and the cutting short of their power. They had observed the saying of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>The place of the Councell is all in all; I will not have it in a place where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hath the upper hand:</hi> and the despaire he conceived both of himselfe and his fortunes, when he received the newes that his Legats had condescended to the election of the City of <hi>Constance.</hi> They perceived withall that all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> banded with the Emperour to have the Councell amongst them, and bended all their designes to that end: so that it necessarily concerned them to save themselves by flight; to shuffle on the time; to spin out delayes; to pump for pretences; and in fine, when they could no longer shift it, it was behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they should pitch upon some such Citie as would be sure unto them, that depended on them, and wherein they had absolute authoritie. Such, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, was <hi>Trent:</hi> yea and that after they had made enquiry about some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which (as they conceived) lay more convenient for them in <hi>Italy.</hi> It must be their next care to be speciall warie to what persons they yeeld admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; to bestow such onely there as were engaged, that so they might make it more firme for them; and proceed now quicke, then slow; now an amble, anon a gallop; holding that course which best fitted with the nature of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and the disposition of the persons. It behooved them also now and then to breake off and deferre it, and when their partie was somewhat ill at ease, to adjourne it to another place, as as to <hi>Bononia,</hi> under colour of some sorie indisposition of the aire: Besides, to move all Catholique Princes to an utter extirpation of the Protestants, and such as had taken their long leave of the Pope. And if this would not serve the turne, then they must scatter reports amongst the Catholiques themselves, to set them by the eares together, and kindle the fire in all quarters of Christendome; enter league with the stronger partie, to support their greatnesse, and raise it to a higher pitch. They must by all meanes possible winne the Bishops and the rest that had ought to doe in the Councell; feed them fat with promises; present them with commodities, make them joint sharers in their dignities and benefices, and gaine them to their side by such like allurements. Then they must submit themselves to these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Not to determine any thing, but with the good will and pleasure of the Holy See, which, when need required, sent the Holy Ghost in poste in a cloke-bag, making him take a good many journeyes: To anathematize all the opinions of the <hi>Lutherans, Huguenots,</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> without exception, how true soever; for feare of giving them the least advantage.

It behooved them also to disannull all the Decrees of the Councels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> which were any way prejudiciall unto them; either covertly repealing them, or by some oblique meanes voiding the force of them; and so to deale with the rights and liberties of some such Realmes and Provinces as durst stand upon their prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, priviledges, lawes and statutes, whereby they pleaded exemption from their upstart <hi>Decretalls.</hi> Lastly, it concerned them to take speciall care how they medled with the reformation of the Pope; how they spoke of his exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive power; of the abuses and misdemeanors of his Court; of his injust at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and the little care which he hath of his spirituall charge, and the good of soules. This was a rocke they must not touch upon in any case. And so well they knew how to steere for their best advantage, that whosoever reads their Decrees, cannot choose but forthwith confesse that it is a worke meerly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and such as none else could have a hand in; and will ever remaine of this opinion, that this last Councell is nothing behinde with those of <hi>Florence,</hi> and that of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which were called of purpose to disannull that of <hi>Basill,</hi> and the second of <hi>Pisa:</hi> just as this of ours was to stop the clamours of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes and people, lest they should have put up one or other in <hi>Germany,</hi> like to the first of <hi>Pisa,</hi> or some others held in after ages. For you shall never reade of any Councell that was so much to the Popes honour and good liking, as this. Amongst so many Buls and Constitutions which have come forth since, you shall scarce finde any which doth not make mention of this Councell; which doth not name it with honour; which doth not expresse an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Let a man but reade the Commissions of the Nuncio's, which since that have come into <hi>France</hi> and other Countries; so many articles in them, so many rehearsals or reinforcements of this Councell. To say nothing of the great paines they have, and doe daily take, to have it generally received and kept: Among all the Councels that ever were, no compare with this for reverence and respect. It hath quite defaced and extinguished the memorie of all the rest. Tis their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, their favourite, their champion, their arcenall, their bulwarke, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, their issue, and their creature: and good reason why they should make so much of it. Now the more highly they prize it, the more should we sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it; the more should we straine our veines, and bend our nerves, our force and vigour, to repell and stifle it as a venemous serpent: what we doe in this kinde will not want a president. When Popes and Councels have straggled out of the right way, when they attempted more than of right they ought, when they tooke their passion for their guide, they have ever encountered with just disobediences, and lawfull resistance; with strong mounds and fences, which have stopt the current of their out-breakings and injust enterprises.</p>

And to the intent they might be read unto him, and an oath administred before the delegates of the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the King was appointed to appeare at <hi>Nants</hi> in <hi>Loraine,</hi> upon our Ladies day in March, where the said Grande's would likewise appeare, they and all the Kings and Princes of Christendome; where they determined to make an universall law, like to that which was was enacted and agreed upon at the said holy Councel, for the extirpation of heresies and uncouth doctrines; such as should be found repugnant to the holy Councell aforesaid.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 They made also some other requests unto him; as, that he would put an end to the alienation of the temporall goods of the Church; that he would cause the ringleaders of the seditious and schismaticall persons in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be punished; that he would revoke the pardon and absolution granted by his proclamation, especially in respect of such as were guilty of treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Divine Majestie; that he would put his hand to the sword of justice, for the punishing of the murther committed upon the person of the late Earle of <hi>Guise.</hi> To all which demands, he made answere by writing in this sort. <q>I thanke your Masters Majesties for the good and commendable advice they give me; and you also for the paines which it hath pleased you to take in that behalfe: giving you to understand that my very purpose is to live and cause my people to live according to the ancient and laudable custome kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and that the peace which I made hereupon, was to cleare my Kingdomes of the enemie: and for the present, my desire is, that justice be observed in all places of my Dominions.

<q>Certaine delegates of the Church appeared in the Councell, and exhorted the three Estates to tolerate but one religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Catholique Romane, and the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>; and to take a view of those Articles which are generall and common to all the three Estates, to have them collected into one scrowle, and authorized by the King, to make them more authentique.</q>
Yet for all this, nothing was done, as appeares by the report afterwards set forth in print.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The same request was againe repeated by the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> assembled at <hi>Melun,</hi> in Iuly 1579. as appeares by the speech made before the King by the prenamed Lord Bishop of <hi>Bazas,</hi> out of which wee have extracted these words:
<q>The Clergy humbly entreateth your Majestie, that it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them by your authority to reduce Ecclesiastical discipline, and reforme themselves in good earnest. Amongst all the rules of reformation and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they have pitched upon those which were dictated by the Holy Ghost, and written to the holy generall Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>; in as much as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde any more austere and rigorous, nor more proper for the present ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, and indisposition of all the members of the body Ecclesiastick: but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because they are tyed and bound to all lawes so made by the Catholick Church, upon paine of being reputed schismaticall against the Catholick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and of incurring the curse of God and eternall damnation.</q>
And presently after he addes,
<q>Wherefore the Clergy doth most humbly beseech you, that you would be pleased to ordaine, that the decrees of the most sacred Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> may be generally published throughout your Dominions, to be inviolably observed by them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Nicolas Angelier</hi> Bishop of Saint <hi>Brien,</hi> made the like instance to the same King, October the third 1579, in the name of the Clergy assembled at <hi>Melun.</hi>

<q>The whole Church, Christian and Catholick, assisted by the Legates and Ambassadours of the Emperour, of this your king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of all other Christian Kings, Princes, and Potentates, did call, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, and celebrate the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>; where many good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some constitutions, usefull and necessary for the government of the Church and the house of God, were ordained: To which Councell, all the Legats and Ambassadours did solemnly sweare in the behalfe of their masters, to observe and keep, and cause it to be inviolably kept by all their subjects; yea, even the Ambassadours of this your Kingdome solemnly tooke that oath: Now it is received, kept and observed by all Christian Catholick Kings and Potentates, this Kingdome only excepted, which hath hitherto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deferred the publication and receiving of it, to the great scandall of the <hi>French</hi> nation, and of the title of MOST CHRISTIAN, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your Majestie and your predecessors have been honoured: So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of some Articles touching the libertie of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, (which might bee mildly allayed by the permission of our holy father the Pope) under scugge I say of this the staine and reproach of the crime of <hi>Schisme,</hi> rests upon your kingdome amongst other Countries: which signifies no lesse in Greeke, then <hi>division</hi> and <hi>disunion</hi>; a marke and signe, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christianity, and which your Majestie and your predecessors have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abhorred and eschewed: and when some difficulty was found about the receiving of some other Councells, as that of <hi>Basil</hi> and others, all was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried so gravely and wisely, that both the honour and unity of the Church, and also the rights of your crowne and dignity, were maintained and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

<q>If there be some particulars in that Councell, which some body, (either by reason of their particular interest and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or because their bodies and humours are not sufficiently prepared, and disposed for the taking of such strong physick,) do complaine of and make some dorres about them; there is a good remedy for that: and wee dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake and promise, that recourse being had to his Holynesse, and he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereunto, he will not refuse to provide for it. In like manner as the Chapiters and exempted corporations have by our meanes, and wee with them already preferred a petition, that their priviledges and exemptions may be preserved intire unto them, and that this publication may in no sort prejudice them; expecting herein a new decree from his Holynesse; after he shall bee sufficiently instructed by those remonstrances, which may bee made unto him concerning this point.

Wherefore this our assembly by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent, have resolved to present their humble petition to our</hi> Most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>King, in like manner as was formerly done by the States of</hi> Blois, <hi>and the Clergy convented at</hi> Melun; <hi>that he would be pleased, for proofe of his true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion, to enjoyne the publication of the said Councell; whereby the maintenance of the Church is well provided for, which is observed to be daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and abated.</hi> In the end of this Councell, there were thirteen doubts proposed to the Pope, with his finall resolution to them: the last whereof was a demand of the confirmation hereof, which was condiscended unto.</p>

One argument hereof which may be alledged, is this, that they were not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested herein; for the most of the decrees which concerned them, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and there was no default in the observation of them, unlesse it were on their part: and one company of them were inserted in the Edict of <hi>Blois,</hi> the rest in divers other Provinciall Councels, holden afterwards in <hi>France</hi>: the Canons whereof are to bee seen in print; at <hi>Roan</hi> 1581, at <hi>Bourges</hi> 1584, at <hi>Tours</hi> 1585, and at <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi> the same yeere: all which are put out in print at many other places.

                  </note>3 This Bull came to the Protestants ear; for heark what they say of it in the declaration which they made at the assembly of <hi>Smalcald</hi> 1537. <hi>Besides, not only because the Pope is a party, but seeing hee hath already condemned our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine long before, hee is growne more suspicious. And who can doubt what judgement will passe upon our doctrine in his Councell? Yea more, hee confesseth that the cause of publishing the Councell is, that the new-sprung heresies may bee rooted out: 'Tis true, that may beare a larger construction; yet there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but he meanes of our doctrine, seeing it is scarce credible that hee should speake of his owne faults. And that it is so he hath published another Bull since, about the reformation of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein hee confesseth down-right without any flattery, that a Councell is called for the rooting out of the pestilent heresie of</hi> Luther. Seeing the case stood thus, they had beene mad to have put themselves upon that Councell, to abide the judgement of him who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them already. Considering withall that <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Bull, saith; how <hi>he hath caused their doctrine to bee pronounced hereticall by a conclave of Cardinals, and also by the Priours of the religious Orders, and by a pretty company of Divines and Doctors in both the Lawes.</hi> So that they had but even gone to be whipt, as <hi>Hosius</hi> of <hi>Corduba,</hi> to the Councell of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in case they should have refused to subscribe to the determination of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. It is a folly for a man to cast himselfe upon such disasters, and a peece of discretion to avoid them.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Maximus</hi> patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> would not be seene at the Councell of <hi>Antioch</hi>; because he foresaw that if he went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he should be constrained to subscribe to the deposall of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> for which he was never yet blamed by any body. To conclude this point, it is holden for a ruled case in law, that a judge who hath discovered his opinion already, may be refused; much more hee who hath passed the sentence before he be made judge. Adde we hereunto the mortall hatred of the Pope against Protestants; the Pope, I say, who calls the Councell, who summons none to judgement but his owne creatures, who must preceed there either in person or by his Legats, and must be supreme moderator and judge in all things. This point of the Popes enmity against protestants, and all those who have ridde themselves out of the Popes servitude, is so well knowne that it needs no proofe. <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> then a Catholique, laid open the hatred of the Pope against him and his subjects, as an excuse for not going to the Councell.<note place="margin">

               <p>THE hatred of the Pope towards the Protestants and the King of <hi>France,</hi> did shew it selfe so fully, before that it burst out into cruell warres.

There are Captaines which make but small reckoning of Cardinals and Prelates, when it is the Popes pleasure: And the Cardinals being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy possessed with this feare, are not in case to counsell what is true, but what will please. Nay there is not a man alive, but will take his oath without scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the place designed at <hi>Rome,</hi> is full of treacheries, and very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, both for those who called the Councell at <hi>Pisa,</hi> and all those that were present there. And we know nothing in all the world so certaine, but is lesse certaine than what wee said before. If then the comming into the City at this time, be generally reputed and esteemed to bee with the great hazard of the lives of the Fathers; this refusall ought not to bee offensive. For what man is hee (as <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth said) that will easily come before a judge guarded with a strong army? Who durst, or could bee thought to appeare willingly before him, and put himselfe into their clutches, whose violence he hath good reason to be afraid of? Which is a thing to be feared of right, and which we usually eschew, which reason enforceth us to doe, and which nature abhorreth. As for the Popes faire words in offering us safe conduct, and his promise to receive and intertaine us courteously, and lovingly, these will not serve either to remove, or lessen the just feares which possesse the minds of the Fathers. For what faith and promise can be made with more solemnity, than that of the Conclave, confirmed by vow and oath, and that in forme of a contract? Yet the late creation of Cardinals, whose liberties were not preserved, doth give sufficient testimony how it was kept. But suppose we were in hopes that his Holynesse will keepe his promise with an upright heart, without suffering himselfe to be transported either with hate or choler: how can the Fathers be assured in their hearts, when they looke backe upon things by-past, though his Holynesse should not be touched with indignation? Popes are men, and God saith, there are twelve houres of the day: Who will secure us against the infinite number of persons which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Pope? against the injuries and affronts of those lewd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which swarme in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>? The intolerable wrongs, the cruell insolencies, the horrid and unheard-of butchering, which some Fathers have suffered that followed the Court, are a sufficient <hi>item</hi> to us, and make us more wary. Not to goe far for examples, the Pope himselfe, when hee was but yet of an inferiour order, hath sufficiently instructed us, how far wee may rely upon the safe conducts of the Court; (from which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal) for he was wont to say, It is a great peece of folly to change life and liberty, with the skin of a dead beast: that is, with a parchment of safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. It will be hard for him to make others beleeve what himselfe was so resolute not to beleeve, and that for so long a time. Which indeed stands with good reason; for even <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth tels us, that no man is bound to put himselfe into the power of his enemy with letters of safe conduct. Hereupon the former Popes, after they had got Armies, Garisons, and Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels into <hi>Rome,</hi> were wont to assemble Councels in other places, rather than there. And if there be no more liberty allowed to the Senat, than what they now have, if the Popes doe not take another course of life and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than they doe, no man can ever thinke that in such kinde, of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall liberty as this, there is any fit and convenient place for receiving the Holy Ghost, who doth usually reside in free so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing then, that the King was lawfully cited upon those grounds by the Emperor, was he bound to come before a judge that was accompanied with a great army? one that hated and was incensed against the party summoned, as was said before? Was he bound to appeare in a populous place, of great strength, and which bore hatred towards him? who durst doe so? or by what r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This manner of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Councels with all freedome, is then mainly required when the number of beleevers on both sides is great, when the complaints are formall, and when there are some ancient opinions defended by whole Provinces and Nations.

For to have recourse to the rigour of the formalities and caltrops of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> is but for men to cosen themselves: the event hath proved the designe to bee naught. This Councell instead of appeasing the troubles did excite them; and inveno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med those mindes which were exulcerated before. In stead of setling the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and unity of the Church, it raised warres in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and in our <hi>France,</hi> not onely during the time of the sitting, but afterwards: and this is the reason why King <hi>Charles</hi> did earnestly sollicit the Fathers there by his Ambassadours to the embracing of peace. Marke what the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> sayes to them about it, in his learned Oration.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>The most Christian King, although hee be throughly perswaded of all these things, and expect nothing from us which may make against them: yet there are two things whereof he puts you in minde, out of the good will he beares towards the Synod, and the great vexation he endures by reason of these differences in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. First, that as much as we can we avoid all new controversies, that wee lay aside all uncouth and impertinent questions, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Wee must be farre from any desire of stirring up warres, that so they who have depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from us, and are cut off from the Church of God, may not thinke that this as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly was rather to raise up Princes in armes, and to enter leagues and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, though for a holy warre, than to procure a generall reconciliation of the mindes of all men. The other maine point of my ambassage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is, that which from the beginning was common to my master the most Christian King, with the most Illustrious the Emperour, and all other Kings and Princes who have their right honourable Ambassadors here present, is that you would in good earnest take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the reformation of manners<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and of the Ecclesiasticall discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 This demaund so affectionate, was never made but upon some ground. So then, there is good reason why this Councell should be suspected; and why the form which was observed in the judgement and decision of matters should be excepted against. For what hath beene said touching the Pope, doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concerne the Bishops, who were summoned to a reformation as well as he. That passage which we have now cited, is a sufficient proofe thereof, so that we need not produce any more. Consider the parties, the demands are mutuall, the actions double; the Pope complaines that the yoke of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is cast off, and impeacheth them of heresie that did it; so doe the Bishops. The Protestants accuse him of tyranny, usurpation, and errour; them of many vices and disorders: and both together of false doctrine: Who shall be judge herein? Surely neither the accusers, nor they that are accused; and the more they busie themselves to have the cognizance of it, the more suspected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusable they make themselves.</p>
               <p n="13">13 So then recourse must be had to that friendly way which we mentioned before; where if there be any proposall of using the extremity of justice, it is necessarily requisite the Laymen have a hand in it; else what for passion, what for fury, it is impossible to see any good end of it. Hence it is that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the Pope for excluding them out of the Councell. It is a thing which he could not doe of right, and that chiefly for two reasons. One, because that when it was first spoken of in the Diet at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> all the States of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> desired of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the sixth, that admittance might be granted as well to Lay men as Clergy men, and that not onely as witnesses and spectators, but to be Iudges there.<note place="margin">

But what is this I pray in comparison of that of <hi>Nice,</hi> where there were three hundred and eighteene Bishops? Or that of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where there were two hundred? that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where there were six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred? that of <hi>Constance,</hi> three hundred? that of <hi>Basil,</hi> where were above foure hundred Bishops, and others? The first at <hi>Constantinople</hi> was the thinnest, where there were onely a hundred and fifty Bishops; but the reason of that was, because at the same time there was another holden at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 We urge this of purpose that wee may serve our turne with that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayes; who would make us beleeve that the former Sessions of the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> are null and invalid, because that certaine schismaticall Bishops fell off there and were defaulty, because they sided with the factions of the two schismaticall Popes, these (as hee saith) made up two parts of the Church: howbeit in those very Sessions there were present two hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, divers Cardinals, the King of the <hi>Romanes</hi> in person, and sundry Princes and Ambassadors. Now by the same reason wee may lawfully say that the greatest part of the Church made default in this of <hi>Trent,</hi> yea &amp; that it was no better than a Conventicle, or at the best a National Councel. And indeed if we throughly reade the acts of this Councel, we shall find that the greatest part of the Bishops &amp; Ecclesiasticks that were there were either <hi>Italians</hi> or <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and that there was but a very slender number of other nations; and that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards the end. In all the Sessions under <hi>Paul</hi> the third wee finde but two <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and in some none at all. Insomuch as one of the Presidents of that Councell in a discourse of his in the last of those Sessions, said, <hi>That many Prelates are not yet come, who wee know very well are upon their journey,</hi> (saith he) <hi>and especially the devout and noble</hi> French <hi>Nation.</hi> They were not onely not come, but which is more, they came not at all, as appeares by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue annexed after that same Session. And after the death of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, the Councell was forthwith broken up, from the fourteenth of September 1547. till the first of May 1551. that it was set on foot againe and continued by virtue of the Bull of <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, under whom were holden six Sessions, and not a <hi>Frenchman</hi> assistant in any one of them, as appeares by the same

               <p n="4">4 As for the other Sessions under <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, from the 18 of Ianuary 1562, till the end of the Councell, the Bishops and other Ecclesiastiques of <hi>France</hi> were there indeed, howbeit no great store; as also the Ambassadours of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth. But marke what is urged, <hi>That which is invalid from the beginning, cannot be made valid by tract of time:</hi> the last Sessions could not legitimate the former, nor purge them of that vice which was inherent in them. We may adde moreover, that the same plea of enmity which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Protestants, holds good also for our Kings of <hi>France</hi>; inasmuch as Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third tooke part with the Emperour against King <hi>Francis</hi>; and <hi>Iulius</hi> the third with heart and good will made open warre upon <hi>Henry</hi> the second, declaring him to be his enemy; whereof he complaines in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned act of Protestation: as also that he sought peace and quietnesse by the Lord <hi>Tervie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Over and above all this, we will here adde the complaints that have been made of the inujust proceedings of that Councell. The Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in his letters written to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, May the third 1563, faith, <hi>Wee have with great griefe of heart been given to understand, that in this holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell things are not carried in that order and fashion as wee and all devout people could wish, and which the miserable state of the Christian common-wealth, and our distressed religion might justly require, which growes lesse and lesse every day; it being to be feared, that if convenient remedies bee not presently applyed, the issue of the Councell will bee such as will minister scandall and offence to all Christendome, and occasion of laughter to such as have cast off their obedience to your Holynesse, and the holy Apostolique See, and of maintaining with greater obstinacy than ever those severall opinions repugnant to our faith, which they have already embraced.</hi> And a little after; <hi>Alas, what a pitifull thing it is, that the Fathers and Doctours in the Councell should begin to abandon themselves to quarrels and contentions, to our great losse and discredit, and to the scorne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision of our adversaries?</hi>

                  <q>The twenty fourth of February, all the confederates made answer at large; which answere I would here set downe, if it were to any purpose. They talked much of the Councell, which they would have to be free, and that <hi>Luther</hi> forsooth and his companions, should have as much power and authority in it, if not more, as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>; although it bee directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the customes of antiquity. And this they said not without many bitter taunts of his Holynesse; saying, that he had broached, and at that present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a doctrine not only contrary to the word of God, but also to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers and Councels.</q>
And anon after,
<q>The last of February the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants made answer at large to the points proposed by <hi>Held,</hi> but I am loath to set them downe: The summe of all that they said, is in their answere to the Councell set forth by the Pope. For they plead, that the authority of judging belongs not only to the Pope &amp; the Bishops, but also to the Church, in which Kings and Princes are comprized. They might as well say, Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Catchpols; Druggists, Apothecaries, and such like. As if it belonged to Lay men, to a Cook, or, a Cowheard, to intermeddle with the questions and decrees of the Church.</q>

Nor hath he any thing to doe with the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>whose Edicts and commandements doe concerne him no more than any other Bishops.

Nor he, nor his are secured by safe conduct; and say he were, there are such apparent dangers, as it is not fitting hee should come there: for it is no new thing with the Popes to breake promise, and to staine and imbrue themselves with the bloud of innocents. And however other men may safely go thither, yet for his part he cannot, and that for reasons wel known: for the Pope layes snares for him, and hates him mortally, putting him out of favour with other King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as much as he can: and this for no other reason, but because hee hath ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the like. At this instant the Councell is prorogued till the first of November, without any mention where it shall be kept, and the fault is put upon the Prince of</hi> Mantua. <hi>Is not this to gull the world? the Prince of</hi> Mantua <hi>wrongs no body if he will not abandon his City to so great a multitude without a garrison: but all the blame should be laid upon the Pope, who doth not as yet goe roundly about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he remove the Councell to another place, he must take a City that belongs to some of his feudatary Princes, or else one of his owne: for he hath a goodly patrimony, with many faire Cities, gotten by his predecessors either by force or knavery, and now kept by him by the bad title of coven and fraud. Now seeing that almost every man of judgement doth despaire of ever seeing a true Councell, hee thinkes it most fitting that every Magistrate reforme religion amongst his owne people. If the Pope plead custome, that will not serve the turne; for, as Saint</hi> Cyprian <hi>saith, Custome without truth is but an inveterate and grounded errour. Therefore this is his advice, and this he thinkes the best course; but if any know a better he will readily embrace it.</hi>

The Catholiques that remained, being but a very few, were so scrupulous that they would have no communion with such as had received the Councell of <hi>Ariminum; Hilary</hi> on the other side thought it best to converse with them, and to call them to such Councels as were frequently holden in <hi>France</hi> upon such oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But what was the issue? <hi>Leo</hi> rejected and detested it, who had formerly approved it; hee beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged another of the Emperours, and obtained it, which was at last assembled at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> But to give a better lustre to this example, wee must see what <hi>Leo</hi> saith at first, and then we shall see what he said at last.<note place="margin">

Lastly, after many discourses upon this subject he concludes;</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>That the most experienced and wisest Catholiques thinke that the people who are puffed up with a desire of innovation cannot be kept in obedience to the See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique, nor diverted from a separation to which they are inclining, unlesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orders aud licence of preaching be conferred upon chast married men, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the liquorish custome of keeping Concubins; and also the use of both kinds be allowed to appease the minds of the incensed multitude.</hi> He goes yet further, and shewes that there is somewhat to bee reformed in matter of opinion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: which notwithstanding he will not meddle with, till such time as this entrance upon a reformation be brought to some issue; considering the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie he hath, least that designe might breed some trouble.
<q>But when this is done (saith he) it will be then full time, when all things shall bee at quiet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, to enter upon a more solid consideration of doctrines and opinions. Now what manner of consideration that must be, if it be for the good of the Catholique religion; my most Illustrious Prince is not peradventure the only man that knows; but is plainly perceived by the common voice, and that not to bee slighted of devout Catholiques concerning this point.

                     </gap>formation of the Head de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, but not obtained.</note> I will now shew you two things; First, that the Councell never touched upon most of them, and therefore there was a plaine denyall of justice: Next, that they are no new demands, being they were made and repeated divers times, in divers ages, and by divers men; to which we shall adde the severall complaints that have hereupon beene made by many good men, for the most part of the Clergy. The very same demands were also for the most part made by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and the rest that had relinquished their obedience to the Pope. But I will not speake a word of that; as I protest also that I will not use reasons of divinity to justifie them, nor authority of Fathers, but very seldome.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The first and principall, and that upon which many others depend (which we shall onely handle, not medling with the rest) is the reformation of the Head, that is the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was required by the Emperour <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and that in termes very respective; heare his owne words. <hi>First, that the supreme Bishop would be intreated to condescend that there might bee some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in himselfe and the Court of</hi> Rome. Conformable whereunto was the King of <hi>France</hi> his demand, for hee required in expresse termes that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might be reformed, with proffer of reforming those of his owne kingdome; besides, his Ambassadours had an expresse <hi>Mandamus</hi> to adhere unto such as should desire any reformation. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the sixth had professed also that it was very necessary, in regard of the great abuses and corruptions of that See. The Deputies of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third make all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses and maladies in the Church to be derived from thence. Those enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which were required to be reformed, were the cause of all the schisme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and divisions in those times; for thence grew the first originall of complaining; that was it that caused this Councell to be so desired and sought after.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Yet for all that the Fathers of that Councell would never touch upon it so much as with the tip of their finger. This is plaine from all the Acts and Decrees of it, as also from the oration which <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory, upon the confirmation of the Decrees of that Councell. <hi>Wee heartily thanke the Fathers</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in matters concerning the correction of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall discipline, and reformation of manners, they had so much respect unto our authority, and were so moderate on our behalfe, that if wee our selves would have beene our own reformers in what concernes us, and not have left all to the Fathers we should have beene more severe against our selves.</hi> Adding afterwards: <hi>If the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He sees well enough to what plight the Church of the holy Apostles, yea the whole Church of</hi> Christ <hi>is brought by the base gaine and filthy avarice of some of his predecessors; who sought that which was their own and not that which was</hi> Christs: <hi>how many men are gone away from it within these few yeeres, in so much that it is to be feared there will more goe yet, if hee doe not now at last apply some remedy, after much delay of salving those sores wherewith the Church is oppressed; which delay, the longer it is, the more chargeable it will be. The principall cause of these so long stirres, is, because for so many yeeres no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is altered, nothing amended: and that which cuts off all hope of reformation, is, that they would see a reformation in all the rest of the body of the Church, who have suffered for so many hundred yeeres together that City wherein they have both meere and mixt power and jurisdiction to bee the most deformed of all. For what excuse can they alledge, or what can they invent either true or likely, they to whom neither King nor Emperour, people nor Clergy, not a Generall Councell, no nor the whole Church must say so much as, Why doe you so? What pretence, I say, can they have for delaying so long to reforme them and theirs? For where shall wee finde under the Sunne greater licentiousnesse in all evill, greater outcries, greater impunity, I had almost said infamy and impudence? Without doubt such and so great it is, that none will beleeve it but he that hath seene it; none will deny it, but they that have not seene it.</hi>

But they knew well enough how to take order with it afterwards, by meanes of the Councels of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> who have given them the upper hand, and shamefully sold the liberty of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Cardinal <hi>Cusan</hi> speaks of this matter more at large:
<q>The Pope (saith he) hath hooked unto himself so much money by investitures,<note place="margin">

All the care is of the temporall, none of the spirituall. That was not the meaning of the Emperours; they never intended that the spirituals should bee swallowed up by the temporals, which were bestowed on Churches for their augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>
And presently after;
<q>The Court ingrosseth unto it selfe all the best and the fattest; and that which the Empire hath set apart and ordained onely for the service of God and the publique good, by pretended reasons and new inventions is diverted another way, since lust and avarice have so seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that what was Imperiall is now made Papall, and the spiritual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</q>

Whence it followes, that the cause of this suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ceasing, the effect should cease likewise; and that therefore we are under the Ordinance of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which was just and good: to the observation whereof we ought the rather to bee inclined, in as much as wee understand by the testimony of the Court of Parliament, and the accounts hereupon made by it unto <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11: that by reason of Vacancies, Expectatives, and such like meanes, there goes almost a million of crownes from hence to <hi>Rome</hi> every yeere. Which is further confirmed by the testimony of the Ambassadours of the Archbishop of <hi>Magdenburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who was present at the Councell of <hi>Basil,</hi> who hath left upon record, that he learned from the Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> then living; that during the Popedome of <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, who sate 14 yeeres, there were carried to <hi>Rome</hi> out of this Realme of <hi>France</hi> only, nine millions of Crownes, without reckoning what was brought in by the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of inferiour quality.</p>
               <p n="25">25 It is reported by an English Historian, that <hi>Henry</hi> the 3 King of <hi>England</hi> in the yeere 1245, caused an estimate to be taken of the pure rents which the Pope had out of his Kingdome, and that it was found they amounted to as great a summe of money, as all that he himselfe received out of his Realme, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoning divers other commodities beside. The like is affirmed by all <hi>England</hi> together in an epistle sent to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4. where it is said, <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more pure rents out of</hi> England, <hi>than the King himselfe, who is the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the Church, and the governour of the Kingdome.</hi> And hereupon the the transporting of gold or silver to <hi>Rome</hi> was forbidden in this Kingdome by many good Statutes made at severall times. Saint <hi>Lewes,</hi> who amongst divers others made one hereabouts expresly forbidding all such exactions, was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse Canonized for a Saint. King <hi>Charles</hi> the 6, <hi>Henry</hi> the 2, <hi>Charles</hi> the 9, and others, were never thought the lesse Catholique for this; nor the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>France</hi> that demanded it in their Councels of State, ever reputed the lesse zealous in Religion.

Now these ancient Canons bind the Pope, as well as other Bishops; and you shall finde no exception for him there; but our Councell had no leasure to thinke of this. I could here make a large discourse of the Reservations of Bishopriques, and other dignities, and benefices Ecclesiasticall: of the granting out of Graces, and the next voydance of benefices; of mandats of provision, and other wayes which the Popes have used and doe use to this day, to enhanse their revenues. The Ordinances of our Kings, are full fraught with complaints made, concerning this particular; as are also the works of divers authors. All those that ever medled with reformation, put alwayes up some Articles about this point: The deputies of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, have a whole Chapter of it in their Councell. The Councell of <hi>Basil,</hi> and the Pragmatique Sanction hath condemned them: The King of <hi>France</hi> desired the like in his demands: Yea, and the Councell it selfe hath taken an order with them, but it is with reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Popes authority above all; which is as much as to put a gull up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Christendome, seeing the reformation in this case was demanded onely against him, inasmuch as he is the man from whence all the disorder proceeds. And after this, all that are acquainted with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> doe very well know, and can testifie, how the Pope doth still practise these meanes, and whether all the decrees of this Councell have debarred him of dispensing his favours.</p>

It was demanded under colour of defending the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; for when it was supposed that</hi> Selim <hi>Emperour of the</hi> Turks, <hi>having conquered the</hi> Sultan <hi>of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and put him to an ignominious death would bend his forces against</hi> Italy: <hi>the Pope in the last act of the</hi> Lateran <hi>Councell, treated with the Fathers there, to have the tenth of their benefices for three yeers, to defend the sea coast, and fortifie the passage against the enemy to the utmost of his ability. This was denyed him by divers, who thought it very hard to see their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings overcharged in that kinde, contrary to the decrees of other Councels, and the constitutions of the Popes; especially seeing Christian Princes, to whom the frontiers belonged, were not mustering any armies nor made any semblance of war. The Pope on the otherside maintained, that there was the like necessitie now as at the Councell of</hi> Constance <hi>under</hi> Martin <hi>the fifth. For what greater cause could there be to move them, than the preparations of the publique enemy of Christianity for the invading of</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Rome? <hi>The Clergy of</hi> Aragon, (<hi>who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened by the Bishop of</hi> Saragossa <hi>the Kings Lievetenant there, and liberty which all in that Kingdome enjoy</hi>) <hi>at their meetings in provinciall Synods, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to deny the payment of those tenths. But forasmuch as it neerly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to take the authority of the Archbishop of</hi> Toledo <hi>along with them, who was in great account with the Pope; aswell the Bishop of</hi> Saragossa <hi>as the other Bishops of</hi> Aragon <hi>intreated him by letters to undertake the cause of the Clergy, and that he would not suffer, being such a potent man in the Province as he was, (wherein he outwent all his Predecessours) the immunities of the Clergy to bee so farre prejudiced.</hi> Ximenius, <hi>who had taken order that it should not be put in execution in</hi> Castile, <hi>answered them courteously and with all mildnesse, promising them that he would doe whatsoever lay in his power, for the preservation of their Ecclesiasticall liberty. But in the mean time he advised them to dissolve their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and expect in patience what would be the event of things; that he would treat with the Pope and the Emperour</hi> Charles <hi>hereabout, and that he hoped the issue would be to their content. Whereupon he thought fit in the first place to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Emperour, to whom he writ his advice to this effect; That seeing the Clergy of</hi> Aragon <hi>had begunne to oppose by calling of Synods, that ours may have the like assemblies, to examine the grounds of these exactions, and try whether that were true which the Pope alledged or no; providing that in imitation of the Kings of</hi> Spaine, <hi>the Clergy did not meet to determine such controversies else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than in the Kings Court. On the other side he writ to</hi> Arteaga <hi>his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour at</hi> Rome, <hi>to goe and greet the Pope with all reverence, and offer unto him in his name, not only the tenths of his Dioces, but even all the commodity, all the moveables of the Churches, all the gold and silver coyned or uncoyned, which could

And there was besides a Bull of the Popes shewed to the Proctour, which was shortly to bee published, which concerned the Act of the</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran <hi>Councell. Yet</hi> Ximenius, <hi>so soone as hee understood all these passages from</hi> Arteaga, <hi>did not let for all that to call the Clergy together, who met all at</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, <hi>a little before hee went to</hi> Tourverte. <hi>For</hi> Peter Martyr <hi>who was present at that Synod, as Proctour of the Church of</hi> Granada (<hi>as appeares by his epistles</hi>) <hi>declares how that it was adjudged by common consent to deny that tenth; which consultation was commended by the Archbishop of</hi> Toledo, <hi>promising to patronize and defend it if need required. It is also plaine, out of the Epistles of</hi> Bembus <hi>set out under the name of</hi> Leo, <hi>that this tenth was really exacted, and that it was no flying rumour or opinion.

O sacred Clergy, all Secular authority is but a toy in comparison of thine; seeing that as all power is given to Christ both in heaven and in earth, so Christ hath bequeathed all to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his successours: So that <hi>Constantine</hi> gave nothing to Pope <hi>Sylvester,</hi> which was not originally his owne, but only restored unto him what he injustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from him. Againe, as there is no power but is of God, so there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing temporall or spirituall, Imperiall or Regall, which is not of the Pope, upon whose thigh God hath writ, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> So as to dispute his power is a kinde of sacriledge. To whom no man may say, Why doe you so? although he should exchange, purloine, of sell all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, the goods, lands, and lordships of the Church. Let me be a lyar if all these things are not written by such as seeme to bee wise men in their eyes, and if they have not beene beleeved also by some Popes.</q>

Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first, in an Epistle to the Emperour <hi>Michael,</hi> saith, <hi>It is evident that the Pope was called God by the devout Prince</hi> Constance; <hi>and it is a plaine case that God cannot be judged by man.</hi> The Glosse would have this honour communicated to other Bishops, who (it saith) are called Gods likewise: But there be other interpreters who informe us, that it is peculiar to the Pope only, and that the title is not given unto him as unto others by way of hyperbole, but that he is a God indeed.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>Augustin Steucheus,</hi> the Popes Library-keeper, <hi>Knowest thou not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> Constantine <hi>called the Pope God, and accounted him so to be? So hee did when he honoured him with that goodly Edict, hee worshipped him as a God.</hi> And yet <hi>Constantine</hi> spake of Bishops in general, for it was at the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and not at the time of that pretended donation which never was made.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Elsewhere it is said,
<q>That the Pope is equall to God: That there can be no appeall from him to God: That he is God upon earth: That as God he can judge of the verity of the fact, and according to conscience: That he is never supposed to judge otherwise than God himselfe: That God and he have one and the same Consistory: That he can determine against the law of Nature, the law of Nations, and the law of God with reason; yea that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee can make expositions and limitations against the law of Nature, of Nations, and of God, with reason or without reason: That he must bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved upon his bare word, even to the prejudice of another: That if hee preferre an unworthy person, it is to bee thought hee dispenseth with him: That hee can make something of nothing: That he can go against all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Statutes: That he can make wrong to be right: That hee can doe any thing beside law, above law, against law: To whom no man may say, Why doe you so? Whose pleasure stands for reason: Whose power may not be disputed, without incurring the crime of sacriledge, forasmuch as he is the cause of causes, and the just cause; and for that it is to bee presumed that whatsoever pleaseth him is just and reasonable.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 Divine honours have also beene ascribed unto him: for it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and prescribed in the Ceremoniall,
<q>That all persons of what digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or degree soever, when they come before the Pope shall bow the knee thrice before him at a certaine distance, and kisse his feet.</q>

<q>What thinke you (Reverend Fathers) who that should bee that is seated in the highest place, who glisters with a garment of gold and purple, I say, who thinke you that should be? if he be without charity, and be puffed up and exalted onely for his knowledge, then hee is Antichrist sitting in the Temple of God, and carrying himselfe as God: but if he bee neither groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Charity, nor exalted in knowledge, he is like an image, like an idoll in the Church of God.</q>

Besides, there is matter of admiration for other Princes and people, who may demand what place of Scripture, or what exposition makes them subject to the jurisdiction of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and exempts the King of <hi>France?</hi> Or why some are more bound to beleeve upon paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation than others? For this being like a fiction, hath been deservedly much derided, and is yet; as proceeding from the ambition of them that vent such things, and the earnest desire of reigning over Secular Princes, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the most illustrious King of <hi>France.</hi>

<q>The greatnesse, excellency, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and necessity of the Popedome is seene in this, that (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher testifies) the world could not bee governed if there were not some supreame principality in it.

And againe,
<q>There can bee no true nor right Common-wealth, if there bee not one above all the rest to guide and governe them.</q>
Which is the Pope the Vicar of the immortall God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ascribes unto him a commutative and distributive justice over the universall world; and speaking of this last, hee saith, that being exercised by him, <hi>it doth institute and ordaine dignities, principalities, Kingdomes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires according to merits, and transferre them from one Nation to another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerits.</hi>

                  <q>Now that the Empire (saith he) depends principally and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon God, as well as the Church or Ecclesiasticall power, is manifest by evident reasons. It is further confirmed by that Decree, where the Pope writes to the Emperour, My Church over which our God hath ordained my Priesthood, while you governe humane affaires, &amp;c: It is proved also by divers testimonies out of the Law. Whence it followes, that they talke sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and soothingly, who say that the Pope or the Church hath two swords, the spirituall and the temporall: whereas it is said in the Gospel, Put up thy sword into thy sheath: For if both the swords were in the Popes power, the Emperour, or the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> should have that title falsely and vainly given unto him. But these flatterers by such like words and writings, breed a great errour over all Christendome, and raise as it were a continuall emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or contention betwixt the Pope and the Emperour. For by this meanes the Imperiall authority is trampled under foot, and his power called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to the great dammage of the whole Common-wealth.</q>

                  </gap> plaine out of the letters of that Councell, written to the Emperours, the words are these; Celestine <hi>the most holy Bishop of Great</hi> Rome, <hi>had signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the judgement which was past by him and his before any Synod was assembled at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>and intrusted in his stead</hi> Cyrill <hi>the most holy and religious Bishop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>with the putting of that in execution which was determined at</hi> Rome. So then hee was not sent by the Pope to supply his place at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which is properly to bee a Legate. Nor had hee any expresse charge from the Pope to supply his place in that Councel, for there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of any such command. Wee conclude therefore that it cannot bee inferred from thence, that there was any particular consent of the Pope in the calling of that Councell.

               <p n="14">14 This notwithstanding <hi>Bellarmine</hi> urgeth some authours for proofe of his assertion, namely <hi>Evagrius, Photius,</hi> and <hi>Celestine</hi> himselfe in his Epistle. They all say that <hi>Celestine</hi> by his letters did substitute <hi>Cyrill</hi> in his place. It is true; but it is true withall, that when those letters were written he spoke not of the Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but of that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was holden by <hi>Cyrill.</hi> Besides, the Pope sent his Legats to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in number three to supply his place; which he would never have done if hee had taken <hi>Cyrill</hi> to have been there in his stead. It is true moreover, that <hi>Cyrill,</hi> who would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever dare call in question, and publiquely dispute those things which have beene once judged and well determined, hee wrongs the reverend Synod: forasmuch as those things which were agreed upon concerning the Christian faith, by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy assembled in</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>by our command were determined according to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall expositions, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> saith, <hi>The fourth Synod of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>consisting of six hundred and thirty Bishops, was holden by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of Pope</hi> Leo, <hi>and the command of the Emperour</hi> Martian. No body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes but that Councell was assembled by the industry of <hi>Leo,</hi> who was a sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter for it; but those Emperours were so farre from desiring his authority and consent, that on the contrary hee used earnest prayers to <hi>Theodosius</hi> for the obtaining of the Councell; bestowing tears to that end, which hee said were shed for his Clergy: using withall another mans favour in his suit.</p>
               <p n="27">27 After the death of <hi>Theodosius, Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Martian</hi> were more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto him: they granted him a Councell after they were petitioned by his Ambassadours. <hi>Martian</hi> writ a very honest letter unto him, wherof <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> now serves himself to prove that the Popes consent is requisite to the calling of Councels,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The Emperour</hi> (saith hee) <hi>intreats the Pope to come and hold the Councell.</hi> There is no such intreaty, but only these words, <hi>It remaines, that, if it please your Holynesse to come into those parts to celebrate the Councell, you would be pleased to doe so out of religious affection.</hi> The Pope by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by his Legats desired two things; that a Councell might be kept, and that it might bee in <hi>Italy</hi>: the first he obtained, the second was denyed him. True it is that <hi>Martian</hi> qualified the denyall with faire words, as that, <hi>If hee would not be present at it, hee would tell them so, to the end that they might call the Bishops unto that place which should be pitcht upon, to provide for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion, and the Catholique faith, by their decision; as your Holynesse shall determine according to Ecclesiasticall constitutions.</hi> I finde no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the calling of it, but such as stands with a petitioner. Indeed seeing he desired it, and that in such manner as we have said, it follows that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto it; but diverse other Bishops have the same plea that he hath, in asmuch as divers times they became petitioners to the Emperours for the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Councels.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> urgeth a letter written by certaine Bishops of <hi>Bursia,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they say, <hi>That many holy Bishops are assembled in</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>by the command of Pope</hi> Leo. But it is a hard case that he would rather trust those poore <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus's</hi> whom the distance of place and inexperience of affaires doth in some sort excuse, than the truth of the Acts. Considering withall that these Bishops speake more in this point than hee would have them; for he standeth only for the Popes consent, and they ascribe unto him the command. Why doth not hee speake as they doe? If they be mistaken in the command why should we beleeve them about the consent? especially seeing they never speake of it?</p>
               <p n="29">29 Afterwards he descends to domestique testimonies; as to Pope <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> his Epistle to the <hi>Dardan</hi> Bishops: where he saith, <hi>That the Apostolique See by her sole authority, decreed that the Councell of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>should bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> Decreed it indeed, but with prayers, intreaties, and teares, with much passionate importunity to the Emperours.

<q>That the Easterne Bishops lay the blame of their absence from the Councell of <hi>Sardis</hi> upon Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> because the time allotted them for their comming was too short.</q>
Whence it follows (saith hee) that the Councell was not called by the Emperour alone, but by Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> also, yea and that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by him. But hee mistakes himselfe in his inference; Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> was deeply ingaged for <hi>Athanasius,</hi> hee had written in his behalfe certaine angry letters to the Orientall Bishops assembled at <hi>Antioch</hi>; gaining nothing at their hands, hee addressed himselfe to the Emperour <hi>Constans,</hi> and perswaded him to write to his brother <hi>Constantius,</hi> to send certaine Bishops to <hi>Rome</hi> to answer for their rejection of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi>: Lastly, after some other accidents which befell about that point, it was decreed by the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the two Emperours, that the Bishops of both sides should meet at a day appointed in <hi>Sardis,</hi> a City of <hi>Illyrium.</hi>

                  <hi>The Emperours when they called Councels, summoned all other Bishops by way of Edict and command: but for the Pope they intreated him, that if hee pleased, hee would vouchsafe to come thither.</hi> I never saw so many fine devises.

               <p n="3">3 Yet still this makes the validity of these Councels to depend upon the Popes authority: And Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> is in the same tune, saying, <hi>That it is not lawfull to assemble any particular Councell; nor was it ever permitted so to doe: but when any question was to bee resolved either touching some doubtfull passages in Generall Councels, or touching salvation, recourse was wont to bee had unto the See Apostolique.</hi> The severall Acts of Councels both Provinciall, nationall, and Generall holden in divers Countries, may easily convince these domestique testimonies of falsity: in asmuch as it is plainly evident from them that those Councels were holden without the presence, authority, or consent of the Popes; and yet withall they made some Canons whereof the Popes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards served themselves; and were well content they should be enrolled in their books.</p>

                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> the third saith,
<q>
                     <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour hath called a Councel by authority from us.</q>
So Pope <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> the first affirme, <hi>That Councels cannot bee holden without the authority of the See of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As for <hi>Pelagius</hi> wee must tell him by his good leave, that it is not true which hee saith; and desire him to answer all the fore-cited authorities. And for Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> if the will may passe for the deed, it was hee that called the Councell indeed: for I doubt not but hee was as greedy of arrogating this to himselfe, as the presidency, for which hee was at daggers drawing with <hi>Dios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus,</hi> who, as hee said, had cozened him of it underhand. But it may be hee goes not so farre as some would beare us in hand: for he meanes onely of a Generall Councell of all the Bishops of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but not of all Christendome. The entire passage, which is mangled and cited by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is (as wee have formerly alledged it) conceived in these termes, <hi>Wee have sent out our letters to our brethren and fellow-Bishops of</hi> Tarraco, Carthagena, Portugall, <hi>and</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, <hi>and have summoned them to a Generall Councell.</hi> And it seemes he much distrusted his owne power; for hee addes, <hi>But if any thing hinder the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Generall Councell, (which God forbid) yet at least let the Clergy of</hi> Gallicia <hi>assemble themselves.</hi> Now he that should grant the Pope this power of calling a Councell of the Bishops of <hi>Spaine,</hi> should give him onely the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Patriarch in the West: but not in <hi>Africk,</hi> nor in the East.

But we finde no such matter in the Acts and Decrees of the Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> Nor is it likely it should herein give any advantage to the Pope, seeing that in the sixth and seventh Canons, by limiting his power and jurisdiction, it makes him equall to other Patriarchs. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>irmeth to have beene made by the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> must bee referred to that which is ordained in the sixth Canon: Where it is said, <hi>That it is a plaine case, that if any bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Bishop without the opinion and advise of the Metropolitan, hee ought not to bee acknowledged for such.</hi> For this ought to bee extended to all things which are treated of by an assembly of Bishops: So <hi>Balsamon</hi> expounds it, who after hee had said, <hi>Forasmuch as the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>is Patriarch of the Westerne Provinces,</hi> hee addes, <hi>The Canons meane that Patriarches should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Metropolitans, and Metropolitans above Bishops; to the intent that no matter of moment and importance bee done by the Bishops without them.</hi> Now the Pope gaines nothing by all this, for any Patriarch may serve himselfe of this Canon, and apply it to his owne cause. So likewise it is probable that the old Canon which was made hereabout, spoke not of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, but had reference to all the other Patriarches and Metropolitans; and that Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> being the first that complained of the breach of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that Canon as if it had beene particularly in favour of himselfe, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it was conceived in generall termes.

The question is, <hi>Whether the Pope ought to call Councels, or no:</hi> we finde by practice that the Popes did not call them, but the Emperours; and that they did so constantly, the Popes seeing and knowing as much; that they themselves have beene petitioners to the Emperours to get them called; that they have

               <p n="19">19 We will adde furthermore, that the Popes never complained of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours for taking upon them that power of Convocation; which doubtlesse they would have done, if it had belonged to them of right; for they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes observed that rule to a haire. <hi>De vigilantibus non dor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Platina</hi> saith that Pope held a Councell of nine hundred Bishops to consult about the sending of succours into the holy Land.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when the Synod cryed with one voice, That they would stand to that definition of faith which had beene rehearsed, the Iudges contradicted it, saying, that it was defective, and that it was requisite to adde something to it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> which was the cause why they met in the Oratory of St. <hi>Euphemia,</hi> where the forme of faith was drawne, as hath been said. I will transcribe the whole passage:</p>

The most magnificent and Right honourable Iudges said,</hi> Dioscorus <hi>did say, I admit that of two natures.

Which of the two doe you follow? Whether holy</hi> Leo, <hi>or</hi> Dioscorus? <hi>The right reverend Bishops shouted, Wee beleeve as</hi> Leo <hi>beleeved, those that doe otherwise are</hi> Eutychians. Leo <hi>hath well expounded it. The most magnificent and Right honourable Iudges said. So then you adde to the rule of faith, according to our holy father</hi> Leo's <hi>opinion, that there are two living natures in Christ, inconvertibly, inseparably, and inconfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly. And these Right honourable Iudges, being entreated thereunto by all the rest, went into the Oratory of St.</hi> Euphemia, <hi>together with</hi> Anatolius, &amp;c. And after they had <hi>treated of the holy faith, they came forth, and all sate downe.</hi> And the copy of their determination was read by the appointment of the Iudges, as wee said before.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now if wee shall make it yet appeare that the Iudges opinion was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and that addition which they insisted upon was admitted.

Where it is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that in Councels ordinarily, the Legats and Vicegerents tooke the same place of honour that belonged unto him that sent them. And of a truth in the Acts of this same Councell, there is one <hi>Peter</hi> a Priest and Monke, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria's</hi> Legat, placed betwixt the Patriarches of <hi>Constantinople</hi> &amp; <hi>Antioch:</hi> and another Priest and Monke called <hi>George,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem's</hi> Legat, put between the same Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> and the other Bishops.

               <head>CHAP. XII. That the Pope did not preside in Generall Councels.</head>
               <p n="1">1 HAving proved already that the Presidence in Councels belongs to Emperours and Kings, it is good to inferre, therefore there is no reason the Pope should arrogate it unto himselfe exclusively to all others: and that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> is by good right rejected in <hi>France,</hi> because hee tooke upon him to authorize it. The Pope may yet pretend that this right belongs unto him, at least by way of concurrence with others. Hee would make us beleeve upon <hi>Bellarmines</hi> word, that by meanes of his Legats hee alwaies presided in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels. Wee have made it appeare that it is not so. Hee may say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance that at least hee presided in many of them. Let us now prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; which will be an easie matter to doe. Wee have already shewed that <hi>Constantine</hi> was President in that of <hi>Nice. Bellarmine</hi> saith it was the Popes Legats, who were in number three, and amongst them <hi>Hosius</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was one. Marke his reasons: <hi>They all three</hi> (saith he) <hi>subscribed first.</hi> True, but not in the quality of Presidents, (they never say so) but as supplying his place to whom the first ranke of honour amongst the rest of the Patriarches doth belong. And to prevent a reply, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> saith the same <hi>Hosius,</hi> was President of the Councell of <hi>Sardis</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Sardicens. ad sin.</hi>
                  </note> and yet we find one and twenty, or more that subscrib'd before him. This is ordinary in all the ancient Councels, that hee who was most eminent in Ecclesiastical dignity subscribed first, not he that presided.

               <p n="4">4 It is also agreed upon that the Pope did not preside at the second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, which was holden at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> neither in person, nor by his Legats.

Hee excuseth the Pope for not being present at that Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> We admit of his excuse, but we intreat him withall to beleeve, that though hee had beene there hee should not have presided, unlesse it had beene the Emperours pleasure. For whereas hee saith, the Bishops of that Councell doe by their letters acknowledge the Pope for their head, and call themselves his members; we deny that it is ought so. They doe not direct their letters to the Pope, but to the Councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had writ unto them, and whereto they returne an answer.

               <p n="5">5 <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludes, that <hi>Nectarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in the Popes absence. But I doubt of that, for I have read in <hi>Theodoret,</hi>

                  </gap>xt is that the Pope would never condescend to assist at that Councell, though (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from these very passages) hee was entreated thereunto both by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and all the Bishops therein. In briefe, hee desired alwayes to act his pageant apart, and would not entermedle himselfe among the Easterne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Wherefore nothing can be collected hence which makes for the Popes advantage. But on the contrary, whosoever shall read all the acts of that Councell, will finde it is a thing much redounding to his disgrace; that hee should be resident in the same Citie after a Councell was there assembled, and being requested to goe to it to treat of points of great importance, that hee should refuse to communicate with his brethren and fellow-Bishops, as it is related in the very Acts. And without doubt this is a mighty breach in his universality; especially seeing he excuseth himselfe for not comming into the Councell, because he had but a few Western Bishops with him: for he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confesseth he had no great authority over the rest: Yea it is one of the strongest arguments that can be brought to prove that the presidence in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels belonged not to him; it being very probable that if so, he would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne comming thither: Which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his workes doth not greatly dissemble.</p>

               <p n="13">13 As for the eighth General holden at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> I professe the Popes Legats presided there: onely I entreat the reader to observe in his perusall of the Acts, in what manner they make their Presidence passe for good; they take good heed of not forgetting that title as in the former; and it is credible they would have beene as carefull then, if it had beene in their power. In the first place they produce their commissions and instructions, wherby they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Pope to preside there: they met with such Emperours as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that is, so honest and respective, that they not only yeelded the Presidence to them, but (which is worse) they would not signe the Acts till after the Bishops and Delegates; as is testified in their subscriptions. Certaine Princes and Lords, which assisted at that Synod by the Emperours command, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so so milde and courteous, in imitating their maisters example, that the Popes Legats having requested them to put some interrogatories to certain men who were come into the Councell concerning a petition pref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that we need not marvaile that he did such an ill office to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his Councell of <hi>Francfort,</hi> considering he did not vouchsafe to devolve the presidence upon him.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Now we affirme yet for all this that this courtesie ought not to be drawn into an argument: that the Emperours might well prejudice themselves thus, but not their successors.

Wherefore wee the Legats and Presidents conclude this holy Councell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and desire the confirmation of it from our holy father, in as earnest manner as is possible.</hi> That which is spoken here of those <hi>three</hi> is razed out of all the Latine copies which were printed since. It is a losse that the names of those honest men who were of that sound judgement, are not knowne.</p>
               <p n="2">2 See here a Decree which doth not a little enhanse the power of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Popes heretofore cryed most stoutly, that it belong'd to them to authorize and confirme Councels: yet for all that no body beleeved them. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell states the question, and will not have any to make a scruple of it hereafter. So that if the pope thinke good, it is a thing done to his hand, there needs no more talking of it. As for the Emperour and Kings and Princes, and all other persons whatsoever, no matter for them: they have no more to do but receive what shall be sent them, to execute what shall bee enjoyn'd them, without making any bones of it, referring themselves in all things wholly to another mans trust.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And the worst of all is, that by assembling this power of confirmation, the Pope pretends to bee above the Councell.<note place="margin">

To repell this errour wee shall prove three things. 1 That in the approving of Councels the Popes have no more authority than other men. 2 That the approbation of them made by them in times past, hath not wonne them any supreme authoritie over Councels. 3 That for point of approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Emperours and Kings had anciently more power than they.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For proofe of the first, wee say that anciently after the celebration of Councels, the Synodicall fathers, as also the Emperours were wont to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice unto those that were absent, and to the Provinces, of such things as had bin determined in them, to the end that they might conforme and give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto them; yet so as there can bee nothing observed which makes for the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular.

               <p n="11">11 Tenthly, Because they suffered, that the Popes which reigned during the time that they were assembled together in Councell, inserted in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of their Legats; namely the power of derogating from General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</p>

Hence then we with good consequence conclude, that they gave the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over Councels: which was never done before, save onely in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Conventicle: and it will never appear that the former Councels gave any such advantages to the Popes in any of these cases here specified.</p>

               <p n="15">15 Shall wee now say this was a free Councell, and that it had authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Pope, being so rudely curb'd and check'd by him, and that in such harsh termes? All which (as this is it betrayes the naked truth of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are registred in the Acts of the Councell. Now all these forementioned clauses deserve to bee paralleld with those in the Bull of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, whereby he decreed the translation of the Councell of <hi>Basil,</hi> and which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such a deal of tragedies, to the confusion of that great Pope, to see if there bee any thing in it, wherewith those fathers of <hi>Basil</hi> might be more justly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended than ours of <hi>Trent</hi> were.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that translation, and without any regard of it the Councell held on at <hi>Basil</hi>: yea and medled with businesse without waiting for the arrivall of the Popes Legat.

The next year after when the Councel had notice of the Popes intention, which was to dissolve the Councell by meanes of this translation, they sent to intreat him that he would not doe it, and at the very same time fix'd upon this resolution, not to suffer it: this was consulted upon the same yeare, one thousand foure hundred thirty two, as the Acts relate it in the fourth Session.

               <p n="21">21 As for the Popes authority, which is alwayes reserved in all the Decrees of this Councell, it is as extraordinary a clause as can bee imagined.

Which is no generall priviledge comprehending any authoritie over Councels: but onely a prerogative in that point which concerned the Bishops condemnation, to the intent that the processe might be revised by his authoritie, according to the Decree of the Councell of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> So likewise the first Councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> did Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> the honour to referre <hi>Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> his cause to his judgement, and that for the reason which we elsewhere relate. But all this was done out of a prerogative of honour, not out of any acknowledgement of the Popes superioritie over a Councell: for it can never bee found that other Councels reserved the Popes authoritie over their Decrees.</p>

There was no need of staying such a while at <hi>Trent</hi> to make up so many Decrees, if they must afterwards send them to the Pope to cancell. For it is well knowne hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth with them sufficiently himselfe, so as there is no necessitie of enlarging his power any further. They might have done better to have referred all to his discretion at first, to clip and stitch them up at his pleasure. The expences of so many armies might have been spared. But see here a thing worth your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation: All the Princes and people of Christendome grone after a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church: cry out that it must begin at the head, &amp; from thence descend to the members: The instructions given to the Ambassadours of the Emperor, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and all <hi>Germany</hi> are charged with it. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth it by his Legat in the Diet of <hi>Noremberg.</hi> And yet for all this in stead of a pastorall staffe which hee had before, they give him a club, a two edged sword. In stead of reforming the abuses, they foment them: in stead of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating them, they increase them. Let us now prosecute the other points.</p>
               <p n="24">24 The Councell referres the exposition and declaration of such doubts and controversies as may arise about it solely and wholly to the Pope. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we reply, that if they bee pettie doubts they should as well bee resolv'd by other Bishops as by him, seeing they are all expositours of Gods law, which hath at least as much authoritie as the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> And therefore by consequent the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> derogates from their authoritie, in ascribing that to the Pope alone which belongs unto them all.

Why all this? if not to chuse the times and seasons of purpose to dispose persons to their desire, to alter their mindes, to breake off the good designes of such as laboured a reformation, to imploy them upon businesse, to stirre up troubles, and put all things in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that so they might reigne more powerfully, and bring all things under their Empire?</p>

                  </gap>; it is an unusuall thing in all companies and congregations (supreme Monarchies one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) that the Head should have more power than all the body. Hee may doe much when hee is joyned with it: but by himselfe if hee doe ought which doth not proceed well, it belongs to his body to take order with it, to take him under their cognizance, to judge of his proceedings, and of appeals from him, and such like matters. Otherwise the inconveniences are too great when a ministeriall Head hath absolute authoritie. If he be unjust, perfidious, wicked, corrupt, abominable, impious, tyrannicall, inhumane: wee must have patience and submit our selves to all, there being no other remedie, but prayers and teares, to which alone these honest Doctors bid us have recourse.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For another reason; what good will it doe us to have Councels hereafter, to what end shall wee use them, if they depend entirely upon the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? if hee alone may alter all in an instant, make new Canons and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and no body can say to him, Why dost thou so?</p>
               <p n="3">3 Lastly, what a misery, or rather what an abuse is this, that the name of the Church should bee confin'd to one man? that so many goodly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and prerogatives as are ascribed to it, should agree properly to the Pope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I desire all good Catholiques to take notice of this, and to open their eyes that from henceforth they may discerne these illusions.

For us, it were not sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that we should judge, as having no commission so to doe by authority from the Synod.</hi> To this it is said in the Popes defence, that if he would have judged of this case, he might have done so. That's true, he being so fairely invited to it. But it must be granted too, that if he had not beene intreated to it by those to whom that charge was committed by the Councel, he could not have done it. Now it was wisely done of him not to meddle in it, being he had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, for in case either the defendant, or the plaintives should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Councell of his judgement, he could not have stood to it. Hee addes that hee would have beene willing to have passed his sentence of it, if the Councell had beene then assembled. Which must bee understood in case hee had been required, or appointed by the Synod so to doe. For otherwise what greater power could he have during the sitting of the Councell then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. To say that hee would not meddle with it, for feare lest he might seeme to wrong the Councell, by reason of that deputation of Iudges by it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made: the wrong had beene farre greater if hee should have bearded the Councell, and undertaken to doe it without being appoynted thereunto.</p>

See now what wee inferre from hence: If the Pope had recourse to a Provinciall Councel for the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Decree whereof himselfe was the authour: if the Councell did abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it: if it said that the Pope could not repeal it himselfe, but together with the assembly of a Councell: then it follows that the Pope hath no authority of himselfe, at least not so much as hee pretendeth to: and lesse yet over a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Councell, seeing in matters of consequence he can doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and least of all over an Vniversall and Oecumenicall Councell. Nor ought we to be moved at that which wee read in the same Acts: <hi>That the Pope was wont to make Synodicall Decrees valid</hi>: Seeing it will not follow from thence, that therefore he is above a Councell: but only that Councels (that is, Generall ones) cannot bee holden unlesse hee bee called to them: which is not peculiar to the Pope, but common to him with the rest of the Patriarches, as wee shew in another place.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And as for particular Councels, the Pope hath nothing to doe with those which fall not to his share, but are held within the Provinces of other Patriarches and Metropolitans, unlesse it bee to looke upon them.

The power or riches and the humility or poverty doth not make a Bishop greater or lesser. Lastly, they are all the Apostles successors. But you will say unto me, How comes it to passe then that at</hi> Rome <hi>a Priest is received into Orders by the testimony of a Deacon? Why doe you object the custome of one Citie against me?</hi> See here is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prove that the Pope is inferiour to a Councell, seeing that which is practised in his Church cannot bee a law to others: seeing the meanest among the other Bishops hath as much authoritie as he. For if he be above a Councel, then all the rest are so: and if he deny it them, hee makes a law against himselfe too. What were the Popes a thinking of when they undertook to pronounce out of their owne mouth that which Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> spoke to their discredit? The Glossatour (it seemes) tooke this for currant money, when he collected from thence, <hi>That the Decrees of a Councell prejudice the Decrees of a Pope, when they are repugnant.</hi>

As namely, that the Pope is Lord of the world: that the question is there about a custome not ordained by the Pope: that a Councell is not all the world.

He speakes (say they) of a custome not authorized by the Pope: then Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> is beside the cushion, when hee quarrels with the Pope himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.

                  </gap>. We could produce divers instances, hereof; but we shall content our selves with one, which gives full satisfaction to all that can be collected from the former passages: It is Pope <hi>Liberius's</hi> epistle written to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> containing a rehearsall of his faith, with a request that hee would approve it, that so he might bee more assured of it;<note place="margin">

That a Pope, who is the universall head of all the Church, and for whom it is not possible to erre, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith) would bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assured in his faith by the approbation of a Bishop: that hee submits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to do his commands. This is too much. Say we then that they are words of complement aswell in the one as the other.

                  </gap> but wee must consider withall, that it was a meere Priest which spoke to the Pope. Besides, it was the part of a good Oratour to extoll the Pope and his authority, that so hee might gaine his consent, and bring him to approve of that his confession.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Nor will I ever deny but that the See of <hi>Rome</hi> had alwayes a great deal of lustre; and much honour was alwayes given unto it: but never so much as to make it a soveraigne Iudge, and state it above a Councel. We might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirme this by divers other testimonies of Popes. They themselves have granted that they may be judged when there is a schisme amongst them,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and the election is not rightly performed; as also when they erre from the faith. This is enough to prove that they are inferiour to a Councell. The glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satour goes yet further, when he saith, <hi>That a Simoniacall Pope, or an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or he that scandalizeth the Church by any other notorious crime, and is grown incorrigible, may be accused.</hi> Now in all these cases they must be judged by a Councel, as the same Glossatour expounds it; whence it follows that they are inferiour to it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The opinions of Vniversities touching the authority of Councels, and the approbation of Princes and Provinces.</head>
               <p n="1">1 THe most famous Vniversities of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> have also given their opinions upon this point, consonant to the Decrees of the foresaid Councels: and that at the very time when the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> for the good will they bore to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> resolved to carry themselves neuters, as in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they did. The said Vniversities withstood this neutrality stoutly and strongly; laying this for a ground, that a Councel is above the Pope: which they prove by many reasons and authorities: and therefore seeing Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> was deposed by the Councell of <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> the fift elected in his place, that therefore the first must be rejected as schismaticall, and the last obeyed as legitimate. King <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh favoured <hi>Eugenius</hi> likewise, but so as that he professeth he will stand to the Decrees of the Councell of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> above all, (as <hi>Nicholas Clemangiis</hi> tels us) as did also the Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> But let us heare what the Vniversities say of the power of Councels, as for the other heads of their answers, wee shall forbeare from relating of them by reason of their prolixity.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Vniversity of <hi>Cullen,</hi> being required by <hi>Theodorus</hi> Archbishop of that Citie, to let him know what they thought of it, made a litle tract, some pieces wherof we will here set downe.
<q>The first proposition is, The Church Synodically assembled, hath supreme jurisdiction upon earth, to which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very member therof ought to obey, of what dignity soever he be, though it be Papall: which no man can dissolve or remove without their Synodicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. This is proved by the Decrees of the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi> The first part is grounded upon that in the 18 of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel; Tell

So then he is set as the rectour, pastour, and Doctour of the rest of the faithfull of Christ, in Christs corporall absence, who is alwayes mystical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and spiritually present: and by Christ the spouse of the Church, the father, lord, and maister of the faithfull, by the authority of Christ, and of the Church his wife and Spouse; which is another new <hi>Eve,</hi> sacramentally taken out of the side of the new <hi>Adam</hi> sleeping upon the crosse, and joyned in mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence it is easie to shew that the Church Synodically assembled is a judiciall consistory, and supreme over all the faithfull of Christ. And from hence also the third part of the conclusion is evident; inasmuch as no party can transferre or dissolve the Iudges Seat at his pleasure. For if the Pope had this power, he should bee above not under the Church, using not a mere borrowed power of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique keyes, but an absolute free Princedome, a jurisdiction belonging to himselfe. And hee should not bee only the Pastour and steward over the sheep and lambes of Christ, but the King and Pastour of his owne sheep, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which is said in the last of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospel, Feed <hi>my</hi> sheep: hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, if the part had power over the whole, the thing contained over the continent, the particular badnesse of the Pope might oversway the universall good of the Churches intention, and the Popes pleasure should be a law to the whole Church. And that Church, which in one of the Articles of our Creed we beleeve to bee holy, built upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable rocke of our Christian faith, should be made subject to a moving, to a moveable and erring Prince; against which (saith Saint. <hi>Ierom</hi>) neither vices nor heresies, which are meant by the gates of Hell, shall ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</q>

For this was determined by the authority of the Church Catholique at the sacred Councell of</hi> Constance, <hi>and confirmed at the holy Synod of</hi> Sens <hi>and of</hi> Basil, <hi>in these words; That a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod lawfully assembled, in the name of the holy Ghost, making a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,

In the first place, reason teacheth us,</hi> &amp;c. After they have proved this in manner aforesaid, at last they conclude in this sort. <hi>Considering then that all General Councels are grounded upon such authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that if they be assembled about faith &amp; reformation of manners, &amp; that which belongs thereunto, every man from the least to the greatest is bound to obey them: as also considering they cannot erre, and that the sacred Councel of</hi> Basil <hi>continues firme and undoubted untill this day, as hath beene proved. From hence three things are inferred: First, That if a General Councell and the Pope, though hee bee truely and reallie Pope, be at variance, and command contrary things, the most illustrious Princes Electours, and all other Christians ought and are bound to obey the Councel and leave the Pope. The second, that the sacred Councell of</hi> Basil <hi>and Pope</hi> Eugenius <hi>that was, commanding contrary things, they are bound to yeeld obedience to that sacred Councel and not to</hi> Eugenius: <hi>Yea to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him no Pope, seeing the Councel had power to proceed to the deposing of him for his disobedience. The third, that they are bound to obey the most holy Pope</hi> Felix, <hi>who was chosen by the Councell.</hi>

               <p n="4">4 The counsell and advice which the Vniversity of <hi>Vienna</hi> gave to the Archbishop and Metropolitan of <hi>Salizburg,</hi> upon his request made unto them, is conformable to the former. <hi>To the second, namely whether the holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of</hi> Basil <hi>had full power to proceed against</hi> Eugenius, <hi>and to depose him and create another, it is answer'd; That the holy Ghost hath openly declared by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of the sacred Councel of</hi> Constance, <hi>that the Church, and a holy Councell wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch represents it, hath such a power over any man whatsoever he be, although he be placed in Papall dignity.</hi> Afterwards they adde the Decree of the said Councell which hath beene here alledged already; together with another of the same Councell, made against those that doe not obey the commandements thereof, though they be placed in dignity Papall. And in another place 'tis said,
<q>It followes then that the Holy Ghost is there, (at the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel) but not as a subject, but as a supreme President, from whom it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any of the faithfull to make appeal, and by consequent not from the Councel neither, forasmuch as concernes the Articles, wherein it is certaine the Councell is governed by him, and that hee presides there by a speciall grace and lustre: to wit, in what concernes faith, the extirpation of schismes, and the reformation of the Head and the members. How can it be otherwise but an open contempt of the majesty of God, and almost a piece of Idolatrie to appeale from a Councel to the Pope in such cases? what is it else but to appeale from God himselfe, who is confessed to preside in a sacred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for such things, unto a meere man? and to take the power of judging from God the Creator, and devolve it upon a man? what is it else but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a man before God as a more just Iudge than he?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 The Vniversity of <hi>Cracovia</hi> gave also their advice and counsell concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this point unto <hi>Ladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> consonant unto the former, but farre more large, containing some very prety reasons to prove that the Pope is inferiour to a Councell; out of which wee shall bring onely some passages to make it appeare what their resolution was. First of all it is said,
<q>That a Generall Councell representing the Church Catholique, is a rule directed by the Holy Ghost, and given by Christ Iesus, which every one is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:16652:128"/>
bound to hear and obey,<note place="margin">Councels ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prove the Pope infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iour to Councels.</note> of what estate and condition soever he be, although he be a Pope.</q>
And in another place.
<q>Whence it followes, that the Pope is not head of the Catholique Church nor of a Generall Councell which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it; but he is head in respect of particular Churches and particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Church. In reference to whom he is supposed to have full power as the Vicar of Christ.</q>
And elsewhere.
<q>Wherefore let this bee the third conclusion concerning this point. That every Generall Councell lawfully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in the name of the Holy Ghost, doth represent the Catholique Church, and hath its power immediately from Christ. This proposition hath no need of proofe, considering that it hath its proofe and foundation from the decree of the Generall Councell at <hi>Constance.</hi>
                  </q>
See here the very words of it, that wee may not bee put to repeat them hereafter. These are the two Decrees of the said Councell, which wee have inserted here before. After which it is said,
<q>Behold the Constitution of the sacred Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> which may suffice to make any man content unto this conclusion, considering it is the assertion of the Catholique Church.</q>
After the proofe of the said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, they proceed unto the fourth in this manner.
<q>And forasmuch as the Catholique Church and the Generall Councell which represents it, hath its power immediately from Christ by the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mer conclusion, let this now bee the fourth. The power of the Church Catholique, as also of every Generall Councell lawfully assembled, which doth represent it, is above the power of the Pope, and all other power whatsoever upon earth, to which every one of what estate, condition or dignitie soever hee bee, though it bee Papall, is bound to obey and submit himselfe. And if he will not obey he may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with condigne punishment.</q>
This conclusion they prove by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and authorities, which it would be long to set downe in this place. Wee shall onely say how that, serving themselves with the authoritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Constance,</hi> and having related at large all that passed in that respect, they adde,
<q>All which facts of that Councell are and will be a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall unto succeeding generations. Whence it plainly appeares whether a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell have any jurisdiction over the Pope or no. Which every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that hath any judgement may easily know.</q>
Where it is to bee observed that the authoritie of the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> was not any way doubted of in those dayes, but continued generally approved by all in this respect. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place it is said,
<q>Whence it may be inferred, that, although it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient the Pope in some sort should be called the head of the Church, yet ought he not therefore to preferre himselfe before the Church. Yea it might perhaps be inferred from hence, that, <hi>eo ipso,</hi> because hee quarrels with the Church for superioritie, either in his actions or affection, hee not onely is not superiour, but also that he is no member of the Church; as one that is ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion'd of the authoritie of the holy Mother the Church, and deficient in the true faith.</q>
It is further said towards the end of that conclusion:
<q>Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been heretofore delivered in this point by the Glosses and Doctors sometimes for the affirmative, sometimes for the negative part, we must now stand to the decision of it made by the sacred Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> for as much as concernes those cases expressed in their Decree: to wit when the question is about faith, or the extirpation of schismes, or the reformation of the Church in the Head and members, and in cases thereunto belonging: as when the controversie is about a notorious scandall, and so of others. In all these the Pope is inferiour to a Generall Councell. And if any man be strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident of the contrary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he ought to bee esteemed a heretique.</q>
I could yet extract some other passages, but see here is more than needs for them that hold the contrary.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Councels of Constance and Basil decree Councels to be above Ppes.</note>THe Popes are in default who have endevoured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure this truth; yea desired to overthrow it in the suit, either by their proceedings, or by their Decrees and their Conventicles; or by the writings of their hireling Doctours, whom it is now my task to answere, but very briefly, because it is none of my proper designe: beside, that which I have touched upon above may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice abundantly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Their maine incounter is with the Councels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> yet so as they cannot agree amongst themselves about them. For some of them say, It was not absolutely determined by them that Generall Councels have power over Popes, but onely in one case, to wit, when there is a schisme, and it is doubted who is the true Pope. But the very words of the two Decrees which we produced in the former chapter, doe sufficiently refell them, so that we need say no more of that. They doe not onely give the Councell power over Popes in case of schisme, but in all that concernes the faith, in all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the reformation of the head and members, and all things that depend thereupon.</p>
               <p n="3">3 What would a man desire more? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knew well enough that this reason is but of base aloy, for contenting himselfe with the bare mention of it, and quoting of the authors, for his part he hath recourse unto others, but such as are no whit stronger. He saith then, for the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> that when it made these Decrees it was not such as had power to determine controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of faith, inasmuch as it was not then Generall; that it had but the third part of the Church, to wit, onely so many Prelates as obeyed Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the three and twentieth, and not those which obeyed <hi>Gregory</hi> the twelfth, and <hi>Bennet</hi> the thirteenth. And marke here how hee would enervate what was done by a Generall Councell, because of the absence of some schismaticall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. By this reason all the Councell should be a nullitie, from the beginning till the end, and not a part of it only, as he would have it. For the Prelates which acknowledged <hi>Gregory</hi> for Pope,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Platinain Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio</hi> 4.</note> never assisted at it but persisted with their Pope in that schisme, even til the end. And yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmes that this Councell is legitimate and approved: only for the reason aforesaid, hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that Session wherein these Decrees were enacted. It was not then such (saith he) that it had power to make these decisions in matters of faith. But, I beseech you, a Councel consisting of two hundred Fathers then when it made these Decrees, where the Emperour and many other Princes were present in person; the Ambassadours of all the Kings and Princes of Christendome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two, the Proctours and Syndiques of all the Nations and Vniversities in Christendome, and so many persons of another quality in such abundauce that above thirty thousand horse were seen to arrive there at the beginning, as <hi>Nauelerus</hi> testifies. This Councell, I say, (according to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) could not

ordaine any thing concerning the power of the Pope and of a Councel,<note place="margin">The Councel of Constance asserted against the Pope.</note> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the absence of some schismaticall Prelats. Now let any man be judge, if any thing firme and strong can bee expected from Councels. Now that all those whom wee mentioned were at the enacting of those Decrees, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the very text of the fourth Session: the words are these; <hi>The thirtith of March there was holden a Generall Session in the Cathedrall Church of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>in which there were two hundred Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There was also the King of the</hi> Romans, <hi>with the habit and formalities belonging to the King of the</hi> Romans. <hi>After masse was done the Cardinal of</hi> Florence <hi>read certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions which should be observed by the Councell, the tenure whereof is set down hereafter: which being read and approved by the Generall Councell,</hi> Henry de Piro, <hi>Proctour and Syndic for the</hi> German <hi>nation, did desire in behalfe of that Nation, that a copy of those ordinances</hi> (that is, the Decrees mentioned) <hi>might be given unto him: The like was required by the Proctours and Syndi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not said there were any disputes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about it: nor that any man did stand out against it: nor that there were diversities of opinions about it.

Who having continued a long time upon that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, they were of opinion that this coercitive Presidence ought not to bee granted them. And the thing being afterwards consulted upon, it was concluded according to their opinion.</q>
Read now the seventeenth Session of that Councell, you shall finde nothing there but the bare resolution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a word of this above. So that we beleeve that this Councel of <hi>Constance,</hi> which consisted of the most learned Devines and Lawyers that were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, did not passe these two Decrees till they had throughly examin'd them: especially considering the thing was put to the tryall againe.</p>

<q>O Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> (saith it) who wast surely the abomination of all desolation, (as a moderne authour testifies) durst thou falsifie thy faith, desert St. <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, and usurpe the title, not only of <hi>Iulius Cesar,</hi> (for he never falsified his faith, nor ever went against his loyalty, as thou) but of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostat, whose name thou hast borne for a long time, (<hi>Conveniunt rebus nomina</hi>) and unfold and display the Apostolicall keyes, and the three crownes in the field? sleep in the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower?

For benedictions and plenary indulgences <hi>à poena &amp; culpa</hi> marched so thicke as nothing more. And to prove this true, in the moneth of August last past, when I complained to one of the late Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> Chamberlaines, of the inconstancy, or rather disloyalty and treason of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his faith and promise so solemnly sworne at the Parliament of <hi>Boloyne</hi> to the most Christian King <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> had declared himselfe the Kings enemy, wondring with my self at the litle fidelity and loyalty of the moderne Popes; more especially of the two last, <hi>Iulius</hi> the <hi>Genoois,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine,</hi> considering that in former times the Popes would have chosen to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death rather than breake their promise; he swore and protested unto me, that when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> came out of his countrey of <hi>Spaine,</hi> into the City of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the same Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> had sent him an absolution from the treason which was then hatched, and plotted to cozen King <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>

                  </note> that they afterwards translated that Councell from <hi>Nice</hi> to <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> But how should we beleeve another man that <hi>Leo</hi> translated it from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> when he himself saith the contrary? Who could better know than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? What can be more authentique than the very letters of the Emperours that were the authors of the translation, which are joyned with the Acts of the Councels? But grant that hee transferr'd the Councell from one place to another: it is a very weake consequence to say, therefore he is above it. The Emperours will have as much authority as he, who transferr'd them from one place to another; yea and made them come all in corps after them from one countrey to another, to render a reason for what they had done, as wee have proved elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let us come to the third reason. Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the fift gave his presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents at the Councell of <hi>Siena</hi> power to remove the Councell, without any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntion made of the consent of that Councell. If <hi>Leo</hi> and his Councell will make us beleeve that, they must abolish the memory of all those other prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Councels. It was decreed in the thirty ninth Session of the Councell of <hi>Constance, That Councels should bee kept from ten yeares to ten yeares, in such places as should be nominated by the Pope within a moneth before the end of every Counc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l with the approbation and consent of the Councl, or in case of his default by the Councel it self.</hi> It is further said, that the place being once appointed, it shal not be altered by the Pope without apparent necessity; in which case he may do it with the consent of the Cardinals, or two parts of them. According to this Decree, this Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> of whom wee speak before the breaking up of the Councell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> did nominate the City of <hi>Padua</hi> for the holding of the next Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that should be called. Which he did <hi>with the consent and approbation of the said Councell,</hi>

               <p n="5">5 But this is not all yet. When the Councell was assembled at <hi>Siena,</hi> he was earnest with the Fathers thereof to change the place: they consulted upon it, and resolved to goe to <hi>Basil</hi>:<note place="margin">

                     </hi> 1.</note> So say the Acts, <hi>The Presidents convoked the Deputies for all the nations of the present Councell of</hi> Siena, <hi>about chusing the place for the future Councell.</hi> And anon after: <hi>They did nominate and chuse the City of</hi> Basil <hi>unanimously and with one common consent.</hi> And yet after, it is said, <hi>That the Presidents assented to the nomination which was made by the Deputies.</hi> Now how shall we beleeve this alteration was made, or that <hi>Martin</hi> did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to doe it without the consent of the Councell? Hee, I say, who appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Decrees of it, which is more, as it hath beene demonstrated in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The fourth reason is, That divers Synods have given a great deale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to Popes, and have obeyed their injunctions and commands with all humility. There was no necessity of saying so much for fear it should be denied.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16652:136"/>
For reverence sake a great deal of honour was ever done to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popes not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yed by Councels.</note> it was acknowledged to bee the first in degree and dignity, but not in power and authority. Besides, the Pope was put to wrestle for honour with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> by reason of the translation, the one of the Imperiall seat, the other of the exarchat into their Cities, pretended that they had got the prerogative of honour. The other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches had scarce any lesse than he; sometimes more was done unto them, and sometimes lesse. The Popes for their part ever made good use of it: they were never ashamed to proclaime their owne praises, and they lost nothing for want of challenging. They have often turned the faire proffers which were made unto them into strict obligations; and have monopoliz'd to themselves what was common to all. But to doe them a courtesie, let us grant them some speciall favour and prerogative. From all these honours and respects there can bee nothing concluded: as for authority and power, we have no more to doe, but set up our staffe there.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The last is more pressing, which speaks of the humble obedience which Generall Councels have done unto them. Let us therefore examine those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which are urged upon us. The first Councel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> granted it to Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> in obeying his Decrees. What a ly is this! Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> in a Synod which he held at <hi>Rome</hi> of the Westerne Bishops, condemned the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Nestorius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi>: gave notice of the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Synod to <hi>Cyrill</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi>: and before hee speake of the Generall Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> hee entreats the same <hi>Cyrill</hi> to cause that to bee put in execution which had beene defin'd at <hi>Rome</hi>: from whence an argument for his presidence is drawne, as much to the purpose as the rest. Being advertised of the Councel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> hee sends his Legats thither; of a truth they speake some magnificent things tending to the Popes advancement, but of which they can make no great booty; saving only that the Councel was glad that the definition of the Westerne Bishops was found conformable to that which had beene made by the Easterne.<note place="margin">

                  </note> And to this intent <hi>The Synod decreed, Considering the Legats of the See of</hi> Rome <hi>have spoken such things as are conformable to what had beene formerly determin'd, they would subscribe to their Acts, that they might continue constant to their promises.</hi> And presently they sent letters to the Emperours, <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> wherein they say, <hi>That God hath touched the hearts of the Western Bishops with a godly zeal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for although the length of the journey did not permit all that multitude of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to come to</hi> Ephesus, <hi>notwithstanding being all met together in one place. the most holy and most devout</hi> Celestine <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>being present and presiding amongst them, they have determined in point of faith conformably to what wee had defined; and have declared those that are of a contrary opinion unworthy of Priesthood, and of all Ecclesiasticall honours and degrees. And</hi> Celestine <hi>the most holy Bishop of great</hi> Rome <hi>had signified by his letters this opinion of his, and of those that were with him, before ever there was any mention of holding a Councel at</hi> Ephesus: <hi>and had sent to</hi> Cyrill <hi>the most holy Bishop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and wel-beloved in the Lord, to prosecute and performe what had been concluded upon at the Synod of</hi> Rome, <hi>substituting him in his place.

As for the humble obedience in question, they must seeke it elsewhere: for there is no more spoke of it here than is to Pope <hi>Agatho, Hadrian</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the sixt and eight Councels.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The Councel that yeelded the most to the Popes was the eight Generall, holden at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which granted <hi>Hadrians</hi> Legats the Presidence, (which the rest never did) and which decreed with a great deale of respect concerning the accusations of Popes.

               <p n="10">10 The fifth reason is the declaration which the Bishops of <hi>Italy</hi> made to the Bishops of <hi>Illyrium</hi> touching the Councell of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> which they said was invalid because it wanted the Pope of <hi>Romes</hi> consent: and Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to the Bishops of <hi>Sicily,</hi> wherein he pretends the very same reason. Wee have an epistle of those Bishops extant at this day, by the meanes of that learned <hi>French</hi> man, to whom all Christendome is so much beholding, which discovers unto us the Popes cunning to manage their designes. They condemne indeed the Councel of <hi>Ariminum:</hi> But why? that they tell us,

As for Pope <hi>Leo</hi> wee make no question but hee might have done that which is put upon him, although the letter which hee writ to the Bishops of <hi>Sicily</hi> make no mention of it. For hee onely tels them that they must send every yeere three Bishops to <hi>Rome,</hi> to assist at the Synod which shall bee holden there. Which cannot bee referred to a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell. And for the rest, no body denyes but the Pope hath the same power in respect of the Churches which depend upon him, which the other Patriarches and Metropolitans have,</p>
               <p n="11">11 But let us grant what they say of him. There is nothing got by it; it is a domestique testimony, and of one that is himselfe a party. Hee that hath at other times disputed the presidence of Councels, is now in question himselfe in his owne cause and his successours. Besides, wee have spoken sufficiently elsewhere of the approbations and subscriptions of the Acts of Councels which were desired at the Popes hands; that they desired as much of other Bishops to mantaine the union and intelligence of the Church, from whence no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage will accrue to the Pope: and yet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for all the Councel of <hi>Lateran</hi> makes this a strong ground: as neither from that which the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> did, which our <hi>Lateran</hi> Fathers have put in the list too, thereby tacitly approving it. Of whom I demand lastly, Why then do they not observe its decrees touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of a Councell, seeing they can finde no flaw in them? They take at nothing but the Councel of <hi>Basil,</hi> and this poore Pragmatique; and that by reason of the sawcinesse of them, as they intimate unto us by those words,
<q>Which was likewise observed by the Fathers of <hi>Constance</hi>: which laudable custome if those of <hi>Bourges</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> had observed, without doubt we should never have all this adoe.</q>

               <p n="1">1 ANd forasmuch as these large Indulgences whereof wee have spoke, are most commonly granted to Fraternities, as appeares by the Buls of them which have beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it is good reason we speake a word of them too. King <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth in his demands required a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the abuses of such Fraternities. The Councell found nothing to be corrected in them; but tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd them,<note place="margin">

By meanes of these indulgences and the superstition which hee useth in them, he gaines millions of men unto himselfe, who devote themselves so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for the especiall favour which they suppose they receive by meanes of these indulgences, that they doe not acknowledge any other superiour.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Former times have instructed us, that leagues, and monopolies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies against the State, have beene hatched in such Fraternities as these, and that disorders and other unlawfull things have beene committed among them.

And for that reason they are condemned by the Edicts and Declarations of our Kings, as the mothers, or at least the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of conspiracies; for they are so joyned together by the same Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: as in that of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, of September 1577. <hi>And all leagues, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociations, and fraternities, made or to be made, under any pretence whatsoever, to the prejudice of this our Edict, shall bee utterly void and of no effect.</hi> And in that of the same Prince, given the 20 of December in the same yeare. <hi>Wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly forbid all our said subjects, of what qualitie soever they be, to begin, make, or prosecute any league, association or fraternitie amongst themselves, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of our said Edict of pacification.</hi> The 44 Article of the conference of <hi>Flex</hi> saith in expresse termes, <hi>All the foresaid</hi> (to wit, Provosts, Maiors, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, Sherifes of townes, &amp;c. mentioned in the former Article) <hi>and other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatsoever of this Realme, of what condition soever, shall depart from and

There are some poore innocents that enroll themselves among them, thinking to find the salvation of their soules there, and to enjoy the virtue of so many goodly indulgences. Some of them pride themselves in going in a masque as it were, and walking about the towne in a white, or black, or gray garment, or of some other colour: some with their white sandals, and their sweet-meats in their pockets to throw at a sweet-heart as they passe along, after they have cast ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a pitifull amorous glance at her. Another with a whip in his hand full set with prickes, lancing himselfe and drawing bloud of his back, who goes from street to street, and Church to Church begging for mercie; serving for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle and an offence to all those that behold these antiques.

It is notoriously knowne to many that the League was sworne in <hi>Tholouse</hi> by the blacke Penitents; and that as many of these Orders as are in <hi>France</hi> did all conspire to the like ends. And yet notwithstanding we see them now adaies spring up againe in divers Cities. This Societie and Fraternitie was renewed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, the yeare 1576, as appeares by his Bull of the fourth of October.

Now in that there is an expresse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition in the 14 of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> where it is said, Yee are the children of the Lord your God, ye shall not cut your selves. The glosse saith; You ought not to make your selves like Idolaters: and it is in the Hebrew, You shall not rent your selves. Now so did the Idolaters, as it is written in the 2 of Kings Chap. 18. Where it is said that they cut themselves, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, with knives and lances, till the bloud gushed out. Surely it is a known thing, and hath been left unto us upon record in writing, that these murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Apostate Divels do long after the effusion of bloud, especially mans bloud. A law the more injust it is, and more pleasing to the Divell, the more cruell it is found to bee. This is evident from the example of such as sacrificed their sonnes and daughters. And therefore the Lord said by his Prophet, You shall serve strange Gods which shall not give you any rest. But Christ by his grace hath bin pleased to save us mercifully by the shedding of his bloud; whereby hee hath made us towards God wisedome, and justice, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and redemption.</q> A little after,
<q>Christs law doth straitly forbid to impose any publique penance upon Clergy men, Priests, and Prelats, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to their spiritual profession. How much lesse ought such persons sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to such publique penance, as many of the <hi>Flagellants</hi> do? who though they seeme to hide themselves, yet are they sufficiently knowne. The same may be said of noted persons of both sexs. And regard should also bee had of the modesty of young children and damosels, which are seene to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest themselves.</q>
A little after hee saith,
<q>The law of Christ declared by the Church, hath alwaies disallowed the Sect of such as whip themselves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving observed that it began to spread in divers parts of the world. This hath beene seene within the memory of some men yet alive, both in <hi>Lorraine, Germany, France,</hi> and manie other places, as both the men and Chronicles of <hi>France</hi> doe testifie, and other writings of good credit. <hi>Item,</hi> no evill could subsist if it had not some shew of good: Wherefore it is a Sophisticall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, much good redounds from this Sect of <hi>Flagellants,</hi> therefore it

<q>Wee are of opinion (most blessed Father) that in the first place this law ought to bee observed in all things. That lawes bee kept as much as may be; and that we thinke it not lawfull for us to dispense with lawes; unlesse it be upon urgent and necessary occasion. For there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee a more pernicious custome brought into any Common-wealth than the not observance of lawes; which our ancestors would have to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holy, calling their power sacred and divine.

In the seventeenth Chapter of the twentie fourth Session they straitly prohibit the pluralitie of benefices, and that all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all dispensations to the contrary notwithstanding. But in another place they renew the Decretall of <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth; which binds forsooth such as hold a pluralitie of benefices to exhibit their dispensations unto the Ordinary, to make it appeare: Now if they be sufficient, the Ordinaries have no more to say. Yea in case the validitie of them be doubtfull, recourse must be had to the Pope, for the manifestation of his pleasure. In another place having religiously forbid hereditary successions in Bishopriques, which have beene alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, at last they admit of them in certaine cases; but with cognizance of the cause, which they attribute to the Pope. They make one or two faire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees concerning the residence of Bishops; but they give the Pope power to approve the causes of their absence, and upon that occasion to punish those

               <p n="14">14 This Decree hath two parts, the one as commendable as the other. The first speaks in general of all dispensations, and tacitly by necessary consequence permits the Pope to use them. For it were to no purpose to provide for the ordering of them, unlesse they were permitted. Yea from that di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inction which is made of them, we collect that the Pope commits the cognizance of them either in <hi>Rome</hi> or out of <hi>Rome,</hi> What is it then which is here decreed? that such as goe out of <hi>Rome</hi> shall be committed to the Ordinary of those to whom they are granted. <hi>Item,</hi> this is all. See now we are well satisfied. Of all those so many kindes of dispensations as are in the world, an order was taken with those touching pluralitie of benefices, touching hereditary succession in them, and touching the residence of Prelats. And so as we have heard concerning the rest. This is the law, this is the reformation. So that provided the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie lose not his right of reference, all the world must rest content, and the Pope as well as others. But the second part is the prettiest of all. They leave the Pope power to grant out gracious dispensations, provided that hee referre the cognizance of them to the Bishops. What to doe? onely, as his Delegates, to try whether there be any obreption or surreption in them; that is, whether his Holinesse were not cheated by false information. For in this case he may give way to the impairing of his rights.</p>
               <p n="15">15 See then here are three things which we complaine of. First, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of gracious dispensations; and the power of granting them, which is left to the Pope. The second is the delegation which he must make unto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; seeing it is a meanes to draw the inhabitants out of the realme, or at least to constraine them, in case of suit and controversie, to demand some other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates <hi>In partibus.</hi> The third, that these Delegates may not judge of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse or unlawfulnesse of the dispensation, but onely of the cosenage which the petitioners may have used towards the Pope. Seeing these Sirs have made such sleight enquiry into the meanes of remedying those evils and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which arise from dispensations, we are dispensed with their inordinate ordinances.

                  </note> it is a wrong to them to take this power and facultie from them, to bestow it upon the Pope. To whom, it is true, so much honour hath beene yeelded in <hi>France,</hi> as to receive his Bulles, whereby they proceed to the union of benefices, provided they be not perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; and for the other, that they be granted after full cognizance of the cause, and upon very just and lawfull reasons. And which is more, it is not sufficient that those causes bee knowne to the Pope alone, that they bee declared in his Bulls, but hee is bound to send out his writs of delegation <hi>In partibus,</hi> for the effecting of the said unions, with cognizance of the cause, and consent of the Patron, and such as are any way interested in them. Which is as much as to give the power and authoritie to the Bishops, reserving the honour to the Poep: as appeares by the Collection of the liberties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church. See here the very words of it, <hi>The Pope cannot make any unions or annexions, of the livings of this Kingdome, during the life of the Incumbents, nor at other times: but he may grant out writs of delegation concerning unions; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to bee done according to the forme prescribed in the Councell of</hi> Constance, <hi>and not otherwise: and this with the consent of the Patron, and such as have any interest in them.</hi>

If they be made otherwise, an appeale is put up to the Parliaments of this Kingdome to stop the execution; who have ofttimes cassed and disanull'd such like Bulls upon such occasions; and that without any regard of the lapse of time, or any other prescription; as appears by the testimony of our common Lawyers of <hi>France,</hi> and by the Arrests which have beene granted out.<note place="margin">

The maine vow whereunto they are bound by their institution is that of obedience. Heark what <hi>Loiola</hi> their founder saith of it in a letter of his which hee writ in <hi>Italian</hi> to the Fathers of <hi>Portugal; Wee easily endure to bee outdone by all other Orders, in fastings, watchings, and other hardnesses, which they use in a holy manner, according to their institution: but in puritie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of obedience, I earnestly desire that you would surpasse all the rest; with a true resignation of your owne will, and a denyall of your owne judgement.</hi> Now this vow looks full upon the Pope, to whom they commit themselves both soule and bodie, to bee no more their owne; not to beleeve their owne sense, their judgement, their understanding, their prudence, and counsell: but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of, and submit themselves totally to him, to goe, come, doe, say, execute upon all and against all, whatsoever hee shall command them.

Whence we must necessarilie conclude, that if the Pope be an honest &amp; peaceable man, such a one as <hi>Clement</hi> the eight now reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to whom <hi>France</hi> is so much obliged, is supposed to be, they will bee so too.

Can the Prince live secure if that saying of an ancient be true, that he which cares not for his owne life is the maister of another mans? Can hee escape a dismall blow, having in all parts of his Kingdome some persons that upon the least whistle will run some to their knives, some to their swords? which will arme themselves with fraud, and treacherie, and perfidiousnesse? which will make underhand plots and projects? which will seduce his subjects, and draw them from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? will pronounce him a tyrant, an heretique, a schismatique, how good, how religious, how Catholique soever hee bee?

                  </gap> what belongs unto them. And indeed the same Councell hath decreed it down-right: For it is said in the eighth Canon of the twentie third Session, <hi>If any one affirme the Bishops that are created by the authoritie of our Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be no true and lawfull Bishops, but a humane fiction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4 It may bee made to appeare yet more particularly, that this Councels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to put into the Popes hands all that concernes the election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopriques and other Ecclesiasticall dignities and offices, and to deprive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that might claime any right to them. For by the first Chapter of the sixt Session, the care and charge of preferring or causing to bee preferred unto the government of Churches, such as shall be most worthie, and the power of providing for Bishopriques in stead of the Bishops that do not reside, belongs unto him: which will be a meanes for him to revenge himselfe of such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as would desire to retaine trusty Prelates in their Counsell. For if they doe so without the Popes licence, they shall be deprived of them: if with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, they shall be but ill served by them. Besides, the Pope will keepe them continually in awe by other meanes afforded him by this Councell; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the oath which they are bound to sweare unto him at their Provinciall Councels and Synods within their Dioces; by the censure of their life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, their errours and offences; which is also granted unto him, with supreme jurisdiction to punish them.<note place="margin">

In the second place is objected the constitution of the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the first, where it is said,

               <p n="18">18 The right of the Emperours in the election and confirmation of Popes being such, there can bee nothing now alledged against these authorities but mere usurpation and violence, which the succeeding Popes have used towards the Emperours to deprive them of it.

               <p n="16">16 The question is now whether this renunciation be valid, and whether it could prejudice his successors. No good lawyer will ever pronounce for it. First, in as much as the Councels aforesaid cancelled the obligation of Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> as made by impression and violence, this renunciation of the Empire stands void by the same reason; considering he was brought to that extremitie by the noise of those thunderbolts hurled by the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in all parts of the world, and by the revolt of his subjects seduced by the abuse of these spirituall remedies, and by the warre which was stirred up against him, to preserve and defend himselfe from an ignominious authoration, and to procure the repeale of those anathema's which vexed his soule, how ever unjust, he was compeld to disclaime his rights.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Now this force and necessitie appears by that testimonie of <hi>Otho</hi> Bishop of <hi>Freisinger. Wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Empire being dismembred, and broken many wayes, the Emperour perceiving that the King revolted from him, because of the anathema pronounced against him, and fearing his fathers example, having called a great assembly of Princes together at</hi> Wormes, <hi>hee resigned the investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bishops to</hi> Lampert <hi>Legat of the See Apostolique.</hi> The revolt against him was such, that his owne nephewes did abandon him (saith the Abbat of <hi>Vsperge</hi>) who addes these words, the true tokens of this violence.<note place="margin">

               <p n="18">18 The termes of this surrender doe elsewhere shew it to be personall, and that it layes no obligation upon his successors. It is the exposition which was put upon it in those dayes: witnesse the same Bishop of <hi>Freisinger.</hi>

               <p n="20">20 As for those Councels which were the cause of this renunciation, and pronounced the Emperour <hi>anathema,</hi> depriving him of Investitures, it must be observed, upon what grounds they stand. They deprive an Emperour of the right of Investitures without hearing him, without summoning him. See here an injustice! They condemne Investitures as hereticall; they condemne then Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the first, and all his Councell, of heresie, who granted them to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; <hi>Leo</hi> the eight and his Councell, who granted them to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi>; as also all other Popes who tolerated them, yea even those who approv'd them, of whom we have spoken already.</p>
               <p n="21">21 And upon this point we must heare what our good Bishop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> that great Pope-Monk saith, who is much troubled to defend this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heresie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and implication of horrible contradictions. For in his epistles making answer to <hi>Iohn</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who reprehended herein the fathers of this Councell of <hi>Vienna</hi>:
<q>Whereas (saith he) you reprehend those that ranke the investitures of Ecclesiasticall dignities made by Lay men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the number of heresies, it seemes there is no great force in your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension For although hereticall errour lodge in the heart, as well as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith: yet notwithstanding as we know a Catholique by his Catholique works, so wee know an heretique by his hereticall works. God hath said, by their fruits yee shall know them: and every tree is knowne by his fruit. And although externall investitures made by Lay men, cannot be properly judged heresies: yet to bee of opinion, and to maintain that they are lawful, is an undoubted heresie.</q>
This is not said with sufficient reason. For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell saith, Investiture is an heresie, and he makes no answer to that. If it bee an heresie, then it follows as wee said, that those precedent Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels that authorized them; yea, (to take in all that is in <hi>Ivo's</hi> answere) that were of opinion they might and ought to bee given by the Emperours, were truly heretiques.</p>
               <p n="22">22 This Bishop makes us behold this heresie of another colour, (so much paines does he take to defend a bad cause!) for he judgeth it an heresie in case the Lay man which performes it, doe thinke it to bee a Sacrament. <hi>If any Lay man</hi> (saith he) <hi>fall into this follie, that he thinks he can administer a Sacrament or a thing belonging to a Sacrament of the Church, by the giving and taking of a rod; wee judge him an absolute heretique; not for his manuall investiture, but for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In that epistle hee notes no other heresie in investitures, but urgeth many reasons to prove they are not so; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he concludes that Princes must be deprived of them; <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>being performed by Lay men, it is an usurpation upon another mans right, a sacrilegious presumption.</hi> Hee speaks thus to maintaine the cause of the Pope and the Councell, right or wrong.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But let us hear what he saith of it formerly, when he was in cold bloud, in an Epistle of his written to <hi>Hugh</hi> Archbishops of <hi>Lyons</hi>;
<q>As for that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:16652:160"/>
which you writ unto me,<note place="margin">Kings may confer Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques, &amp;c. The Emperour <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> right vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</note> how the said party elect received Investiture into his Bishoprique from the Kings hands, wee knew nothing of it, nor was it told unto us by any body. But although it were so, yet considering that hath no force of a sacrament, to make a Bishop whether it bee done or not done, I doe not see wherein it can be hurtfull to faith and religion: yea we doe not finde that by Apostolicall authoritie Kings are forbidden to grant Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques after Canonicall election.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ivo Ep.</hi> 65.</note> For wee read that some Popes of good fame have become intercessours to Kings for those who had been elected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Churches, to get them to give them the Bishopriques: and that others have deferred the consecration, because they had not yet received the Princes consent. I would have set downe the examples hereof, were it not that I desire to avoid prolixitie in my letter. So Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi> as we understand, excludes Kings only from the corporall investiture, but not from the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for asmuch as they are heads of the people, or of the grant: although the eight Synod forbids them onely to assist at the election, but not at the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie; which whether it bee done by the hand, or by seale, or by word of mouth, or by the rod, what matters it? Seeing Kings doe not pretend to conferre any thing that is spirituall in it, but only to consent unto the will of those that require them; or to grant unto them Ecclesiasticall possessions and other externall goods which Churches hold by the liberalitie of Kings.</q>
As for the Sacrament of which he hath spoken now twice, there was no question of that, seeing that by former Councels the investiture was granted to Emperors and the consecration to Bishops.</p>
               <p n="24">24 What can be alleadged more in defence of these later Councels? If any man will say that the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> was justly deprived of this right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had violated the holy See, and had put Pope <hi>Paschal</hi> in prison: Wee will give two or three very pat answers to this objection. One, that hee did no more but repell the injury which was done unto himselfe. For even in the Church, and while he received the Eucharist from the Popes hands, hee was like to have beene traiterously killed. Heare what the <hi>German</hi> Chronicles say of it; <hi>While the Emperour received the Sacrament from the Popes hands, behold one of the principall of the Clergy, who was offended with that purpose which the Emperour had put on, that he would maintaine the constitutions of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, stirred up a sedition and tumult in the temple, beat off the guard of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours body, and went about to seaze upon him: who with much adoe saved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, repelling the force with his owne hands.</hi> And speaking of the same Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hee afterwards addes, <hi>Hee got him presently into the Citie, killed a great multitude of citizens and Clergy-men, tooke the Pope prisoner.</hi> Elsewhere the Pope and Emperour were very good friends, by meanes of the agreement made betwixt them, of which wee have spoken already: yea in such sort that the Pope sealed it, by delivering the body of Christ unto the Emperour,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2 We shall make it appeare plainly that this Councell hath dealt very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with the Pope in this respect, and that it hath strain'd it selfe to confirme his usurpations, yea even to augment them without sparing any thing.

But if the cause be such as it must necessarily be tried out of the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>let it not bee committed to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons excepting such Metropolitans or Bishops as the Pope shall chuse. That this commission be in speciall, and sealed with the Popes hand, and that hee never give them any greater power but onely to receive the bare instruction for matter of fact, and to make the processe, which they shall forthwith send to the Pope: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive sentence being alwayes reserv'd unto the Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 In another decree it is ordained, <hi>That the causes of Bishops, when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the quality of the crime which is objected unto them, they ought to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, be brought before our holy Father the Pope, and be determined by him.</hi>

                  <hi>That if they doe not abstaine from that crime after they have beene admonished by the Provinciall Councell, they shall bee complained of to the Pope by the same Councell, who shall punish them according to the quality of their offence, even by deprivation, if need require.</hi> So that a Provinciall Councell hath no power to condemne a Bishop for criminall matters, save onely for Peccadillo's; such as we may say for play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ball, for getting up late in a morning, and such like things.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Now wee say on the contrarie, that the cognizance of such crimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Emperors and Kings: That they themselves ofttimes have proceeded to judgement: That they have assembled Councels for that end, and have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and presided there: That sometimes they have committed the same judgement to the said Councels, or their Iudges: That Popes themselves have become petitioners unto them, yea plaintives before them, and which is more, have themselves beene judged by them.</p>

It is a certaine rule, that Ecclesiasticall persons have no jurisdiction within this Realme over Lay men, save in one case; to wit, when the question is concerning the sacraments and spirituall things. This is so farre true, that an Ecclesiasticall Iudge cannot so much as deale in a fault committed by his Lay gaolor for suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a prisoner to make an escape, or in any other offence committed in the gaole; as it was judged by an Arrest given in the Great dayes of <hi>Poictires</hi> the 18 of September 1531; nor in any faults committed by the Proctour of his office if hee bee a Lay man, although he have trespassed in the exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to an Arrest of <hi>Paris</hi> of the 11 of April 1532. Now the Royall Notaries are so farre from being, nay it is so impossible that they should be under the Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, that on the contrarie the Iudges Royall have authoritie over the Apostolicall Notaries. This appears by an Edict of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, made at <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> in September 1547, about the calling in of the Apostolicall Notaries, wherein it is said, <hi>That by the bailiffes, stewards and Presidiall Iudges, every one in his owne power and jurisdiction a sufficient number of the said Notaries shall bee adjudg'd and limited.</hi> Which calling being so made by them and every of them, his will is <hi>That they make choise of the most able and sufficient within their jurisdiction to the number by them determined.</hi> And for the Notaries Royall, it were a superfluous thing to alledge the Decrees which give the Kings Iudges authoritie to punish them in case of any offence or crime by them committed.</p>
               <p n="22">22 The jurisdiction which is given unto Bishops over such married people as have only the single tonsure, is not lesse extraordinarie. A married shaveling hath as good as no priviledge at all in <hi>France,</hi> but is reckoned in the ranke of Lay men, because of the great abuses which have beene heretofore committed in this Kingdome. For, to inlarge the Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction; the time was when Prelates bestowed that tonsure upon all sorts of people, even upon some young infants, some servants, some bastards, and some ignorant and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate married men; yea, and which is more, if the Kings Officers prosecuted any offender, if he but said hee was shav'd, though indeed hee were not, the Ecclesiasticall Iudge would straightwaies hooke unto himself the cognizance of the cause by censures and excommunications. Which was a meanes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders escaping with impunitie, because that they might get off by their purse from the Ecclesiasticall Iudges, upon which occasion all malefactours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined rather to this jurisdiction: as it is prov'd at large in the Articles which were presented to King <hi>Philip,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Peter de Cugneres</hi> against the Clergy of <hi>France.</hi>

               <p n="24">24 And see here another great prejudice done unto us by this Councell, which we must either take a course to remedie, or else all the regall jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                        </gap>ees Popes have usurped over Princes, by their Decrees.</note> First, they made certaine lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ecclesiasticall Order, and concerning Clerks, which they called De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. After this they perswaded lay men to certaine Ordinances by way of entreatie and exhortations, as fasting, and abstaining from certaine meats at certaine times, to obtaine the suffrage and mercie of God: to remove cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine contagions and tempests of the aire from among men; as appeares by the legend of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> and some other Saints. Next, perceiving that the Laity received them willingly, and that they observed them by reason of their devotion, the custome being now growne ancient in such matters, they begunne to alter those institutions which ran by way of entreatie, into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; being so bold as even to strike the transgressours of them with the terrour of an anathema, or verball excommunication; yet alwayes under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of devotion and divine service: and this without licence from the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawgiver.

                     </gap>m by their priests, upon paine of eternall damnation, the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the assembly of their Clergy, undertooke to enact certaine edicts, or oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall and factious ordinances, concerning civill affaires, whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and declared themselves, together with all those that receive their order or office of Clerkship, yea even pure lay men, exempt from all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique charge: admitting even Secular married men to that office, who were easily allured thereunto, that they might enjoy those immunities from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique charges: gaining unto themselves no small part of the people by that meanes, whom they freed from the power of Princes and Magistrates: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring withall to draw yet a great many more from their obedience. By o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther edicts they denounced a curse or anathema against all such as doe any personall injurie, whatsoever to those which are admitted into the number of Clerks; defameing them publiquely in Churches by excommunications, and presenting them neverthelesse to get them punished by the punishments prescribed by humane lawes. But the most horrible thing of all, and which is most exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And not being yet content with these things, but ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the greatnesse of Secular Princes, (contrary to the commandement of Christ and his Apostles) they take licence to make lawes distinct from those which concerne the generalitie of the citizens; by declaring all the Clergie exempt from them, and bringing in a civill division, and a pluralitie of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne principalities. For this is the root and originall of this contagion of the Realme of <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence all scandals grow every day, and as long as it continues, discords will never bee at an end. For the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath enjoyed this power a long time already, upon which hee entered by a covert prevarication by litle and litle; and the boldnesse of one of them hath burst out so farre, that hee hath declared in his writings, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is bound to him by an oath of allegeance, as subject to him by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active jurisdiction: as may bee gathered from the contemptible and ridicu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He addes further,
<q>The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> with their Cardinals durst not call these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious Ordinances, lawes; but they have Christened them by the name of

Which at first they durst not expresse by the name of lawes, fearing the opposition and correction of the lawgiver, considering that therein they incurred the crime of treason. Afterwards they called these their Ordinances, Canon law; to the intent that under colour of the name, though wickedly used, they might bee more authentique; and further to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in faithfull people a credit and reverence, and obedience to them.</q>

In the seventh and eighth Chapters whereof the Clergy man and the Knight conferre together on this wise;
<q>I call (saith the Clerk) and account the Decrees and Decretals of the holy fathers of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee good law, which binde and oblige every true Christian, as a subject and sonne of holy Church our mother.</q>
To whom the Knight replyes,
<q>If the termes of <hi>Rome</hi> be Decrees, or Decretals, Ordinances, or Constitutions touching the temporall affaires of Kings, Princes, or other Secular Lords, you Clerks among your selves shall call and account them law, if you please. But the truth is, no man can establish nor ordaine any thing where he hath no power nor au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. So as the King of <hi>France</hi> hath no power to make a law or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to bind and tie the Empire: so neither can the lawes of the Emperour binde the King of <hi>France</hi> nor his subjects.</q>
And a little after, <hi>I hold it therefore a frivolous thing, and very ridiculous, that the holy Father should make any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Decretal, or Constitution about temporall matters.</hi> And yet the greatest part of them were made about things of that nature.</p>

In which volume of Decretals wee finde many things which degenerate much from that ancient discipline delivered in</hi> Gratians <hi>Decret; and thence rose that common proverb amongst them, That it was never a good world since the Decret tooke wing and flew away.</hi> And presently after,
<q>The other booke is <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight's; which, as wee understand was never received in <hi>France,</hi> because that divers constitutions therein contained were made in hatred and despite of King <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire, and devised for the commoditie of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
He addes yet further,
<q>We are enforced to confesse, betide us well, betide us woe, that the manners of the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> are so degenerate by litle and litle, that the later constitutions of Popes fall short of the former: and it seemes a man may rightly say of them as <hi>Homer</hi> writ; Very few chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are like their fathers in virtue, many worse, scarse any to bee found bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Wherefore as it is necessarie to reduce the manners of Clergy men to their ancient religion; so it would be expedient peradventure to take all that is most true, most pure, and most profitable, in so many divers Papall consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and reduce them into one short volume. And wee are not out of hopes that this may one day bee brought to passe: even during the life of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the third of present being, who hath the bruit and report (I wish it bee not vaine) of one that seriously thinkes upon repairing the ruines of the Church, and restoring the ancient Canons.</q>
The event hath proved that this bruit was vaine; for neither <hi>Iulius</hi> nor any of his Successours ever put his hand to this reformation: unlesse a man would ascribe that to <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, who hath caused many things to bee altered and rased out of those books which were disadvantageous to the Pope, and favourable to <hi>France,</hi> and all those whose rights are usurped by the Pope.</p>

               <p n="1">1 HAving approved and confirm'd the Popes Decrees and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals, it was necessary they should condemne those many bookes that are in the world which teach a quite contrary doctrine. For they are as so many witnesses of the so many errours and falsities as are in them, and of the folly of those which approved them. Our Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> thought they could not by this charge upon any that would better quit himselfe of it than his Holinesse himselfe, considering it so nearly concernes his copihold. This is the reason they decree in this manner.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>The holy Councell in the second Session holden under our holy Father</hi> Pius <hi>the fourth, made a committee to certaine select Fathers that they should consider what was requisite to be done concerning divers censures and suspected or pernicious books, and that they should make report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the holy Councell; hearing now that they have finished th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s worke, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by reason of the multitude and variety of bookes it cannot bee distinctly examined by the holy Synod; it therefore commands that whatsoever hath beene done by them in this particular bee presented to the most holy Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be concluded and set out by his judgement and authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 This Canon must be rightly understood with all its ampliations, whereof the first is, That power is not onely given to the Pope to determine and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish what had beene alreadie done, but also to doe the like for ever after with all bookes wherein should bee found any thing that may be offensive to him. The words of the Decree seeme repugnant to this in some kinde, when they speake of that which hath beene done alreadie; but our Doctors say that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia non sunt restringenda.</hi> Next, it belongs to the Popes to put expositions upon the Canons and Decrees of this Councell; for that power is given unto them in expresse termes, at the end of the last Session. Now the Popes have understood it so, and those which came after have not omitted to doe their endeavour in this kinde, so that a man would wrong them to accuse them of negligence. The last impression of their <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> set forth at <hi>Paris</hi> by <hi>Laurence Sonnius</hi> the yeare 1599 will alwaies serve them for a just defence, which carries this inscription: <hi>The Index of bookes prohibited, with the rules made by the Fathers select by the Councell of</hi> Trent, <hi>first published by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of</hi> Pius <hi>the fourth, afterwards augmented by</hi> Sixtus <hi>the fift, and now lastly revised and set forth by the command of our holy Father</hi> Clement <hi>the eight.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised (that no scruple bee left) signifies as much as augmented, afterwards. Which is necessary: for those many wicked bookes must be excommunicated which say worse than hang'em to our later Popes, the Authors of our warres, and almost to all the rest, yea (which is more grievous) to the Popedome it

The second ampliation is, That power is given unto him to condemne all those bookes as hereticall which were made in defence of the lawes, power, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Emperours, Kings, and Princes; and that so farre forth as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be spoken of but as vassals and feudetaries to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to bestow any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title, qualitie, or prerogative upon them, is to speake blasphemie against the holy Sec.</p>

They have not spared even Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the second himselfe, not content with that declaration which he set forth in his Bull, declaring all that to be hereticall which he had written against the Popes authoritie when he was called <hi>AEneas Sylvius,</hi> and by consequent the booke which he intitled <hi>De origine &amp; authoritate Imperatoris Romani,</hi> where he speakes of Imperiall lawes in other termes than the Popes doe, to the prejudice of their Decretals. Our Lawyer <hi>Baldwin,</hi> for all he was an enemie to the Hugenots, yet could not escape the furie of <hi>Rome,</hi> but was condemned as a Heretique for a booke which he made, <hi>Of the Ecclesiasticall and Civill Lawes of the Emperour</hi> Constantine. And because he gives the Emperours too much power over Ecclesiasticall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline; whereas by the doctrine of our Popes they are no more but meere executioners of their Decrees and Constitutions, having no power to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle further.</p>
               <p n="4">4 All other bookes which have treated of the Imperiall or Royall power, whether for temporall matters, exempting them from the power or iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Popes, or for spirituall and ecclesiasticall discipline, have undergone the like condemnation, and amongst others that which beares this title, <hi>What manner of power it is that belongs to Kings.</hi> The historie of <hi>Francis Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> where he speakes of the usurpation of Popes, and the progresse of them.

               <p n="5">5 The third ampliation is, That they have power to abolish and condemne all those books and writings which have been published at divers times in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Councels, and of the authoritie of the Church against the usurpations of Popes. And upon this consideration it is that the book of <hi>Zabarel</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Florence,</hi> concerning schisme, was condemned, together with some others whereof we have spoken already. The counsell of the Abbat of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normo</hi> made in defence of the Councel of <hi>Basil</hi>: The book of <hi>AEneas Sylvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> of the same Councel of <hi>Basil</hi>; which troubles them infinitely.

               <p n="6">6 The fourth ampliation is, That it is lawfull for them to enroll amongst these the writings of all such as have recorded the vices and abuses of the Popes Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand a reformation thereof: Or who have spoke of them by way of complaint, or otherwise: as <hi>Theodoric</hi> of <hi>Nihem,</hi> one of their Officers, who hath told us strange stories of the lives of Popes during their schisme. Cardinall <hi>Benno,</hi> who hath told us wonders of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seventh, who was called <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and some other Popes that lived before him. <hi>Nicholas de Clemangiis</hi> a devine of <hi>Paris,</hi> who speaks very freely, after the <hi>French</hi> fashion, of the abuses of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The hundred grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, put up in the Dict of <hi>Noremberg</hi> in the yeare 1522, by the Catholique Princes, and other States there assembled, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the future Councel, which was afterwards called at <hi>Trent</hi>: (See what justice was done to them in this case.) As also all the tracts put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a book, intitled, <hi>Fasciculus rerum expetendarum &amp; fugiendarum,</hi> which concerne especially this reformation; and others in great abundance.</p>

The Emperours <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> declare the vassals and tenants of the Church lyable to the same services that others are.

For by meanes of them they have disposed of Kingdomes and Empires, Dutchies and Principalities, Cities, Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and other such like things. So our Councell useth them against duells, against Combatants and their Seconds: depriving them of their Cities and Places where such Duells shall bee fought, and these of their inheritance: and that by virtue of an Excommunication which shall bee thundred out against them. Besides what we have spoke already concerning the disposall of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall matters, wee have elsewhere proved that it is an unjust and unlawfull thing to extend excommunications to mens goods, to deprive such men of them to whom of right they appertaine.

The Histories thereof are knowne to all men; and they have been so canvased in divers writings set out during our late troubles, that it will bee fitting to overpasse them, that wee renew not the memorie of our former miseries. We will only say that some Popes have in good sincerity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this right and prerogative of our Kings: yea, which is more, they have confirmed it by their Buls; declaring thereby that the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot bee excommunicated, nor his Kingdome interdicted: and amongst others, <hi>Martin</hi> the third and fourth; <hi>Gregory</hi> the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh; <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth; <hi>Clement</hi> the fourth and fifth; <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third; <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the fifth; and <hi>Boniface</hi> the twelfth, whose Buls are yet preserved in the

See here the place taken out of one of his Epistles which hee writ to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Sens</hi>:</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>I say confidently and boldly, that if a Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath offended against his brother, and will not give eare to the admonitions which should bee divers times given by the Church, I say that same Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>by the commandement of God, must bee accounted as an Heathen and a Publicane: For by how much the degree is higher, by so much the fall is greater. But if hee account us unworthie of his communion, forasmuch as none of us will consent with him in that which is against the Gospel, hee cannot therefore sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the communion of Christ.</hi> And presently after; <hi>We should not therefore give this advantage to our ill-willers, as to make the Priesthood, which is but one in all places, as the Catholique Church is but one, seeme to bee subject to one man only; in such sort, that if hee be corrupted by money, or favour, or fear, or ignorance, no man can bee Priest but hee that shall be commended unto him by such virtues as these.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 Whence wee collect, that the Popes have no more power over our Kings, in matter of excommunications, than other Bishops, whether of their owne Kingdome, or strangers. The Courts of Parliament of this Realme (and especially that of <hi>Paris</hi>) have alwaies stood out against such excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have declared them to bee frivolous, nullities, and abusive: yea and have proceeded with rigour and severitie against the bearers of them. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests given out against the Buls of <hi>Benedict</hi> the thirteenth, the two <hi>Gregories</hi> the thirteenth and fourteenth, are sufficient witnesses hereof. Now it is not only true that our Kings cannot be excommunicated: but, which is more, they may absolve such of their subjects as are excluded from the Communion of the Church: yea they are accounted to restore them to their former state, by the meere admitting of them to their table, or into their company. This is a thing which wee finde upon record in the Capitularie of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in these words; <hi>If the Royall power doe receive any delinquents into favour, or admit them to his table, they shall be likewise received into the assemblies of the people and Clergy in Ecclesiasticall communion; to the intent that the ministers of God may not reject what the pietie of the Prince doth admit.</hi> The Prelats of <hi>France</hi> have observed this law at other times. <hi>Ivo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chartres</hi> saith, hee practised it towards one <hi>Gervase,</hi>

Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> writ to the Orientall Bishops,
<q>That Christian Princes were wont to obey the Decrees of the Church, and not preferre their owne power. To submit their owne heads to Bishops, not sit as Iudges of theirs.</q>
These are the Glosses of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> upon the forecited Decree: all taken out of <hi>Gratians</hi> Decree; all hammered out and whetted in the Popes forge.</p>

The Glossatour infers:
<q>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Princes of the earth are inferiour to Bishops. Which is true. But if the King have many Bishopriques within his Realme, before which of them shall he treat of his spirituall cases? Hee shall treat of them before that Bishop in whose territorie hee makes his principall residence.</q>
Which glosse is approved and followed by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists that comment upon that place. And wee need not wonder if they would have the King to repaire to the Bishop to treat of spirituall matters. For there are some of them that left it in writing, that if the Bishops bee out of the fiefs or mannors which they hold, they are not bound to call Kings by their names, nor to acknowledge them for Kings, not so much as for the goods temporall of the Church. It is a Pope that pronounced this sentence, by name <hi>Innocent</hi> the third.</p>
               <p n="9">9 We forgot to tell how our Canonists are entered upon a profound piece of Philosopie, to know exactly how much the Sun is bigger than the Moone: for without the knowledge of this point they cannot resolve how much the Papall dignitie surpasseth the Imperiall, inasmuch as this is the ell with which they must be measured; the Pope being by <hi>Innocent</hi> the third compared to the Sunne, and the Emperour to the Moone. The Glosse upon that Chapter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the case thus:
<q>Wherefore seeing the Earth is seven times bigger than the Moone, and the Sunne eight times bigger than the Earth, it followes that the Papall dignitie is fortie seven times bigger than the Royall.</q>
                  <hi>Iohn Andreas</hi> observes there is a fault in this glosse.
<q>In other copies (saith he) it is ten times foure; in others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> fortie times: but neither this nor that can stand with the supputation of the Glosse. For if the Earth be seven times greater than the Moone, and the Sunne eight times greater than the Earth, the Sunne must then be eight times seven times greater than the Moone, and therefore it is fifty six times greater.</q>
For eight times seven make fifty six. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> in his censure upon this place, takes notice of this diversity of reading, which is more to his owne advantage. <hi>In other copies</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is fifty times seven

<q>We are in such a taking (saith hee, speaking of the Prelates of his times) that we seeme to outvie the pride of the Princes of this world; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because we doe not understand, or doe not respect the commandment of Christ: and after the fashion of Kings wee desire to have weapons of terrour to march before us.</q>
Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith likewise,
<q>That the Princes of this world are for ruling over such as are inferiour to them, for bringing them into subjection, and spoiling them (when they deserve it) and for serving their turnes of them, to their commodity and for their honour, even to death. But the Prelates of the Church are ordained to serve such as are inferiour to them, and to minister unto them all that they have received from Christ, &amp;c. It is not then either just or profitable to desire primacy in the Church. For what wise man is there that, with his good wil, would submit himself to such a servitude, and undergoe such a danger, as to bee bound to give account for all the Church, unlesse perhaps some that is not afraid of Gods judgement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing his Ecclesiasticall primacy in a worldly way, by converting it into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power?</q>
And what is this else but turning the Ecclesiasticall dignity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a secular, to dispute so much about honour and place, not against other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastiques (which were more tolerable) but against the Princes of the earth, the respect and observance of whom was so much recommended unto them? to declare them their inferiours, their subjects, their vassals, perverting all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both divine and humane? Where is there any earthly Prince or Monarch that ever made such a goodly shew and boast of their greatnesses and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences as the Popes have done?

<q>That in stead of bread hee gave his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest sons Scorpions; that they laid the blame of all that was done to their Prince upon him, that he robb'd his eldest sonne of the honour which is due unto him; that hee arrogated unto himselfe power and authoritie over the Councell; that he prescribed unto it, what it shall doe; that the <hi>French</hi> will not acknowledge him for Pope: and see what they did.</q>
After that the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadours had commanded the Prelats of <hi>France,</hi> that they should depart from the Councell, they themselves retired to <hi>Venice.</hi>

               <p>See here a suit for our Kings, which they may thank this Councell for. They can never approve the Acts of it, without doing unto themselves a most grosse prejudice. That will bee asmuch as giving the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> a title, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will endeavour to make his cause good hereafter. And there is no other way to ward this blow but by rejecting the Councell: considering withall the great favours done by it unto the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not only in this but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. So when there is any occasion of making answere to his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours, this Councell cannot finde words significant enough to expresse their commendations, wherein it is too excessive; and on the contrary, too reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and sparing when there is any question about them of <hi>France.</hi> And in stead

An <hi>English</hi> Historian saith, the King of <hi>France</hi> is accounted the chiefe amongst all Kings. In briefe it is the common opinion of all the Doctours that ever writ of it: to seeke no further, even of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p n="14">14 I will content my selfe with setting downe here in this place what hath beene spoken of this point by one of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> owne subjects. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celot Conrade</hi> by name, as considering that his testimony is authentique and void of all suspicion. <hi>The Doctors</hi> (saith he) <hi>doe sometimes dispute which of all the Kings is to have the first degree of honour, and who is preferred above all the rest. But they seeme generally to agree, that this honour belongs entirely to the King of</hi> France: <hi>for he is styled the most Christian King; and is above all Kings at this day, and takes place of them: as</hi> Baldus <hi>teacheth</hi> Ad §. ult.

Ego pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. volum. 3. <hi>that no man may pretend any prerogative of honour against the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the King of</hi> France. Hee afterwards comes to speake of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whom he highly extols for his power, greatnesse, and titles; yet so as for matter of order he alwayes makes him inferiour to the King of <hi>France.</hi> And yet for all that he was his Prince, and <hi>Conrade</hi> his naturall subject, as being a native and inhabitant of the towne of <hi>Lauda</hi> within the Duchy of <hi>Milan.</hi> For marke what hee saith himselfe of it when he reckons up the titles of the King of <hi>Spaine. He is King, Prince, Arch. Duke, Duke and Lord of divers townes: and was not long agoe made Duke of</hi> Milan, <hi>our Lord and our Duke.</hi> There is yet more in it: namely, that the saying of this Doctour was confirmed and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by a Decree of the Senate of <hi>Milan,</hi> that is, by one of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Soveraigne Courts.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15 And yet for all that, he was the man who would have put the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in equipage with ours at the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> testifies.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Onuphrius in Pio</hi> 4.</note> It is true which hee addes that the same Pope gave the precedency of honour to our Kings Ambassadour at <hi>Rome. Not long after</hi> (saith he) <hi>when there arose a controversie betwixt the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Spanish <hi>Ambassadours who should have the more honourable place in publique assemblies, which was hatched long before by meanes of</hi> Francis Varga: <hi>the Pope after much dodging at last adjudged the first place to the</hi> French, <hi>after he had beene long plodding about a forme of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but could finde none. For the</hi> Spaniard <hi>denied the precedency to the</hi> French, <hi>and the</hi> French <hi>would not endure that he should be made equall with him.</hi> But there is alwayes in the Popes exactions as well as in the decrees of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, somewhat in the fag-end that spoiles all. For marke what followes. <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion,</hi> Ludovicus Requesenius, <hi>great commander of</hi> Castile, <hi>and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of</hi> Spaine, <hi>being displeased, departed from</hi> Rome, <hi>after hee had made his publique protestation to the Pope, which the Pope admitted, and promised him he would judge of it.</hi> I know not how he meanes to proceed in it: for to judge after he hath once determined it himselfe, to what purpose? seeing there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o new evidence come in, and that he was so long a consulting about that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he passed. To referre it to a Councell, that were as much as to confesse himselfe inferiour to it: he will beware of that blow. So you see we are put upon the quarrell againe.</p>
               <p n="16">16 After that there were some Popes that altered the place which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Ambassadours and they of other Kings used to have in their Chappell, &amp; made choice of another altogether inconvenient, to the intent that they not accepting of it, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadours should not lose the precedency, which fell out accordingly. And from that time forwards there hath beene a contention about precedency betwixt the Ambassadours of the two Kings. Which was debated at <hi>Venice</hi> when the league was concluded against the Turke betwixt the Pope, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Ambassadour entreated that the <hi>French</hi> might not assist at the Ceremonies. But the Signiory thought it fit that he should hold that ranke of honour which belonged unto him. And so he did. It is true the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was a Church man, to slip his necke out of the collar, desired that he might sing Masse: which was granted unto him. As for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath, for some late yeares, had so much succour and favour there, that nothing could be hoped for from thence but to the disadvantage of the <hi>French.</hi> The nonage of King <hi>Charles</hi> emboldened the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to call his honours in question: our by-past follies have made him attempt upon the State, for his successours. But he that preserved and restored it, as he surpasseth all the Kings of the earth in glorious atchievements, will one day put a period to this dispute.</p>

<q>Reverend father in God, wee send greeting to you. Reverend father in God, it hath pleased the king to grant unto the Presidents, Counsellours, and other Officers of this Court, his letters and nomination to some benefices which are in the hands of some Conferrours and Patrons of this Realme, and among others to our brother such a Counsellour of our said Soveraigne in this Court, to the benefices which are in your gift and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall. Wherefore we most earnestly beseech you, that in obedience to the said letters, and in consideration of the deserts of our said brother, you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon him the first benefice that fals in your gift, being by him required thereunto. And in so doing you shall doe us a most acceptable courtesie, for which we shall take your affaires into speciall recommendation. Reverend Father in God, we beseech the blessed Sonne of God to grant you your desire. Written at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Parliament, under the seale thereof, the seventh day of September, the men celebrating the Kings Parliament.</q>

                  <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, and others, which are received even by the Popes themselves and other Clergy men, doe fully prove it. Now there is no question but the power which they have in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar they might derive it upon the person of their Officers. The Clergy have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes suffered the use of this practice. It is true, that as in other things they have gone about to hooke in unto themselves the whole administration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, so have they endeavoured to doe the like in this case; not directly, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely. For in proceeding to censures by virtue of the command of the Iudge Royall, they have gone about to get the cognizance of the revelations made in consequence of those censures, by that meanes robbing the Iudge of his juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="6">6 As for the other point, where they say that the cognizance of censures belongs not to Secular Iudges, the contrary is evident from those reasons which have beene urg'd already; whereto wee will adde use and practice. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that in all ages, secular Princes, their Officers and Magistrates, or other their Committees have judged of abuses, befalling in excommunications and interdicts: have stopped the unjust proceedings of Popes and other Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiques; have bridled their too bold enterprizes, their passionate maledictions. The Courts Royall of this Kingdome were wont to grant the courtesie of an absolution by way of caution to the appellant as from abuse, whether Clergy man or lay (without any prejudice to the right of the parties) and compell the Bishop to endure it even by the seizure of his temporals. It is one of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church. By an Arrest of the twelfth of December 1468,

Their suit was declared irreceivable into the Court, and they condemned to pay charges. Gallus</hi> gives this reason, Because such Donation was contrary to the substance of their Order. I have an ancient copie of the Arrests of this Parliament concerning the King and the temporall justice, where the fact is related otherwise, yet so as the substance is much alike.
<q>Betwixt the Fryers Mendicants plaintiffes, of the one partie, and <hi>Isabel de Palais</hi> inheretrix of <hi>Ioan Paumer</hi> defendresse, on the other party. By an Arrest of the Court it was said that the Provost of <hi>Paris</hi> had not judged right, and the said <hi>Isabel</hi> did well to appeale; for as much as he had condemned her to pay and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to each of the said two orders, (namely the Predicants and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melites) twenty pound rent, given to them by legacy, together with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements and arrerages which should be raised of it, and the charges. And had determin'd the contrary for the other two Orders, because they had not exhibited their titles. And it was said by the same Arrest that the said Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants ought not to be admitted in the suit which they commenced, every one of them for twenty pound rent given unto them by legacy by the said <hi>Ioan.</hi> And the said Court did reserve unto it selfe the power of disposing of the said revenew for the soule of the said <hi>Ioan</hi> deceased. Pronounced the twenty fourth of March 1385.</q>

And what Popes and Councels tooke upon them in this regard, was by their toleration.

<q>The Pope cannot convert any Legacies, though they be given to charitable uses, or to any other use, contrary to the will of the deceased; save only in such cases when the will cannot be formally observed, or where there is a necessitie of making such commutation: alwaies provided that in such cases it be equivalent to that which was ordained by the testament, or other disposall made by the last will of the deceased; the cognizance wherof notwithstanding belongs to the Lay Iudge, except for the case of conscience.</q> Now suppose the Pope chance to make any such commutations without a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall and lawfull cause, it belongs to the Court of Parliament to reforme them upon appeals as from abuse, which are wont to bee put up in such cases; who must have their hands tyed, if this Councel be admitted.</p>

In this they take too much upon them, that they wold have al things put in execution without the Princes consent or privitie, and perhaps even against his will. It hath alwaies belonged to Kings and Emperours to approve the Canons and Decrees of Councels. Wee have proved it in the third Book by many plaine examples taken out of all antiquitie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Wee wee will adde in behalf of <hi>France,</hi> that the Councell of <hi>Basil</hi> used another manner of respect towards our King, when at two several times it sent forth Deputies, with expresse commission into this Kingdome to get their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We say then that to give out such commands to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons and Vniversities, is all one as to set up two Monarchies in <hi>France,</hi> and other Kingdomes. All this should bee referred to Kings and Princes; and they by their authoritie, after they have approved and allowed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of a Councell, should cause them to bee put in execution and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The late king <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the States of <hi>France</hi> assembled at <hi>Blois</hi> in the yeare 1579, knowing this very well, made certaine lawes concerning Ecclesiasticall discipline, in some sort conformable to these of the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> in many matters, without making any mention of it. Whereby they give us to understand, that the proceedings of it displeased them, and that they would not receive the Decrees and Constitutions thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But the worst is yet, that such as are refractorie must be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the authoritie Royall, and the exalting of the Papall. O that God would unseele the eyes of the Princes and Monarchs of the earth, that they might see it clearly! Provinciall, and also Diocesan Synods are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise bound publiquely to anathematize and detest all the Heresies which are condemned by this Councell: which may ingender troubles in those places where two religions are tolerated. As as also the prohibition made to Bishops that they shall not allow any to preach, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And there is no question but after the admission of the Councell, suite will be made for the abolishing of that Religion which is tolerated by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts; considering that the Councel hath past the sentence of condemnation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and that after the pronunciation of a sentence, it is necessarie to proceed to the execution of it. Besides, there is no more hope of agreement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union left; for those that have judgement given for their advantage, will be sure not to remit any thing of it, and the rest will never stand to such an unjust condemnation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Towards the beginning of the first booke wee have spoken of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage sent to King <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, in behalfe of the Pope, the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for the receiving of this Councel, and we have made it appeare that the end of it was, they were faine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to intreaties.

This Councell declares all to bee heretiques which follow the doctrine by it condemned, and doth anathematize them.</p>
               <p n="6">6 In the rules which were made by authoritie of this Councel concerning prohibited books, so many words as there are, so oft almost is there mention of the Inquisitours. Which gives us plainely to wit, that they are destined to be the executioners of this Councell. And when the Pope shall establish them, who shall say unto him, he ought not to do it, being he is made omnipotent? Besides, Inquisitours are now adaies onely for Heretiques. I say, they would seeme to be for none but them. Where then shall they be rather established than where they are in the midst of us, namely in the Realme of <hi>France</hi>?

As for the Canons, although we never undertooke the defence of those that condemne them, yet wee shall say by the way, that though they bee indited upon them, yet it would trouble a bad Lawyer to cast them by them.
