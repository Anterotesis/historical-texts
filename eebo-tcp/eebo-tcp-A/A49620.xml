            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It were needleſſe to tell you, by how many titles this little Orphan booke, claimes the honour of your Lord<hi rend="sup">ps</hi> protection. Firſt, by the law of nature, its parent dying in your ſeruice, you stand bound to bee a

But to paſſe by theſe two, there is yet a third reaſon, wherby it will appeare, not the effect of choiſe, but of neceſſity, that it should come forth vnder the fauour of your name: The wellgrounded experience which you haue gained in your trauells; the exacte and iudicious account you are able to giue of the places you haue ſeen, which make a great part of the ſubiect of this booke; the mature iudgment of the intereſts of ſtates, and manners of people wherof it treats, which in you is not the after fruit of age;

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER, CONCERNING TRAVELLING.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I firſt ſet pen to Paper to handle this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I had not the leaſt thought of the <hi>preſſe;</hi> nor of erecting my ſelfe into an <hi>Author.</hi> J onely diſcharged my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory haſtily of ſome things which J had ſeen, in <hi>Italy;</hi> and wrapt vp that vntimely <hi>Embrio</hi> in fiue sheets of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for the vſe of a noble perſon, who ſet me that taske. Yet this <hi>Embrio</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon for whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, obliged me to lick it ouer and ouer againe, and bring it into better forme. Second thoughts, and ſucceding voyages into <hi>Italy,</hi> haue finished it at laſt; and haue made it what it is; <hi>A compleat Voyage,</hi> and an exact <hi>Itinerary</hi> through <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I thought to haue drawne
<pb facs="tcp:52976:8"/>
bridle and reſted, after ſo long a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; when a learned friend hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed this my <hi>Deſcription</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> deſired much to ſee a <hi>Preface</hi> to it, of my fashion, and <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Traueling.</hi> I could refuſe nothing to ſuch a freind; and haue done it here willingly, both for my owne, and my countryes ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my owne sake;</hi> to preexcuſe ſome things in my booke, which ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may diſlike.</p>
            <p>For ſome, I feare, will quarrel with my English; and juſtly, ſeeing three long voyages into <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſix into <hi>France,</hi> fiue into <hi>Italy,</hi> one into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> haue made mee, liue half of my life time in forrain countryes, to the diſturbance of my owne language. Yet if J bring not home fine language, J bring home fine things: and I haue ſeen great Ladyes, both in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> buy finde things of <hi>chimney-ſweepers,</hi> and <hi>Pedlars,</hi> that ſpoke but courſe <hi>Lombard</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and groſſe <hi>Scotch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others perchance will finde fault, that J write merrily ſometimes: And why not? Seeing I write to young men, and for them: and mirth is neuer ſo lawfull as in traueling, where it shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
<pb facs="tcp:52976:8"/>
long miles, and ſweetens bad vſage; that is, makes a bad <hi>dinnar</hi> go downe, and a bad <hi>horſe</hi> go on.</p>
            <p>Others will ſay, that I fill my booke with too much <hi>Latin:</hi> But theſe muſt be minded, that I am writing of the <hi>Latin</hi> country; and that I am caruing for <hi>Schollers,</hi> who can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſolid bitts, hauing good ſtomacks.</p>
            <p>Others will ſay, J ieere now and then: And would any man haue me go through ſo many diuers countries, and prayſe all I ſee? Or in earneſt, do not ſome things deſerue to be ieered? when things cannot be cured but by ieering, ieering, ſayth <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is a duty: and I thinke the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſtruck as great a blow at vice, as the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others will ſay, I change ſtile often, and ſometimes ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:52976:9"/>
ought we to haue ſeueral words in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them.</p>
            <p>Others will ſay, I affect a world of exotick words not yet naturalized in <hi>England</hi>: No, I affect them not; I cannot auoyd them: For who can ſpeak of <hi>Statues,</hi> but he muſt ſpeak of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> or of <hi>Churches,</hi> Wrought <hi>Tombes,</hi> or inlayd <hi>Tables;</hi> but hee muſt speak of <hi>Coupolas;</hi> of <hi>baſſi ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieui;</hi> and of <hi>pietre commeſſe?</hi> If any man vnderſtand them not, its his fault, not mine.</p>
            <p>Others will ſay, I hunt too much after <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and Church anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quityes. No, I onely meet them. And as a man cannot ſpeak of <hi>Hercules,</hi> but he muſt ſpeak of <hi>clubbs,</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,</hi> of <hi>Labours,</hi> and <hi>victories</hi>: ſo I cannot ſpeak of <hi>Rome</hi> the Christian, but I muſt ſpeake of <hi>Relicks, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> Yet I beleeue, I giue my Reader a full drought to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of prophane <hi>antiquityes, Maſcarades, Shews, dreſſings,</hi> and <hi>paſſetimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others in fine will ſay, that I do but a thing done allready; ſeeing two others haue written of this ſubiect in <hi>English.</hi> Well; if others haue written vpon this ſubiect, why may not I? They did the
<pb facs="tcp:52976:9"/>
beſt they could, I beleeue; but they drew not vp the ladder after them. The one writes much of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupp. M. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> and ſays little: the other writes little and leaueth out much; which I impute to the ones writing out of old Geographers, long after he had been there: and to the others short stay in <hi>Italy,</hi> when he was there. And if theſe ingenious gentlemen haue painted out <hi>Italy</hi> in <hi>buſto</hi> onely, and <hi>profile;</hi> why may not I paint her out at <hi>full face,</hi> and <hi>at her full length</hi>? If they, like ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaryes, haue repreſented <hi>Italy</hi> vnto vs like a <hi>naked ſtatue;</hi> I haue ſet her out in all her <hi>beſt Attire,</hi> and <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</hi> And thus much for my owne ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my countryes ſake;</hi> To read to my countrymen two profitable <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> The firſt, <hi>of the Profit of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling.</hi> The ſecond: <hi>of Traueling with profit.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. For the first, to wit <hi>the Profit of Traueling,</hi> its certain, that if this world be a great <hi>booke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The profit of trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> as <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:52976:10"/>
the dull follow in <hi>Pliny,</hi> who could neuer learne to count further then fiue, they dwell allwayes vpon one leſſon. They are like an acquaintance of mine, who had alwayes a booke indeed lyeing open upon a deske; but it was obſerued that it lay allwayes open at one and the ſame place, and by long cuſtome, could lye open no where elſe. He then that will know much out of this great booke, the world, muſt read much in it: and as <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> is ſetforth by <hi>Homer</hi> as the wiſeſt of all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> becauſe he had traueled much, and had ſeen <hi>multorum hominum mores &amp; Vrbes, the Cittyes and cuſtomes of many men:</hi> ſo his ſonn <hi>Telemachus</hi> is held for a very shallow witted man: and <hi>Homer</hi> giues the reaſon, becauſe his mother <hi>Penelope,</hi> inſtead of ſending him abroad to ſee forrain countryes, had allwayes kept him at home, and ſo made him a meere <hi>Onocephalus,</hi> and a homeling <hi>Mammacuth.</hi> So true is the ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that <hi>Imperitum eſt animal homo, &amp; ſine magna experientia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſi circumſcribatur Natalis ſoli ſui fine.</hi>

               <hi>2</hi> Traueling preſerues my yong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
<pb facs="tcp:52976:10"/>
from ſurfeiting of his parents, and weanes him from the dangerous fondneſs of his mother. It teacheth him wholeſome hardship; to lye in beds that are none of his acquaintance; to ſpeak to men he neuer ſaw before; to trauel in the morning before day, and in the euening after day; to endure any horſe and weather, as well as any meat and drink. Whereas my country gentleman that neuer traueled, can ſcarce go to <hi>London</hi> without makeing his <hi>Will,</hi> at leaſt without wetting his <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher.</hi> And what generous mother will not ſay to her ſonn with that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? <hi>Malo tibi malè eſſe,</hi>

And I haue read that many of the old <hi>Romans</hi> put out their children to be nurced abroad by <hi>Lacedemonian nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> till they were three yeares old; then they put them to their <hi>Vncles,</hi> till ſeauen, or tenn; then they ſent them into <hi>Toſcany</hi> to be inſtructed in <hi>Religion;</hi> and at laſt into <hi>Greece</hi> to ſtuddy <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>

               <hi>4.</hi> Traueling takes off, in ſome ſort, that <hi>aboriginal curſe,</hi> which was layd vpon mankind euen allmoſt at the beginning of the world; I meane, the <hi>confuſion of tongues</hi>: which is ſuch a curſe indeed, that it makes men, who are of one kind, and made to be
<pb facs="tcp:52976:11"/>
ſociable, ſo ſtrangely to fly one an other, that, as great <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſayth, A man had rather be with his dog, then with a man whoſe language he vnderſtands not. Nay, this diuerſity of language, makes the wiſeſt man paſſe for a foole in a ſtrange country, and the beſt man, for an excommunicated perſon, whoſe conuerſation all men auoyd. Now, traueling takes off this <hi>curſe,</hi> and this moral <hi>excommunication,</hi> by making vs learne many languages, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe freely with people of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes.</p>

               <hi>6.</hi> Traueling enables a man much for his countryes ſeruice. It makes the <hi>merchant</hi> rich, by shewing him what
<pb facs="tcp:52976:12"/>
abounds, &amp; wantes, in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes; that ſo he may know what to import, what to export. It makes the <hi>mechanick</hi> come loaden home with a world of experimental knowledge for the improueing of his trade. It makes the <hi>feild officer,</hi> a knowing Leader of an army, by teaching him where an army in forrain countryes, can march ſecurely, paſſe riuers eaſily, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp ſafely, auoid ambuſcades and narrow paſſages diſcretly, and retreat orderly. It makes the <hi>Common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> play the ſpy wel, by making him ſpeak the ennemyes language perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſo mingling with them, he may find their deſignes, and croſſe their plottes. In fine, it makes a <hi>nobleman</hi> fitt for the nobleſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, to bee <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> abroad for his king in forrain coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, and carry about with him his kings <hi>perſon,</hi> which he repreſents, and his kings <hi>word,</hi> which he engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

            <p>As for the <hi>Parents,</hi> their greatest care ought to be of prouideing there children (I ſpeak to men of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) a good <hi>Gouernour,</hi> to trauel with them, and haue a care of their <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>breeding</hi>: that is, play the part of the <hi>Archangel Raphaël</hi>

Seing then yong youths are the future hopes of families, and Commonwealths, their education ought not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but to men of great parts and excellent breeding.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is like his <hi>shirt,</hi> which is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes next vnto his skinn and perſon; and therefore as yong Noblemen are curious to haue their <hi>shirts</hi> of the fineſt linnen: ſo should they haue their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours</hi> of the fineſt thread, and the beſt ſpunn men that can be found. Hence the ancients as they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in honouring the memory of thoſe that had binn <hi>Gouernours</hi> to great <hi>Heroes,</hi> as of <hi>Chyron, Gouernour</hi> of <hi>Hercules, Iaſon, Paris, Achilles,</hi> and other braue heroes; <hi>Miſcus Gouernour</hi> of <hi>Vlyſſes; Eudorus</hi> of <hi>Patroclus; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> of <hi>Hector; Epitides</hi> of <hi>Iulus, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas</hi> of <hi>Theſeus;</hi> all of them choyce men: So they were in chooſeing the rar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men for that great employment,

Others I haue knowne who hauing their miſtreſſes in the country, perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their yong <hi>pupils,</hi> men of great birth, that it was fine liuing in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try houſe, that is, fine carrying a gunn vpon their necks, and walking a foot.

            </p>
            <p>But to returne againe to our ſubject, the <hi>Parent</hi> hauing found out ſuch a <hi>Gouernour</hi> for his ſonn, as we haue deſcribed here aboue, he muſt reſigne ouer vnto him his full Authority, and command his ſonn to obey him: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let the <hi>Gouernour</hi> be the wiſeſt, and the moſt compleat man in the world, if his pupil do not obey him,

and follow his counſel, all will go wrong. I haue ſeen great diſorders befall for want of this.

And my reaſon is this; For ſeing the intention of traueling, is to make a man a wiſe man, not a finical man, its better to ſeaſon his minde betimes with a ſtayd wiſe breeding, then to fill it vp to the brime at firſt, with a phantaſtical giddy breeding, which hauing once gotten poſſeſſion of the minde, bolts the doore on the inſide, locks out all ſtaydneſs, and makes my yong man delight in nothing but <hi>vanity, clothes, danceing, liueryes, bals,</hi> and ſuch meere outſides.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Geneua,</hi>

                  <p>The things which I ſaw in <hi>Geneua</hi> were theſe: 1. The great <hi>Church of</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> the <hi>Cathedral</hi> anciently of the Bishop of this towne.

                     <hi>Bouillon</hi> General of the army of <hi>Germans,</hi> called then in France the <hi>Reiters,</hi> who in the battle of <hi>Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau</hi> were beaten by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and forced to fly to Geneua, haueing laſt 1800 of their men vpon the place, moſt of them with charmes about their necks, which they thought would haue made them shott free. Mounting vp to the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſaw a fair <hi>Bell</hi> with a <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix</hi> caſt vpon it, shewing whoſe it was; and four good <hi>peices of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> that none may ſay, the <hi>Church of Geneua</hi> wants <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Cannons.</hi> And a little below in the <hi>Belfree,</hi> there liue in ſeueral Chambers, three or four families of <hi>husbands</hi> and wifes and ſucking children begotten there; contrary to the <hi>Canons</hi> of any other Church, except thoſe of <hi>Geneua.</hi> From the top of this Church you haue a fair proſpect vpon the lake and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring countryes; which makes them brag here, that they can ſee from their ſteeple, into ſix ſeueral principalities, to wit, their owne, <hi>France, Sauoye, Swiſſerland,</hi> the

                     <hi>Valeſians,</hi> and the <hi>Franchecounty</hi>: But I told them, it would be a greater brag, to ſay, that they could ſee into no other country, or dominions but their owne. 2. I ſaw the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> little, but well ſtored with defenſiue armes. They neuer forget to shew the <hi>Ladders</hi> of the <hi>Sauoyards,</hi> who attempted to ſurpize this towne by ſcaleing, but were themſelues taken and beheaded <hi>à la chaude,</hi> leaſt ſome <hi>Prince</hi> should haue interceded for them. 3.

                  <p>As for the Gouerment of this towne, it was anciently Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and the Bishop was Prince of it vnder the <hi>Duke of Sauoye</hi>: but <hi>Farel</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> comeing hither with their anarchical <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> droue the Bishop <hi>Peter de la Beaume</hi>

Yet the Bishop keeps ſtill his title, and the <hi>Chapter</hi> its reuenews and Lands, which happily lye in <hi>Sauoye</hi> out of the reach of the short iuriſdiction of <hi>Geneua.</hi> Both the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> reſide in <hi>Aniſy</hi> in <hi>Sauoye,</hi> and officiate in the <hi>Cordeliers Church.</hi> of this <hi>Seat</hi> was Bishop the late Canonized Saint, <hi>S.

                  <p>Hauing thus ſeen the little All of <hi>Geneua,</hi> I made towards <hi>Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerland,</hi> leauing the <hi>Lake</hi> on my right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d;<note place="margin">The Lake of Geneua</note> or rather takeing it on my right hand; for it would needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me to <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> where it tooke leaue of me, or I of it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Lake</hi> is abſolutly the faireſt I haue ſeen: its fairer then either the <hi>Lake Maior,</hi> the <hi>Lake of Como,</hi> the <hi>Lake of Zuric,</hi> the <hi>Lake of

Walenſtat,</hi> the <hi>Lake of Jſee,</hi> the <hi>Lake of Murat,</hi> or the <hi>Lake of Garda.</hi> In ſome places this Lake of Geneua is eight miles broad, and well nigh fifty miles long. I haue red of a ſtranger, who traueling that way alone in winter, when the Lake was all frozen ouer, and couered with ſnow, tooke the Lake for a large plain, and rid vpon it eight, or ten miles to the towne: Where lighting at his Inn, and commending the fine plain ouer which he had ridden, was giuen to vnderſtand, that he had ridden, if not in the air, at leaſt fifteen fathom aboue ground; at which, the poore man reflecting vpon the danger he had been in, fell downe dead with the conceit of it. Thus we are troubled not onely at euils to come but at euils paſt; and are neuer ſo neare the danger of death, as when we are newly paſt it. No animal but man, hath this folly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Soleur,</note>Paſſing thus a long, I came to <hi>Soleur (Soloturrum</hi> in Latin) a neat towne and Head of a <hi>Canton.</hi> They are all Catholicks here: and here it is that the <hi>French Embaſſadours</hi> to the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> alwayes reſide, as the <hi>Spanish Embaſſadors</hi> do at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna.</hi> This towne is very ancient, as the golden Letters vpon the clock teſtifye;<note place="margin">Petrus Romual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus in Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolog.

                  <p>From <hi>Soleur</hi> I went to <hi>Murat,</hi> a little towne famous for a great battle fought hard by it, by the <hi>Duke of Burgondy,</hi> and the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> For the the <hi>Duke of Burgondy</hi> beſeiging <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>

himſelf to the Lake, then to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes. Wherevpon ſpurring his horſe into the Lake,<note place="margin">The Lake of Murat.</note> one of his Dages, to ſaue himſelf alſo, leaped vp behind him as he tooke water. The Duke out of feare either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him not at firſt, or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it till he came to the other ſide of the Lake which is two miles broad: The ſtout horſe tugged through with them both, and ſaued them both from drowning, but not both from death. For the Duke ſeing in what danger his page had put him, ſtabbed the Page with his dagger. Poore Prince! thou mighſt haue giuen an other offering of thanks giueing to <hi>God</hi> for thy eſcape then this; nay, thou mighſt haue been as ciuil as thy horſe, and haue ſpaired him, whom beaſts and waues had ſaued: At leaſt by that means, thou mighſt haue ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy owne honour, by ſaueing that poore page who offended rather out of feare of death, then out of malice; and thereby thou mighſt haue truly ſayd, that thou hadſt not loſt all thy men in that battle. But
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52976:51"/>
paſſion is a blind thing: Nothing is ſo dangerous to man, as man; and, as I obſerued aboue, we are neuer in greater danger, then when we think we are paſt danger. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones of the <hi>Burgundians</hi> ſlain in this battle, are ſeen in a great Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which ſtands a little diſtant from the towne, and vpon the road, with an inſcription vpon it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time and circumſtances of this defeat.</p>

                  </p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52976:54"/>
The people haue for their <hi>Prince</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Sion</hi> the cheif towne of the country. Their <hi>Valley</hi> is aboue four dayes iourney long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their hills which are two more: Moſt of their little townes and <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages</hi> ſtand vpon hill ſides, leauing all the plain country for tillage and paſturage.

In fine, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here are great and maſſiue, and not eaſily to be blowne away: ſo that I may iuſtly ſay of this people, as <hi>Cardinal Bentiuoglio</hi> ſayd of the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> that they are good for the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and the <hi>Alpes</hi> for them.

                  <p>As for their ſtrength,<note place="margin">Their Strength.</note> vpon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue occaſion, they can aſſemble forty thouſand men together vnder their knowne Commanders, who are often times the Innkeepers in whoſe houſes we lodge; but out of their owne pit they are not to be feared, haueing neither ſpirits, nor ſinnews: that is, neither ambition, nor money, to carry on a forrain warre.</p>

The Court of this Prince is not great, becauſe of his, and his peoples quality.

that they neuer offered that honour to any man but to <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> he was well pleaſed with that offer: ſo the rarity of hauing a <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> in the <hi>Capitol</hi> being an honour granted to few, and thoſe well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing men, made men think it the higheſt of recompences.

againe.

                  <note place="margin">Mirandola</note> being inuited thither by its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull name. It is a principality farre more ancient then great; and it is ſo called, from <hi>Three children</hi> borne here of a great <hi>Lady,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Franciſcus Pius. Leander Albatus.</note> at one birth. The ſtory as it is pretty, ſo it is related by good authors, and therefore I will give it you here, in the end of this my <hi>Italian</hi> iourney, as a faire well. And tis this. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> the Emperor, Sonn of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin the great,</hi> had à daughter called <hi>Euridis</hi>; who beeing growne vp in yeares, fell in loue with <hi>Manfred</hi> a courtier of her Vncle <hi>Conſtantin,</hi> à hanſome well bred
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:52976:366"/>
yong gentleman. <hi>Manfred</hi> was both courtier enough, and wiſe enough, to vnderſtand this to be no ſmall honour; and therefore embraced her affection with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding flame. In a word, they meet often; talke of it; giue mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tual promiſes; make all the money they can, and iewels, and flye away ſecretly. They come into <hi>Italy,</hi> land at <hi>Naples,</hi> from thence to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna</hi>; and at laſt pitch vpon this country where now <hi>Mirandula</hi> ſtands. It was then a place ouerſpred with thickets and vnderwoods, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing ſome paſturage for sheep, and cottages for shepheards. Here then they chooſe to liue priuately and conuerſe with none but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſwaines, and shepheards. Blind loue whither doeſt thou hurrey, <hi>Princeſſes,</hi> to make them preferre <hi>cottages</hi> before <hi>Courts</hi>? At laſt with their money they buy land, and <hi>Manfred</hi> grows Soone to that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority among his neighbours, that they chooſe him for their <hi>Head</hi>; and recurre vnto him, vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his aduiſe and protection:
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:52976:366"/>
In the meane time (haueing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly marryed <hi>Euridis</hi> at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual in <hi>Italy</hi>) she brings him forth three ſonns at once, <hi>Picus, Pius,</hi> and <hi>Papazzo</hi>; and <hi>Manfred</hi> growes farre more conſiderable dayly in theſe parts. At laſt the <hi>Emperor Conſtantius</hi> comeing into <hi>Italy</hi> vpon his accaſions, and being compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all the ſeueral provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, this Prouince among the reſt, choſe <hi>Manfred</hi> as their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> to the ſayd <hi>Emperor,</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him the tender of their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and homage. <hi>Manfred</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the employment, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed himſelf ſo gallantly in the <hi>Embaſſy,</hi> that the <hi>Emperor</hi> knighted him, and vpon further tryal of his worth, rayſed him to high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. <hi>Manfred</hi> ſeing the realityes of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> thought it now high time to diſcouer himſelf vnto him. Whereforecaſting himſelf one day at the <hi>Emperors</hi> feet, and begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pardon, he diſcouered himſelf vnto him, and told him his whole ſtory, and aduentures.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:52976:367"/>
At fitſt the <hi>Emperor</hi> was a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; but findeing ſuch freedome and gallantry in his carriage, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſuch humble ingenuity in the Confeſſion of his fault; he not onely pardoned what was paſt, but preſently ſent for <hi>Euridis</hi> and her children to come to him, and liue at court with him. This done he makes <hi>Manfred Count</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,</hi> of a great part of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, and gives him leaue to build <hi>townes</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> there: and for his <hi>armes</hi> giues him the <hi>black Eagle.</hi> In fine, in memory of the <hi>three children</hi> borne ſo wonderfully at one birth, he commands that the chief towne thould be called <hi>Miranda.</hi> After the death of <hi>Conſtantius, Manfred</hi> and his <hi>Lady</hi> returned with great riches vnto their old dwellind place, and there began to build <hi>Miranda,</hi> which in proceſſe of time was called <hi>Mirandola.</hi> This true <hi>ſtory</hi> if it looke like a <hi>Romance,</hi> you muſt not wonder; ſeing <hi>Romances</hi> now a dayes, looke like true <hi>ſtories.</hi>
