            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I firÅ¿t Å¿et pen to Paper to handle this Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I had not the leaÅ¿t thought of the <hi>preÅ¿Å¿e;</hi> nor of erecting my Å¿elfe into an <hi>Author.</hi> J onely diÅ¿charged my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory haÅ¿tily of Å¿ome things which J had Å¿een, in <hi>Italy;</hi> and wrapt vp that vntimely <hi>Embrio</hi> in fiue sheets of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for the vÅ¿e of a noble perÅ¿on, who Å¿et me that taske. Yet this <hi>Embrio</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perÅ¿on for whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, obliged me to lick it ouer and ouer againe, and bring it into better forme. Second thoughts, and Å¿ucceding voyages into <hi>Italy,</hi> haue finished it at laÅ¿t; and haue made it what it is; <hi>A compleat Voyage,</hi> and an exact <hi>Itinerary</hi> through <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I thought to haue drawne

bridle and reÅ¿ted, after Å¿o long a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; when a learned friend hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uÅ¿ed this my <hi>DeÅ¿cription</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> deÅ¿ired much to Å¿ee a <hi>Preface</hi> to it, of my fashion, and <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerning Traueling.</hi> I could refuÅ¿e nothing to Å¿uch a freind; and haue done it here willingly, both for my owne, and my countryes Å¿ake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my owne sake;</hi> to preexcuÅ¿e Å¿ome things in my booke, which Å¿ome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may diÅ¿like.</p>
            <p>For Å¿ome, I feare, will quarrel with my English; and juÅ¿tly, Å¿eeing three long voyages into <hi>Flanders,</hi> Å¿ix into <hi>France,</hi> fiue into <hi>Italy,</hi> one into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> haue made mee, liue half of my life time in forrain countryes, to the diÅ¿turbance of my owne language. Yet if J bring not home fine language, J bring home fine things: and I haue Å¿een great Ladyes, both in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> buy finde things of <hi>chimney-Å¿weepers,</hi> and <hi>Pedlars,</hi> that Å¿poke but courÅ¿e <hi>Lombard</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and groÅ¿Å¿e <hi>Scotch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others perchance will finde fault, that J write merrily Å¿ometimes: And why not? Seeing I write to young men, and for them: and mirth is neuer Å¿o lawfull as in traueling, where it shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens

long miles, and Å¿weetens bad vÅ¿age; that is, makes a bad <hi>dinnar</hi> go downe, and a bad <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> go on.</p>
            <p>Others will Å¿ay, that I fill my booke with too much <hi>Latin:</hi> But theÅ¿e muÅ¿t be minded, that I am writing of the <hi>Latin</hi> country; and that I am caruing for <hi>Schollers,</hi> who can diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿t Å¿olid bitts, hauing good Å¿tomacks.</p>
            <p>Others will Å¿ay, J ieere now and then: And would any man haue me go through Å¿o many diuers countries, and prayÅ¿e all I Å¿ee? Or in earneÅ¿t, do not Å¿ome things deÅ¿erue to be ieered? when things cannot be cured but by ieering, ieering, Å¿ayth <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is a duty: and I thinke the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ophers Å¿truck as great a blow at vice, as the <hi>Stoicks.</hi>

            <p>Others will Å¿ay, I affect a world of exotick words not yet naturalized in <hi>England</hi>: No, I affect them not; I cannot auoyd them: For who can Å¿peak of <hi>Statues,</hi> but he muÅ¿t Å¿peak of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> or of <hi>Churches,</hi> Wrought <hi>Tombes,</hi> or inlayd <hi>Tables;</hi> but hee muÅ¿t speak of <hi>Coupolas;</hi> of <hi>baÅ¿Å¿i ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieui;</hi> and of <hi>pietre commeÅ¿Å¿e?</hi> If any man vnderÅ¿tand them not, its his fault, not mine.</p>
            <p>Others will Å¿ay, I hunt too much after <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and Church anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quityes. No, I onely meet them. And as a man cannot Å¿peak of <hi>Hercules,</hi> but he muÅ¿t Å¿peak of <hi>clubbs,</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,</hi> of <hi>Labours,</hi> and <hi>victories</hi>: Å¿o I cannot Å¿peak of <hi>Rome</hi> the Christian, but I muÅ¿t Å¿peake of <hi>Relicks, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> Yet I beleeue, I giue my Reader a full drought to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Others in fine will Å¿ay, that I do but a thing done allready; Å¿eeing two others haue written of this Å¿ubiect in <hi>English.</hi> Well; if others haue written vpon this Å¿ubiect, why may not I? They did the

beÅ¿t they could, I beleeue; but they drew not vp the ladder after them. The one writes much of <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupp. M.

And if theÅ¿e ingenious gentlemen haue painted out <hi>Italy</hi> in <hi>buÅ¿to</hi> onely, and <hi>profile;</hi> why may not I paint her out at <hi>full face,</hi> and <hi>at her full length</hi>? If they, like ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaryes, haue repreÅ¿ented <hi>Italy</hi> vnto vs like a <hi>naked Å¿tatue;</hi> I haue Å¿et her out in all her <hi>beÅ¿t Attire,</hi> and <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.</hi> And thus much for my owne Å¿ake.</p>

He then that will know much out of this great booke, the world, muÅ¿t read much in it: and as <hi>VlyÅ¿Å¿es</hi> is Å¿etforth by <hi>Homer</hi> as the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t of all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> becauÅ¿e he had traueled much, and had Å¿een <hi>multorum hominum mores &amp; Vrbes, the Cittyes and cuÅ¿tomes of many men:</hi> Å¿o his Å¿onn <hi>Telemachus</hi> is held for a very shallow witted man: and <hi>Homer</hi> giues the reaÅ¿on, becauÅ¿e his mother <hi>Penelope,</hi> inÅ¿tead of Å¿ending him abroad to Å¿ee forrain countryes, had allwayes kept him at home, and Å¿o made him a meere <hi>Onocephalus,</hi> and a homeling <hi>Mammacuth.</hi> So true is the Å¿aying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that <hi>Imperitum eÅ¿t animal homo, &amp; Å¿ine magna experientia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Å¿i circumÅ¿cribatur Natalis Å¿oli Å¿ui fine.</hi>

                  <hi>Annunciata,</hi> I went to the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>FranciÅ¿cans,</hi> called <hi>Santa Croce.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sancta Croce.</note> This <hi>Church</hi> is of a large bulk and height, but Å¿omewhat too darke. The Å¿ide <hi>Altars</hi> are many, and cheeked with round pillars, and adorned with excellent pictures. The <hi>pulpit</hi> would become A <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oÅ¿tome,</hi> or A <hi>ChryÅ¿ologue:</hi> Its of <hi>white marble,</hi> in which are grauen the moÅ¿t notable actions of <hi>S.

when he was giuen to vnderÅ¿tand that in the Å¿mooth painting there were head, armes, leggs, hands and feet, as well as in the bulky Å¿tatue which he had felt, iudged preÅ¿ently for painting; yet <hi>Michel Angelo</hi> himÅ¿elf preferred <hi>Sculpture</hi> before <hi>painting,</hi> as the <hi>body</hi> is to be preferred before the <hi>Å¿uperficies</hi> of a body. But to returne againe to the <hi>Tombe</hi> of this great <hi>artiÅ¿t,</hi> I found Å¿ome words vpon the <hi>tombeÅ¿tone,</hi> but thoÅ¿e Å¿o dull and hard to be read in that darke corner, that one in the company choÅ¿e rather to make him a new <hi>Epitaphe,</hi> then read that which is written there: and it was this:
<q>
                     <l>Cur indignemur mortales morte perire?</l>
                     <l>Ecce, Å¿tupor mundi! hÃ®c Angelus ipÅ¿o perit.</l>
                  </q>
And I think the moderne <hi>Roman</hi> was of the Å¿ame mind too, when he choÅ¿e alÅ¿o to make him this Epitaph:
<q>
                     <l>Roma mihi mortem tribuit, Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vitam.</l>
                     <l>Nemo aliis vellet naÅ¿ci, &amp; obire, locis.</l>

We Å¿tayd not long here, the Å¿eaÅ¿on preÅ¿sing vs to be gone, and this towne, being Å¿oone Å¿een. For the towne its but little, yet one of the neateÅ¿t hauen townes a man can Å¿ee. Heretofore it was not Å¿ufferable by reaÅ¿on of the bad ayre; but Å¿ince <hi>Ferdinan the firÅ¿t</hi> built it a new, and dryed vp the neighboring <hi>Fenns</hi> (gathering much of the water into a cut channel, which goes from hence to <hi>PiÅ¿a,</hi> and carryes great boats) the towne is twice as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome,

There is an other Å¿tatue of <hi>Hercules</hi> oppoÅ¿it to it, and iuÅ¿t like it, but not Å¿o good, being but a copie of the former. The other Å¿tatues here of the two <hi>Floras,</hi> the two <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and others, are excellent peeces. Mounting vp the great Å¿tairs to go into the chambers and open Gallery, I Å¿aw the curious <hi>Statue</hi> of the <hi>boy</hi> and the <hi>Dolphin</hi>: and at the dore of the great <hi>Hall,</hi> the Å¿tatues of two <hi>Parthian captiue Kings.</hi> Entring into that <hi>hall</hi> I met preÅ¿ently with the rare Å¿tatue of <hi>Alexander FarneÅ¿i,</hi>

In the meane time (haueing Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly marryed <hi>Euridis</hi> at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual in <hi>Italy</hi>) she brings him forth three Å¿onns at once, <hi>Picus, Pius,</hi> and <hi>Papazzo</hi>; and <hi>Manfred</hi> growes farre more conÅ¿iderable dayly in theÅ¿e parts. At laÅ¿t the <hi>Emperor ConÅ¿tantius</hi> comeing into <hi>Italy</hi> vpon his accaÅ¿ions, and being compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all the Å¿eueral provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, this Prouince among the reÅ¿t, choÅ¿e <hi>Manfred</hi> as their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baÅ¿Å¿ador</hi> to the Å¿ayd <hi>Emperor,</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him the tender of their reÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and homage. <hi>Manfred</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the employment, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed himÅ¿elf Å¿o gallantly in the <hi>EmbaÅ¿Å¿y,</hi> that the <hi>Emperor</hi> knighted him, and vpon further tryal of his worth, rayÅ¿ed him to high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. <hi>Manfred</hi> Å¿eing the realityes of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> thought it now high time to diÅ¿couer himÅ¿elf vnto him. WhereforecaÅ¿ting himÅ¿elf one day at the <hi>Emperors</hi> feet, and begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pardon, he diÅ¿couered himÅ¿elf vnto him, and told him his whole Å¿tory, and aduentures.
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:52976:367"/>
At fitÅ¿t the <hi>Emperor</hi> was a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; but findeing Å¿uch freedome and gallantry in his carriage, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Å¿uch humble ingenuity in the ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of his fault; he not onely pardoned what was paÅ¿t, but preÅ¿ently Å¿ent for <hi>Euridis</hi> and her children to come to him, and liue at court with him. This done he makes <hi>Manfred Count</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,</hi> of a great part of theÅ¿e coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, and gives him leaue to build <hi>townes</hi> and <hi>CaÅ¿tles</hi> there: and for his <hi>armes</hi> giues him the <hi>black Eagle.</hi> In fine, in memory of the <hi>three children</hi> borne Å¿o wonderfully at one birth, he commands that the chief towne thould be called <hi>Miranda.</hi> After the death of <hi>ConÅ¿tantius, Manfred</hi> and his <hi>Lady</hi> returned with great riches vnto their old dwellind place, and there began to build <hi>Miranda,</hi> which in proceÅ¿Å¿e of time was called <hi>Mirandola.</hi> This true <hi>Å¿tory</hi> if it looke like a <hi>Romance,</hi> you muÅ¿t not wonder; Å¿eing <hi>Romances</hi> now a dayes, looke like true <hi>Å¿tories.</hi>
