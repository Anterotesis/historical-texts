            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat we interrupt your more serious Studies with the offer of this Peice, the injury that hath been and is done to the deceased Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Ashes not only pleddeth our Excuse, but engageth you (whose once he was, and within whose Walls this Standard of
<pb facs="tcp:109805:5"/>
Wit was first set up) in the same Quarrel with us.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Randolph</hi> and <hi>Cowley</hi> lie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed in their own native Wax, how is the Name and Memory of <hi>Cleveland</hi> equally prophaned by those that usurp, and those that blaspheme it? By those that are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to lay their Cuckows Eggs in his Nest, and those that think to raise up Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixes of Wit by firing his spicy Bed about him?</p>
            <p>We know you have not without passionate Resentments beheld the Prostitution of his Name in some late Editions vended under it, wherein his Orations are murthered over and over in barbarous Latine, and a more barbarous Translation: and wherein is scarce one or other Poem of his own to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute for all the rest. At least every Curiasier of his hath a fulsom Dragooner behind him, and <hi>Venus</hi> is again unequally yoaked with a sooty Anvile-beater. <hi>Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> thus revived, dieth another Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109805:5"/>
You cannot but have beheld with like zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Indignation, how enviously our late Mushrom-wits look up at him, because he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdroppeth them, and snarl at his Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as Dogs at the Moon.</p>
            <p>Some of these grand Sophys will not allow him the Reputation of Wit at all: yet how many such Authors must be creamed and spirited to make up his <hi>Fuscara?</hi> and how many of their slight Productions may be gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of one of his pregnant Words? There perhaps you may find some Leaf-gold, here massie Wedges; there some scattered Ray, here a Galaxy; there some loose Fancy frisking in the Air, here Wits Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack.</p>
            <p>The Quarrel in all this is upbraiding Merit, and Eminence his Crime. His touring Fancy soareth so high a pitch, that they fly like Shades below him. The Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thereof (which riseth far above their high Water-Mark) drowneth their Levels. Usurping upon the State Poetick of the

            <p>Another Blemish in this Monster of Perfection is the Exuberance of his Fancy. His <hi>Manna</hi> lieth so thick upon the Ground they loath it. VVhen he should only fan, he with H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To cure this Excess, their frugal VVit hath reduced the VVorld to a <hi>Lessian</hi> Diet. If perhaps they entertain their Reader with one good Thought (as these new Dictators affect to speak) he may sit down and say Grace over it: the rest is VVords, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else.</p>
            <p>VVe will leave them therefore to the most proper Vengeance, to humour themselves with the perusal of their own Poems: And leave the Barber to rub their thick Skulls with Bran until they are fit for Musk. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we will leave this friendly Advice with them; that they have an Eye upon <hi>John Tredeskant</hi>'s Executor, lest among his other Minims of Art and Nature he expose their slight Conceits: And another upon the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society, lest they make their Poems the Counter-ballance when they intend to weigh Air.</p>

            <head>A short Account of the Author's Life.</head>
            <p>HE was born at <hi>Hinckley,</hi> a small Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Town in the County of <hi>Leicest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> if we may esteem that small, which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in so great a Birth.</p>
            <p>His Father was the Reverend and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Minister of the place; <hi>Fortes creantur è fortibus.</hi> Being thus well descended for a Vein of Learning, he even lisped Wit, like an English <hi>Bard,</hi> and was early ripe for the University, who was one.</p>
            <p>To cherish so great hopes, the Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> drew forth both her Breasts. <hi>Christ</hi>'s Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> gave him Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s a Fellowship. There he lived about the space of nine years, the Delight and Ornament of that Soeiety. What Service, as well as Reputation he did it, let his Orations and Epistles speak; to which the Library oweth much of its Learning, the Chappel much of its pious Decency, and the Colledge much of its Renown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109805:8"/>
The Rays, which he thus shed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, reflected upon himself. But that which alone may suffice for his Honour is, that after the Oration which he addressed to that Incomparable Prince, of Blessed Memory, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, the King called for him, and (with great Expressions of Kindness) gave him his Hand to kiss, and commanded a Copy to be sent after him to <hi>Huntington,</hi> whither he was hastening that Night.</p>
            <p>Thus he shined with equal Light and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence until the general Eclipse; of which no Man had more Sagacious Prognosticks. When <hi>Oliver</hi> was in Election to be Burge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s for the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as he engaged all his Friends and Interests to oppose it, so when it was passed, he said with much passionate Zeal, That single Vote had rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both Church and Kingdom. Such Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock the good Prophet beheld in <hi>Hazael</hi>'s Face. Such fatal Events did he presage from his bloody Beak. And no sooner did that Schritch-Owl appear in the University, but this Sun declined. Perceiving the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracism that was intended, he became a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier in his Academick Exile, and would no longer breath the common Air with such Pests of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109805:8"/>
From thence he betook himself to the Camp of his Sovereign, and particularly to <hi>Oxford</hi> the Head-Quarter of it, as the most proper and proportionate Sphere for his Wit, Learning and Loyalty; and added no small Lustre to that with which that famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity shined before.</p>
            <p>His next Stage was the Garrison of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,</hi> where he was Judge Advocate, until the Surrender: And, by an excellent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of both, was a just and prudent Judge for the King, and a faithful Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the Country. There he drew up that Gallant Return to the Summons of the Besiegers, which spake him, and the rest that were embarked with him, resolute to sacrifice their Lives to their Loyalty, had not the King's especial Command, when first he had surrendred himself into the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> made such stubborn Loyalty a Crime. And here again he was <hi>Vates</hi> in the whole Import of the Word, both Poet and Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, beside his passionate Resentment of it in that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poem, <hi>The King</hi>'s <hi>Disguise,</hi> upon some private Intelligence, three Days before the King reached them, he foresaw the Peices of Silver paying upon the Banks of <hi>Tweed,</hi> and that they were the price of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's

Blood, and predicted the Tragical Events.</p>
            <p>Thenceforth he followed the Fates of distressed Loyalty, for which, when he had been long imprisoned at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed his Petition to <hi>Oliver;</hi> wherein he courted his Freedom with such Insinuations, as might neither do Violence to his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor betray his Cause.</p>
            <p>After many intermediate Stages (which contended as emulously for his Abode, as the seven Cities for <hi>Homer</hi>'s Birth) <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> was his last: Which when he had enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with some short Residence also, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Fever seized him, whereof he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Disease at that time epidemical: And if it had taken him only away (so publick was the Loss) it deserved to carry the Name of a Common Mortality.</p>
            <p>He was buried upon the first Day of <hi>May</hi> (for which nothing but the 29. can attone) in the Parish Church of St. <hi>Michael Royal</hi> upon <hi>Colledge Hill London, Anno</hi> 1658. To which being attended by many Persons of Learning and Loyalty, Mr. <hi>Edward Thurman</hi> performed the Office of Burial, and the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> (now Lord Bishop of <hi>Chester)</hi> Preached his Funeral Sermon, and made his Death Glorious.</p>

                        <head>The Character of a Country-Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with the Ear-mark of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrator.</head>
                        <p>A Committee man by his Name should be one that is possessed; there is number enough in it to make an Epithet for <hi>Legion.</hi> He is <hi>Persona in concreto</hi> (to borrow the Solecism of a Modern Statesman.) You may translate it by the <hi>Red-Bull</hi> Phrase, and speak as properly, Enter seven Devils <hi>solus.</hi> It is a well-truss'd Title, that contains both the Number and the Beast; for a Committee-man is a Noun of Multitude, he must be spell'd with Figures, like Antichrist wrapp'd in a Pair-Royal of Sixes. Thus the Name is as monstrous as the Man, a complex Notion, of the same Lineage with Accumulative Treason. For his Office it is the Heptarchy, or <hi>England</hi>'s Fritters; it is the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken meat of a crumbling Prince, only the Royalty is greater; for it is here, as in the Miracle of Loaves, the Voyder exceeds the Bill of Fare. The Pope and he rings the Changes; here is the Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Crowns to one Head, joyn them together and there is a Harmony in Discord. The Triple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Turn-key of Heaven, with the Triple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed Porter of Hell. A Committee-man is the Reliques of Regal Government, but, like Holy Reliques, he out-bulks the Substance whereof he is a Remnant. There is a score of Kings in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109805:50"/>
as in the Reliques of the Cross there is the number of Twenty. This is the Gyant with the hundred hands that wields the Scepter; the Tyrannical Bead-Roll, by which the Kingdom prays backward, and at every Curse drops a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-man. Let <hi>Charles</hi> be wav'd, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending Clemency aggravates the Defection, and make <hi>Nero</hi> the Question, better a <hi>Nero</hi> than a Committee. There is less Execution by a single Bullet, than by Case-shot.</p>
                        <p>Now a Committee-man is a party-colour'd Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. He must be drawn like <hi>Ianus</hi> with Cross and Pile in his Countenance; as he relates to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or faces about to his fleecing the Country. Look upon him martially, and he is a Justice of War, one that hath bound his <hi>Dalton</hi> up in Buff, and will needs be of the <hi>Quorum</hi> to the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. He is one of <hi>Mars</hi> his Lay-Elders, he shares in the Government, though a <hi>Non-</hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist to his bleeding Rubrick. He is the like Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Arms, as the Platonick is in Love; keeps a fluttering in Discourse, but proves a Haggard in the Action. He is not of the Souldiers, and yet of his Flock. It is an Emblem of the Golden Age (and such indeed he makes it to him) when so tame a Pigeon may converse with Vultures. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a Committee hanging about a Governour, and Bandileers dangling about a fur'd Alderman, have an Anagram Resemblance. There is no Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax between a Cap of Maintenance and a Helmet. Who ever knew an Enemy routed by a Grand Jury and a <hi>Billa vera?</hi> It is a left-handed Garrison where their Authority perches; but the more preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the more in fashion; the right hand fights,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109805:51"/>
while the left rules the Reins. The truth is, the Souldier and the Gentleman are like <hi>Don Quixot</hi> and <hi>Sancha Pancha,</hi> one fights at all Adventures to purchase the other the Government of the Island. A Committee-man properly should be the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's Mattress to sit his Truckle, and to new-string him with sinews of War; for his chief use is to raise Assessments in the Neighbouring Wapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                        <p>The Country people being like an <hi>Irish</hi> Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>So much for his Warlike or Ammunition-Face; which is so preternatural, that it is rather a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard than a Face; <hi>Mars</hi> in him hath but a blinking Aspect, his Face of Arms is like his Coat, <hi>Partit per-pale;</hi> Souldier and Gentleman much of a Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                        <p>Now enter his Taxing and deglubing Face, a squeezing Look, like that of <hi>Vespastanus,</hi> as if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>ung with a Canting Ordinance: not a murthered Fortune in all the Country, but bleeds at the Touch of this Malefactor. He is the Spleen of the Body Politick, that swells it self to the Consumption of the Whole. At first indeed he ferreted for the Parliament, but since he hath got off his Cope he set up for himself. He lives upon the Sins of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109805:51"/>
People, and that is a good standing Dish too. He verifies the Axiom, <hi>Iisdem nutritur ex quibus componitur;</hi> his Diet is suitable to his Constitution. I have wondred often, why the plundred Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should repair to him for succour; certainly it is under the same Notion, as one whose Pockets are pick'd goes to <hi>Mal Cut-purse,</hi> as the Predominant in that Faculty.</p>
                        <p>He out-dives a Dutch man, gets a Noble of him that was never worth six pence; for the poorest do not escape, but Dutch-like, he will be dreyning even in the driest Ground. He aliens a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent's Estate with as little Remorse, as his other Holiness gives away an Heretick's Kingdom; and for the truth of the Delinquency, both Chapmen have as little share of Infallibility. <hi>Lye</hi> is the Grand Salad of Arbitrary Government, Executor to the Star-chamber and the High Commission; for those Courts are not extinct, they survive in him, like Dollars changed into single Money. To speak the truth, He is the Universal Tribunal: For since these Times all Causes fall to his Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance; as in a great Infection all Diseases turn oft to the Plague. It concerns our Masters the Parliament to look about them; if he proceedeth at this rate, the Jack may come to swallow the Pike, as the Interest often eats out the Principal. As his Commands are great, so he looks for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence accordingly. He is punctual in exacting your Hat, and to say, Right is his due, but by the same Title as the upper Garment is the Vails of the Executioner. There was a time, when such Cattle would hardly have been taken upon suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Men in office, unless the old Proverb were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109805:52"/>
renewed, That the Beggars make a Free Company, and those their Wardens. You may see what it is to hang together. Look upon them severally, and you cannot but fumble for some Threds of Charity. But oh, they are <hi>Termagants</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction! like Fidlers, who are Rogues when they go single, and join'd in Consort, Gentlemen Musicianers. I care not much if I untwist my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-man, and so give him the Receipt of this Grand <hi>Catholicon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Take a State-martyr, one that for his good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour hath paid the Excise of his Ears, so suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Captivity by the Land-Piracy of Ship-money; next a Primitive Freeholder, one that hates the King because he is a Gentleman, transgressing the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Delving <hi>Adam:</hi> Add to these a Mortified Bankrupt, that helps out his false Weights with some Scruples of Conscience, and with his peremptory Scales can doom his Prince with a <hi>Mene Tekel.</hi> These with a new blew-stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing'd Justice, lately made of a good Basket-hilted Yeoman, with a short-handed Clerk, tack'd to the Rear of him to carry the Knap-sack of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; together with two or three Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sirs, whose Religion, like their Gentility, is the Extract of their Acres; being therefore Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, because they are Earthly; not forgetting the Man of the Law, whose Corruption gives the Hogan to the sincere Juncto. These are the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Precious Compound; a kind of Dutch Hotch-Potch, the <hi>Hogan Mogan</hi> Committee-man.</p>
                        <p>The Committee-man hath a Side-man, or rather a Setter, right a Sequestrator, of whom you may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109805:52"/>
say, as of the Great <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Horse, where he treads the Grass grows no more. He is the States Cormorant, one that fishes for the publick, but feeds himself; the misery is, he fishes without the Cormorant's Property, a Rope to strengthen the Gullet, and to make him disgorge. A Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! He is the Devil's Nut-hook, the Sign with him is always in the Clutches. There are more Monsters retain to him, than to all the Limbs in Anatomy. It is strange Physicians do not apply him to the Soles of the Feet in a desperate Fever, he draws far beyond Pigeons. I hope some Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank will slice him, and make the Experiment. He is a Tooth-drawer once removed; here is the difference, one applauds the Grinder, the other the Grist. Never till now could I verifie the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et's Description, that the ravenous Harpie had a Humane Visage. Death himself cannot quit scores with him; like the Demoniack in the Gospel, he lives among Tombs; nor is all the Holy Water shed by Widows and Orphans, a sufficient Exorcism to dispossess him. Thus the Cat sucks your breath, and the Fiend your blood; nor can the Brotherhood of Witch-finders, so sagely institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all their Terror, wean the Familiars.</p>
                        <p>But once more to single out my emboss'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-man; his Fate (for I know you would fain see an end of him) is either a whipping Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, when he is wrung in the Withers by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Examinations, and so the Spunge weeps out the Moisture which he had soaked before; or else he meets his Passing-peal in the clamorous Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of a Gut-foundred Garrison: for the Hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparrow will be feeding the Cuckow, till he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109805:53"/>
mistake his Commons and bites off her head. What-ever it is, it is within his desert: For what is observed of some Creatures, that at the same time they trade in Productions three Stories high, Suckling the first, Big with the second, and Click<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting for the third: A Committee-man is the Counterpoint, his Mischief is Superfoetation, a certain Scale of Destruction; for he ruins the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beggars the Son, and strangles the hopes of all Posterity.</p>

                        <head>The Character of a Diurnal-maker.</head>
                        <p>A Diurnal-maker is the Sub-almoner of History, Queen <hi>Mabs</hi> Register; one whom, by the same Figure that a North-country Pedlar is a Merchant-man, you may stile an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. It is like over-reach of Language, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thin, Tinder-cloak'd Quack must be called a Doctor; when a clumsie Cobler usurps the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of our English Peers, and is vamp'd a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. List him a Writer, and you smother <hi>Geoffry</hi> in Swabber-slops; the very name of Dabler over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets him; he is swallowed up in the Phrase, like Sir <hi>S. L.</hi> in a great Saddle, nothing to be seen, but the Giddy Feather in his Crown. They call him a <hi>Mercury,</hi> but he becomes the Epithet, like the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Negro mounted upon an Elephant, just such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Blot Rampant. He has not Stuffings suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Reproach of a Scribler; but it hangs about him like an old Wifes Skin, when the Flesh hath forsaken her, lank and loose. He defames a good Title, as well as most of our Modern Noble-Men;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109805:53"/>
those Wens of Greatness, the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick's most peccant Humours, Blistred into Lords. He hath so Raw-bon'd a Being, that however you render him, he rubs it out and makes Rags of the Expression. The silly Country-man, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Ape in a Scarlet-coat, bless'd his young Worship, and gave his Landlord joy of the hopes of his House, did not slander his Complement with worse Application, than he that names this Shred an Historian. To call him an Historian is to knight a Mandrake: 'Tis to view him through a Perspective, and by that gross <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to give the Reputation of an Engineer to a Maker of Mouse-traps. Such an Historian would hardly pass muster with a Scotch Stationer, in a Sieve full of Ballads and Godly Books. He would not serve for the Breast-plate, of a begging Grecian. The most cramp'd <hi>Compendium</hi> that the Age hath seen, since all Learning hath been almost torn into Ends, outstrips him by the Head. I have heard of Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets that could prattle in a Play, but never saw of their Writings before. There goes a report of the <hi>Holland</hi> Women, that together with their Children, they are delivered of a <hi>Sooterkin,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to a Rat, which some imagine to be the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of the Stoves. I know not what <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> adulterates the Press, but it seems much after that fashion, else how could this Vermin think to be a Twin to a Legitimate Writer; when those week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fragments shall pass for History, let the poor man's Box be intituled the Exchequer, and the Alms-basket a Magazine. Not a Worm that gnaws on the dull Scalp of Voluminous <hi>Hollinshed,</hi> but at every Meal devour'd more Chronicle, than
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109805:54"/>
his Tribe amounts to. A Marginal Note of <hi>W. P.</hi> would serve for a Winding-sheet, for that man's Works, like thick-skin'd Fruits, are all Rinde, fit for nothing but the Authors Fate to be pared in a Pillory.</p>
                        <p>The Cook, who serv'd up the Dwarf in a Pye (to continue the Frollick) might have lapp'd up such an Historian as this in the Bill of Fare. He is the first Tincture and Rudiment of a Writer, dipp'd as yet in the preparative Blew, like an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack Well-willer. He is the Cadet of a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer, the Pedee of a Romancer; he is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo of a History slink'd before Maturity. How should he Record the Issue's of time, who is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an Abortive? I will not say but that he may pass for an Historian in <hi>Garbier</hi>'s Academy; he is much of the size of those Knot-grass Professors. What a pittiful Seminary was there projected! Yet sutable enough to the present Universities, those dry Nurses, which the Providence of the Age has so fully reform'd, that they are turn'd Reformado's: But that's no matter, the meaner the better. It is a Maxim observable in these days, That the only way to win the Game is to play Petty <hi>Iohns.</hi> Of this number is the Esquire of the Quill; for he hath the Grudging of History, and some Yawnings accordingly. Writing is a Disease in him, and holds like a Quotidian; so 'tis his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity that makes him an Author, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> was beholding to the Falling-sickness to vouch him a Prophet. That nice Artificer, who field a Chain so thin and light, that a Flea could trail it (as if he had work'd Short-hand, and taught his Tools to Cypher) did but contrive an Emblem for this

                        <p>Methinks the Turk should license Diurnals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he prohibits Learning and Books. A Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Diurnals is a Wardrobe of Frippery; 'tis a just <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Limbo</hi> of the Infants. I saw one once that could write with his Toes, by the same token I could have wished he had worn his Copies for Socks; 'tis he without doubt from whom the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnals derive their Pedigree, and they have a Birth-right accordingly, being shuffled out at the bed's feet of History. To what infinite numbers an Historian would multiply, should he crumble into Elves of this Profession? To supply this smalness they are fain to joyn Forces, so they are not singly, but as the Custom is, in a Croaking Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee. They tug at the Pen, like slaves at the Oar, a whole Bank together; they write in the Posture that the <hi>Suedes</hi> gave fire in, over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's heads.

                        <p>A Diurnal is a puny Chronicle, scarce Pin-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd with the Wings of Time.

It may be the Legislative Lady is of that Linage, so she spawns the Diurnals, and they at <hi>Westminster</hi> take them in Adoption by the names of <hi>Scoticus, Civicus, Britannicus.</hi> In the Frontispeice of the old Beldam Diurnal, like the Contents of the Chapter, sitteth the House of Commons judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> You may call them the Kingdoms Anatomy before the weekly Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar; for such is a Diurnal, the day of the Month with what Weather in the Commonwealth. It is taken for the Pulse of the Body Politick, and the Emperick-Divines of the Assembly, those Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Dragooners, thumb it accordingly. Indeed it is a pretty <hi>Synopsis;</hi> and those Grave <hi>Rabbies</hi> (though in the point of Divinity) trade in no lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Authors. The Country-carrier, when he buys it for the Vicar, miscals it the Urinal; yet properly enough, for it casts the Water of the State ever since it staled Blood. It differs from an <hi>Aulicus,</hi> as the Devil and his Exorcist, or as a black Witch doth from a white one, whose office is to unravel her Enchantments.</p>
                        <p>It begins usually with an Ordinance, which is a Law still-born, dropt before quickned by the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Assent.

                        <p>The next Ingredient of a Diurnal is Plots, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Plots, which with wonderful Sagacity it hunts dry-foot, while they are yet in their Causes before <hi>Materia prima</hi> can put on her Smock. How many such fits of the Mother have troubled the Kingdom; and for all Sir <hi>W. E.</hi> looks like a Man-Midwife, not yet delivered of so much as a Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

Suppose a Corn-cutter, being to give little <hi>Isaac</hi> a cast of his Office, should fall to paring his Brows (mistaking the one end for the other, because he branches at both) this would be a Plot, and the next Diurnal would furnish you with this Scale of Votes.</p>

                        <p>I'll present them in their order. And first as a Whister before the show enter <hi>Stamford,</hi> one that trod the Stage with the first, travers'd his ground, made a Leg and <hi>Exit.</hi> The Country people took him for one, that by Order of the Houses was to dance a Morrice through the West of <hi>England.</hi> Well, he's a nimble Gentleman; set him upon <hi>Banks</hi> his Horse in a Saddle rampant, and it is a great question which part of the Centaure shews better Tricks.</p>

There was a Vote passing to translate him with all his Equipage into Monumental Gingerbread; but it was crossed by the female Committee, alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that the Valour of his Image, would bite their Children by the Tongues.</p>
                        <p>This Cubit and half of Commander, by the help of a Diurnal routed his Enemies fifty miles off. It's strange you'll say, and yet 'tis generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, he would as soon do it at that distance as nearer hand. Sure it was his Sword for which the Weapon-salve was invented; that so wounding and healing (like loving Correlates) might both work at the same removes. But the Squib is run to the end of the Rope: Room for the Prodigy of Valour. Madam <hi>Atropos</hi> in Breeches, <hi>Waller</hi>'s Knight-errantry; and because every Mountebank must have his <hi>Zany,</hi> throw him in <hi>Hazlerig</hi> to set off his Story. These two, like <hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> are always worshipped in the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they hunt in couples, what one doth at the head, the other scores up at the heels.</p>
                        <p>Thus they kill a man over and over, as <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold</hi> murder the Psalms with another of the same; one chimes all in, and then the other strikes up as the Saints-Bell.</p>
                        <p>I wonder for how many Lives my Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> took the Lease of his Body.</p>
                        <p>First <hi>Stamford</hi> slew him, then <hi>Waller</hi> out-kill'd that half a Barr; and yet it is thought the sullen Corps would scarce bleed, were both these Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayers never so near it.</p>
                        <p>The fame goes of a Dutch Headsman, that he would do his office with so much ease and dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Head after Execution should stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Shoulders. Pray God Sir <hi>William</hi> be not Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner for the place; for as if he had the same knack too, most of those whom the Diurnal hath slain for him, to us poor Mortals seem untoucht.</p>
                        <p>Thus these Artificers of death, can kill the Man without wounding the Body, like Lightning, that melts the Sword, and never singdes the Scabbard.</p>
                        <p>This is the <hi>William</hi> whose Lady is the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; This is the City's Champion and the Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals delight; he that Cuckolds the General in his Commission; for he stalks with <hi>Essex,</hi> and shoots under his Belly, because his Excellency himself is not charged there; yet in all this triumph there is a Whip and a Bell; translate but the Scene to <hi>Roundway down,</hi> there <hi>Hazelrig</hi>'s Lobsters turn'd Crabs, and crawled backwards; there poor Sir <hi>William</hi> ran to his Lady for an use of Consolation.</p>
                        <p>But the Diurnal is weary of the arm of flesh, and now begins an <hi>Hosanna</hi> to <hi>Cromwel;</hi> one that hath beat up his Drums clean through the Old Testament; you may learn the Genealogy of our Saviour by the names in his Regiment: the Muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master uses no other List but the first Chapter of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With what face can they object to the King the bringing in of Foreigners, when themselves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain such an Army of <hi>Hebrews?</hi> This <hi>Cromwel</hi> is never so valourous, as when he is making Speeches for the Association; which nevertheless he doth somewhat ominously with his Neck awry, holding up his ear as if he expected <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Pigeon to come and prompt him. He should be a Bird of Prey too by his bloody Beak: His Nose is able to try a young Eagle, whether she be lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

But all is not Gold that glisters. What we wonder at in the rest of them is natural to him, to kill without Bloodshed; for the most of his Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies are in a Church-window, when a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass would shew him more Superstition. He is so perfect a hater of Images, that he hath defaced God's in his own Countenance. If he deals with men, 'tis when he takes them napping in an old Monument, then down goes Dust and Ashes, and the stoutest Cavalier is no better. O brave <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!</hi> Time's Voyder, Subsizer to the Worms, in whom Death, who formerly devoured our Ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, now chews the cud. He said Grace once as if he would have fallen aboard with the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle;</hi> nay and the Diurnal gave you his Bill of fare; but it proved a running Banquet, as appears by the Story. Believe him as he whistles to his <hi>Cambridge-</hi>Teem of Committee-men, and he doth Wonders. But holy Men, like the holy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, must be read backwards.

                        <p>But for all <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Nose wears the Dominical Letter, compar'd to <hi>Manchester,</hi> he is but like the Vigils to an Holy-day.

                        <p>IS it so then, that our Brother and Fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the Gospel is started aside? Then this may serve for an use of Instruction, not to trust in Man, nor in the Son of Man. Did not <hi>Demas</hi> leave <hi>Paul?</hi> Did not <hi>Onesimus</hi> run from his Master <hi>Philemon?</hi> Besides, this should teach us to employ our Talent, and not to lay it up in a Napkin. Had it been done among the Cavaliers, it had been just; then the Israelite had spoiled the Egyptian; but for <hi>Simeon</hi> to plunder <hi>Levi,</hi> That! That! You see, Sir, what Use I make of the Doctrine you sent me; and indeed since you change Style, so far as to nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at Wit, you must pardon me, if to quit scores, I pretend a little to the Gift of Preaching. Sir, I expected to hear from you in the Language of the lost Groat, and the Prodigal Son, and not in such a Tantivy of Language; but I perceive your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is not always Yea, Yea; now and then a little Harlotry-Rhetorick. You say that your Man is entred our Ark: I am sorry you were so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Scripture, as to let him come single. The Text had been better satisfied, if you had pleased to bear him company; for then the Beasts had entred by Couples: But though he came alone, yet well lin'd it seems, with <hi>133 l. 8d.</hi> Sure your Hue and Cry hath good Lungs, it would have been out of breath else, before it had reached the Eight pence. This is the Summ; but why you call it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109805:61"/>
the Precise Summ, since it is thus fallen away, I understand not. But how come you to reckon so punctually? Did <hi>Ananias</hi> tell it upon the Table Dormant? What year of the Persecution of the Saints? I wonder you did not rather count it by the Shekels, that is the more sanctified Coyn. You mistake in the Sanctuary you speak of; for that which your Man hath taken in <hi>Welbeck,</hi> one of our Chappels of Ease, not the Mother-Church, our Garrison of <hi>Newark;</hi> but the best is, they are both without the reach of your Sacrilege. Whereas you account your Loss but a Loan, we shall grant it a Debt, but bearing the same Date of Payment with that which you borrowed on the Publick Faith. I suspect your hand was troubled with the Palsie, when you wrote of a Judge; your Man however shall find me an Advocate; for what say you to an occasional Meditation? Reflect but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your self, how you have used your Common Master, and I doubt not but you will pardon your Man. He hath but transcribed Rebellion, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out that Disloyalty in Short-hand, which you have committed in Text. Sir, I bemoan your Losses, and am sorry I cannot as easily repay that of your Money, as your Man, being resolv'd to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that place my self; and to make it appear by wearing the Livery of this Title,</p>

                        <p>THE Philosopher that never laughed but once, when he saw an Ass mumbling of Thistles, would have broke his Spleen at this Rejoynder of yours; for who would not take that to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of this, observing how gingerly, and with what caution you nibble at my letter, lest it should prick your Chops? But something must needs be replied. Repetitions are usual with the Saints at <hi>Grantham.</hi> I look upon your Letter as a <hi>Spittle-</hi>Sermon; <hi>Sallinger</hi>'s Round, the same again. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Ambition, how you would prove your self to be a clean Beast, because you know how to chew the Cud; for the first Sentence where you speak of troubled Spirits and Sacred Oracles, you talk as if you were in <hi>Doll Commons</hi> Extasie. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your spirit is troubled, else your Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had not run so muddy; for never was Oracle more ambiguous, if possible to be reconciled to Sence. The Wit which you say may be truss'd up in an Egg-shell, I fear your Oval Crown hath scarce Capacity enough to contain. You disclaim being a Coloss: Content; I have as diminitive thoughts of you as you please. I take you for a Jack-a-Lent, and my Pen shall make use of you according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, three Throws for a penny: But you cannot Cleave Land like <hi>Terrain findere.</hi> What a charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Commodity is Wit at <hi>Grantham,</hi> where the poor Writer plays the Pimp, and jumbles two

Language together in unlawful Sheets for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Quibble: But I applaud your Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for the more unknown Tongue you jest in, your Wit will be the better. And why cannot you Cleave the Land? Tread but hard, and your clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Foot will leave its Impression. You talk of <hi>Cyclops</hi> and Juglers (indeed hard words are the Jugler's Dialect:) But take heed, the time may come, when unless you can play <hi>Presto</hi> be gone, your Run-away King may cause you Jugler-wise to disgorge your Fate, and vomit a Rope instead of Inkle.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109805:65"/>
this <hi>Ergo</hi> thus: <hi>If three or four other Treasons be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and prov'd, though they be at a loss in one, this doth not straight evince his Innocence.</hi> To this Belief he will draw you (as he says) by a Comparison. Let him put himself in his Geers. Let him play his Tricks of Fast and Loose. In the <hi>Interim</hi> thus I gird up his tedious <hi>Quemadmodum. If one be tyed with three or four Cords, he is not at liberty, though one of them be loos'd, as being still bound with the rest. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as, Even so. Philip</hi> writing to the <hi>Spartans,</hi> prefac'd every Sentence with <hi>If, If, If;</hi> they stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying their Laconical Brevity, and denying the Contents of the Letter, returned nothing but the same Monasyllable. The Objection runs in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s fashion. <hi>If,</hi> is the Postilion of every Line; and I know not but the Answer may be as opposite. If three or four Treasons be prov'd; if he be tyed with three or four Cords; but if those Treasons prove but Misdemeanor, if those Cables be but Threads; if <hi>Sampson</hi> that was bound with them have twitch'd them in peices; then I must say your Cords come in very unseasonably, unless it be to put you in mind of your Mortality. But he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles his Files. Faults in this Paper (he saith) go not alone; that's the Reason he bears the Author company to the end of his Speech; that if there be any Faults, his Answer may match them with Twin-brothers. <hi>Though this reducing the Kingdom by an Irish Army be not proved by Retail, yet 'tis Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Lump. Rip but up the bowels of a former Testimony, and there you shall find it. His Majesty is absolv'd from all Rules of Government, and may do what Power will admit.</hi> So ho! Whither now? My Task is to justifie the Speech in what it treats, not to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109805:66"/>
declame the Question at large. This is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his Speech, but his Conscience that would not be convicted. I am not tyed to follow you in your Wildgoose-chase; yet I am so confident (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the strength of the Cause, or your Weakness, I say not) that I wish you and I might plead it on a Pillory, and he that lost the day pay Ear-rent for us both. But there is danger in following an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> whither it will lead you, especially when he makes up at the Throat of Majesty. He sees that Power will admit the use of an Irish Army, or any other which that Power can purchase. A Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion which deserves to be answer'd with a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt; but 'tis out of fashion; and I am afraid I shall be laughed at, if I speak any thing in defence of the King: yet (thanks be to God) there's no great need on't. His Majesty's Vertues are his strongest Guard. A King, like a Porcupine, is a living Quiver of Darts; every Beam of Majesty is a <hi>Fulmen Terebrans</hi> to his Blaspheming Enemies. My Fellow-traveller stept aside a little to give his Brain a Stool, and now is return'd into the Road, <hi>His Lordship,</hi> he says, <hi>multiplies and is fruitful in Absurdities.</hi> 'Tis true by an equivocal Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for so he begat your Pamphlet, meeting with the putrid Matter of your Invention, as the Sun produceth Insect Animals. The Absurdity is, <hi>he hath no Notion of Subverting the Law Treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but by Force;</hi> and here we must score up the second Quibble, for then (he says) <hi>This Argument will never subvert the Law, as having no Force.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am of a mind, that if my Antagonist were both to Dispute and Answer himself, he would have the best on't, and that's the Course he takes here. He
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109805:66"/>
frames an Argument where none is intended. His Lordship says he knows no other, nay and there is no other; but he doth notinfer the latter from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, therefore there is no other because he knows no other; so that this is a Brat of your own Brain, not drawn from his Lordship's Ignorance (as your scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Quill foam'd at the mouth) but from your own Impudence; and if it halt (as you say) it confesses its Father, it halts before a Creeple. You do well therefore to let Nature work to help your lame Dog over a Stile, to cast it, as you conceive, in a right Frame. <hi>There is no way of Subverting the Law but what I know; but I know no way of Subverting the Law but by forcé.</hi> You would be loath a man should say this is no Syllogism; and yet 'tis true. There's no Figure will give it a Tenement to hide its head in. I could give you a Remove now and set you upright; but I had rather you should take it asunder, and my Lord and you part Stakes; part Propositions; he the <hi>Major,</hi> you the <hi>Minor,</hi> because in the first you say there is so much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in the latter so much Ignorance. You see you are in a Bog; but I will throw my Cloak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, and dance you out; for lo, a most Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Si quis</hi> in quest of the Author of our Tenent. <hi>Who says this?

                           <hi>Licosthenes</hi> at the next Impression. But he makes a Transition from Common Law to Common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and he hopes to be scored up for that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Quibble, but I cannot afford it. <hi>If nothing but Force can subvert Law, then Iudges when they pronounce false Iudgments, stop lawful Defences, let loose the Prerogative,</hi> and all that Rout of Instances which he hath rallied up, <hi>do not subvert the Law.</hi> Well, to do you a Courtesie, they do not. 'Tis one thing to stop a Pipe, to cut an Aqueduct and divert a Conveyance, and another to spoil a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. The Law in this Case suffers a <hi>Deliquium,</hi> but she is not dead. The Subversion of Laws is Root and Branch. A Castle may be dismantled, made unserviceable, and yet 'tis not said then to be quite overthrown. When you usurp'd the Chair of Logick and made a false Syllogism, were the Laws of Logick then subverted? No, but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd; so that if our Author suffer by Injustice (as I hope you are more Historian than Prophet) he will not involve the Laws in his Ruin. Your <hi>Apostrophe</hi> to <hi>Tressilian</hi> is a true <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> for 'tis from the Cause; for will ye introduce a Parity in Offences too? Scan the Cases and you shall find them diverse. But give me leave by the way, to admire your Phrase of the <hi>Iron Laws.</hi> 'Tis a good Argument to me that there is no Alchymy, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Corruption of so many Judges, by this time had turn'd them into Gold: But my Lord must dispute again. Do you carry the Knapsack of his Arguments? My Lord hath a fine time on't, that you should feed him thus with a Spoon? 'Tis thus; <hi>The Earl of</hi> Strafford'<hi>s Practices have been as high as any. The Practices of</hi> Tressilian <hi>have been as</hi>
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:109805:67"/>
                           <hi>high as High Treason.</hi> I wonder where you got all this Logick; at <hi>Furnival</hi>'s Inn? But I know the Reason of it, because <hi>Plutarch</hi> attributes Logick to a Fox, and King <hi>Iames</hi> maintains Discourse in a Hound, that's it which puts you upon Syllogisms. You would be loath to come short of any of your Fellows. For the words of the <hi>Major</hi> (which are only my Lord's, and which indeed I had as lieve he should justifie as I) you must know they are a Comparison: Now Comparisons are betwixt things of the same kind: <hi>As high as any,</hi> that is, in the rank of Misdemeanours. The Painter, when his Picture would not sell for a God, made a special Devil of it, and so he vented it. Though my Lord cannot yield, that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices should be sublimated into Treason; yet place them in the front of any lower Offences, and it seems he will pass it. This Similitude of mine doth not run of all four, no more must you think of that, <hi>As high as any.</hi> But to make few words; suppose I should grant you your Conclusion, that the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Practices were as high as Treason, yet if they be not specified by Statute for Treason, my Lord doth justly abstain his hand from his Dispatch. You ask how these words should sound in the Mouth of a Judge? Truly I have not the measure of your Ears, they are of too large a size for me. I being a Judge hold your Guilt to be as high as Treason; yet having no Law to give me Commission, I'll have no hand in your Sentence: so that supposing all Cases to be like this, I grant you the Assizes would be in vain; the Judges Circuit would be like the wheeling of a Mill, move continually, but never nearer their

Journey's end: but when the Law hath provided sufficiently, unless in a Case as this extraordinary, the Vanity and Mockery, which you speak of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils upon him that first discharged them. For your last, where you would have Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi>'s. Oath to be prefer'd before my Lords Suspicion, I would willingly answer as he did with Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; at the first time nothing, as much at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and at the third <hi>Vouz avez</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> You say his Oath gets an addition of Belief from the Speeches before, and from the Memorials that day; so that you imply what I dare not say, that it is not full of it self, but wants a Supplement of Credit to gain our Faith. As for the words, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded whencesoever they had their Venom, it seems they were poysoned; (for to that, and not to their Pregnancy do I attribute it) that they swell'd into such a bigness, that one Testimony appear'd double: But that you should entitle Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> to this mistake, that he should look through a Multiplying Glass in a case so weighty as that of Treason; the Gentleman's known Integrity saves me the labour of his Defence. So that the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies being but such, though the Charges be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; be the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> as high in his Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as it pleases my Lord to make him, yet my Lord's Dipthong, may easily be justified, and the Earl both at once Condemn'd and Sav'd. Thus I have entreated Patience of my self to Counterpuff your Pamphlet, when by the help of a Penny-worth of Pears I could (more sutably to your Defects) have confuted you backward. But I did it in hopes that you would muzzle your self hereafter; for though your Teeth be hollow and cannot bite, yet wanting Cloves they may Infect.</p>

My Lord, it is my Misfortune, that after ten years Retirement from being engaged in the Differences of the State, having wound up my self in private Recess, and my Comportment to the Publick so inoffensive, that in all this time, neither Fears nor Jealousies have scrupled at my Actions. Being about three Months since at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> I was fetch'd by a Guard before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, and sent Prisoner to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and if it be not a new offence to make an enquiry wherein I offended (for hitherto my Fault was kept as close as my Person) I am induced to believe, that next to my Adherence to the Royal Party, the Cause of my Confinement is the Narrrowness of my Estate; for none stand committed whose Estate can bail them.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109805:69"/>
Accessory to my Guilt. Let it suffice, my Lord, that the Calamity of the War hath made us poor, do not punish us for it. Who ever did Penance for being Ravished; Is it not enough that we are strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd so bare, but must it be made in order to a severer Lash?

I beseech your Highness put some Bounds to the Overthrow, and do not pursue the chase to the other World. Can your Thunder be levell'd so low, as our Grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Condition? Can your Towring Spirit, which hath quarried upon Kingdom's, make a stoop at us, who are the Rubbish of these Ruins. Methinks I hear your former Atchievements interceding with you, not to sully your Glories with trampling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prostrate, nor clog the Wheel of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot with so degenerous a Triumph. The most renowned <hi>Hero's</hi> have ever with such Tenderness cherished their Captives, that their Swords did but cut out work for their Courtesies. Those that fell by their Prowess sprung by their-Favour, as if they had struck them down, only to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound the higher. I hope your Highness, as you are the Rival of their Fame, will be no less of their Virtues. The Noblest Trophy that you can erect to your Honour, is to raise the Afflicted; and since you have subdued all Opposition, it now remains that you attack your self, and with Acts of Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness vanquish your Victory. It is not long since, my Lord, that you knock'd off the Shackles from most of our Party, and by a grand Release did
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109805:69"/>
spread your Clemency as far as your Territories. Let not new Proscriptions interrupt your Jubilee. Let not that your Lenity be slandered as the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush of your farther Rigour. For the Service of his Majesty (if it be objected) I am so far from excusing it, that I am ready to alledge it in my Vindication. I cannot conceit that my Fidelity to my Prince should taint me in your Opinion, I should rather expect it should recommend me to your Favour. Had we not been Faithful to our King, we could not have given our selves to be so to your Highness; you had then trusted us <hi>gratis,</hi> whereas now we have our former Loyalty to vouch us. You see, my Lord, how much I presume upon the Greatness of your Spirit, that dare prevent my Indictment with so frank a Confession, especially in this which I may so safely deny, that it is almost Arrogancy in me to own it: For the Truth is, I was not qualified enough to serve Him: All I could do was to bear a part in his Sufferings, and to give my self to be Crushed with his Fall. Thus my Charge is doubled; my Obedience to my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and what is the Result of that, my want of Fortune. Now whatever reflection I have upon the former, I am a true Penitent for the latter. My Lord, you see my Crimes; as to my Defence you bear it about you. I shall plead nothing in my Justification, but your Highness's Clemency, which as it is the constant Inmate of a valiant Breast, if you graciously be pleased to extend it to your Suppliant, in taking me out of this withering Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, your Highness will find, that Mercy will establish you more than Power, though all the days of your Life, were as pregnant with

holds good in Reason, that the shore moves and falls off from the Sayler; whence you see, Sir, there is some possibility I might reverse your Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, were it not for one Argument which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirms them, The sage Experience you have treasur'd up in your Observations; for no sooner had you lost your Native Soil, but by way of Reprisal you took in others. The Dominions you visit you carry along with yóu, and by a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Industry make them pay Tribute to your Understanding. Not like a number of our Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gallants, who return so empty and without their Errand, as if their Travel (like Witches in the Air) were nothing but the Waftage of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Phantasie, perswading themselves that they circle the Globe, when the Card they sail by, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a slumbring Imposture. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we are too Grave, Sir. What if we unbend a while, and presume to tell you, that in all your Errantry there is no Adventure so much affects me, as that of the Nun; where I cannot determine, whether your Love it self were more Exotick, or the form of accosting it: For although it be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for Jealousie to study Fornication, and every Cuckold within his own Precincts to be an Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer; yet never before have I heard of a Mistress fenc'd with a Portcullice, or an amorous Visit manag'd with the Caution, which suspicious Kings use in an Enterview. This manner of Greeting may not unfitly be termed <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Barriers; a breathing Exercise, rather than a Combat, where the Sporting Champions have a Rail to part them, that they may not fight it out to the uttermost. Had your old Romancing Spirit possess'd you,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109805:74"/>
the Brandish'd Blade would have freed the Lady from her Enchanted Durance. Nor had you been less concern'd in the Rescue than the Fair Recluse; for who that blows short in expectation of his Love, and in the Heat of Impatience, should be severed from his Hopes by a few envious Barrs, would not feel himself (like another St. <hi>Laurence)</hi> broil'd on a Gridiron? But see how Customs vary with the Clime. As there are some Regions who salute one another, by putting off their Shoes instead of their Hats; so it seems, where you have been, there is as different a form of Imprisonment or Commitment. The Prisoner is at large and without the Grates, wishing for Admittance, and she at whose Suit his Soul is arrested, close clap'd up and abridg'd of Liberty. Sure at this Grate those Chrisom Lovers, call'd Platonicks, had their first Training. Those Queasie Gamesters that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et themselves with the very Notion of Mingling Souls, without putting the Body to farther Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage, than kissing of Hands and twisting of Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams. For your part, Sir, you are none of those puling Stomachs: You have an Appetite for a whole Cloister. It is but Trifling Sport for you to pull down an Out-lyer, unless you leap the Pale and let slip at the Herd. I wonder what Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms the Abbess us'd to get quit of the <hi>Incubus;</hi> for had she not check'd your Hovering Temptations, I am confident by this time you had transform'd the Covent, and turn'd the Nunnery into a <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But in sober Sadness, why a Nun, Sir?

State, as fixing upon one of another World. Had your Passion been centred on the Beauty of her Soul, I had look'd upon it as the Act of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. Such a Love might justly have been Christned by the name of Zeal, being setled on a Person, with whom to be enamour'd is in a sort to take Orders. Hence it is, there want not some who suspect your Religion, lest equivocating from the Beauty of her Person to that of her Profession, you should turn Monastick. Others, who are better acquainted with the warmth of your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are rather solicitous for the Church in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, lest with <hi>Luther</hi> you should marry a Nun, and so with him make her a Joynture in a new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If this be your Plot, Consider, I pray you, how difficult it is to innovate farther in this Age of Novelties, when the World is so spent in new Inventions, that for want of Gain, even Rust and Rottenness are flourished over with a seeming Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Not one of all those Beldam-Heresies that did Penance formerly by the Doom of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, but hath cast her Skin since these Confusions, and giveth her self out for a Blooming Virgin. But I think I may spare this piece of Counsel, I dare be your Compurgator for meddling with Religion. That which fir'd your Spirits was the Ambition of the Enterprize; nor could you entertain a more Aspiring Phrensie, but by making Love to a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Body. Tell me, I pray you, how many Beads did you drop in Wooing? By what Liturgy did you frame your Courtship? Laick Applications are here scandalous; nor will it avail to say, you languish without her Compassion. A Sensual Man is able to vitiate the Vestal Flame, even by his

Martyrdom; other Lovers in the Jollity of their Trope are wont to canonize their Mistresses, as being of opinion that the Native Rubrick of their Cheeks hath hallowed them. Will you run Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that Consecration, and degrade a Saint by Mortal Addresses? If you have no room in your Calendar for Persons upon Earth, yet do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane a Probationer of Heaven; as if the readiest way to rectifie Superstition, were, with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Reformers, to bow it into Atheism. Let me advise you, Sir, to retrieve your self back from this Carnal Sacrilege. Catch not at <hi>Herostratus</hi> his Fame, by setting fire on the Temple, and dispute not a share of Guilt with <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in causing a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Fall of Angels. Nay, never start, Sir, not look about at the Expression: For I perswade my self, that those Divines who allot to each of us a Tutelar Angel for our Protection, would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their Opinion, should they leave her to her own Tuition; as hardly knowing in such a Person, how to distinguish between the Charge and the Guardian. Sir, I was entreated by our Noble Friend, that what my Fancy suggested upon this Subject, I would mould into Number; but I must beg your pardon, it being a Request with which to comply were to be your Fellow-criminal, and by a Conformity of Guilt pervert a Votary: For even my Muse is vow'd and vail'd too, she is set apart for the Service of my Mistress, and what is that but entring Orders in the true Religion. The Truth is this; she is so chastly confin'd to that sole Employment, that should I in Verse attempt to yield you an account how much I honour you, not a whole Grove of Laurel would bribe her to a

Nothing but Joy and Triumph, Pomp and Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants at the Resurrection.

                        <p>I begin with the Evening, and so I may well style the Passion, since the Horrour thereof turn'd Noon into Night, and made a Miracle maintain my Metaphor. The Sun was obscur'd by Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and his Darkness points us to a greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse. The Sun and the Moon, what are they but Parables of our Saviour, and the Soul of Man? The Moon is the Soul; I am sure her Spots will not confute the Similitude. I might here slacken the Reins of my Comparison, and shew you how the Moon of her self is a dark Body, and what Light she partakes, she receives it from the Sun

How every Soul is by Nature sinful, and in the Shadow of Death, till <hi>the Light that lightens the Gentiles, till the day-spring on high visit us.</hi> I might pursue my Allegory in the Eclipse. The Shadow of the Earth intercepts the Beams of the Sun, and so the Moon suffers an Eclipse. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Profit, those two Dugs of the World, what are they but Earthly shadows that Eclipse the Soul, and deprive it of the sweet influence of the Sun of Righteousness. But I hold me to the Metaphor, my Téxt will warrant the Parallel. As the Moon is Eclipsed by the Earth, so she her self Eclipses the Sun.

Man's sets God and him at odds; God's reconciles them. The Moon when she is Eclipsed, is always in Opposition with the Sun. The Soul will sin, though she be at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God for't: But the Sun, when he is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed, is always in Conjunction with the Moon.

The only way to comprehend the Sufferings of our Creator, is by feeling the Pulse of the Creature. What shall I say to the Convulsion of the Rocks? The Lapidary tells you, how the Compassionate Turcoise confesseth the Sickness of his Wearer by changing colour. The whole Rocks suffered with our Saviour, they were cleft; and shall not this rend our stony hearts? O that <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Men were not now a Fable! <hi>Caucasus</hi> is supple in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of our Breasts.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109805:78"/>
the old Philosophers; who held the Soul to be Fire; some Air, some Water; none ever had so gross a Soul, as to conceive it to be Earth. O that in this case we were Earthy-minded! That we were affected with this Religious Palsie! Then should we see that <hi>Motus Trepidationis,</hi> the Motion of the Heavens as well as the Earth. We must <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> But the Earth hath quaked so long till it hath awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dead: nor is it a wonder that the Dead live, when Life it self can dye. Heaven descends into the Bowels of the Earth, and, to make up the Anagram, the Graves open and the Dust ariseth. Thus were all things shuffled, and Nature rung the Bells backwards, as if every Creature desir'd to bear the Burden of our Saviour's Elegy. <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite &amp; videte—Behold and see, if ever there was sorrow like unto my sorrow.

                     <l>If this our loss a comfort can admit,</l>
                     <l>'Tis that his narrow'd <hi>Crown</hi> is grown unfit</l>
                     <l>For his enlarged Head, since his distress</l>
                     <l>Had greatned this, as it made that the less;</l>
                     <l>His <hi>Crown</hi> was fallen unto too low a thing</l>
                     <l>For him who was become so great a <hi>King:</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>So the same hands enthron'd him in that <hi>Crown</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>They had exalted from him, not pull'd down:</l>

And thus God's Truth by them hath rendred more</l>
                     <l>Than ere Mens falshood promis'd to restore;</l>
                     <l>Which, since by death alone he could attain,</l>
                     <l>Was yet exempt from Weakness, and from Pain.</l>
                     <l>Death was enjoyn'd by God to touch a part,</l>
                     <l>Might make his Passage quick, ne'er move his heart:</l>
                     <l>Which ev'n expiring was so far from death,</l>
                     <l>It seem'd but to command away his Breath.</l>
                     <l>And thus his <hi>Soul,</hi> of this her Triumph proud,</l>
                     <l>Broke, like a flash of Lightning, through the Cloud</l>
                     <l>Of Flesh and Blood; and from the highest Line</l>

For Sir, as we had lost you, or your Fate,</l>

                        <l>So truly mourn'd, that we did only lack</l>
                        <l>One to begin, and put us all in Black.</l>
                        <l>The Court, as quite dissolv'd, did sadly tell,</l>

                        <l>Your Births, great Queen, have made a new Account,</l>
                        <l>Who bring not forth some Olives, but the Mount;</l>
                        <l>And we, who wisht your Table half Way round</l>
                        <l>Beset with them, do now behold it crown'd.</l>
                        <l>Were there no other Court, or Nobles, yet</l>
                        <l>The King, we see, can his own Court beget:</l>
                        <l>Nay, in the first Worlds Age, he that could do</l>
                        <l>Like him, was Father of his Country too.</l>
                        <l>When in that Dearth of Subjects, Kings were fain</l>
                        <l>First to beget their Kingdoms, and then reign,</l>
                        <l>When their own Off-spring were their People; and</l>
                        <l>One Family both fill'd, and made the Land.</l>
                        <l>But I speak Treason, to say Princes Blood</l>

                        <l>The Work deserves a Shrine: I should rehearse</l>

Of devout Rebels, the Non-ships which be</l>

                  <p>THe Beginnings of the Second <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>'s Reign are turmoiled with a Rebellion, which shook his Throne and Empire: A Rebellion, not more against Religion and Order, than Nature and Humanity too; a Rebellion never to be believed, but in the Age it was acted in, and our own, in which we find how terrible the Overflows of the common People (ever delighted in the Calamities of others) untyed, and hurryed on by their own Wills, and beastly Fury, must prove. Though <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi> is short of <hi>Tyler,</hi> yet if we compare that Fisherman with our Hind, the Neapolitan Mechanicks, and our Clowns, we shall not find them much unlike; not in their sudden Flourish and Prosperity, not in the Mischiefs they did, and the barbarous savage Rudeness in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: <hi>Masanello</hi> made a Shew of foolish unseasonable Piety to the Prince and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, which became not his part, which made him the more imperfect Rebel, the worse Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician; however, he might seem the better
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:109805:209"/>
Man; but these too might be but counterfeit Reverence, this might be his Disguise, and he might have come up to more, according to the new Lights, which we may imagine was break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in. The Continuance and Mis-rule of these Worthies were much of a Length; in a few 'Days the Brands themselves had fired, broke upon their own Heads; they were pluck'd up before their full Growth, like airy flitting Clouds, they were blown over e'er they could pour down the Storm they were big with. The Colours of these Tumults were fair, and taking, such as their Architects <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Straw,</hi> the Priests had laid, such as the Masters of these Schools have deliver'd in all Ages. The Weal publick, the Liberty of the free-born People pilled, and flayed by the King's Taxes, and the cruel Oppression of the Gentry, Iustice, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or Regulation of Fundamental Laws long subverted (considerable Names if we may believe them) set them on. The King, his Glory, his Honour, his Safety, the King and the Commons are cry'd up. But the King was compassed with Traitors and Malignants, they will have it so, and it is their Care to remove them Root and Branch; they will fire the House to cleanse it; much other Business they had, much was amiss, much to be reformed, but in the first Sally all is not noised; what was not

handsome, what might give a fuller Fright was lapped up in Folds, to be discovered as they had thriven, to be swallowed, but gilded with a Victory: we know Crimes carried in a happy Stream of Luck, lose their Names in it, are Beautiful, and must be thought so: The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale of the Sword justified <hi>Caesar,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Pompey,</hi> not his Cause. <hi>Adversae res etiam bonos detractant</hi> (says <hi>Salust.)</hi> Good Men if they miscarry, do not only lose themselves but their Integrity, their Iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, their Honesty; they are what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror pleases, and the silly Multitude, which ever admires the glitter of Prosperity, will hate them. Providence preserved the English Nation from this Blow. The Lawrel of Success crowned not the Rebels, they crumble to their first Dust again, are ruined by their own Weight and Confusion. They had risen like those Sons of the Dragons Teeth, in Tempests, without Policy or Advice. Their Leaders were meerly fantastical, but Goblins and Shadows; Men willing to embroyl, and daring, whose Courage was better than their Cause; and who to advance the Design would not boggle at a piece of Honesty, an Oath, a Protestation, or Covenant, a Verse of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a Case of Conscience in the Way of brave, bold, manly Spirits; yet without Heads or Wits to

The Heathens make it a Mark of the Divinity of their Gods, that they bestowed Benefits upon Mortal Men, and took nothing from them. The Clowns of the Idol upon this Rule were not very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, they were the meek Ones of those times, the only Inheritors of Right; the Kingdom was made a Prey by them, it was cantoned out to erect new Principalities for the Mock-Kings of the Commons; so their Chiefs or Captains would be called. Here, though the Title of Rebellion spoke fair, was shewn somewhat of Ambition, and no little of unjust private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, no little of Self-seeking, which the Good of the People (in Pretence only) was to give Way to, and no Wonder for the good of the People properly, was meerly to be intended of themselves: and no where but amongst those was the Commonwealth.

Such was then the Face of things; Estates were dangerous; Every rich Man was an Enemy; Mens Lives were taken away without either Offence or Tryal, their Reign was but a Continuation of horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Injuries; the Laws were not only silent, but dead: The Idol's Fury was a Law, and Faith, and Loyalty, and Obedience to Lawful Power, were damnable: Servants had the Rule over Princes, <hi>England</hi> was near a Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the most unworthy of free and ingenious Spirits of any.</p>

                  <p>THe Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was but a Throw of State for so many Years, a Feaver to whose Distempers all pieces of the home Dominions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by Fits (<note n="*" place="margin">Guien.</note> the forraign part only continuing faithful.) In the fourth Year of his Reign, and Fifteenth of his Age the Dregs and Off-scum of the Commons unite into Bodies in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Kingdom, and form a Rebellion (called the Rebellion of the <hi>Clowns)</hi> which lead the rest, and shewed the Way of Disobedience first. Of which may truly be said (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other Causes, we may attribute it to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition and Unseasonableness of the Age, that the Fruits of it did not take) it was strongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and had not Providence held back the Hand, the Blow had fallen, the Government had broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Shivers then. The young King at this time had few besides <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodstock</hi> his Uncle,

Earl of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and after Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> but the Servants of his House in Ordinary about him, the Lord <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley</hi> Earl of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> after Duke of <hi>York,</hi> with the Lords <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ, Botereaux,</hi> Sir <hi>Matthew Gourney,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Nobility and Gentry, had set sail for <hi>Portugal,</hi> the Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> another of his Uncles, was in <hi>Scotland</hi> treating a Peace, when this Commotion brake out. Though no Cause can be given for Seditions, those, who design publick Troubles, can never want Pretences; <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidore</hi> (as much out in this Story as any) gives this Reason for this; the Poll-mony, says he (impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Parliament) a Groat Sterling upon every Head was intolerable. It was justly imposed, and so by some, to whom Law and Custom of <hi>England</hi> were intolerable not to be endured; but we shall find in the Tyranny breaking in, not only fifth and twentieth Parts and Loans forced, out of Fear of Plunder and Death; but Subsidies in Troop and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, by Fifties, (more than Sequestrations and Compositions) not under Foot, low Sales; for what had these Rascals to give, but down-right Robbery and Violent Usurpations of Estates.</p>
                  <p>Thus would <hi>Polidore</hi> have it in Defence of his Priests, who blew the Fire, and thrust the silly Rout into the midst of it. He takes it ill that <hi>Baal (Valle</hi> he calls him) should be supposed, by I know not what Flatterers of the Nobles, to have filled these Sails, to have let these Winds out of their Caverns.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth Year of this King (says the Monk) there was a grievous Tax exacted in <hi>Parliament;</hi> after Cause of great Trouble, every Religious paid

half a Mark, every secular Priest as much, every Lay-Man or Woman <hi>12d.</hi> This might discontent the People, but who prepared the Mutineers for such dangerous Impressions? Who fell in with them after, and pushed them forward, will be soon found. <hi>Froissart</hi> complains of the Servitude of the Villains or Bond-men (now Names worn out) a miserable sort of Drudges, frequently known here in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times; excluded from any Right of Propriety, sold, and passed away with the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Lands to which they belonged, bound to till the Lords Ground, cut down, and carry in his Corn, cleanse his Ditches, cover his Hall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These <hi>Froissart</hi> make the first Stirrers in the Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, these he makes look back to the Beginning of Men and things to talk of the Primitive Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of the Liberties of the Creature, above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; that only Treason against the Lords could forfeit Liberty, which was the Case of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi> and could not be made theirs, who were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels nor Spirits, but Men of the same Shape, Extraction, and Souls with those who proudly would be thought their Lords; which (say they) was an height too much, and deserved Levelling, must not be endured hereafter.

The People of the Town (says the Knight) were of the same Sect, it seems the Castle (once one of the strongest in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,) was now neither fortified nor manned, the Governour Sir <hi>Iohn Moton</hi> yields himself into their Hands; he was one of the Kings Family, of his Houshold, and must be thought awed, as he was into the Engagement.

was said, the Knight yields, but his Charge of <hi>Captain General</hi> is forgotten; we shall see here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after what Use they make of him, and in what manner he must be employed. This Example is followed in the other Countrys. The Gentry did not only lose their Estates, and Honour, but their Courage and Gallantry, their Bloods were frozen, Fear had stifled their Spirits.

Persons. <hi>Walsingham</hi> tells us, who those Advocates and Procurers were; All Men (says he) were amused, some looked for good from the new Masters, others feared this Insurrection would prove the Destruction of the Realm. The last were not deceived. All the Lawyers of the Land (so he goes on) as well the Apprentices, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, as old Justices, all the Jury-men of the Country, (this was Priest <hi>Baal's</hi> Charge) they could gripe in their Clutches had their Heads chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off.</p>
                  <p>It was a Maxim of the <hi>Cabal,</hi> That there could be no Liberty, while any of these Men were suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to breath. From little to great they fell upon things which they never thought of in their first Overflow, which <hi>Guicciardine</hi> observes (in civil Discords, where the Rebellion is Fortunate and Mens Minds are puft up with Success) to be Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. The Statue of <hi>Cumaean Apollo</hi> weeps for the Destruction of <hi>Cumae,</hi> we shall here read of Men without Sense or Apprehensions; both the Stories will seem as Incredible. The stupid Nobility and Gentry sleep in their Houses, till they are roused by these Blood-hounds, that they might seem to deserve the Calamity tumbling upon their Heads. They were becoming Tenants at Will, in Villei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, to their Vassals, under their Distress, their Task, and Taxes, more by the sottish Baseness of themselves, than any Vertue in these Rascals, scorned and sleighted by every tatter'd Clunch; Their Lands continually upon any Vote or Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be sold, or given away upon any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Loyalty, or Faithfulness: The ancient Vertues of the Gentleman, not to be found in that

Next (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to this Riffraff) their Cruelty reaches to Parchment Deeds, Charters, Rolls of Courts; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences are cast by them into the Fire, as if they meant to abolish all Remembrance of things; this was to defeat their Lords in the Claims of any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights; and to leave no Man more Title than themselves had to their Sword and Power.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kentish</hi> and <hi>Essexian</hi> Rout, were joyned (says the Monk, but <note place="margin">Wals.</note> he tells us not where) and approached near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> at <hi>Black-heath</hi> they made an Halt, where they were near 200000 strong.</p>
                  <p>Thither came two Knights sent by the King to them, to inquire <note place="margin">Wals.</note> the Cause of the Commotion, and why they had amassed such Swarms of the People. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, they met to conferr with the King concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Business of Weight; they tell the Messengers they ought to go back to the King and shew him, that it behoves him to come to them, they would acquaint him with their Desires (we shall quickly discover why his Presence was required.) Upon Return of the Knights, it was debated in Council by the Lords about the King, whether he should go or no: Some of the Table more willing to
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:109805:222"/>
venture the King than themselves, willing to throw him into the Gulph, or perhaps not senting the Design of the <hi>Clowns,</hi> perswade him to see them: Your Majesty (thus they) must make a Tryal of these Men, Necessity now must be looked on above Reason; if any thing can give the Check to the Uproars, it must be your Presence, there can be no Safety but in this Venture; it is now as dangerous to seem not to trust, as to be deceived; Fate is too much feared, if it be imagined that this Tree of your Empire, which has flourished so many Ages, can fall in an Hour.</p>

Petitions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you upon Swords Points are fatal; if you allow this Custom you are ruined; as yet Sir, you may be obeyed as much as you please.</hi> Of this Opinion was Sir <hi>Robert Hales,</hi> Lord <hi>Prior</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> newly Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> a Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and stout Knight, but not liked by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

                  <p>Hereupon, without more Consideration they advance towards <hi>London,</hi> not forgetting to burn, and raze the Lawyers and Courtiers Houses in the Way, to the Kings Honour no doubt, which they will be thought to arm for.

Your Person will be safe, they repute you still their <hi>King</hi> (this deserved Thanks) but how long the Kindness will hold we shall soon find, they profess that all they had done or would do was for your Honour. <hi>For your Glory (your Honour and Security are their great Care) they will make you a Glorious King, fearful to your Enemies, and beloved of your Subjects; they promise you a plentiful and unparalell'd Revenue. They will maintain your Power and Authority in Relation to the Laws, with your Royal Person, according to the Duty of their Allegiance, their Protestation, their Vow, their solemn League and Covenant, without diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your just Power and Greatness, and that they will all the Days of their Lives continue in this Covenant against all Opposition.</hi> They assure you Sir, <hi>That they intend faithfully the Good of your Majesty, and of the Kingdom, and that they will not be diverted from this end by any private or Self-respects whatsoever.</hi> But the Kingdom has been a long time ill governed by your Uncles, and the Clergy; especially by
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:109805:223"/>
the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of whom they would have an Account. They have found out necessary Counsels for you; they would warn you of many things, which hitherto you have wanted good Advice in.</p>
                  <p>The Conclusion was sad on the Knights part. His Children were Pledges for his Return, and if he fail in that, their Lives were to answer it. Which moved with the King; he allows the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, sends him back with this Answer, that he will speak with the <hi>Commons</hi> the next Morning; which it should seem the report of the Outrages done by the <hi>Clowns</hi> upon his Refusal, and this Message made him consent to. At the time appointed he takes his Barge, and is rowed down to <hi>Redriffe,</hi> the place nearest the Rebels; Ten thousand of them des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the Hill to see, and treat with him, (with a Resolution to yield to nothing, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Treaty; as they must have done, had not the Kings Fear preserved him.) When the Barge drew nigh, the new Council of State (says our Knight) <note place="margin">Froiss.</note> howled, and shouted, as though all the Devils of Hell had been amongst them; Sir <hi>Iohn Moton</hi> was brought toward the River guarded, they being determined to have cut him in peices, if the King had broke his Promise.</p>
                  <p>All the Desires of these good and faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors contracted suddenly into a narrow Room, they had now but one Demand. The King asks them, What is the matter which made them so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sollicite his Presence? They have no more to say, but to intreat him to land; which was to betray himself to them, to give his Life and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty

up to those fickle Beasts, to be held of them during their good Pleasures; which the Lords will not agree to. The Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> of the ancient Nobility, and Illustrious House of <hi>Montacute,</hi> tells them their Equipage and Order were not comely, and that the King ought not to adventure amongst their Troops. They are now more unsatisfied, and <hi>London</hi> how true soever to the <hi>Cause,</hi> and faithless to the Prince, shall feel the Effects of their Fury. <hi>Southwark</hi> a friendly Borough, is taken up for their first Quarters. Here again they throw down the Malignants Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and as a Grace of their Entrance, break up the Kings Prisons, and let out all those they find under Restraint in them; not forgetting to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack the Arch-bishops House at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and spoil all things there—plucking down the Stews standing upon the Thames Bank, and allowed in the former Ages. It cannot be thought but that the Idol loved Adultery well enough, but perhaps these publick Bawdy-houses were too unclean, and might stink in his Nostrils; we cannot find him any where quarrelling with the Bears, those were no Malignants.</p>
                  <p>They knocked not long at the City-Gates, which (some say) <note place="margin">Wals.</note> were never shut against them, or (as others) quickly opened: The Citizens fancyed themselves Privy Counsellors born, inspired from their Shops for Affairs of State, and would not suppose the Reformation could be effected without them. They were rich by Lyes, and all the most sordid Ways of Falshood, and must be sage and knowing; Pride the first Sin the Devil taught Man tickles

them. The Mayor Sir <hi>William Waleworth,</hi> whose Memory (while Truth and Loyalty shall be thought Vertues) must be Honourable, and nine of the Aldermen held for King <hi>Richard,</hi> in vain; a prosperous wicked Chief shall never want wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Instruments; three Aldermen, and the greatest part of the People for the King of the <hi>Commons,</hi> the Idol, and his Priests. Those, the <hi>Considers,</hi> and well-affected to <hi>Tyler,</hi> forbid their Mayor to keep him out, own his Actions, as done for the Good of the faithful People of the Land, and the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and his Followers for their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Companions of the <hi>Holy Cause. They vow to live and dye with Tyler.</hi> Many of those who had no thoughts of doing Mischief (yet being none of the wisest) were cheated into a good Belief of them, because of their <hi>Protestation</hi> (which in their first Entrance they made solemnly) that they had no Intent, but this only, to search and hunt out the Traitors of the Kingdom, the <hi>Subverters of the fundamental Laws, evil Counsellors and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> and that this done they would give over, they would disband, and return home the same Men they were, to their Farms and Cottages, without enriching themselves, without any other Harvest of their Labour; <hi>not doubting but that in the end, it should appear to all the World, that their Endeavours have been most hearty and sincere, for the Maintenance of Religion, the Kings just Prerogatives, the Laws and Liberties of the Land; in which Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by the Grace of God, they would persist, though they should perish in the Work.</hi> Which was believed. What confirmed this Faith was, they made Theft Capital (which yet was confined, all without the

                  <p>The Citizens were their Purveyors, and made Provision for them; every House was open to them, and Tables continually furnished. Their Entry was on the 14th. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1385. on Wednesday (a little before Midsummer) the Eve of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Day; they spend the Morning of the next Day, being the Festival, in Ringes, discoursing of the Piety, Honesty, and Fairness of their Cause, of Liberty and the Courses to gain it, Of seizing Traitors, <hi>Of bringing Incendiaries, Malignants, and evil Instruments to condign Punishment,</hi> Of the Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> who was above all Men hated by them, but too far off for the Scratches of their Claws, being imployed in <hi>Scotland</hi> to treat a Peace there, whence these report him turned a Traytor to the <hi>King,</hi> and become Scottish: About Noon, being warmed more by their Cups, than with the Sun, for the richest Wines were drawn for them, and swallowed with that Greediness, that they were got to the height of Drunkenness and raved like Mad-men, they are for Execution; the Savoy of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> a Princely Building, the most stately Fabrick of the Kingdom was fired by them, his Servants there murthered, his Plate and Jewels broke in pieces, a Coat of his of great Value (called in that Age a Jack) in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn to this Prince, was stuck on the top of a Launce, made a Mark for their Arrows, then cut and gashed to Jaggs with their Hatchets; one of them who had hid a piece of Plate, was

This Night the King was counselled to fall upon these Beasts, for the most part drunk, and cut their Throats, easie to be destroyed, if any Man had had but the Courage to overcome. It was the Gallant Mayors Advice, they lay on Heaps without Sense or Motion, tired with the Mischiefs of the Day, drunk and asleep, without Guards or Watch; the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and the Nobility, against whose Lives, Honours and Fortunes these Beasts had conspired, desire the King to try all fair and gentle Ways of appeasing them, which Counsel he approves. They were not so kind to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, many lost their Lives by the Hands and Swords of their Companions; every petty discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or grudging, being enough to provoke them. Thirty two of them being drunk in a Cellar of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> were immured there, finding in the same place Death and the Grave together. Some of them threw Barrels of Gunpowder (which was little known then) into the Fire, and are blown up with part of the Palace.</p>
                  <p>Proclamations were formerly made in <hi>Tylers</hi> Name, not in <hi>Straws,</hi> (as <hi>Polydore</hi> would have it.) <hi>Straw</hi> was this while busied elsewhere. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about was by these Proclamations summoned to repair to <hi>London</hi> with all speed, to spoil this <hi>Babylon;</hi> the close Menaces <hi>(lest they provoke Gods Iudgments)</hi> pluck them down upon their Heads; which themselves explain, if ye fail, <hi>if ye and your Officers give not Obedience freely to the Protector,</hi> we will send out 20000 Men (20000 of our Locusts) who shall burn the Towns of the Children of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.

                     <hi>Iack Straw</hi> Captain of this Herd, calls these new Comers to <note place="margin">Richard.</note> him, and forces them to swear to adhere to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and the Commons. How long this <hi>Oath</hi> will be sworn to we shall see, and how much the safer the King will be for it.</p>
                  <p>We shall see too what is lost by this new Union of King and Commons, by the new Fellowship to observe the horrible Irreligious Hypocrisie of these <hi>Clowns,</hi> who only would be thought the <hi>Protectors</hi> of his Crown and Person. They alone had decreed his Ruin, who swear thus often to prevent it, to guard him from it; A <hi>Treason</hi> not to be believed by some then, till it had taken. The Commons were then divided into three Bodies, this with <hi>Iack Straw,</hi> the second at <hi>Mile-end</hi> under the Essexian Princes, <hi>Kirkby, Treder, Scot,</hi> and <hi>Rugge,</hi> the third on Tower-hill, where the Idol, and Priest <hi>Baal</hi> were in Chief.</p>
                  <p>This last Crue grew horribly rude, and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Commons there were not contented to be the Kings Tasters and no more, they snatch the Kings Provision violently from the Purveyors, he is to be starved for his own Good, and after Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies or Vultures, chuse you whether, strike high, like brave Birds of Prey they will kill no more Flies; this was the Way to secure their smaller

She swoons, and is carried pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to the Wardrobe by her Servants. Some revile and threaten the Noblest Knights of the Houshold, some stroke their Beards with their unclean Hands (which beyond the Roman Patience in the same Rudeness from the <hi>Gauls</hi> is endured) and this to claw, and sweeten (they meant it so) they gloss, with smooth Words, and bespeak a lasting Friendship for the time to come; they must maintain the Injuries done to themselves; must not disturb the Usurpers of their Estates and Rights; must not shew any Sense of Generosity, of Faith, of Honour, (it concerned <hi>Tyler</hi> that they should be the veriest Fools and Cowards breathing) if they stir, make any Claims, they shall be reputed Seditious, Turbulent, and Breakers of the Publick (otherwise and plainly) <hi>Tylers Peace.</hi> It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard (says the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>Sleydan)</hi> that it should be lawful to despoil any Man of his Estates and Rights, and unlawful to restore him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our <hi>Tyler</hi> and his Anabaptists thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>

He was a Valiant Man and Pious, and expected these Blood-hounds with great Security and Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind; when their bellowing first struck his Ears, he tells his Servants that Death came now as a more particular Blessing; where the Comforts of Life were taken away, that Life was irksome to him, (perhaps his pious Fears for the Church and Monarchy, both alike indangered, and fatally tied to the same Chain, might make him weary of the World) and that he could now dye with more quiet of Conscience than ever; a Quiet which these Parricides will not find, when they shall pay the Score of this and their other Crimes.

                  <p>The generous Lord Mayor obeys the Sentence, which was given by the same Power, by which the Judges of Courts sat and acted, when Justice flowed down from the Fountain in the ordinary Channel, and which the Damm Head being thus troubled by this Wolf, could flow no otherwise, which was Authority sufficient; by this Power <hi>Richards</hi> Captains must fight when he has them, and kill those whom the Courts of Justice cannot deal with: <hi>Tyler</hi> faints and shrinks to what he had been, he was as cowardly as cruel, and could not seem a Man in any thing but that he was a Thief, and a Rebel: He asks the brave Mayor <hi>in what he was offendedly him?</hi> This was a strange Question to an honest Man; he finds it so. <hi>The Mayor</hi> (says <hi>Froissart) calls him false stinking Knave, and tells him he shall not speak such Words in the Presence of his natural Lord the King.</hi> The Mayor answers in full upon the accursed Sacrilegious Head of the Idol with his Sword. He struck heartily, and like a faithful zealous Subject. <hi>Dagon</hi> of the <hi>Clowns</hi> sinks at his Feet. The <hi>Kings</hi> Followers inviron him round, <hi>Iohn Standish</hi> an Esquire of the Court, alights, and runs him into the Belly, which thrust sent him into another World, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him who taught Rebellion, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der first. Event was then no Sign of a good Cause.</p>
                  <p>All History now brands him for a Traitor, which by some will be attributed to his Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:109805:236"/>
without Doubt had he prospered in the <hi>Work,</hi> he had had all the Honours which goe along with Prosperity. The <hi>King</hi> had been the wrong Doer, and his <note place="margin">Ut reus sit vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendus. est.</note> Afflictions, if nothing in so much Youth could have been found out, had been Crimes; we must over-power those whom we would make guilty. <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France</hi> under the <hi>Popes</hi> Interdict, is told by a Gentleman, Sir, if we be overcome, we shall dyne condemned Hereticks; if your Majesty conquer, the Censures shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, they will fall of themselves. He who reads the Mischiefs of his Usurpation, will think he perished too late.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to an Act of <hi>Richards</hi> the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of his History, which the <hi>Annals</hi> past can no where parallel; here his Infancy excells his after Man-hood. Here, and in the Gallantry of his Death, he appears a full Prince, and perhaps vies with all the Bays of his Usurpers Triumphs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Monarch of the World, (not more wondered at for his Victories, than for that suppressing the Sedition of his <hi>Macedons</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and unable to march, whither his Ambition carried him on Wings) leaps from his Throne of State, into the Battels of his <hi>Phalanges</hi> enraged, seizes Thirteen of the Chief Malecontents, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers them to the Custody of his Guards. <note place="margin">Curtius</note> knows not what he should impute this Amazement of the Seditious to, every Man returning upon it to his old Duty, and Obedience, and ready to yield himself up into the same Hands: It might be (says he) the Veneration of the Majesty of <note place="margin">Lib.</note>

equally with the Gods, or of himself which laid the Tempest. That Confidence too of the Duke <hi>Alessandro</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> in a Mutiny of the <hi>German</hi> Ruiters at <hi>Namurs</hi> is memorable, who made his Way with his Sword alone through the Points of all their Lances, into the middest of their Troops, and brought thence by the Collar one of the Mutineers, whom he commanded to be hang'd to the Terror of the rest. The Youth of <hi>Richard</hi> begat rather Contempt, than Reverence, of which too these <hi>Clowns</hi> Breasts were never very full: When the Fall of the Idol was known to the Rout, they put themselves into a Posture of Defence, thunder out nothing but Vengeance to the <hi>King</hi> and his, whom they now arraign of Murder and Tyranny: He is guilty of <hi>Innocent Blood,</hi> a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> a <hi>Traitor,</hi> an <hi>Homicide,</hi> the <hi>publick Enemy of the Common-wealth</hi> Richard Plantagenet is indicted <hi>in the Name of the People of</hi> England <hi>of Treason; and other heinous Crimes.</hi> He is now become less than <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> Ghost, a Traitor to the <hi>Free-born Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Treason was, he would not destroy himself, he would not open his Body to <hi>Tylers</hi> full Blow. They roar out, our <hi>Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> is slain treacherously, let us <note place="margin">

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:109805:237"/>
resenting this Blow here: Let his Tyrannies, his Exorbitances have been what they would, they would have answer'd no doubt in the Negative: Though <hi>Richard</hi> might have been struck thorough and thorough, <hi>Tyler</hi> who had usurped his Power, must have been Sacred, it must have been Treason to touch him: <hi>Phocas</hi> must not be hurt: In <hi>Tylers</hi> Case <hi>Straw</hi> would allow the old Text again: The Powers were to be obeyed. Their Bows were drawn when the <hi>King</hi> gallops up to them alonae, and riding round the Throng asks them, what Madness it was that armed them thus against their own Peace, and his Life, whether they would have no end of Things or Demands.</p>
                  <p>He tells them, If Liberty be their only Aim, as hitherto they have pretended, they may assure themselves of it, and that it is an extreme Folly to seek to make that our own with the Breach of Faith, of Laws, with Impieties, violating God and Man, which we may come by fairly. But they trod not the Path to <hi>Liberty;</hi> that where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man commands, no Man can be free; the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> too they fancy cannot be had, the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without Order and Subjection, Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be freed from Laws: If they were, there could be no Society, no Civility any where; Men must be shunned as much as Wolves or Bears, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and Blood-shed would over-run the World; the Spoyler must fear the next Comer, like savage Beasts, who hurt others, and know not it is ill to hurt them. Men would devour Men, the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Thief would swallow up the rest; No Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would be Sacred, where every Man has the Power of the Sword; the aged Sire (could there
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:109805:237"/>
be any such) must defend his silver Hairs from the unnatural Violence of his own Sons.</p>
                  <p>He adds, if there can be any just Cause of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet is the Sedition unjust which outlasts it, which continues, when the Cause is yielded to, and taken away; that if his Prerogative has been sometimes grievous, his Taxes heavy, and any of those they call evil Counsellors faulty, they ought to remember, in their first Risings, and all along in all their <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> they swore conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually not to <hi>invade the Monarchy,</hi> nor <hi>touch the Rights of his free Crown.</hi> You ought to remember your own Remonstrances; you once declared, that you acknowlegded the Maxim of the Law, <hi>The King can doe no wrong; if any ill be committed in Matters of State, the Counsellors; if in Matters of Law, the Iudges must answer for it</hi>—My Person was not to be violated. He expects they should deal with him, as the honest Husbandman does in Overflows of Waters, who clears and drains his Ground, repairs the Banks, but does not usurp upon the Stream, does not inhance within the Channel; and farther, that quarrels to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laws are unreasonable from those, who out of Ambition arm to overthrow both; that Reformation is not the Work of Sedition, which ever disorders what is well setled. He conjures them to forsake these Furies, who, says he, abuse their Lightness meerly for their own Ends, whose Companions and Masters they were lately, now are they but their Guards; and that if they refuse a Subjection according to all Laws Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to his Scepter, they must become Slaves and Tributaries to their Iron, to the Flails and Pitch-forks
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:109805:238"/>
of some Mushroom of their own Dirt, and that advancing their Mushroom, thus upon his Power by the Ways of Force, gives an Example to the next Tumults against themselves.</p>
                  <p>There can be no Safety for any new Power raised upon this Force; <note place="margin">Non est diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na possessio in quam gladio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciamur. <hi>Curt.</hi>
                     </note> the Obedience to that upon these Rules being limited, and annexed to the Force, and Success, and to yield and give Way to the next Power visible, which shall overbear it. A way to thrust a Nation into a State of War, continual Perjury and Impiety to the Worlds End. This Realm (as he goes on) is my Inheritance; which I took Possession of after the Death of my Grandfather being a Child, and did I claim only by your Gift (which I shall never grant) yet are not you free, to make a new Choice; you are bound to me by <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts,</hi> and no Right of new Complyance, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission can be left you to transfer. He concludes, That Despair was a dangerous Sin, which would drive them head-long to Destruction; that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Offences had been, they were not above his Mercy.</p>
                  <p>He bids them not trouble themselves for <hi>Tyler,</hi> a base Fellow who thrust them into Dangers, and blew them into a Storm, to raise himself upon the Billows, upon the Ruins of his Country. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to lead them, he will be their Captain if they will follow him, he will please them in all their Desires. This he spake to draw them off farther into <hi>Smithfield,</hi> fearing they would again fall to burning of Houses. They now wanted their Devil, who possessed them, and being in Doubt
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:109805:238"/>
whether they should kill the King, or return Home with his Charters, there being no Incendiary to command, follow the <hi>King</hi> in Suspence; <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Straw</hi> about this time amazed at the Idol's Fall, lose Courage and slip away. In the mean time the stout Mayor spurs to the City with one Servant, where in a few Words he acquaints the Citizens with the Kings Peril and his own, and requests their sudden Assistance, if not for himself, for the King, who (says he) is in Danger now to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Some Loyal Hearts, some good Men of the Kings Party arm, and joyn to the Number of one Thousand, and range themselves in the Street, expecting some of the Cavaliers of the Kings Knights to conduct them, resolved either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or not to fear the Conquerors.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Robert Knowles,</hi> a renowned Commander in the French Wars of the King's Grandfather (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led falsly <hi>Canol</hi> by <hi>Polydore,</hi> and others) undertakes this Charge. Sir <hi>Perducas D'Albret</hi> (called <hi>D'Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth)</hi> a Noble Gascoign and a Commander too in those Wars, <hi>Nicholas Brembre</hi> the Kings Draper, and other Aldermen, come in with their Levies, and march to the King in sight of the Rebels. There the King knights the brave <hi>Wil: Walworth, Iohn Standish,</hi> one of his Esquires, <hi>Nicholas Brembre, Iohn Philpot,</hi> 'a most generous Citizen, (famous for his faithful Service to his Prince in the times suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding) and others. The Nobility about the King desire him to strike off an hundred or two of the Clowns Heads, in Revenge of the Injuries and Infamy they had received from them. Sir <hi>Robert Knowls</hi> would have him fall on, and cut them all to pieces. The King dislikes both these Counsels;
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:109805:239"/>
He says many of these unhappy Men were awed to side, without either Malice to his Person or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that if the first Advice were taken, the most Innocent might be punished, and the Guilty scape: If the Second, the very Rebel and the Counterfeit (the forced one) must be swallowed up together, which was high Injustice. Yet were there many of these Rebels called to an Account, and their Acts of Blood, Rapine and Burning cost them dear; but these Acts of theirs done against Law, were punished Legally, upon the finding of Juries, when the Tumults were composed: Which was fair and handsome, and shew the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Justice of our King. All that was done against them that Night, was, to forbid the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens by Proclamation to entertain any of these Men in the City, or communicate with them; and to command all Men, who had not dwelt there for one Year before, to depart.</p>
                  <p>So far was the young King from approving the Cruelty of the late Counsels, that in the next Place, he causes the Charters, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them, to be delivered: Yet some may suppose this but a Pardon of Shew, and the Pardon-piece of the Charters, as well as the other part, rather a Piece of Policy than any thing else; the Countrys being yet Tumultuons, the Clowns were upon their good Behaviour, that was a Condition of their Pardon, which they would not observe; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit new Outrages, break the Kings Laws, and pluck down the Vengeance of Justice upon their Heads afresh, they did not give over their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs after their Return, says <hi>Wals.</hi> By the King and his Counsel, the Charters at extorted
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:109805:239"/>
out of Force, and Necessity were recalled; and though the Meynie generally were pardoned, the King (again provoked) staid but for a fit time to take Vengeance on the Ring-leaders, and punish particular Offenders who could not be forgiven: It being necessary in so desperate a Revolt, for the Terror of others, to make Examples of some such malicious Disturbers of the Peace, as would never have been reclaimed. The King's Charters contained a Manumission of the Villains, and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Memory of what was past for the rest. The Tenor, says <hi>Walsingham,</hi> of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>extorted from the King by Force,</hi> was this, (he gives us only that of <hi>Hartfordshire</hi> the Province of his Monastery.)</p>

                  <p>This Charter was granted about the time the <hi>Clowns</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> disbanded, and received theirs, it was brought into <hi>Harfordshire</hi> to Saint <hi>Albans</hi> by <hi>Wallingford</hi> one of the Town. <note n="*" place="margin">Illucescente die Veneris.</note> Friday says <hi>Walsingham</hi> the day of Tribulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which was the 16th. of <hi>Iune)</hi> the Townsmen of Saint <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> being at the time of Mattins acquainted by those of <hi>Barnet</hi> with the Command of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or Act, for repairing to <hi>London</hi> presently with the Esquires of the Abbot, set forth; So that I conceive the Day of this Charter is mistaken in it by the Monk.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Clowns</hi> throw down their Arms at the <hi>Kings</hi> Feet, sue for Mercy, and deliver up their Chiefs; the Principal of which, Priest <hi>Straw</hi> was after drawn from his hiding Holes, and laid hold of by the Kings Officers.

                  <p>The Commons of <hi>Kent</hi> now scatter and dissolve, the Heads of the Arch-bishop, Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> and the rest, are taken down from the Bridge, and the Idols advanced there.

The Example and Success of the Idol had moved with many, but his Invitation, and Sollicitation by the Emissaries of this Confederacy and Spirit more. The Sectaries, or Ring-leaders of the hurden rustick Raggamuffins in the several Provinces of the Association (while <hi>Tyler</hi> was thus busied in the chief Seat of his new Dominions) promote the Cause, and pursue the Instructions of the Prince of Devils; they were all to trèad his Steps, as we shall find in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

First, as if the English Church had been lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, the Monasteries founded, their Royalties, Liberties, Priviledges granted by the <hi>Norman</hi> Princes, than which nothing could be more false. The most Christian Saxon Kings of Blessed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, twelve of which dyed Martyrs of the Faith, ten shine Glorious Stars in the Calender of Saints, were all nursing Fathers of the Church; scarcely was there one in the Illustrious Roll, who gave not Lands and Possessions with Exemptions, and Immunities to the Church; who erected not Bishop-ricks, or Monasterys, into which Thirty of our Crowned Heads, <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Queens</hi> entred; the Superstition of the Ages then ought not to blemish their Piety.

                  <p>The gracious <hi>Captain General</hi> was yet more kind; he vows, if it be convenient, to assist them in his own Person.

                  <p>That they may seem pious in their Entrance, they free the publick Malefactors out of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots Prison; but so that they should owe Faith hereafter, and Grace of the Benefit to the <hi>Commons</hi> (a Name the most Honourable, and which must swallow up all things else) and inseparably stick to them.

                  <p>From the Idols first Entrance no Act of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or Grant was done (could any such Act be done and valid) to establish or make a Right, by the Power which had that Right to bestow; he asked for a Commission of Life and Death, but was refused, and his Arbitrary Acts were only a Continuance of his Intrusion, and of the Violence upon which he began.</p>

In all these Conspiracies the Church was the main Mark aimed at, about the Carcases of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals and Abbys (they were now nothing else) did these Vultures gather. In the same Conjuncture of times enters <hi>Richard Wallingford,</hi> Head-borough or Constable of the place, who tarried at <hi>London</hi> for the Kings Letter of Manumission and Pardon, (which <hi>Greyndcob</hi> had been so earnest for) bearing the Kings Banner or Pennon of the Arms of St. <hi>George,</hi> being the red Cross before him, according to the Fashion of the <hi>Clowns</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Commons</hi> hearing of his coming, pour themselves out in Heaps to meet him. He alights, strikes the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non into the Earth, and bids them keep close and encircle it like a Standard. He intreats them to continue about it, and expect his Return, and the Lieutenants, who were resolved with all Speed to treat with the Abbot, and would suddenly bring them an Answer to their Propositions. Which said, he and they enter the Church, and send for
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:109805:245"/>
the Abbot to appear before them, and answer the <hi>Commons</hi> (only Sacred then, and to whom all Knees were to bow.) The Abbot was at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute to dye for the Liberty of his Church; (a pious Gallantry which will be admirable) but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with the Prayers of his Monks; who told him, as things stood, his Death could advantage nothing; that these stinking Knaves, these Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds were determined to murder the Monks, and burn the Monastery, if they had the Repulse; and that there was no Way of Safety but to fall down before these <hi>Baals,</hi> he yields.

Here certainly again is a Mistake of the Day, for till Friday the 16th. of <hi>Iune,</hi> the <hi>Clowns</hi> of Saint <hi>Albans</hi> (as is observed) stirred not. Thus is the King forced to be the Author of other Mens Injustice, to consent to those Insolences (and Wrongs) which must undoe all those who are Faithful to him, to please a base Rabble, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to turn in the end their destroying Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself and his Royal Family; the Abbot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Letter with due Reverence, and reads it: Then thinking to work upon the Consciences of these Hell-hounds, he begins a Discourse of Law, Reason, Equity, and Justice; Law and Reason were the Princely Bounds betwixt which the <hi>Kings</hi> Commands ran. He tells them, whatsoever was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by them, had been long agoe determined in the Courts of Justice, by the publick Judges, Persons knowing and honourable, sworn to do equal Right.</p>
                  <p>That the Records were kept amongst the <hi>Kings</hi> Rolls at <hi>Westminster,</hi> whence he inferred, That according to the Laws anciently in Use, they had neither Right nor Claim left: He adds, the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation upon anothers Propriety is Tyranny in the Abstract; it is the greatest Injustice: The very <hi>Heathens</hi> will have it unnatural to enrich our selves to make our Advantage from Spoil and Robbery, but Force is odious to God and Man, that aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the Sin; Violence is a more heinous Crime than Theft. This was ridiculous Wisdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering who they were the good Abbot spake to; he had forgot perhaps how <hi>Antigonus</hi> armed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and seize the Cities, and Countries of other
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:109805:246"/>
Princes, laughed at the serious grave Folly of one who presented him with a Tractate of Justice. <hi>Wallingford</hi> with his Hand upon his Sword takes him off pertinently, as reflecting upon the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Men, whose Treasons prosper, and Practise of the times; in which now Men did not advance themselves by Vertue, by Learning, by Justice, or Valour, but by Murder and Robbery.</p>
                  <p>My Lord (says he) every Story is not true, because it is eloquently told; you endeavour here to inveigle and deceive us in a long Discourse of Equity, of Law, and Justice; we come not hither for Words but Things; we pretend not to refute your Reasons, (which are but unjust Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your Oppression), but cunning Subtilties, but Colours to paint o'er the Wrongs you do us, nor can we; the Rudeness of our Education must disable us for this part, we have been born and bred under your Dominion, Slaves, and Villains to you under a Dominion so unmanly cruel; you have always kept us deprived, not only of all Means of Learning or Knowledge, but would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have taken away our very Reason and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Understanding, that we might groan under our Miseries with the feeling of Beasts, but be Masters neither of Sense nor Language for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
                  <p>It is time now that we of the <hi>Commonalty,</hi> as you call and range us, should take our Turn of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, however of <hi>Liberty.</hi> Nor is this to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, at if you consider our Strength, and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the new <hi>Model;</hi> the Eminency of the Commons is visible to every Eye, theirs is the present, theirs is the <hi>Supreme Power.</hi> We are armed,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:109805:246"/>
and we will not think of the Laws, nor regard them, they only submit to Laws who want Power to help themselves. Besides these Laws you tell us of, are but the Will of our Enemies in Form and Rule, they were made by them, they favour them; and our Captain General <hi>Tyler,</hi> who has conquered (a sad unhappy Word, where it is used of one part of a <note place="margin">Per<expan>

                  <p>The Abbot, entring into a new Speech, is again stopped and told, the Thousand before the Doors of his Monastery sent for him not to parly, but consent, which they look he should be sudden in; if not, we (says <hi>Wallingford)</hi> the Lieutenants, chosen by the <hi>Captain Representatives of the People, will deliver up and resign the Powers to him, which we received of him.</hi> We have <hi>voted,</hi> if you comply not, to send for the Captain General <hi>Tyler,</hi> and Twenty thousand of his <hi>Militia,</hi> to the Danger of this Place, and of the Monks Heads.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot here recites his good Deeds, how
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:109805:247"/>
often in their Necessities he had relieved them, he had been (he says) their spiritual Father thirty two Years; in all which time, no Man had been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or oppressed by him: this giving implyedly the Lye to <hi>Wallingford,</hi> they grant but will not be denyed. The Obligations and Charters which they require, are delivered them, which they burn in the Market-place, near the Cross. This did not content them, they ask for an ancient Charter concerning the Town Liberties, the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Letters of which (say they) were one of Gold, another of <note n="*" place="margin">De azorio.</note> Azure: The Abbot prays them to be satisfied for that time, he protests, they have all he has to give them, he knew of no more, yet he would make a search, and if any such Deed could be found, it should faithfully be delivered to them. This too was the answer of the <hi>Covent,</hi> it was agreed that the Abbot should after Dinner disclaim under his Hand and Seal in all Things prejudicial to their Liberty. In Memory of an old Suit betwixt Abbot <hi>Richard</hi> the First, and the Townsmen in the Reigns of <hi>William</hi> the Second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the First, wherein the Townsmen were overthrown, were laid Milstones before the Door of the Parlor.

                  <p>After Dinner, a sad Dinner to the Monks, this Merdaille, these Stinkards, throng before the Gates, and demand the Charter of Liberties, which the Abbot had promised them to seal, which was sent, and read to them in the thickest of the Rout: If they please to accept it, (this was the Abbots Complement) he is ready to seal. They (resolved never to be pleased) with much Scorn and Pride answer by an Esquire of the Abbot, That the Abbot must appoint some Clerk of his to attend them with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Charter did certainly (as they will have it) contain all their ancient <hi>Liberties</hi> and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and if this was true, there was no great Reason it should be in the Abbots keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Here the Abbot imploys the most Honourable Esquires of the Country, as Mediators to soften them, and offers (if they desire it) to say Mass before them next Morning, and to swear upon the Sacrament he <note place="margin">Super Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> should be about to take, with what Monks they would name, that he kept from them no such Charter with his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Make Choice (says he) of what <hi>Liberties</hi> you can, you shall have my Charters drawn, they shall be granted you by it; I will seal you a real Charter instead of a fantastical one, never seen by you, no where to be had. The Abbot struggles in vain against these Waves, this Charter of their Fancies they will have: Nor shall any other Price redeem the Monastery, they intended the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the House, and wrangle thus crossly, that they might seem to have some Pretences to do it; but because they had much Business to go about, and could not be here and there too, a Truce was taken for that Day, and many of these <hi>pure Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> betake themselves to other parts; some of them would not be prevailed with, the Bread and Ale of the Monastery brought forth to them in huge Fats, would not work upon them to lay their Fury, they staid only for a leading Hand.

The rest of the Day is spent by their united Forces, in overthrowing of Houses, clashing of Vessels, and spoiling of Goods accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule of <hi>Walter</hi> the false Founder of the Order.

They proclaimed also, that whosoever could challenge any Debts due to him from the Monastery, might put in his Claim (and little Proof should be needed) the next Day, and the Burgesses of the Town, would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge as far as the Goods of the Monastery would reach.

                  <p>Saturday Night passed with much Perplexity to the Monks, who were at their Wits Ends, and Lives too (they could not hope better things) about the Charter, which was no where extant but in the Noddles of these Cluster-fists. But Day and Comfort broke out together upon them; sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly this Overflow of Pride, and Arrogancy aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their Loftiness fell, and their Bristles were somewhat laid, very unpleasing Rumours concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Army were spread, and the Death of the Idol <hi>Tyrant Wat,</hi> of stinking Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, was certainly known and <note place="margin">Wals. foedae me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriae.</note> divulged; and what was as stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> grown wise, and resolute, either out of Loyalty (or which is the rather to be supposed, Experience of their new Master) began now to own their Prince, their natural Lord unanimously, and to side with him against all Seditious Opposers of his Majesty, and the <hi>just Rights and Liberties</hi> of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they saw like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish <note place="margin">Walsingh.</note> together. Farther a Knight of the Court, seconds the Report, and by Proclamation in the Kings Name (now legal again) commands this Herd to keep the Kings Peace under forfeiture of Life, and Members from that Hour.</p>
                  <p>The King now grown a <hi>Protector</hi> again of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:109805:249"/>
sends his Letters Protectory to the Abbot in these Words.</p>
                  <p>RIchard, <hi>&amp;c. To all our Lieges, and Commons of</hi> Hartford, <hi>&amp;c. We pray, charge, command, straightly as we may, &amp;c. by the Faith and Liegances which to us ye owe, that to our Beloved in God, the Abbot of St.</hi> Albans, <hi>nor to our House and Monastery of the said Place, of our Patronage, nor to none of the People, Monks, nor others, nor to none of the Goods of the said Monastery, &amp;c. Ye suffer to be done, as much as in you lies, any Grievance, Dammage, &amp;c. Given under our Great Seal at our City of</hi> London, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though now these Carles were well cooled, yet e'er the Zeal was quite slackened, and the Clouds dispelled, which hovered weakly, and were likely to scatter with the next Breath of Wind, they conclude to perfect their Building, which to the great Nuisance of this Monastery they had raised. Besides, the Lieutenants, or Major Generals of <hi>Tyler,</hi> thought it a much unworthiness to droop too soon, before those whom they had sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned in to piece up their deformed Insurrection with so much Bravery, and Insolence. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and pursue their Requests to the Abbot, but with less Noise than formerly; the Abbot was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by Letters from Sir <hi>Hugh Segrave,</hi> Lord Steward of the Houshold, and Sir <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> created after Earl of <hi>Worcester,</hi> to grant all things,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:109805:250"/>
assuring him these Grants being thus forced from him would be void in Law, and could not hurt his Monastery. The Abbots Chamber, the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, all Places are full of them, they give Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Abbot's Clerk for their Charter of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, which now they were contented to accept, but will have a Bond of One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds Sterling for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering <note place="margin">Wals. Sterlingo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> up the Charter unknown, before the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin next, if it can be found; if not, that the Abbot with his twelfth Hand, (an ancient Saxon manner of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or clearing the Offender, where the Offence was secret) with twelve of his chief Monks should swear, that he neither has nor detains any such Charter with his Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot agrees, he and the Covent Seal; but oh! the Miracle (not to be believed, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without another upon our Faith, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) the seal, in which the Glorious <hi>Protomartyr</hi> was figured, <note place="margin">Wals.</note> three times together could not be pulled from the Wax, no sleight, no Strength could doe it; to pass by the pious Frauds, and Dreams of Monks. From thence the Black-bands depart to the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, there at the Cross they publish their new Acquisitions, the Charters of the King, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, with the Kings Protection of the Monastery, which was but a Counterfeit of their Love. On Munday and Tuesday following, the Villains of the Patrimony of our <hi>Protomartyr</hi> (as the others did in all places else imbroiled) exact of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot Deeds of Manumission and <hi>Liberty,</hi> according to the Effect of the Royal Charter before, which
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:109805:250"/>
Charter the Abbot recites, and confirms.</p>
                  <p>From Villains these now conceive themselves Gentlemen of Welsh Pedegree, descended of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay, as our Monk, noble beyond the Line and Race of Kings; they are meer Free-holders, hold only of God and the Son, rather of the Sun, and Club, and will neither perform their Customs, and Services, nor pay Rent. The common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are neither swayed by Religion or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, stop and check themselves, not that they were contented, <note place="margin">Wals.</note> but because they could not, nay they durst not go on to more.</p>
                  <p>The Plague of this Distemper was not only epidemical, but kept its Days; on the fatal Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, fifty thousand Clowns, out of <hi>Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> (places miserably harrassed according to the former Presidents) were incorporated by the jugling Tricks of the Essexian Impostors, sent out by the Fathers of Disobedience, in the first Conception of the Ruffle, to inveigle Proselites to the <hi>Holy League.</hi> This was but an indigested Mass, without Shape or Form, <hi>Wraw</hi> not <hi>Straw</hi> (as sometimes he is called) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He with <hi>Robert Westbrome</hi> King of this Congregation, lead the tatter'd Reformers from <hi>Mildenhall</hi> to St. <hi>Edmunds-bury,</hi> where then stood a most Glorious Monastery, and where their Fellow Scoundrels

expected them. <hi>Wraw</hi> finds these Choperloches good Disciples, willing to learn, and quick of Apprehension, so capable they understood his least Signs. The same Frenzies are again acted by other Lunaticks, the Lawyers or Apprentices of the Law (as the Monk) and their Houses are the first Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their spight, they do not only cut off them, but fire their Nests. Sir <hi>Iohn Cavendish</hi> Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, who had been one of the most able Serjeants of this Kings Grand-fathers Reign, and was made Chief Justice by him, they intercept, and behead. <hi>Orpheus Tracie, Nero</hi> the <hi>Roman, Belgabred</hi> the <hi>Brittain,</hi> excellent in the Sweetness of a Voice and Skill of Song, with <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Prior of Saint <hi>Edmunds,</hi> lose their Lives in the same manner, as they unluckily fell into their Hands.</p>
                  <p>The Cause of the Priors Death is made this: He was discreet and managed the Affairs of his Monastery faithfully, and diligently; he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken near <hi>Mildenhall,</hi> a Town then belonging to Saint <hi>Edmund</hi> of the Demain of the Abby, the Vassals, Hinds, Villains, and Bond-men of the House, sentenced him, murthered him by Vote; His Body lay five Days Naked in the Field unburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In Saint <hi>Edmunds-bury,</hi> these Cut-throats compass the Priors Head round as in a Procession, after they carry it upon a Lance to the Pillory, where that and the Chief Justices Head are advanced. The next Work was the levelling a new House of the Priors. After they enter the Monastery, which they threaten to fire, unless <hi>Iohn Lakinhethe</hi> Guardian of the Temporalities of the Barony in the Vacancy then were delivered to them, which
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:109805:251"/>
the Towns-men mingled in the Throng, put them upon: The Guardian stood amidst the Crowd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. This Man out of Piety to preserve the Monastery (it was Piety then, though it may be thought Impiety now) discovers himself, he tells them he is the Man they seek, and asks what it is the <hi>Commons</hi> would have with him. They call him Traitor (it was Capital to be called so, not to be so) drag him to the Market-place, and cut off his Head, which is set upon the Pillory to keep Company with the Priors and Chief Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                     <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Todington</hi> a Monk was sought for, they wanted his Head, but he hid himself, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. Our Hacksters Errant, of the Round Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Knights of Industry, would be thought Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Redeemers, to take Care of all men in Distress; for the Burgesses Sake, they command the Monks, (threatning them and their Walls, if they obey not) to deliver up the Obligations of the Townsmen for their good Behaviour, all the ancient Charters from the time of King <hi>Knute</hi> the Founder any way concerning the Liberties of the Town; besides they must grant and confirm by Charter the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the Town, which could not be done in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy (for so it was) <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Brumfield</hi> Abbot in Name, by Provision of the <hi>Pope</hi> was a Prisoner at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> nor had any Election been since the Death of Abbot <hi>Iohn Brivole,</hi> and therefore the Jewels of the House are pawned to the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as a Gage that <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Brumfield</hi> (whom they would suppose Abbot, and whom they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to set free) should seal; which Jewels were a Cross and Chalice of Gold, with other things,

exceeding in value One thousand Pounds, these were restored again in time of Peace, but with much Unwillingness. Upon the Bruit of the Idols Mishap, and the Suppression of his Legions at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> these Caterpillers dissolve of themselves. <hi>Wraw</hi> the Priest, <hi>Westbrome,</hi> and the rest of the Capital Villains in the General Audit, or Doomes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day for these Hurliburlies, shall be called to a Reckoning for their Outrages. <hi>Cambridge</hi> suffered not a little in these Uproars, the Towns-men with the Country Peasants about confederated together, break up the Treasury of the University, tear and burns its Charters; they compel the Chancellor and Scholars under their common Seals, to release to the Mayor and Townsmen all Rights and Liberties, all Actions, and to be bound in 3000l, not to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the Burgesses by Suits of Law concerning these things for the time to come. The Mayor and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs were fetched up by Writ to the next Parliament, where the Deeds were delivered up and cancelled, the Liberties of the Town seized into the Kings Hand as forfeited; new ones granted by him to the University, all which they owe yet to the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this King, and his Parliament, a Court which the Idol never names: Had he set up one of his own begetting, it must have had nothing else but the Name, it would have been as destroying as the Field.</p>

Men. This Upstart Kingling would not wholly move by Example, he makes Presidents of his own, and tramples not like a dull Beast the Road beaten by others. He had heard what was done by the <hi>London</hi> Congregations; he had a Stock of Traditions from the Elders there, which he was able to improve: and although I know not how he could exceed the Idol with his Council, yet (so the Monk) exceed them he did, he presumed greater things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyler</hi> lost his Life before things were ripe, was watched and undermined by the King and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he could not spread his full Sails, else for his Presumption he far out-goes <hi>Litster.

The <hi>Malignants</hi> of the Kings Party (the rich and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable go under that Notion) are made a Prey, no place was safe, or priviledged. Plots were laid to get the Lord <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Ufford</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> at his Mannor of <hi>Ufford</hi> near <hi>Debenham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> into the Company, out of Policy; that if the Cause succeeded not, then the Rebels might cover themselves under the Shadow of that Peer.

over with them, which they durst not deny: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those enthralled by this Compulsion were the Lords <hi>Scales,</hi> and <hi>Morley,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Brews,</hi> Sir <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Salle,</hi> which last was no Gentleman born, but as full of Honour and Loyalty as any Man, Knighted by the <hi>Kings</hi> Grand-father for his Valour; he was (says <hi>Froissart)</hi> one of the biggest Knights in <hi>England,</hi> a Man not supple enough, who could not bend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the new Lords; he had not the Solidity of Judgment (as some more subtle than honest call it) to accomodate himself to the times. Like <hi>Messala</hi> he would be of the justest side, let the Fortune be what it would; he would not forsake Justice under Colour of following Prudence; he thought it not in vain to prop up the falling Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: perhaps his Judgment may be blamed he stayed not for a sit time, had he not failed here, he had not fought against Heaven, against Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whose Councils and Decrees are hid from us, are in the Clouds, not to be pierced; our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is as weak as foolish, as Providence is certain and wise. Our Hopes and Fears deceive us alike, we cannot resolve our selves upon any Assurance, to forsake our Duty for the time to come, Gods Designs are known only to himself; it is Despair, not Piety (Despair too far from that) to leave our Country in her dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, in her publick Calamities; the Insolency of injust Men is a Prodigy of their Ruin, and the Incertainty of things Humane may teach us, That those we esteem most <hi>established,</hi> most assured, are not seldom soonest overthrown. <hi>Plato</hi> would not have them refer all things to Fate, there is
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:109805:253"/>
somewhat in our selves (says he) not a little in Fortune. Ours are but Cockfights, the least Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of Force and Life may strike a necking Blow, and by an unlooked for Victory raise what is fallen; if Death cannot be kept off, if our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try cannot he saved by our Attempts, there is a Comliness in dying handsomly, nor can any Man be unhappy but he who out-lives it. We have heard of Women who cast themselves into the fiery Pits, where their dead Husbands are consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; of Vassals who stab themselves to follow their Prince into the next World; of <hi>Otho</hi>'s Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians, of the Saguntines burning in their Cities Flames. What can be so honourable as to dye for or with our Country or Faith, our Religion or Honesty, to dye with that which gave us Life, and Liberty, and Sense of these?</p>

                     <hi>Litsters</hi> Hog-herds vow to burn <hi>Norwich,</hi> unless this Knight will come out to them, which he does well mounted, and forsakes his Horse to please them. They seem to honour him highly, and offer him a fair Canton of the new <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> if he will command their Forces.</p>
                  <p>The faithful <hi>Cavalier</hi> abhorred the proposition, and could not dissemble his Dislike: He tells them, he will not to his eternal dishonour renounce his Soveraign, whom all good Men obeyed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with the veryest perfidious Traitors living, in their Villanies. He attempts to horse himself again, but fails; it was Treason to speak against the Government.</p>

Then do the Infernal Curs rush in with full Mouths and mangles him to bits, who (says <hi>Walsingham)</hi> would have driven a Thousand of them before him, had he had fair Play.

Sir <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> a Knight of Honour carves before him and tasts his Meats, and Drinks; the rest of the miserable Courtiers are imployed in their several Offices. But when the Fame of the Kings good Fortune began to go strong, and of his Preparations to assert his Right and Authority, <hi>Litster</hi> sends on Embassy (from <hi>North-Walsham,</hi> the Throne of his Tyranny) to <hi>London,</hi> the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Brews,</hi> with three of the <hi>confiding Commons,</hi> to obtain Charters of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and Pardon, with great Summs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (squeezed out of the Citizens of <hi>Norwich,</hi> under Pretence of preserving the City from Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Fire and Spoil, or as others raised by an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Tribute to <hi>Litster.)</hi> Which Monyes were sent for Presents to the King, to win him to grant them Charters more ample and beneficial, than had been given to any others.</p>
                  <p>These Messengers are met at <hi>Ichlingham</hi> near <hi>New-Market</hi> by <hi>Henry le Spencer</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> of a noble Family, stout and well-armed;
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:109805:255"/>
He had been at his Mannor of <hi>Burleigh</hi> near <hi>Oke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and there heard of the Tumults in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and was now hasting thither to see how things were carryed, with eight Lances only in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and a few Archers. He charged the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> upon their Allegiance to tell him, whether any of the <hi>Commons</hi> (the Kings <hi>Traitors)</hi> were with them. They look upon the Bishop as a young rash Man, and the Awe of their Masters was so prevalent, he could hardly wrest the Secret from them. After many Words they discover it; and the Bishop causes the Heads of the Clowns to be struck off, and fixed on a publick place at <hi>New-Market</hi> Then taking with him that Lord and Knight, he posts for <hi>North-walsham.</hi> The Gentry hearing of the Bishops Arrival in his Coat of Male, with his Helmet upon his Head, his Sword by his side, and his Lance upon his Thigh croud in to him; the Bishop quickly found himself in a Gallant Equipage, and as quickly reaches <hi>North-walsham,</hi> the sink of the Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Litster</hi> was intrenched, he had fortified his Ditch with Pales, Stakes, and Doors, and shut himself in behind with his Carts, and Carriages. The Heroick Bishop, like another <hi>Maccabeus,</hi> charges bravely through the Ditch, into the midst of the Rebels (when all the Barons of <hi>England</hi> hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,) so suddenly, that the Archers could not let an Arrow fly at him, and came to handy Blows. As the <hi>French</hi> Historian <hi>de Serres</hi> observes; in Affairs of the World <note place="margin">Raro simul bonam fortuuam cum bona mente. <hi>Liv.</hi>
                     </note> oftentimes he that is most strong carrys it; a good Fortune, and a good Mind seldom go together.</p>

                     <hi>Otho</hi> tells his Souldiers, often times where the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of things are good, yet if Judgment be wanting (I may put in) where the Counsels are unsound, the Agents faithless, where Money, Arms, and Men are wanting, the Issue must be pernicious. The Goods and Honours of this World which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Triumphers Chariots are common to the good and bad; Grace, Charity and Love, are the Marks of a pious Man, not Success, to brag of which becomes rather a <hi>Spartacus</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> (who carry Faith and Law upon the Swords point) than a Christian: The God of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is not the God of Robbery, and Blood. But things here fell out as could be wished, the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the side prevailed, and the righteous weak side overcame the strong unjust. <hi>Litster</hi> touched with the Conscience of his Mischiefs, struggles to the utmost to avert his Danger, at length gives Ground, and attempts to shift for himself by leaping over his Carriages in the Rere. The Bishop pressed forward so fiercely, that this Course proved in vain; most of the unhappy Clowns are laid along upon the place. <hi>Litster</hi> and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Conspiracy are taken and condemned to be drawn, hanged and beheaded, which was done. Others of the chief Conspirators disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over the Country, are searched out and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                  <p>The Monk here tells us, It <note place="margin">Nisi enim daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis pleni fuissent, nequaquam in destruct. sacr. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Chr. fidei &amp; regni extermini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um conspirass.</note> was apparent by the Works of these Demoniacks, by their Fruits, that they had conspired (he speaks of the whole) not only the Destruction of the Church and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:109805:256"/>

                  <p>Our Monk attributes these Calamities to the remisness of the Bishops, to the Conceits and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of Presbyter <hi>Wycliff,</hi> which if they be truly registred by the Monks, his mortal Enemies, were pestilential and damnable. Indeed Presbyter <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi> was then living, but is not named in these Commotions, as one busie in them, by the Monk, (though busie he might be, we shall find Sir <hi>Iohn Old-Castle,</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and others of <hi>Wycliffs Disciples,</hi> Rebels, and Traitors too too busie in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifths Beginning) <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>Straw,</hi> and <hi>Wraw</hi> were Priests of the Idol, and his Lieutenants, and might serve the turn to imbroil without fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Aid in: He attributes too these Mischiefs to the licentious Invectives of the Clowns against their Lords, generally to the Sins of the Nation, inclusively taking in the Orders of Mendicants, or Begging Fryers, (like factious Lecturers) w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>We will now return to see what the King does next, who was not asleep this while. After he had cleared the City (lately <hi>Tylers</hi> good Town) of the Kentish Fry; he commands the Nobility and Gentry (who durst now peep abroad) all the Kingdom over to repair to him at <hi>London</hi> well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and well horsed, as they loved him, and his Royal Honour. Their own Danger, and late Fears, add Wings to their Haste. Within a few Days, forty thousand Horse meet at a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz upon <hi>Blackheath,</hi> whither the young King who had taken his Sequestration off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored himself to his Blood and Majesty, rides daily upon a Royal Courser, to view their Order, with his Imperial Banner born before him. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to be seen and acknowledged for what he was amongst his own Homagers. Here he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the Kentishmen (a stirring People, but with what generous Resolution will soon be found) are again in Mutiny, (a Mutiny however else contemptible) not to be sleighted at that time. The King commands his Cavalry (on Fire, as much as himself) to march, and root out this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Race of Miscreants. Here the Nobility and Gentry of the County interpose, and become Pledges for the Commons, which appeases the King; who now disbands his Army, and resolves to take no other Course of Justice, but such as was ordinary and usual, by Judgments upon the known Laws of the Land, and by Juries of twelve Men; the Ancient Birth-right of the Englishmen. Laws which could not have fitted <hi>Tylers</hi> Courts, nor Tryals, but which have been ever the Rule in all
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:109805:257"/>
just and legal Tryals, in all calm and pious Ages. The Law Martial being proper to an Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be exercised in it.

                  <p>Upon this fair, and Kingly Conclusion of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> Commissions were given, and Justices of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> to hear and determine the Treasons and Fellonies committed in the late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections; and principally to enquire, who were the chief Authors, Fomenters, and Incendiaries of the Broils, are sent into <hi>Kent, Essex,</hi> and the rest of the Provinces in Rebellion.</p>

                  <p>Their Oath to preserve him could not last lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than their Conveniency and Opinions, which had then changed.

They had often sworn and covenanted, that <hi>they neither meant nor had Power to hurt the Kings Prerogative; that they intended to maintain the Kings Authority in his Royal Dignity, the free Course of Iustice, and the Laws of the Land;</hi> with infinite Expressions and Protestations of this kind.

This <hi>Proclamation</hi> put Life into the Royalists, into all honest Hearts, and dismays as much the Rebels; yet after this the <hi>Essex</hi> Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, gather again at <hi>Byllericay</hi> near <hi>Hatfield</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verel, and send to the King, now at <hi>Waltham,</hi> to know whether he intends to make good his Grants of Liberties, and require to be made equal with their Lords, without being bound to any Suits of Court, View of <hi>Frank-pledge</hi> only excepted twice the Year.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> and his Council are startled at this Impudence. The <hi>King</hi> answers the Agents, <hi>That if he did not look upon them as Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he would hang them up: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>

From thence they get to <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> making every where such <hi>Proclamations</hi> as of old they had used; where the Lord <hi>Fitzwalter</hi> (whose Seat was at <hi>Woodham-Walters</hi> in <hi>Essex)</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Harlestone</hi> rush suddenly upon them, kill and take them: the <hi>King</hi> meaning to visit <hi>Essex</hi> in his own Person, comes to <hi>Havering</hi> at the Boure, a Mannor of his own Demain, of the Sacred Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and from thence to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> where he appoints Sir <hi>Robert Tresilian,</hi> Chief Justice of his Bench of <hi>Pleas</hi> of the Crown, to sit and inquire of the Malefactors, and Troublers of the Country, and to punish the Offendors according to the Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms of the Realm, known, and visible.</p>

by the chief Justices to carry themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, and justly in their Verdicts, neither swayed by Love, or Hatred, to favour, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute any Man: Many upon the Evidence given in, and the finding of the Jury, were condemned to be drawn and hanged; nineteen of them were trussed upon one Gallows. Heading had formerly been the Execution of others in <hi>Essex, Kent,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> because of the Numbers of the Guilty, which was now thought a Death short of the Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the most foul and heinous Offenders; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the Custom of the Realm, it was decreed (says the Monk) that the Captains should be hanged.</p>
                  <p>The like was done in other Countrys by the Justices in Commission, where the <hi>King</hi> was in Person.

                  <p>The Close commands <hi>to bring in to the King and his Council all Charters of Manumission and Pardon, to be cancelled upon their Faith and Allegiance, and under Forfeiture of all things forfeitable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Witness our self at</hi> Chelmsford <hi>the 2. of</hi> July, <hi>and 5th.

                  <p>In the Case of a Subject (and no reason Kings shall be more bound) every Act extorted by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Awe upon the Agent, is void. In the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, two Thieves (which was the Case here) force a Traveller to swear that he will at a day appointed bring them a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pound; and threaten to kill him if he refuse their Oath; he swears and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms what he had sworn: By Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <note place="margin">44 E. 3. 14.</note> of all the Justices these two were indicted of Robbery, and the Court maintains that the Party was not bound by this Oath. Yet if this be denyed as unsafe, Violence, or Force, which strikes a just Fear into any Man, makes any Contract void, say the Casuists.</p>
                  <p>Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> that most learned Prelate, answers to the <note place="margin">Resp. ad Apo'og.</note> pretended Resignation of King <hi>Iohn</hi> urged by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that what this King did, (if any such Act was done) was done by Force, and out of Fear.</p>

King, the Royal Family, the Bishops of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Catholick Church, the Nobility and Gentry, as their Letter speaks, with one Blow, says of this Resignation, or Donation, if we may (so he) call it so, that it was not freely given. The Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits Challenge the perpetual Dictature, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the University of <hi>Pontamousson</hi> by Bull of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, contrary to the Statutes of the Foundation by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth. Were the Bull true (says <hi>Berclay)</hi> yet it ought not to be of Force, because it was obtain'd presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Creation, when things are presumed to be rather extorted than obtained. <hi>Bodin</hi> denys that a <hi>King</hi> deceived or forced can be bound by his Grants. The Justice of Contracts is that alone which binds. The Distinction of Royal and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Acts is of more Sound than Strength, and answers not the Injustice of the impulsive Violence, which must be naturally vicious every where, and corrupt and weaken the Effects, and cannot be good and bad by Changes, or as to this, or that. <hi>Grotius,</hi> who loves this Distinction, in another place is positive, There must be Equality in all Contracts. He condemns all Fear, or Awe upon the Person purposely moved for the Contracts Sake, and tells us out of <hi>Xenophon</hi> of those of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> who annulled a Sale of Lands, which the <hi>Elians</hi> had forced the Owners to pass out of Fear.</p>
                  <p>A Charter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third imprisoned and forced, is said by <hi>Aldenham</hi> to be void upon this Reason, and I judge the Justice of this Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> by which, as our
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:109805:264"/>
old Parliaments, such Force is Treason. The Fruits of which <note place="margin">Exil. Hugh. de le Spencer pat. &amp; fil.</note> were here more justly plucked up than they were planted. He who gives up his Money to Thieves, according to his Oath, may lawfully take it away from them: However they are bound to make Restitution. Nor can any Prescription of time establish a Right of Possession in him, who makes his Seizure upon no other Title <note place="margin">Rei furtiva aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na authoritas esto.</note> but Plunder and Robbery. The 5th. of this King, the Parliament declares these Grants to be forced and void. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to clear the Honour of King <hi>Richard,</hi> as to this part.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Chelmsford</hi> the King is informed of the whole History of Mischiefs done at St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Person with all his Guards and Cavalry to ride thither, and sentence the Malefactors with his own Mouth; but Sir <hi>Walter Ley</hi> of <hi>Hartford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> fearing the much impoverishing the Country, if the <hi>King</hi> should make any long Stay there, with such Numbers as then attended him, beseeches him to make a Tryal, whether things might not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed without him, and offers to reconcile the <hi>Abbot</hi> and Townsmen, if the <hi>King</hi> would; which was consented to: The <hi>King</hi> grants him a <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and joyns with him <hi>Edward Benstude, Geofry Stukely,</hi> and others of the Gentry of that County.</p>
                  <p>The coming of these <hi>Commissioners</hi> was noised at St. <hi>Albans:</hi> The fiercest of the Clowns know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they had done was condemned by the Law, and not to be defended, but by Force,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:109805:264"/>
which now they had not, began to shake and take Fright, are plotting to get out of the Way. <hi>Greyndcob,</hi> Lieutenant of the late Idol, comforts them, he perswades to go to Horse; let us meet the Knight (says he) and see whether his Looks promise Peace or not; if not, the Towns about us have engaged, they have associated, and are of our <hi>League;</hi> we are rich, and cannot want good Fellows, who will assist us while our Monys last. On St. <hi>Peters</hi> Day this ill-advised Crue meets the Knight upon the Road, who was ignorant of their Resolutions, and conduct him Honourably, according to their Fashion, to the Town: Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had with him fifty Lances, and some Companies of Archers, listed at random, many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churls, and Confederates with them: The Knight cites the Townsmen and their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to appear before him in <hi>Derfold,</hi> to hear the Pleasure and Commands of the King; they fail not, <hi>There he tells them what Forces the King had assembled; how rigorously those of</hi> Essex <hi>were senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: That the King was highly incensed at the Troubles and Seditions of this place, of which he was the Patron and Defender: That with Great Difficulty he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of the King a Commission, by which himself, and others, not Strangers, or Enemies, but their Friends and Neighbours were authorized to do Iustice in the KingsStead; he concludes if they will appease the King, they must find out, and deliver up the Beginners of these Broils, and make Satisfaction to the Lord Abbot, an holy and a just Man, for the Wrong they had done him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This many of the Hearers approve, and promise to obey. The Knight charges a Jury to be made
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:109805:265"/>
ready the next Morning, and make what Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they can, and gives the People Leave to depart. Towards Night he sends for the Jury to his Chamber, intending to have apprehended the Lieutenants, by the Assistance of the Jury, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Noise. These good Men and true know nothing; it was the Case of their Fellows in Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and might be their own. They answer in a plain <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> they can indict no Man, accuse no Man. Amongst all the sounder of these Swine, there was not one who had been Faithless and Disloyal to his Natural Liege Lord, not one Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his Peace, not one who could appear so to them.</p>
                  <p>The Knight seems not to understand the Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Cunning of these Hob-nail perjured Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: He takes another Way, and next requires them within a peremptory time, to bring him the Charters which they had forced from the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they return after a short Consultation, and in the <hi>Abbots</hi> Chamber, where the Knight then was, tell him, <hi>They dare not obey out of Fear of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; what was more, they knew not in whose Custody the Charters were.</hi> The Knight grows angry, and swears, they shall not go out of the Chamber till he have them, which they call imprisoning their Persons. Here the <hi>Abbot</hi> intercedes, and though he knew them as very Knaves and Lyers as any <hi>Tyler</hi> had set on work, yet he will not (he says) distruct their Honesty; he will leave things to their Consciences, upon which they are freed.</p>
                  <p>Another Assembly is appointed at <hi>Barnet</hi> Wood, whither the Villagers about throng in Multitudes.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:109805:265"/>
Three hundred Bow-men of <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>Berkham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,</hi> make here so terrible a Show, nothing is done.</p>
                  <p>The Commissioners privately charge the Gentry, Constables, and Bayliffs to seize in the Night <hi>Greyndcob, Cadindon, Iohn</hi> the Barber, with some others, and to bring them to <hi>Hartford,</hi> whither themselves went in all Haste; which was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: The Esquires and Servants of the Abby, were sent with them to strengthen the Company. This enrages the Townsmen afresh, they gather into Conventicles in the Woods and Fields, so much frightful to the Monastery, that the <hi>Abbot,</hi> recalls his Esquires, lets the Prosecution fall, and fearfully summons in his Friends to guard him. <hi>Greyndcobs</hi> Friends take Advantage of this Change, and bail him for three Days, within which time they were either tyed to agree with the <hi>Abby,</hi> or render up <hi>Greyndcob</hi> to the Justices again. The Townsmen fierce enough still, yet earnest to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Worthy, are content to part with the Charters; but this <hi>Greyndcob</hi> (more Fool-hardy than wise) would not consent to. Nor does he, as knowing the Stifness of his Clowns whine in a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Tone, never used by him.</p>
                  <p>He prays them to consider how Beautiful <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is, how sweet, how Honourable: Dangerous <hi>Liberty,</hi> (says he) is more valuable than safe and quiet Slavery; let us live, or dye with <hi>Liberty,</hi> in so generous, so honest a Contention, it will be Glorious to be overcome; whatsoever our Fears are, worse we cannot be, then now we are about to make our Selves. Success too doth not so often fail Men, as their own Industry and Boldness: Fear
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:109805:266"/>
not for me, nor trouble your selves at my Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I shall think my self more happy than our Lords, if they prosper, or their <hi>King,</hi> to dye a Martyr of the <hi>Cause,</hi> with the Reputation of such a Gallantry. <note place="margin">Per tale Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium vitam fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note> Let such Courage as would have hurryed you forward to all brave and signal Mischiefs, had I lost my <note place="margin">Si Hertfordiae, hesterno decolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c.</note> Head at <hi>Hartford,</hi> inflame your heavy Sprights. Methinks I see the Hero <hi>Tylers</hi> Ghost chiding our sluggish Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and by the Blazes of his Fire-brands kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in Hell, and waved by Fiends about his Head, lead on to noble Villanies.</p>
                  <p>Let dreaming Monks and Priests tremble at the airy Sounds of God, and Saints; he who fears Thunder-bolts, is a Religious heartless Coxcomb, and shall never climb a Molehill. Thus our bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin'd Martyr swaggers, after the Raptures put upon him by <hi>Walsingham; Greyndcob's</hi> Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hardens on the Clowns, they now accuse themselves of Baseness, that they did not cut off the Knights Head, and nail it on the Pillory, to the Terror (say they) of all Judges, and false Justices. <hi>Greyndcob</hi> had raised Spirits, which he could not lay when he would.</p>
                  <p>Three days being expired, he is again sent to <hi>Hartford</hi> Goal, where he hears News from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who mediated for him in the Court, not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasing, which he communicates to his Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. His Intelligence was to this Effect; That <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Beauchamp</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Piercie</hi> with a thousand armed Men were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to visit S. <hi>Albans.</hi>

At this Report the Rebels startle, they fall to new Treaties, offer the Charters and Book, in which the old <hi>Pleas</hi> betwixt the <hi>Abby</hi> and the Town were recorded, with 200 l. for amends. The Book is received; the rest put off till the next Day. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> sends only Excuses, he heard his own House was on Fire, that the Clowns of his own Lordships were up, and he leaves all things else to quell them. This raises the fallen Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of those of Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> they now laugh at their late Fears, <hi>If the Commons,</hi> say they, <hi>must quit their Right of Conquest, and surrender their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet will not we the (Renowned Mechanicks) of St.</hi> Albans <hi>be their President.</hi> And as in all Tumults (which can never be observed too often) Lying is necessary, and must not be useless, whatsoever else is; they lay the Blame of their Obstinacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inhabitants of <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>Watford,</hi> who threaten (so they would have it believed) to burn their Town if they deliver up their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Inhabitants of <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>Watford</hi> had humbly surrendred theirs before, and submitted to the <hi>Kings</hi> Mercy: Thus we find these Rebels of St. <hi>Albans</hi> again swaggering in their old <hi>Rhodomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadoes.</hi> An Esquire of the <hi>Abbots</hi> acquaints the <hi>King</hi> with these Turnings, who vows to sit perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in Judgment upon these Everlasting Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Abbot</hi> full of Pity and Charity, who had saved some of these Enemies of his House from the Axe by Intercession at <hi>London,</hi> continues his Goodness still. He sollicites Sir <hi>Hugh Segrave,</hi> Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the Houshold, and others of his Friends, to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:109805:267"/>
mitigate the King's Displeasure, and hinder his Journey thither, which was not in their Power. Now again are the Townsmen dejected, and seek by all means to keep off the Tempest, which threatned them: They fee Sir <hi>William Croyser</hi> a Lawyer to make their Defence, and mediate with the <hi>Abbot,</hi> wherethere was no Danger: An Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is concluded the Day of the <hi>Kings</hi> Entry, by which they would bind the <hi>Abbot,</hi> not to disclose them, or inform against them.</p>
                  <p>He promises (if they fail not in Performance on their Part) not to make any Complaints to the <hi>King</hi> of them; that he would be a Suiter for their Peace, if his Prayers may be heard, but that here he cannot assure them: Pardons were Acts flowing meerly from <note place="margin">See 27 A. 1. c. 24.</note> the <hi>Kings</hi> Grace. <hi>No Man had any Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to pardon or remit Treasons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but the King;</hi> and whether he could prevail for them, he knew not. This Doubtfulness troubles them, it seems to call their Innocency too much into Question: They tell him, his good Will was sufficient, and that as to what belonged to the Royal Dignity they should satisfie the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Vespers the <hi>King</hi> made his Entry into the Town, being met by the <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Covent;</hi> the Bells rang aloud, and the Monks sang merrily his Welcome: He was followed by some thousands of Bowmen and Cavaliers. In this Train was Sir <hi>Robert Tresilian,</hi> Chief Justice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> who the next Day, being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 13. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and first of the Dog-days, sat in Judgment at the Moot-hall (says <hi>Walsingham)</hi> at the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</p>

                     <hi>Greyndcob, Cadindon,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Barber, are fetched from <hi>Hartford,</hi> and laid fast till Munday, against which time new Jury-men are chosen, and charged to be ready with their Verdicts: Prophet <hi>Baal,</hi> the <hi>Sergius</hi> of the new <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the Priest of the Idol and his Calves, the <hi>Martin of the Yoak, of pure Discipline, of the Eldership,</hi> was taken by the Townsmen of <hi>Coventry,</hi> brought to St. <hi>Albans</hi> the Day before, and this Saturday condemned by the Chief Justice to be Drawn, Hanged, Beheaded, Imbowelled, and Quartered, which was done on the Munday following.</p>
                  <p>He confessed to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> (to whose Christian Piety he ought the two last Days of his Life, which were begged for his Repentance) that certain hot and <hi>powerful Pastors of the Separation, Brethren of simple Hearts, called by the Spirit</hi> (he named six or seven) <hi>had covenanted and engaged to compass</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales <hi>round, as Itinerant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to propagate the Gospel, beat down all Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the outward Man, Antichristian Hierarchy, and Tyranny of the Nimrods of the Earth, to cry up the great and Holy Cause, and to spread the Law, Principles, and Heresies of</hi> Baal; <hi>which Disciples</hi> (says this <hi>Rabbi) unless they be prevented, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off will destroy the Realm in two Years:</hi> He might have said <hi>two Months,</hi> and been believed, as to the Civility, Humanity, Order and Honour (never intermitted but in the Confusion of a barbarous, impious Age) which made <hi>England</hi> Glorious, they had been destroyed, and torn up in a less time. A few licentious ill Acts easily beget a Custom, and an hundred ill Customs quicklier grow and prevail than one single good one. There

is a Proneness in unruly Man to run into Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and no wonder that the arrogant, misled, silly Multitude, capable of any ill Impressions, should deprave and disorder things, where all Ties of Restraint are loofened; nay, where Disorders are not only defended by the corrupt Wits of Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but bidden, strengthened by a Law, and Villanies made legal Acts.</p>
                  <p>Had the Idol King <hi>Tyler,</hi> with his Council, not gone on too far in the Way of Extermination, but endeavoured to repair the Breaches of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; it would have been no small Labour to have restored things to any mean and tolerable Condition; if <hi>Presbyter Wickliff,</hi> and his <hi>Classes,</hi> by their pernicious Doctrines (as they are charged to this Day) did first pervert and corrupt the People, and broach that Vessel with which Father <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Straw</hi> poysoned them, they must have rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themselves by the Change; sure enough they had been no more comprehended in any of <hi>Tylers Toleration,</hi> than the <hi>Prelatical or Papistical Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Turmoils and Outrages of this <hi>Tyranny,</hi> had it taken, Innocence, Virtue, Ingenuity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, Faith, Learning, and Goodness had been odious, and dangerous. The Profit, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the new Usurpers, had been the Measure of Justice and Right: The Noble and Ignoble had died Streets and Scaffolds with their Blood, not by Laws and Judgment, but out of Malice to their Height and Worth, out of Fury and Covetousness to enrich publich Thieves and Murtherers. The Jealousies too and Fears of <hi>Tyler,</hi> had made all Men unsafe. Yet the Repute, the Renown of the Founders could not have been much. The Glory
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:109805:268"/>
of Success cannot be greater than the Honesty of the Enterprise; there must be Justice in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, else there can be no true Honour in the Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. <hi>Cato</hi> will love the conquered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: <hi>Iugurtha</hi>'s Fame, who is said to be Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his Parricides and Rapines, will not make all Men fall down and worship.</p>
                  <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the Fifteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> (not of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as <hi>Walsingham</hi> is mis-printed) the Chief Justice <hi>Tresilian</hi> calls before him the Jury for Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who faulter and shamelesly protest they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any such Discovery as is desired. The Chief Justice puts them in Mind of the <hi>Kings</hi> Words to them upon the Way, promising Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don if they will find out the Offenders; else threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with the Punishment they should have suffered, who through such Silence cannot be apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Out they go again, and the Chief Justice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them: He shews them a Roll of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Offenders Names, tells them they must not think to delude and blind the Court with this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and advises them out of a Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve wicked Mens Lives, not to hazard their own.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon they indict many of the Town and Country, which Indictments are allowed by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Inquest, appointed to bring in the Verdict, and again affirmed by a third Jury of Twelve, charged only for the Fairness of the Tryal: So no Man was pronounced guilty, but upon the finding of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty six Jurors. Then were the Lieutenants <hi>Greynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Cadindon,</hi> and <hi>Barber,</hi> and twelve more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, Drawn, and Hanged. <hi>Wallingford, Iohn Garleck, William Berewill, Thomas Putor,</hi> and
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:109805:269"/>
many more; with Eighty of the Country, were Indicted by their Neighbours, and Imprisoned, but forgiven by the King's Mercy, and discharged. They were forgiven most by the Kings Mercy; for he had forbidden by Proclamation, all Men to sue or beg for them, a Command which the good <hi>Abbot</hi> sometimes disobeyed, and he shall be well thanked for it.</p>
                  <p>No Benefits can oblige some Men: A true rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Churl can never be made fast, never be tyed by any Merit whatsoever: Nothing can soften him: See an unheard of Shamelesness till then. These lazie, tender-hearted Clowns, who could hardly be got to discover the Guilty, now run with full Speed to betray the Innocent: They indict the <hi>Abbot</hi> as the principal Raiser, and Contriver of these Tumults, which struck at his own Life, and the Being and Safety of his Monastery. The Abbot, as it is said, sent to <hi>Tyler,</hi> upon his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> some of the Town and Monastery, but to temporize, and secure himself. This is now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the very Traitors indeed, <hi>Treason by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law and Statute against the King his Natural Liege Lord.</hi> This <hi>having not the Fear of God in his Heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but being seduced by the Instigation of the Devil, is compassing the Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and deposing of his Soveraign Lord from his Royal State,</hi> &amp;c. (as such Indictments use to run) This must goe for <hi>levying War against the Lord the King, adhering to, comforting, and aiding his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by open Fact;</hi> Which are the Words of the Statute of Treason, <note place="margin">25 Edw. 3.</note> declarative of the Common Law.</p>
                  <p>The Chief Justice, abominating and cursing the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:109805:269"/>
treacherous Malice, and Perfidiousness of these Brutes, makes them tear the Indictment which themselves, though urged, are not wicked enough to swear to; nay, which publickly they confess to be false in the Face of the Court.</p>

                     <hi>Villeinage</hi> was not now abolished, though some think otherwise, but by Degrees extinguished since this Reign. Besides, the Letters of Revocation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, restoring all things to their old Course, a Commission, which the Abbot procured from the King out of the Chancery, then kept in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-house of this Monastery, makes this manifest; which speaks to this Effect.</p>

The Disobedient are commanded to be taken, and Imprisoned as Rebels</p>
                  <p>In the Time of <hi>King Henry</hi> the Seventh there were Villains. This <note place="margin">11 H. 7. 13.</note> I observe to make it appear, how little it is which the miserable Common People, without whom no famous Mischief can be attained, are Gainers by any of their Riots or Seditions; whatsoever the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are, their Condition is still the same or worse. If some few of them advance themselves by the Spoils of the publick Shipwrack, the rest are no happier for it; the insolent Sight offends their Eyes, they see the Dirt of their own Ditches lord it over them, and the Body of them (perhaps) more despised than ever. <hi>Tyler</hi> (who could not but have known, that nothing can be so Destructive to Government, as the Licentiousness of the base Commons) would doubtless (when his own Work had been done) quickly have chained up the Monster; he would have perched in the Kings sacred Oak; all the Forrest should have been his, Bishopricks, Earldoms, nay the Kingdoms had been swallowed by him. Instead of a <hi>just legal Power</hi> by which the Kings acted, an <hi>Arbitrary, boundless, unlimited Power</hi> must have been set up; instead of a Fatherly Royal Monarchy, a <hi>Tyranny</hi> after the Turkish Mode, a Monarchy Seignioral; and had he brought in upon the Fall of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith and Worship, which must have followed his <hi>Establishment,</hi> Circumcision, and the Creed of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as the Spirits of Men were than deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he must have been obeyed. All the Kings Right (and more) must have been his; <hi>Sultan</hi>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:109805:270"/>
                     <hi>Tyler</hi>'s <hi>Prerogative</hi> would have been found more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, more heavy, more killing than all the Yokes and Scorpions of our Kings; no Man when he went to Sleep, could assure himself that one Law would be left next Morning; the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Tyler</hi> and his Council flew about in Swarms, killing and rooting up the Laws: One Proclamation of this Tyrant's was of Force to blow up the ancient Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; enough to have made Men mad, if ever they could wake, and understand. When the <hi>French</hi> had conquered <hi>Naples,</hi> the People looked for a golden World, they thought their new Master would (as the King of <hi>Mexico</hi>'s Oath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to say) do Justice to all Men, make the Sun to shine, the Clouds to rain, the Earth to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: They promise themselves <hi>Liberty,</hi> and that the accustomed Imposts of their former <hi>Kings</hi> of the House of <hi>Arragon,</hi> should not only be taken off, but the very Word <hi>Gabelle</hi> driven out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there should be no such thing in Nature left; but foolish Dolts as they were, they found an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration quickly, instead of a Court Cavalry before (the new Masters ill <hi>established</hi> and assured, not daring to trust any thing) standing Armies were continually to be kept on Foot; instead of one Tax, intolerable of late, they are oppressed with ten, their Backs and Shoulders crack under the Load.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Fancy of these abused <hi>Italians,</hi> says the Historian, <hi>This is the Custom, for the most part of all People, weary ever of the present Condition, and inconsiderately gaping after a Change, but they receive such Wages of their fond and disorderly Lightness.</hi>

                  <p>The Prince of the <hi>Burgundies</hi> demands the Towns upon the <hi>Some</hi> for himself: <hi>Normandy</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Berry,</hi> and other places; Offices, and Pensions for the rest; some Overtures were made for the <hi>Weal Publick</hi> (says the History) that is all, the <hi>Weal</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> having now quieted the Commotions removes to <hi>Berkhamsted,</hi> eight Miles from St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans;</hi> a Royal Castle then, and at <hi>Easthamsted</hi> where he hunts, is informed, that the Bodies of the Traytors executed were taken down from the Gallows; hereupon he directs his Writ or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Bayliffs of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> commanding them under Penalty of forfeiting all things forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to hang up again the said Bodies now rotten, and stinking in Iron Chains, which the Townsmen
