            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wisdome, Grace, and Power are the Essence of God, and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he made and governs the whole Creation independently, and none can say, Why hast thou done thus? There is some parity between a Saints Soul-state, and the true Church-state: Darkness and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage precedes light and comfort; sufferings goe before rest; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>

true Seed are in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> they <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 13. Exod. 12. 40, 41.</note> pass the red Sea, and wander in a houling Wilderness, before they can possess the promised Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and all these former deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God with his people in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, were written for examples <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 11.</note> and types for us upon whom the ends of the world are come. <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vab</hi> hath not usually made great promises to his people, and inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with his Free Grace, but he hath brought them to live upon him by faith for the performance of the word that went out of his mouth; yet as God saw the state of future times, he was pleased still to discover and fore-tell to his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Saints the enemies fall, and the Churches advance and glory in this world. The state both of the Jewish and Christian Church, as to their sufferings, union and glory, were fully represented in <hi>Daniels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and <hi>Johns</hi> Revelations. When Jesus Christ was in the Flesh hee
<pb facs="tcp:50070:3"/>
was frequently Preaching, and in Parables representing the Churches suffering, and raised estate, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him the Apostles taught the same things. The Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles spake not only of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches future sufferings under the Beasts &amp; false Prophet, the Dragon and the Whore, but God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed also to compute and measure the time of Saints sufferings to their promised Redemption.</p>
            <p>In Christs fore-telling the events of time after his Resurrection, hee gives not his Disciples the number of years, but leaves with them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fore-going signs of their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Redemption, that both by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of time, and by signs, the Saints might the better finde the time of the Beasts reigns, and the appearing and Kingdome of Jesus Christ. Indeed Chronologies are imperfect, and I judge the very year of the Beasts fall, and Churches deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 36</note> cannot be asserted by man;
<pb facs="tcp:50070:4"/>
yet I humbly conceive, that both from computations and signs, God hath begun his Churches delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in these Nations.</p>
            <p>The Churches Restoration is as fully promised, as her afflicted state fore-told; and when the Dragon and the Whore have had their time of tyranny over the Saints, why should we not certainly beleeve and look for promised rest? If you please here to take a view of the Kings of the Earth, and examine Antichrists plots and practices, they have fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Word of God by the mouthes of his Prophets, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them exactly, as face answers face in a Glasse.</p>
            <p>Great Senators, I may be bold to say, God hath honoured <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Nations of the earth, and you above many Sons of men, in making use of you to begin (and prosess your resolutions) for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of Truth and Holiness in these Lands; it was only the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:50070:4"/>
free mercy that brought, and hath continued the Gospel in <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any Country and Kingdom in <hi>Europe;</hi> and may we not upon that ground beleeve, that appearing, and kingdom of the Son of Man promised shall here begin, and from hence run from Nation to Nation, till all the Vials of Gods Wrath be poured out upon the Churches enemies, &amp; that great voyce out of the Temple in Heaven be fulfilled, saying, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> 
               <hi>of this world are become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever?</hi> True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the night is not yet past, and the Lords work in your hands is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with great difficulty, yet you shall ever have a Pillar and a Cloud to guide and defend, if you keep your eye upon them.

<pb facs="tcp:50070:5"/>
Carnal Counsellours, and worldly Politicians know little of the Lords designs at this day, and will doe as little in his work.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the providence of my dear Father, when he took me from more rough imployment in the Warrs of <hi>England,</hi> to call me to preach the Gospel of Light in a dark cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which was not without success and comfort to my soul, and refreshing to many at home and abroad: but after a little time Satan raised so great opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some few painful Servants of the Lord, who (with my self) joyned freely to preach the Gospel on week-days from Town to Town where we were invited by any of the Lords people; that after the continuance of this course for about two years, and some light (especially in the order of the Gospel) brake forth, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Ministers shut the doors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Meeting-places against us, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees put an end to those fruitful and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed exercises. My more publick Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel being so prevented, and
<pb facs="tcp:50070:6"/>
my preaching in my Parish-relation by the same spirit of Antichrist made very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, that young Converts were stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered about Church-order, and many Christians drew back; It was upon my heart to imploy my spare hours to prepare something for the Presse, and preach in Print, when I could not preach in other mens Pulpits. I was (for some time) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved of a Subject to write upon, but seeking to the Lord in Prayer, God set the sence of the old Dragons, and the Whore of <hi>Babylons</hi> long-continued Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over the Saints much upon my soul, and I judged it was now a time seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a Work necessary afresh to take a view of this old World under Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tyranny in States, and under mystical <hi>Babylons</hi> usurpations over the Church of Christ. In the time of the Jewish Church-state, and for some time after the New-Testament-church-state was begun, <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>els</hi> four parted terrible Image, and his four monstrous Beasts, had all their answerable times and terms, that with Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, <hi>Johns</hi> Serpent, or Dragon with seven Heads and ten Horns, the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was entered the stage of this World, and acted like himself. But as this Beast grew weak, and fell in power, the
<pb facs="tcp:50070:6"/>
great Whore, Mystery, <hi>Babylon,</hi> took her opportunity to get up, and rides that Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-coloured <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 3</note> Beast to this day. Since the Pope, or Papacy hath ridden the Dragon or earthly Monarchy, the Whore hath made great use of the Kings of the Earth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise her bloudy cruelty upon the Saints, that have owned and sought those privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges where-with the Lord Jesus Christ hath made them free.</p>
            <p>What the Dragons and the Whores time and Tyranny hath been, is not unknown to many Saints, and light will break forth more and more to the perfect day.</p>
            <p>Large and vast are those Volumes which have been written upon these four great Empires of the World, and the Papacy of <hi>Rome;</hi> but these (for the greatest part) have been written in strange Tongues, and are in the studies of great Scholars, to little Spiritual use.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had taken <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and setled the Empire of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> in himself, his desires were to know what after should come to passe in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter daies; His mind being thus busied, he had a Vision of a great and terrible I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, whose head was of Gold, his brest and arms of Silver, his belly and his thighes of Brasse, his leggs of Iron, his
<pb facs="tcp:50070:7"/>
feet part of Iron and part of Clay; a stone cut out without hands, smote the Image upon his feet—and brake them to peeces—that no place was found for them; and the stone that smote the Image became a great Mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p>
            <p>This Vision was revealed from the Lord to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and by <hi>Daniel</hi> to King <note place="margin">Dan. 2. 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> wherein is presented the future state of the world from that time to the Kingdom of Christ, or Kingdom of the Stone, and end of this old World. From that time the world was to bee under the successive government of four Kingdoms, of which <hi>Babylon</hi> was the first. <hi>And in the days of these Kings shall the God of</hi>

I may hence infer, its now a work becoming the Lords people to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after light in this Prophecie, and be saying to the Lords Watch-men, as those of <hi>Sier, Watch-man, what of the night? <note place="margin">Isa. 11. 11</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50070:7"/>
watch-man, what of the night?</hi> that is, how much of the time of these four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are run out, or what remains yet to be fulfilled of them? when the fifth Kingdom is to begin? and the watch-men may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>The morning cometh, also the</hi>

            <p>It was a mercy that the Lord should have this Prophecie as a ground for faith, and prayer to his people; but God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly fore-told the suffering state of his Church under these four Kingdoms, hath by his Prophets and Apostles, which are now so plain, that Saints doe run and <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

This news being brought to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he was astonished; and lying down upon his bed, fell sick with grief, and in his trouble lamented his cruelty against the Jewes, whom he destroyed without cause; acknowledging the just hand of the Lord was upon him for it.

               <p>THis Empire had it's Original from <hi>Rome,</hi> as is well known. <hi>Italy</hi> is <note place="margin">Maginus.</note> a Country in this part of the World cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Europe,</hi> and lies thus: <hi>Italy</hi> is round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Ionian and <hi>Adriatique</hi> Seas, except towards <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> from whom it is parted by the <hi>Alps.</hi> This Region was distinguished into four parts. 1. <hi>Hesperia,</hi> 2. <hi>Latium,</hi> 3. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonia,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Merula.</note> and 4. <hi>Oenotria.</hi> Of all the Cities wherewith <hi>Italy</hi> was beautified, <hi>Rome</hi> had the first place, and became Mistress of the World. This City is supposed to be founded by <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus,</hi> in <note place="margin">Romes <hi>first building, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> Anno mun. 3230.</note> the reign of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> about <hi>Ann. mund.</hi> 3230. This City in her glory spread her lines to the compass
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50070:45"/>
of 50. miles: But this City felt the fury of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and by them was laid in <note place="margin">Sleidan.</note> heaps. So that now <hi>Rome</hi> standeth low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the Bank of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and is drawn <note place="margin">Funke.</note> into narrower bounds. This Empire hath (according to <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophesie,) <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 7.</note> differed greatly from the other three, and in nothing more then in the several changes of Government: yet as the Lord described to <hi>Daniel</hi> this fourth and last earthly Kingdom in several parts and properties, it is apparent that no City or Empire of the World hath answered the Vision, like this of <hi>Rome. Daniels</hi> fourth beast is described with 10. horns; but <hi>John</hi> in the Revelation having a Vision <note place="margin">Rev. 12. 3.</note> of the same beast, saw him with seven <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 9, 12.</note> heads, and ten horns: where the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost there interpreteth the seven heads to be seven mountains, and the ten horns, ten Kings. Both which, time hath proved true in <hi>Rome.</hi> First, <hi>Rome</hi> in her plantation was built upon seven hills, which are thus named and numbered. <note place="margin">Rome <hi>built upon seven hills.</hi>

Emperours or <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars.</hi> But though ambition and avarice did cause these changes in the Roman State, yet the word of the Lord hath been fulfill'd in it and upon it, that there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be accomplished. I shall wholly pass over the State of <hi>Rome</hi> under all these former Governments, and onely speak to the Imperial.</p>
               <p>When the Romans had ended their <note place="margin">Note.</note> War in <hi>France,</hi> Civil War arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves between <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and <hi>En. Pompey</hi> his kinsman. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> were both Roman Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and had great interest in the people. But <hi>Pompey</hi> laying his design to get into sole power, would have <hi>Caesar</hi> put out of his Consulship, unlesse he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Army. <hi>Caesar</hi> could not think himself safe to dismiss his Souldiers: yet did offer, that he would do it, if <hi>Pompey</hi> would do the like. Yet this equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not being accepted, <hi>Caesar</hi> presently speeded to his Army in <hi>France,</hi> marched into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there possessed himself of divers strong Holds. This news being brought to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he rallied his Army, and gave Battel to <hi>Caesar.</hi> But in this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50070:46"/>
Fight <hi>Pompey's</hi> Army was routed, and <hi>Pompey</hi> himself fled into <hi>Egypt.</hi> But where <hi>Pompey</hi> looked for requital of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">A false friend.</note> kindness, his low estate was now despised, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> fearing uprores in his Country by har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Pompey,</hi> he caused <hi>Pompey</hi> to be treacherously slain, and so <hi>Caesar</hi> came to sole power.</p>
               <p>In the 5. year of this Civil War, <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> returned to <hi>Rome:</hi> and now ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being vanquished abroad, and the <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> people pacisied at home, <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had the honour of Dictator; but having the power of the sword, he assumed Supreme Authority to himself, chose Senators of his own party, and conferred honours and Offices of the Weale-publike, upon whom he pleased. By this usurpation, <hi>Caesar</hi> was lost much in the affections of the people in general, and hated by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. So that conspiracies were made against him, and at last he was murdered in the Senate, the 15. of <hi>March,</hi> the 5. moneth after he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> by those he had shewn great kindness to. The Roman Monarchy here took beginning, and from hence I intend to trace the Emperours so long as the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire lasted, and give a view to the world

what beastly Monsters most of them were, according to the Visions of them to <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Julius Caesar, Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Augustus <hi>first Emp. of</hi> Rome.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustus, Caesars</hi> sisters son, drew the Souldiers after him, and pretended to put himself into Arms for the Weale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu <note place="margin">An. mun. 3848.</note> like. At this time the Government of <hi>Triumviri</hi> were established, and the Rule given to <hi>Augustus,</hi> and two of his friends. But the greedy ambition of sole Authority ingendred strife amongst the three Governours. <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> was soon deposed, for conspiring against <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</hi> And not long, after <hi>Augustus</hi> made War upon <hi>Antonius,</hi> (who had married the sister of <hi>Augustus)</hi> for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her away, and marrying the Queen of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In this War <hi>Augustus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and made <hi>Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his new wife, to kill themselves. And thus <hi>Augustus</hi> came to the Empire of <hi>Rome.</hi> Historians say, Our Saviour Jesus <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The birth of Christ.</hi> 3891 Luk. 2. 1.</note> Christ was born of the Virgin, in the 42. year of the reign of <hi>Augustus.</hi> That Christ was born in the reign of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> the Scripture assures us; but to finde out the particular year of his reign, we must consult Chronologers. <hi>John Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> saith, It was the 29. year of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50070:47"/>
&amp;c.</hi> Yet these may be thus recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: accounting 13. years of <hi>Augustus</hi> his reign as <hi>Triumviri,</hi> and 29. in sole Government as Emperour, the birth of Christ falls in the 42. year of <hi>Augustus;</hi> after which he reigned 14. years, and in all 56. and died <hi>Anno Christ.</hi> 15. <note place="margin">An. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Augustus, Tiberius</hi> (his son in <note place="margin">Tiberius <hi>the</hi> 2. <hi>Emp</hi> Sleidan.</note> law) took the Empire. At first he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard to be perswaded to accept the Crown, and for some time did nothing of moment without the Senate. But <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 1, 21, 23.</note> when he was well setled in the Throne, he did what he pleased.

Cytreus</hi> upon the 21. of <hi>Mat.</hi> hath it thus: Our Saviour Christ Jesus, when <note place="margin">Cytreus.</note> he had lived here on earth 33. years, and something more, suffered death for the Salvation of mankinde the 25. day of <hi>March,</hi> in the 18. year of the reign of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> In his reign also <hi>Steven</hi> was stoned, <hi>John Baptist</hi> beheaded, and <hi>Paul</hi> called.

               <p>Though the Empire was divided by <hi>Constantine</hi> in his life time to his three sons, and each had large Dominions; Yet (as ambition can keep no bonds) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> made War upon his brother <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans,</hi> and invaded some of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50070:55"/>
This stirred up <hi>Constans,</hi> who went against his brother, where <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> (the Elder brother) lost his Army and life together.

But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of <hi>Constantine,</hi> the Souldiers chose <hi>Magnentius</hi> Emperour, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the War against <hi>Constans,</hi> and in a short time had him murdered by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50070:56"/>
into the hand of <hi>Constantius.</hi> But in the absence of <hi>Constantius, Gallus</hi> rebelled, and set up himself Emperour of the East. Yet <hi>Constantius</hi> by a wile, got <hi>Gallus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France;</hi> and when he had him there, soon took off his head, and so ended that strife.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In Policy he applyed himself to every <note place="margin">Socrates.</note>

He slattered some, he allured others with gifts, and places of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gave all their liberty in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <note place="margin">Devilish Policy.</note> to establish himself. <hi>Julian's</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and dissembling of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, was undiscovered until this time. But now having got his design, and setled in the Throne, he manifested himself a desperate Apostate, soon open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Idol Temples, and offered sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice therein.

                  </note> and studyed how to root out Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He would not put Christians to death, because Martyrs had so great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but as Learning was a great help to maintain the Doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>Julian</hi> made a Law, that Christians should not be trained up in the Schools of Literature.

               <p>Thus, as in a Map, I have represented some remarkable passages in the rise and succession of Kings, from <hi>Saul</hi> to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age. If this little be laid up in the minds of men, by this taste you may judge much of all their Lives, and Reigns that is vailed under the Curtain. To my best skill, I have only run down sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and prophane History, and have taken the relations of others, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Stories. But if so much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50070:80"/>
came to light, what was done in the dark, that is open to the all-seeing eye of Heaven? Surely a woful sad burden have this sort of men (I may well say, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) been to all People and Nations where-ever they were. And that the Dragon, the Beast, and all their limbs, shall be utterly destroyed by Jesus Christ, who is King of Kings, I question not: I am perswaded the work is now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wheel; and as Jesus Christ is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, here will appear more and more, <note place="margin">Note.</note> to clear up to the Saints another way of governing his people, then yet we see. There is nothing hinders, but our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness. But if I may discover what I see yet afar off, I conceive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours call'd and set up by Jesus Christ, shall be like Jesus Christ himself, humble, self-denying Saints, such as shall set up a publike, and not a self-interest. Such as shall ease burdens, and not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. Such as shall deliver the poor, and not seed upon them. Such as shall guide the people by the rule of Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word, and not make lust and self-will their law, and force it by a long Sword. For certain, if the Lord did not leave <note place="margin">A caution for Kings.</note> wise-men to themselves, they could not but easily reade their own ruine by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50070:81"/>
examples in all times: God is the same yesterday, to day and for ever: And in the same way that God did manifest his righteousness and justice under the sacred Scriptures, the same hath been the Lords providences and dispensations in the world, ever since the Scriptures were written; and as the Apostle expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, These things were written for our <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 11.</note> examples, upon whom the ends of the world are come. I may say, sin was the rise of Monarchy, sin hath been the strength of Monarchy: and Monarchy hath been the punishment of sin, ever since it was. Therefore when the sin of Kings grew high, the Lord stirred up some to punish &amp; pull down these Kings, by the shedding of much bloud, and exhausting of treasure. But when such had got into the Kings State, they did the same that the King did before them; &amp; when their sin again was full, the Lord raised up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to destroy them and their Families. And this is the track of times. But when <note place="margin">Isa. 2. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </note> in the times of the Apostles, is clear by Divine authority: And that this Church of Christ had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Church Officers, Bishops, and Deacons, I think there is no question. But the better to discover the <hi>Roman</hi> Antichrist, two things have been in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate amongst the godly.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whether the first Bishops of the Churches of Christ, had, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise (by power given from Jesus Christ) a Lordly and Soveraign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Saints in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whether the power of one Bishop
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50070:82"/>
or Pastor, by the institution of Jesus Christ, did extend to divers Churches? The judgements of many learned men are published to the World, upon these needful questions; yet I desire to assert my thoughts in this place.</p>
            <p>First, That ordinary Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers <note place="margin">The power of Bishops or Pastors.</note> ought not, nay may not, put out a Lordly Soveraign power over the Church, or Brethren, is plain to all that will read it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That ordinary Church-Officers, have not any power or charge given them over diverse Churches, is plain from Scripture and Reason. When <hi>Paul</hi> called the Bishops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and spake to them all present, yet he presses every one to take care of his own particular Flock, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. If any through prejudice should seek other glosses to put upon this text, to hold their own opinions, they let goe natural reason, and deal worse with Christian souls, than they are willing to doe by their flocks of Sheep. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Shepherd that takes charge of divers flocks in several places, is very <note place="margin">Note.</note> like to Rot them all. But my business is to gather an Epitomy of the Papacy, that the rise and growth of this proud
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50070:82"/>
scarlet. Whore (who rides the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) may bee yet more perfectly discovered, and that the Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> may appear to bee the very Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> shadowed out in Types and Figures unto <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gospel was no sooner preached by the Apostles, but Satan had some ministers ready to pervert the truth of it, and turn away Disciples. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> not only describes, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the working of Antichrist in his time; <hi>Paul</hi> said then, the Mystery of iniquity doth already work, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7. that is, in that very age, pride, end usurpation of false teachers, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Doctrine and Discipline, grew fast on, and many were drawn off from the simplicity of the Gospel, to Idolatrous and Superstitious practices, through ignorance and blind devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but that the first Bishops of the Church of Christ in <hi>Rome,</hi> were many of them sound in the faith, and sealed the truth of the Gospel with their bloud in Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet in those times Heresies, and Sects in Religion grew fast, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50070:83"/>
after more and more. I shall pass in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all the first Bishops, and begin with <hi>Elutherius</hi> the twelfth Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elutherius</hi> was chosen Bishop of the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the fifteenth year <note place="margin">Elutherius <hi>the</hi> 12 <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and dyed,</hi> Anno 191. Euseb.</note> of <hi>Antonius Verus</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Anno</hi> 178. and governed that Church thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years; untill this time the same Doctrin, and Order in the Church which was left by the Apostles, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In his <note place="margin">England <hi>received the Christian Faith.</hi>
               </note> time <hi>England</hi> received the Christian Faith, and when <hi>Lucius</hi> the British King sent to <hi>Rome</hi> (as a famous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church) and desired <hi>Elutherius</hi> to send them the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes, the good Bishop (not dreaming then of a Supremacy) modestly refused it, and referring of the Christians to the Books of the Old and New Testament, to gather out Lawes from thence, urged this reason; The <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes, and the Emperours Lawes we may ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, but the Law of God wee may not—out of them take yee a Law, and by that Law rule your Realm of <hi>Britain.</hi> At this time there was a Sect followed <hi>Marcus,</hi> who denied the real suffering of Christ, and that there
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50070:83"/>
was no resurrection of the Flesh, and therefore lived in Adultery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Victor</hi> succeeded <hi>Elutherius;</hi> In his <note place="margin">Victor <hi>the</hi> 13 <hi>Bishop. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about Easter.</hi> Euseb.

Some observed it upon the fourteenth day of the Moon, after the Jewish Passeover, some upon the Sunday following. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this contention many Synods of Bishops were called in all parts; and so <hi>Victor</hi> called a Synod at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he himself sate President. In this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at <hi>Rome, Victor</hi> took upon him to <note place="margin">Antichrist appears.</note> Excommunicate the Churches in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> because they conformed not to the practice of the Western Churches; But this insolent attempt of <hi>Victor</hi> was stoutly opposed, and <hi>Victor</hi> overcome. Soon after this <hi>Victor</hi> dyed, when hee <note place="margin">Anno 203</note> had governed twelve years, <hi>anno</hi> 203.</p>
            <p>At this time sprung the Heresie of <note place="margin">Euseb.</note> 
               <hi>Artemon,</hi> the Disciple of <hi>Theodotus</hi> a Tanner, who denied the Divinity of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zephyrinus</hi> was the next Bishop of <note place="margin">Zepheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>the</hi> 14 <hi>Bishop. Anno</hi> 221. Euseb.</note> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> and governed eighteen years, <hi>Anno</hi> 221. In his time was <hi>Neotus,</hi> who denied the Trinity of the Deity:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50070:84"/>
He called himself <hi>Moses.</hi> There were also the Sect, <hi>Melchisedechiani,</hi> who held <hi>Melchisedech</hi> to bee greater than Christ. Some taught also, that the Soul dyed with the Body, yet rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the general resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calistus</hi> now took the Chair, and continued five years, and dyed, <hi>Anno</hi>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:50070:103"/>
had a great desire to get into the throne, yet had some scruples how to be absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his Oath; but in a little time <hi>Pipin</hi> was informed that the Pope had the power of Christ and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and could doe all things. <hi>Pipin</hi> dispatches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Ambassadours to Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> about the businesse. At first the Pope made a pause, and thought the attempt vile, but considering of what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage this might be to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, he put on impudence, and exercised all his power. <hi>Zachary</hi> deposed <hi>Childrick,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved <note place="margin">

I need not seek further for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that Man of Sin, that Son o Perdition spoken of by the Prophet and Apostles, nor need any a sharp sight to discern him sitting in the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now was that word of the Lord perfectly fulfilled spoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, who described the Antichrist by several marks, some of which I will here observe. These are the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15 <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 7 <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 7</note> Prerogative Royal of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to dispose of Kingdoms, and pardon Sin; so that he who shall assume these out of the Hand of God, is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, as described at large by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul;</hi> and both these Pope <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> took upon him at this time, when he absolved <hi>Pipin,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Allegiance to <hi>Childrick</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and when hee deposed <hi>Childrick,</hi> &amp; set the Crown upon <hi>Pipin.</hi> I might give the particular Characters the Holy Ghost hath set upon Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and shew how clearly they are fulfilled in the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other order of men in the world, but this would swell my Discourse too much; neither doe I need to go further than what I have here noted, for though some Emperours have deposed Kings,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50070:104"/>
and disposed of their Kingdoms, yet Emperours have not taken upon them to absolve from Oathes, &amp; pardon Sin; though some Priests have taken upon them to pardon sin, yet they have not taken upon them power to dispose of Kingdoms; these only have been assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so the <note place="margin">The Pope is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</note> Pope is the Antichrist. I have now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained my end in this Epitomy, to wit, to discover the Antichrist, and therefore will not detain the Reader with any farther relation of this abominable, blasphemous Beast, yet these two things in general I may not passe, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Popes Pride, and fulfill the Word of God.</p>
            <p>First, when <hi>Zachary</hi> had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that design which had been so long in hatching, hee was cloathed in his Pontifical Robes, and caused himself to bee carried in Triumph upon mens shoulders, to the Church of St. <hi>Lateran.</hi> He appointed Lettanies to bee said in every Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> He also caused the Sculls of the Apostles (if you can beleeve it) and other like Reliques to be openly shewed, which were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and from this time the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have been carried upon mens shoulders.</p>

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:50070:105"/>
Secondly, this is considerable, the unsatisfied ambition of the Popes cea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed not till they had perfectly inflaved the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to make good tha Word of the Lord spoken by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>John, I saw a Woman sit upon a scarlet-coloured Beast, full of Names of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 3</note> 
               <hi>Blasphemy &amp;c.</hi> At the first the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> contended only for a priority of piace in Councils; then for Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Bishops of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but after they took upon them to call Councils, to depose and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Emperours and Kings at their pleasure; so that while they bare the Title of Christs Vicars, they blushed not to assume the Prerogatives of God Almighty, and put upon their heads a Triple Crown, as King of Heaven, Earth and Hell. All these things are published at large, both by Protestant and Popish Writers, to whom I referre those who desire a fuller relation in the particulars.</p>
