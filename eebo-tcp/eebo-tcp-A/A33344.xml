         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E your Majeſties moſt dutiful and loyal Subjects, Ministers of the Goſpel in your City of</hi> London, <hi>having peruſed your Majeſties late Declaration concerning Eccleſiaſticall Affaires; And finding it, to the joy of our hearts, ſo full of Indulgence and Gracious condeſcention, We cannot but judge our ſelves highly obliged, in the first place to render our unfeigned thanks to our good God, who hath ſo mercifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined your Majeſties Royall heart to this Moderation, and next, our most humble and hearty acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto your ſacred Majeſty, that we may teſtifie to your Royal Self, and all the World, our juſt reſentment of your Majeſties great goodneſſe and clemency therein expreſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty,</hi>
               <lb/>
THe liberty of our conſciences, and the free exerciſe of our Miniſtry in the Work of our great Lord and Maſter, for the converſion and ſalvation of ſouls, ought to be, and are more dear to us, then all the profits and preferments of this world; And therefore your Majeſties tenderneſſe, manifeſted in theſe ſo high concernments, doth wonderfully affect us, and raiſe up our hearts to an high pitch of gratitude.</p>
            <p>We cannot but adore Divine Goodneſs for your Majeſties ſtedfaſt adherence to the Proteſtant Religion, notwithſtanding all temptations and provocations to the contrary, and your profeſſed zeal for the advancement and propagation thereof, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that nothing can be propoſed to manifeſt your zeal and affection for it, to which you will not readily conſent.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty hath graciouſly declared, That your Reſolution is, and ſhall be, to promote the power of Godlineſs, to encourage the Exerciſes of Religion, both publick and private, to take care that the Lords day be applyed to holy Exerciſes, without unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary divertiſements; and that inſufficient, negligent, and ſcandalous Miniſters be not permitted in the Church. Your Majeſty hath granted that no Biſhop ſhall Ordain, or exerciſe any part of Juriſdiction which appertains to the cenſures of the Church, without the advice and aſſiſtance of the Presbyters, and neither do, nor impoſe any thing, but what is according to the known Laws of the land. Excluded Chancellors, Commiſſaries, and Officials from Acts of Juriſdiction: ſo happily reſtored the power of the Paſtors in their ſeveral Congregations; and granted a liberty to all the Miniſters to aſſemble monthly, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Paſtoral perſwaſive power, to the promoting of knowledge and godlineſs in their flocks. Your Majeſty hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly promiſed a Review, and effectual Reformation of the Liturgy, with Additional formes to be uſed at choice: And in the mean time, that none be puniſhed, or troubled for not uſing it. Your Majeſty hath graciouſly freed us from ſubſcription re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Canon, and the Oath of Canonical obedience; And granted us to receive Ordination, Inſtitution and Induction, and to exerciſe our function, and enjoy the profits of our livings, without the ſame. Your Majeſty hath gratified the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of many, who are grieved with the uſe of ſome Ceremonies, by indulging to, and diſpenſing with their omitting thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>viz.</hi> Kneeling at the Sacrament, the Croſſe in Baptiſm, bowing at the Name of Jeſus, and wearing of the Surplice.</p>
            <p>All this your Majeſties indulgence and tender compaſſion (which with delight we have taken the boldneſs thus largely to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate) We receive with all humility and thankfulneſſe, and as the beſt expreſſion thereof, ſhall never ceaſe to pray for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties long and proſperous Raign; and ſtudy how in our ſeveral ſtations, we may be moſt inſtrumental in your Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: And that we may not be defective in Ingenuity, We crave leave to profeſſe, that though all things in this frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be not exactly ſuited to our judgement, yet your Majeſties Moderation hath ſo great an influence upon us, that we ſhall to our utmoſt, endeavour the healing of the breaches, and promoting the peace and union of the Church.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other things that have been propounded by our Reverend Brethren, which, upon our knees with all humble importunity, we could beg of your Majeſtie, eſpecially that Reordination, and the Surplice in Colledges may not be impoſed; and we cannot lay aſide our hopes, but that that God, who hath thus far drawn out your Majeſties bowels and mercy, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incline your Majeſties heart to gratifie us in theſe our humble deſires alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we be not further burthenſome; We humbly beg leave to thank your Majeſty for the liberty and reſpect vouchſafed to our Reverend brethren in this weighty affair of accommodation. The God of heaven bleſſe your Majeſty, and all the Royal family,</hi>
