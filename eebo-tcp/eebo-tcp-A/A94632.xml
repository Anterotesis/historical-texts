            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lord, Knights, and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe deep ſence of our particular miſeries, together with a tender fellow
feeling of the ſad and diſtempered condition of this famous City, and
alſo of the whole Kingdom, hath upon divers ſerious and mutuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
ſo far prevailed with us, a great and conſiderable part of this County
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as humbly to make our addreſſes in a petitionary way to the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Houſes of Parliament the fourth of this inſtant <hi>May;</hi> The ſumme of our
deſire is briefly thus, That the King our gracious Soveraigne may come with
honour and ſafety, to treat with his two Houſes of Parliament, the onely
probable way now left us, whereby the true Proteſtant Religion, and all the
juſt rights and liberties of the King, Parliament, and Subjects, and the ancient
and known Laws of this Realme and government, may by the bleſſing of
God upon their joynt conſents in Parliament, be once more revived and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed,
to the glory of God, and comfort of all honeſt men; and though
we cannot doubt of an unanimous compliance from the greateſt part of this
City, and of the whole Kingdome in this our laſt refuge, yet for the better
ſatisfaction, and to clear our ſelves from the miſ-interpretation of ſuch as are
of a contrary opinion, we doe ingeniouſly declare. Firſt, that our addreſſe
ſhall be with all civility and reſpect both to the Parliament and City, free
from any intent of diſturbing the peace and quiet of either; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
with an hearty deſire to prevent the effuſion of ſo much bloud as will
probably be ſhed, if not by a perſonall Treaty timely prevented, which all
men may diſcerne that looke not through Spectacles of particular intereſts.
Secondly, we do not careleſly paſſe by any Ordinance of Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
unto the Kingdome, but do well remember, and have very ſeariouſly
conſidered of that particular Vote againſt a perſonall Treaty, and the reaſon
upon which it is grounded; And we have further compared it with three
former Declarations, where in the firſt we were told, <hi>That the ſeparation of his
Royall Perſon from his Parliament was the originall of our unhappineſſe;</hi> In the
ſecond, when we aſſiſted in ſo large a proportion both of men and money,
<hi>That the chiefe intent of raiſing the Army was, To bring the King from his evill
Counſell in honour and ſafety to his Parliament;</hi> in the third, when we groaned
under the burden, <hi>That it was impoſſible ever to have a ſafe well grounded peace
without his Majeſties perſonall concurrence in Parliament:</hi> When we looked
upon the weighty reaſons expreſſed in the ſaid Declarations, we are well
aſſured, that whoſoever well conſiders what it hath coſt to procure a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Treaty, cannot juſtly blame any man for deſiring of it; And upon theſe
conſiderations we are encouraged to proceed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith confidence that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Houſes will grant our requeſts, which we conceive reaſonable,
whereas to our underſtanding no apparent prejudice can enſue thereby.
Thus humbly deſiring the bleſſing of Almighty God to aſſiſt us in theſe our
juſt deſires, we commit you to his protection.</p>
