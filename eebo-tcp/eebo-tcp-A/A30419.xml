            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Rev. 3. 2, 3.</bibl>
               <q>I have not found thy Works perfect before God.
Remember therefore how thou hast received,
and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If
therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on
thee as a Thief, and thou shalt not know
what hour I will come upon thee.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is nothing in which Men of all Religions
do so constantly agree, as in the Duties we
are now about: so that it may be justly called
<hi>The Voice and Law of Nature,</hi> which directs
all people, when in great Straits, or under great Fears,
to call on that God whom they serve, to implore his
Pity, and pray for his Assistance. I need not tell you
how all <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations do it: the <hi>Jews</hi> practise it:
<hi>Christians</hi> of every Perswasion have upon all great Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and in all Ages, set about it solemnly. Some, with
the Pageantry of <hi>Heathenish</hi> Processions; and others,
with the simplicity that becomes their Profession, as We
do this day.</p>
            <p>When the Ship in which <hi>Jonas</hi> endeavoured to have
fled from the Discharge of an uneasie Commission which
God had given him,<note place="margin">Jon. 1. 5.</note> was driven in a Storm, and
brought to great Extremities, <hi>every Man called upon his
God:</hi> only the guilty Person, whose God could only
hear and help them, <hi>lay fast asleep.</hi> I need not enlarge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54302:3"/>
on the too visible Occasions of our Calling on God at
this time: a sadness that is spread over the Faces, and
fills the Hearts of all Men; the present Distractions We
are under, and the greater Mischiefs of which We are
afraid, speak aloud, and need not be further described:
so that all good Men had in their secret Mournings, and
in their Wishes for a Publick Humiliation of the whole
Nation, anticipated the Address of this <hi>Honourable
Assembly.</hi> It is well that We pay this visible Homage
to Religion and its blessed Author. In this Storm We
have but one God to fly to, and one Lord and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
by whom We may Address to him: If the guilty
Persons will sleep on still, or do worse, continue Sinning
while we are Fasting and Mourning; yet if We <hi>Cry
mightily to God,</hi> We may reasonably hope that He will
ease Us of that load of our Sins, which only can, and
certainly will sink Us, if it still hang on Us. When
We consider Our present ill Condition, and alas! per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this is but the beginning of Our Sorrows; and
reflect on the Signal Blessings We have received from
God, and that We still retain that holy Religion which
was revealed from Heaven by Jesus Christ, <hi>The great
High Priest of our Profession,</hi> We cannot be long to
seek for the true Causes of all those Evils which We
either feel or fear. Truth is still the same, and of the
same Value with the Author of it; and the God of
Truth changes not. What has then separated between
God and Us? and what hath raised that thick Cloud
that seems to be set over Us,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 1, 2.</note> and is ready to discharge
it self in <hi>Fire, Brimstone, and a horrible Tempest? God's
Hand is not shortned, that it cannot save, neither is his
Ear heavy that it cannot hear: But it is our Iniquities
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54302:3"/>
have separated between Vs and our God, and our Sins have
hid His face from Vs,</hi> if He will not hear. Therefore
those whom you Command to plead with You, in the
Name of God on such Occasions, ought to <hi>Cry aloud,
and not spare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 1.</note> but with all the plainness that becomes this
Place, and this time, <hi>Shew you your Transgressions and
your Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to this, I have made choice of these words,
being a part of a short, but weighty <hi>Epistle</hi> written by
St. <hi>John,</hi> in the Name of Christ, to the Church of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi>
Of it in particular we have so little recorded in
the History of the Church, that We can gather nothing
from thence to give Us a clearer Light into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these words: so I shall go no further than the
<hi>Epistle</hi> it self, for setting before You the State in which
it was at that time. <hi>Sardis</hi> had a great Name among the
other Churches, as being one of those planted by the
Apostles: <hi>It had a Name that it lived, yet was dead:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note>
the Power and Life of Religion was under a great
decay, the remainders of it in some few Persons, that
<hi>had not defiled their Garments,</hi> were even ready to die:<note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note>
they were all that left of those who had at first sincerely
embraced the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> they were but a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of what had been, and they were like to drop off
soon: but for the rest, though they retained the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Profession of their Religion, yet Christ <hi>knew their
Works:</hi> and though in some things they might be praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
yet they were not full Weight and Measure;
they were not such as became their Circumstances, their
Light, the Advantages they had, nor the Age they lived
in, in which they ought not only to have <hi>been blameless
and harmless, but to have lookt like the Sons of God, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54302:4"/>
to shine as Lights in the World,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 15.</note> holding forth the Word of
Life.</hi> In a word, <hi>their Works were not perfect before
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, Direction is given them, how to amend
what was defective or amiss among them: they were to
<hi>Remember what they had received and heard,</hi> from the
Apostles: they were to make that the standard of their
Actions: they were neither to frame a Religion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of their own Imaginations, or make up a
mixture of <hi>Heathenism</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> to which many
were then enclined; nor were they to be seduced by any
false Teachers from the Apostolical Doctrine, which was
their Rule; to this they were to adhere and to <hi>hold it
fast.</hi> They were to maintain it in its Purity uncorrupted
while they lived, and to deliver it so to their Posterity
at their Death.</p>
            <p>They are also directed in the use of it, not to preserve
it only as a matter of Speculation, or as a Denomination
by which they were discriminated from others, but were
to improve it so as to be the better for it; <hi>To Repent,</hi>
to change their Hearts and Lives. If they were not
awakned by this Alarm given them from Heaven, they
were to look for a more terrible blow, which should
surprize them in the midst of their Securities, as a
Thief when he is least lookt for: which also insinuates
the Severity, as well as the suddenness of the Stroke.
Thieves that break in in the Night, commonly carry
all away with them, that is worth their pains. On the
other hand, the Remnant, who were then <hi>but a few,
that kept their Garments clean,</hi> are comforted with the
hopes of enjoying God in a State of more perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
expressed in the Figure of <hi>walking with Christ in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54302:4"/>
White:</hi> and to encourage others to follow their Steps,
a general Promise is made to all them that continued to
the end in that course of life,<note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> that they should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the same State of perfect Holiness: their
Names were now to be written in the <hi>Book of Life;</hi>
and at the Great Day, when these Books should be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Christ would before God, Angels, and Saints, give
such a Testimony to them as is recorded in the 25. <hi>Chap.</hi>
of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> Gospel, <hi>When I was Hungry, ye Fed me, &amp;c.</hi>
This <hi>Epistle</hi> being thus explained, it will not be difficult
to apprehend what the Particulars are on which I shall
enlarge. They are these five:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Jesus Christ observes, and will reckon with every
Church, according to the blessings which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
if they live not suitably to them.</item>
               <item>2. The Rule by which we are to examine our selves,
and by which God will judge us, is the Doctrine which
the Churches received from the Apostles.</item>
               <item>3. All those who have heard and received this
Doctrine, ought to keep it carefully, and to conveigh
down that Sacred Trust committed to them to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generations.</item>
               <item>4. The chief Use We ought to make of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is to reform our Hearts and Lives; to repent, and
to forsake our Sins.</item>
               <item>5. Such as will not make this Use of it, have reason
to look for sudden and severe Judgments. All these
things are clearly gathered out of my Text, and seem
to comprehend the full sense of these words, <q>I have not
found thy Works perfect before God: Remember therefore
how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast, and repent.
If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54302:5"/>
Thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon
thee.</q>
               </item>
            </list>
            <div n="1" type="point">
               <head>To Return to the first.</head>
               <p>1. Jesus Christ observes, and will reckon with every
Church, according to the Blessings which they have
received, if they live not suitably to them. <hi>I have
not found thy Works perfect before God. Perfect,</hi> the
<hi>Greek</hi> word is different from that which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  </note> and strictly imports <hi>accomplished</hi>
or <hi>filled up</hi> with such Ingredients as make Works ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
with God. By this we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that absolute Perfection, which excludes all
Sin, or all Defects; for Works so perfect belong to
another State; but such a Perfection as agrees to the
Gospel-Covenant, by which all that is sincere is <hi>perfect</hi>
in some sort, and will be so accounted for to us by
God. Wherein the Works of this Church were not
perfect, We can only guess at it, by what we find in the
other <hi>Epistles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in this and the former Chap. and in the
<hi>Epistles</hi> written by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to some other Churches. There
are three things chiefly specified and insisted on.</p>
               <p>1. Their falling from their <hi>first Love,</hi> and not doing
their <hi>first Works,</hi> charged by St. <hi>John</hi> on the Church of
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> and by St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the <hi>Galathians:</hi> they
received the Gospel, according to the Parable of the
Seed <hi>with great joy:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 13. 20, 21. Gal. 5. 7.</note> they begain <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> they did
<hi>run well,</hi> but the fear of Persecution, or the Cares of the
World, and the Deceitfulness of Riches, made that the
Seed of the Word of God, that had been sown
among them, either withered or was choaked: their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54302:5"/>
first Fervour abated, their Love cooled, they became
Lukewarm, and then quite cold and dead; so that those
who began <hi>in the Spirit</hi> in a spiritual Course,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 3.</note> or had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Gifts or Graces of the Holy Spirit, ended <hi>in
the Flesh,</hi> became carnal and loose men.</p>
               <p>2. They are charged for listning to false Teachers and
Seducers: they had heard many strange things from the
Apostles which were new to them, and these did raise a
curiosity in them after Novelties, with a disposition to
receive them; some of them are particularly named in
these <hi>Epistles:</hi> some brought in <hi>Heathenish</hi> Sorceries and
Idolatrous Rites among them, as <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Jesabel</hi> had
done: others loosed all the Tyes of Modesty and Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,
as the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> did: others were for subjecting
the <hi>Christian Church</hi> to the Yoke of all the Ceremonies of
the <hi>Mosaical Law:</hi> and by the Arts which these Seducers
used, the Churches that had received the Apostles with
great kindness, so that they were ready to have plucked
out their very Eyes for them,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 15.</note> a phrase expressing the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
affection, yet Were too much inclined to entertain
those false Apostles.</p>
               <p>3. They were apt to divide and quarrel unreasonably
about little and inconsiderable things, and carried these
Heats so far, that even when they assembled together to
receive the Holy Sacrament, they met <hi>for the worse, and
not for the better:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 17, 18.</note> so that there were Divisions among
them, and the several Parties assumed such Names as
they thought would give them the most Credit: some
were for <hi>Paul,</hi> some for <hi>Apollo,</hi> some for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and some for
Christ.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> And the very Teachers themselves were factious and
contentious, so that some at <hi>Rome,</hi> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the Gospel, preached there <hi>out of Contention,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 15, 16.</note> that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54302:6"/>
they might thereby <hi>add affliction to his Bonds:</hi> though in
that they were disappointed; for notwithstanding their
Injustice to him, he rejoyced that Christ was preached by
them. Some one or all these had perhaps got into the
Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> for which S. <hi>John,</hi> in the name of Christ,
Expostulates with them. They had much to answer for, to
whom the Apostles had delivered what they had seen and
heard concerning Jesus Christ, confirming it with many
Miracles, and had conferred on them extraordinary Gifts,
so that they were made <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghost, and of
the Powers of the World to come:</hi> These seem to have been
the sins of this as well as of the other Apostolical Churches.</p>
               <p>And now to apply all this to Our own Case, suffer
me first in the Name of God to plead with you, and to
set before you the many blessings you have received
from him, beyond most or rather any Nation now in
the World: We are born in a Country that abounds not
only with all that is necessary for the Inhabitants, but
yields Us great store of very valuable Goods which We
exchange with other Nations, and bring over such
things as grow not among Us; with a vast encrease of
wealth, which from all parts of the World flows unto
Us: Our Country being equally well situated for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Traffique, We have almost forgot when We
were visited with the Plague of Famine. We are under a
Government so rarely tempered by Law, that in it We
have all the advantages of other Constitutions, and
avoid the mischiefs of the several forms of Government,
as much as is possible for any thing that is managed by
mortal and sinful men to be: So that after any of the
Convulsions that have been among Us, it has been still
found necessary to return to the old Channel, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54302:6"/>
the Landmarks which Our Forefathers set Us.
These blessings We enjoy beyond any Nation in the
World, but these We have in common with the former
Ages; they are also Temporal and end with this Life,
We have yet much more to answer for.</p>
               <p>We have the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ
among Us, and therein the way to Life and Immortality
hereafter, is opened to Us. This We have freed from
all the impure mixtures of Idolatry or Superstition with
which it is defiled in other Churches, and are delivered
from the Tyranny of a foreign Power. We have had
Our Religion long secured to Us by Law, with all the
encouragements that can be expected, in a Church so
happily constituted between the extreams of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Tyranny one the one hand, and Enthusiastical
principles on the other hand; so that it is only our own
fault if We are not the Sanctuary and Defence of all
other Reformed Churches, as well as We are the chief
Object of the practices and designs of Our Enemies at
<hi>Rome.</hi> This We have likewise in common with the
former Age: but I shall next enumerate those blessings
that We of this Age have been more particularly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with: They are great and signal, and so obvious that
it will be enough to name them.</p>
               <p>We were involved in a long and tragical War at
home, but were not swallowed up in it. Our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Island drank indeed of a bitterer Cup, and was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
almost all over with the Blood and the Carcases
of the slain. But here the storm was not so terrible:
The Conquerors were so restrained by that supream
Power that governs the World, that it is no small won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
there was so little mischief done, by those who had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54302:7"/>
the Power to do so much: When Our Confusions
thickned so upon Us that our Government changed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as oft as the Weather, all things returned of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to their old Chanel, the King was restored, and the
Nation was setled in so serene and calm a manner,
that it cannot be denied there was a signal hand of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in it. The more have We all to answer for, that
have made so ill use of so extraordinary a blessing; since
that time we have had plenty and peace at home these
twenty years, no breaking out nor complaining in Our
Streets or Countries. We have all this while lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the clear Light of the Gospel; and though many of
the Pastors have much to answer, for their great failings,
yet there have been raised up among us not a few emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and faithful Labourers, who have asserted the
Truth and demonstrated the power of Religion, with as
much advantage as hath been done in any Age since
Miracles and Persecution ceased: and these have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
given publick and free warning to the Nation.
Many excellent Books have been writ, and Sermons have
been published as well as preached, which will remain
to the next Age to testifie against that we live in. God
has been calling on Us aloud from Heaven, both by
his Mercies and Judgments, to turn to him and to bring
forth fruits worthy of Repentance, and meet for the
Kingdom of God; that is, for his holy Gospel. A raging
Pestilence, and a consuming Fire came quick one after
another to awaken Us effectually: yet though We were
then engaged in an expenceful War, God did not deliver
Us up into the hands of our Enemies, though he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
Us so severely himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54302:7"/>
These things did perhaps give a little stop to some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though others went on still publishing their Sin
as <hi>Sodom;</hi> but with the return of peace and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of plenty, We returned to or still continued
in our Sins: We have been delivered from another
War since, and the ill designs of wicked Men were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
and came to nothing: and now for above seven
years We have slept in a profound Peace, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
a security, when there was nothing but vastati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and misery in the Countries that lie next to us:
But our Enemies slept not, they were contriving how
to make Us return back again into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or submit not
our Necks only, but our Souls and Consciences to that
Tyrannical yoke of the <hi>Roman</hi> slavery; and thought
the design so well laid for <hi>rooting out</hi> that which they
call a <hi>Pestilent Heresie,</hi> that it was upon the point of
being executed. Then did it appear that God was still
watching over Us for good, and he that saw all these
secret contrivances, so closely carried and cemented with
so many sacred ties, disappointed all their Councils, and
brought all their designs to Light, when We were least
aware of it; being, though sensible of a great danger
hovering over Us, yet little apprehensive that it was so
near Us, and was to break out in such a manner. I need
not run over all those steps, by which Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has brought out what they intended we should
never have known, till We had felt it and been past
the possibility of preventing or redressing it: They are
well enough known, and are often in all our Mouths,
Oh that they were as much in our Hearts!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54302:8"/>
And now put all these things together, and see if it may
not be said concerning Us, what the Prophet <hi>Isaias</hi>
said of the people of the Jews, <hi>God has planted a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
in a very fruitful place, with the choicest vine, and
has fenced it, and built a Tower in it:</hi> In a word what
more could have been done in this Vinyard, that has
not been done in it? And therefore as partial as we are
apt to be in our own concerns, it may be referred to our
selves, to judge between God and Us. We see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
what he has done for us, let us next consider
what Grapes we have brought forth? What returns We
have made to God? Have Our works been perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God? Alas what do I say perfect! Have they not
been on the contrary the worst, the most impious, and
immoral that many could think on? We have exceeded
the Sins of the Jews, and the Vices of the Heathens. It has
not been only a slackning or going back of the Power
of Religion, but an open revolt against Heaven; in too
great a part of the Nation: a Banner has been set up for
Athiesm and Impiety, and all have been encouraged to
come about it. The Sins which our Popish forefathers
and our more remote Heathenish Ancestors were so much
ashamed of, that they committed them in corners, We
have seen done in the sight of the Sun. The belief of a
God that sees, rewards and punishes, the rules of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and the doctrine of Christ have been by some open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assaulted, and treated with indignities which no other
Nation could endure; while others have if not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consented to them, yet looked on as unconcerned,
have laughed at and been pleased with them. Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
have been taken from the Hipocrisie or Euthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asme
of the last Age, to throw off the very appearances
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54302:8"/>
of Religion or Vertue in this Age: and it has passed
for a piece of Gallantry and decent Breeding to be
above the fears and apprehensions of a supream Power,
or a future State. Have we forgot how publickly that
great blessing of the Kings Restauration was abused?
It grew to that height that it was thought a Scandal not
to concur in all the excesses of Riot and Intemperance
that did then defile the Land. Whether shall we now
turn our Eyes? If on this place, Luxury, Immorality,
and open Lewdness meet us almost in every corner: If
on the Country, how does Intemperance, Injustice, and
a total neglect, if not a resolved scorn of Religion fill
most places? And the excesses of Drinking have in many
parts of the Nation, not only corrupted Civil Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
but vitiated the very Vitals of our Government,
by the ascendent that such practises have had in so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and main a part of our security, as are the Elections
of this great and Honourable Assembly: of whom if
some generously scorned such methods, too many have
complied too much with so base and so ignominious a
custom. If we have thus abused the earthly blessings
of Peace and Plenty, and have much to answer for on
that account: Oh what can we say to excuse our selves
who have not only brought no fruit to perfection,
notwithstanding all that seed of the Gospel that has
been so plentifully sown among us, but have done
what we could to defie God himself, and to drive
him out of our Country, being weary of that very dead
Form of Religion yet remaining. And to bring this
home to our present circumstances, though we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great apprehensions of loosing this blessed Light;
what are we doing to engage God to be on our side?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54302:9"/>
We have been now for above two years in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
full of allarms, and under eminent and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dangers; but what Lust or ill Custom have we
parted with? What demonstration have we given to God
or the World, that we consider Religion as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Power of God to the Salvation of our Souls?
Or what do we for our holy Faith, that Infidels, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,
Jews, or Papists, would not do for their
perswasions? Do we continue still in our Lewdness, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
Oppression, Injustice, Falshood and ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
while we are talking of preserving our Religion,
and yet are doing all we can to undermine or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it?</p>
               <p>If God is against us, all that we can do for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Religion or our other just Rights, will either
by his wise and holy Councils be quite blasted; or
perhaps the very methods that to us seem the most
probable to secure them, may in conclusion really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
that which we fear so much. Are our works
perfect before God who knows them? To make a work
perfect it must be good in it self, flow from a good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and be directed to a good end. The greatest
part of our works are faulty in all these particulars, so
that neither We nor our Works can be accepted with
that God, That <hi>is of purer Eyes than that he can behold
Iniquity.</hi> Some of our Works may be in themselves
good, and such is a zeal for the Reformed Religion;
but if some do not believe that about which they make
so much noise, or if others have no design but to serve
base ends or private Interests, which they hid with
the pretence of Religion, and are ready to throw it
off, when they have attained that for which they are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54302:9"/>
in truth only concerned, shall not God search this out?
Things may be so dressed up, as to have a fair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
but to God they appear as indeed they
are: So the true value of us and our works, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what we are in his sight, from whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can disguise us. From all these things it is but
too evident, that our Works are not perfect before
God.</p>
               <p>If we will consider more particularly what may be
supposed to have been the ground of the Expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in my Text, with this Apostolick Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi>
we shall find the parallel betwixt it and us agrees but
too well. These Churches had fallen from their first
Love, and their first Works: Oh what sad decays are
we come under! And how much have we declined
from that Zeal and Love which our Fathers bore to
the Reformation! There were two things that were
visible in the practice of those who first embraced it
among us: the one was the great pleasure they took in
reading the Scriptures, from whence they were in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siion
called <hi>Gospellers.</hi> When the Bibles were first set
up in Churches, and went at such rates that ordinary
people could not buy them, what a running was there
to Churches, and what crouds gathered all day long
about such as could read, to hear this blessed Word,
which is now in all our Hands, and yet is scarce ever
considered by us? Some read it only to abuse it and
make themselves merry with some Atheistical jests to
which they wrest it: Others judge that indecent, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they will make no ill use of it, they make none at
all, and never open it but for fashion: some imploy
their time in searching into the abstruser parts of it,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54302:10"/>
with a prying and vain curiosity: some read it meerly
to acquire a faculty of talking in such a Stile, and so ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they pervert the Scriptures by their false Glosses, or
only learn to defend some Opinions out of it, or to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in that Dialect, for private Designs, to which
that is perhaps some way necessary. But who read
them with a simplicity of Mind to be directed by them,
and to be inwardly inflamed by the heavenly strains in
them? So that we have little left among us to entitle
us to the Name of Gospellers.</p>
               <p>The other chief Character by which the <hi>Reformed</hi>
were at first known, was their applying themselves only
to God through Jesus Christ. This was intended to take
men off from two fatal Errors, in which they had been
formerly led; the one was relying on such external
Works as were really of no Value at all, and were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the juglings of those deceitful Guides, that had set
up Pilgrimages, slight Penances, and the purchasing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,
in the room of that which our Saviour had
revealed to the World; the other was their imagining
that they were justified by the Sacraments, upon
some slight acts of sorrow or devotion: In stead of
these things the Reformers set up the applying to
God through Jesus Christ according to the methods of
the Gospel: so that great and frequent addresses to the
Father through his Son was the mark by which they
were then known! This begetting in them a sense of
that Love which their Saviour had for them, could
not but kindle returns of Love sutable to it; and
that must needs reform the inward man, upon which
Purity and Holiness of Life will certainly follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54302:10"/>
This was the main Article of the Reformation, and
being that upon which the hopes of Salvation depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was indeed the thing of the greatest consequence;
though it was afterwards managed with too much Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
nicety. In sum this being the chief Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a true Protestant, we may soon see how much
we have fallen from that Love which our Fathers had
to this Truth, while they lived; and that appeared
more signally by their dying for it, when they were
called to give their last Testimony to it. But what is
all this to us? Are we living under the influences of
that love? do our hearts burn with the sense of it?
what reverence have we for the person, or what obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
pay we to the Doctrine of our Crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
If any of this remain, it is much spent, at least,
and ready to dye.</p>
               <p>The second thing charged on these Churches, was
their being apt to be carried away by the cunning
slight of those who lay in wait to deceive, and their
being too easily disposed to vitiate Christianity with
the mixtures of Judaism or Hethenism or other errors.
Our vices have taken us off from the practice of the
plain and indispensable duties of our holy Religion;
and then it is no wonder we find no pleasure in that
Doctrine which can give no true comfort, to such as
continue in their sins. This disposes people to seek
that elsewhere, which they cannot have among us; and
therefore a Religion made up of pomp and shew,
wherein God and his Saints were offered to be bribed, in
which they knew the rares of sin and the price of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
found us but too well prepared to become Profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
to it. Our sins have been also so visible and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
that they have made our Communion grow
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54302:11"/>
loathsom to many well disposed but weak minds, and
have tempted them to separate from our Assemblies,
when they saw such mixed multitudes among us: so
that they have run into Sects, that had the appearance of
greater gravity and strictness.</p>
               <p>3. And we are no less faulty in the third particular,
of contending out of measure, for things that are no
way essential to salvation. Things of so indifferent
a nature, that succeeding ages will wonder how men
could manage such long and eager contests about them.
We have fallen into passions concerning them, these
have grown up to a hatred, which hath broken out into
most violent and dismal effects, and seems now setled
into a formed rent and separation. Where is that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
healing and compassionate temper which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Christians, and reformed Christians? especially
when they are as it were strugling for life. Oh shall
nothing make us wiser? shall neither the advantages
our enemies take, nor the prejudices Religion suffers
by our contests, dispose us to bear with one anothers
infirmities, and to manage our differences, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
entirely bury them, with a more Christian and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
temper! There have been extreams on all hands:
neither side can free themselves from being too much
exasperated: The resentment for what has been done in
the several turns of affairs, has gone too far with us.
It is not so much our differences that divide us one from
another, as our alienation one from another which wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
our differences, and makes them appear to be
greater than indeed they are. So on all accounts we
must acknowledge, that when our works are weighed
in those just ballances they cannot be found perfect
before God. I hope we are all in some measure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54302:11"/>
of this: The thing is alas too visible. What is
then to be done? but to set about a real Reformation
with all possible seriousness and sincerity. And in or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
to this and to direct us in it, here is a rule and
standard given, by which we may govern our selves in
the means or methods to it: and that is the second thing
I proposed to speak to.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="point">
               <p>2. The Rule by which are to examine our selves, and
by which God will judge us, is the Doctrine which the
Churches received from the Apostles, <hi>Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how thou hast received and heard.</hi> Here is a certain
fixed rule; we are neither left to the heats of our
own fancies, nor to the uncertainties of Tradation, nor
to the impostures of such as may pretend to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Consciences: but are conducted by a more
certain thread. It is true, in the Apostles days this
Doctrine was at first preached and received, before it
was written. There was no great danger as long as they
lived, who might be appealed to in any difficulty which
could arise concerning their Doctrine: so it is a vain
way of arguing to infer from the mention of <hi>Tradition</hi>
in the Epistles, that we after so many ages are past,
and so many impostures have been discovered, should
be obliged to receive what may be obtruded on us as
Apostolical Tradition. Tradition while the Apostles
lived, was what the Scripture is now: And indeed so
uncertain a conveyance is Oral Tradition, that in the
very Apostles days or soon after, when there were no
advantages to be made by such cheats, and so there was
less to tempt men to them, yet many false Gospels
were given out, and false Doctrines were infused into
some weaker people. We know how unfaithful a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor
Tradition was of Natural Religion among the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54302:12"/>
Gentile Nations: The Gospel tells us how the Jews do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the Traditions of their Fathers, and by them
<hi>made the Commandments of God of none effect.</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of Tradition where it was not put in writing,
appeared within an age after the Apostles, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
concerning the observation of <hi>Easter:</hi> both sides
vouching the practice of the Apostles, and that even
while some were alive, that had seen them and had
lived with them. But after that wealth and greatness
had corrupted the Church, and this holy Religion was
made an Engine to advance the ambition and interests
of designing men, then what a swarm of supposititious
writings appeared every where to support some opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or designs; many of these were discovered and
branded, but others passed without a censure; so that
it was long before Criticks in this and the former age,
could find out what was genuine, and what was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
               <p>The most advantagious Imposture was coined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the <hi>9th</hi> Century; a whole Volume of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiles
of the first Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Apostles days
downwards, was pretended to be found; in which they
were represented as governing the Church in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages, with the same <hi>fulness of power,</hi> that their
Successors have pretended to since. This was rejected
by some in that age, but kindly entertained by those
that were more concerned for their own greatness than
for Truth: and by the Presidents in these Epistles they
justified what they did, till their Tyranie came to be
generally submitted to: And now when these Epistles
are found to be spurious, they have been forced to throw
them away; but stand upon possession and prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
tho it began at first upon this and some other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54302:12"/>
not unlike it, such as the Donation of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
and many more.</p>
               <p>They well know that their cause cannot be defended
if the Scriptures are appealed to: these in many points
are directly against them, as in the worship of Images,
and Angels, the praying in an unknown tongue, and
the denying the Chalice, or saying that Christs body
which is now in Heaven, is in the Sacrament: in other
things they are silent, such as the Popes Power, the
Infallibility of a General Council, the praying to Saints,
the redeeming souls out of Purgatory, Indulgences,
Pilgrimages, with a thousand other additions, by whi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
they have vitiated the purity of that holy Doctrine,
which the Apostles delivered to the world. This is
the foundation of our whole Religion, that we believe
all that the Apostles delivered to the Churches, and no
more: so we stand to this appeal in my Text, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
therefore that thou hast received and heard.</hi> It were
easie to instance it in many particulars, and to shew
you how at first ignorance and superstition let in some
Customs; and perhaps those who introduced them at
first, being innocent, but weak men, meant well in it:
so to draw the Heathens off from their Idolatry, they
directed them to call on Saints, instead of the gods
they had formerly worshipped: and to perswade peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to receive the Sacrament with great devotion, they
strained their eloquence and invention to recommend
the value of it in high figures. Many more might be
named, but these may suffice: afterwards when the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire was over-run by the incursions of the
Barbarous Nations, and Civility, Religion, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
were almost driven out of the world; then some
crafty and aspiring Priests came to graft upon the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54302:13"/>
Customs of the former times, new Opinions, and still
to add new Rites, till in the end they swelled up to
what they are now at in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. When
these Opinions were first broached, Visions and Dreams
were given out to support them; and if these lesser
frauds did not prevail, pretended Miracles were not
wanting to give them credit, till they were received;
and being once received, they were enrolled among the
Traditions of the Church, and so were no more to be
contested or denied: if any presumed to do it, it was
at his peril. These Miracles were coined so, as to fit
not only the Doctrine it self, but the way of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; and as new ways of explaining were fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
new Miracles suitable to these new expositions were
at hand.</p>
               <p>When the Doctrine of the Corporal presence was
first received in the <hi>9th</hi> Century, it was believed that
the whole Loaf was an entire body of Christ, so that
he was sliced in pieces and eat up in gobbets; and so
they continued to understand it near 300 years. Then
the Miracles to prove it were adjusted to that conceit;
it was given out that it did sometimes bleed, and pieces
of it were said to be converted to pieces of slesh: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the School Divinity came to be in request, this
way was not found so defensible, nor so decent: and
then it was said, Christ was in every Crumb of the Host;
so that upon the breaking it, an entire Christ flew off
from the rest, which yet remained still as entire as it
was, notwithstanding that diminution: and then as
they blessed Wasers instead of a Loaf, so the former Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were not so much talked of, though some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Priests that did not consider that these were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Doctrine of their Church, did in some
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54302:13"/>
places continue to act the former cheats; but new ones
were more generally invented, and Christ was said to
appear all in rayes, over or upon the Host: so well practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
were they in the arts of jugling, as to make their
tricks always agree with their Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>In opposition to all these false Doctrines and lying
wonders, the Reformed have from the first beginning
of the Reformation set up the whole strength of their
cause, upon this single Plea, of receiving nothing as a
part of their faith, but what could be found in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apostles; that so all agreeing on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Umpire their differences might be more easily
composed. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> knows well what the
issue must be, if this is granted, and so have put the
strength of their whole cause upon the authority of the
Church, that is themselves, and the certainty of Oral
Tradition, handed down by such men as themselves
are: Whether the one or the other seems to be the more
ingenuous Principle, the more certain method of Trial,
and the less liable to deceit, I leave it to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of all wise and good men.</p>
               <p>But as we ought to <hi>remember what we have thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and heard,</hi> so the end of this is not barely for specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
to inform us about some notions, or to furnish
us with arguments and discourse: these things are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary for a further end; that our minds being
well informed, and our belief rightly directed, we may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
our lives according to what the holy Apostles have
left to us. It is because <hi>their works were not perfect,</hi> that
they are here charged <hi>therefore to remember the doctrine
that they had received:</hi> What shall our knowledge, our
Orthodoxie, and soundness of opinion avail us, if we
do not reduce it to practise? unless it be to heighten
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54302:14"/>
our condemnation, and to intitle us to more stripes
and severer judgements. Here we will find our duties
set before us, and from thence we will both know
what our sins have been, and how to turn from them.
Oh that there were such a heart in us! But as we
ought to remember and improve the Doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Church by the Apostles, so we ought to
keep it carefully.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="point">
               <p>3. And this is the third particular I am to speak to:
All who have received this Doctrine, ought to preserve
it, and to conveigh down that sacred trust commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, to the succeeding generations. This is
to <hi>Hold-fast,</hi> what we have received and heard. The
meaning of this, considering the circumstances the
Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> was in, is either that they should
preserve it pure, and keep it as it was delivered to
them, or that if persecutions should arise for the
Faith, they should not depart from it for the love of
this present world, or make shipwrack of it; but should
<hi>hold fast the profession of their Faith without wavering.</hi>
There were many Tares sown then in the field of the
Church, many of the followers of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were
corrupting the Christian Religion; it was necessary on
that account to look carefully to that sacred <hi>Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
that was put in their hands. There was also a
black Cloud gathering, a persecution was coming on
the Church: One storm had passed, that had been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Nero,</hi> and they were now in another set on by
<hi>Domitian;</hi> therefore it was necessary to put them on
their guard, and to charge them to keep or <hi>Hold fast</hi>
the Doctrine delivered to them. This was all that
they could be obliged to; but in our circumstances
there is somewhat else imported in this Holding fast,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54302:14"/>
that we ought not only to keep our Religion pure,
and to be ready to suffer for it, if we are called to it,
but since we enjoy the protection and security of law
and lawful authority, we ought to hold that fast, and
deliver it down to our posterity, as we have received
it from our Fathers.</p>
               <p>We are to keep it pure from the corruptions that
may be introduced to vitiate the simplicity of our holy
Religion: we know the Enemies of the Church sleep
not, tho the Watchmen sleep too often. While we
have Adversaries that are so restless and industrious,
that make up in their arts of insinuation and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
diligence, what is wanting in the justice and
goodness of their Cause; on these our eyes ought to
be much set. They have corrupted Religion where
ever their arts have been succesful; and have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to overthrow all Governments, and broken the
peace of all Societies that have been so much on their
guard, as to look carefully to them. For that same
principle that makes them burn and destroy where
they have power, makes them also incessantly Plot
and practise where they have it not. Severities in
matters of Religion are indeed contrary to that huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that is imprinted in our nature, and to those
rules that are often repeated in Scripture. But if any
Sect of Religion continues to breed frequent and almost
uninterrupted disturbances in any Government, it is not
enough to punish those that are found in the fault,
but if it is evident, as it is certainly in this case, that
their Doctrine sets them on to, and will bear them
through in such conspiracies, it seems not possible to
secure the peace of a Kingdom so much infested by
them, as we have been now 120 years, but by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it entirely out of their hands, and putting an utter
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54302:15"/>
end to the distractions we have been in, and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
we have smarted under, by their means. They
will live much better among their own friends, beyond
Sea, where they may freely exercise their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and I am sure we will be much the happier and
quieter for being freed from the trouble they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us. And thus we are to <hi>Hold fast</hi> the Apostles
Doctrine and to keep our selves from the infection of
those who have corrupted it.</p>
               <p>But if this cannot be done, and if God either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us for our former sins, or to raise again the true
spirit of the reformed Religion, to purifie us from our
dross, and to melt us into one lump, and close up those
breaches which we have been rather widening than
healing, will deliver us up into the hands of our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless
and implacable Enemies; then, as we know what
we are to look for, so we ought to prepare our selves
for it, and resolve to be <hi>faithful to the death.</hi> We know
what wil be, not only by what has been, but by what
is the Doctrine of that Church, of extirpating Hereticks,
decreed in their General Councils: and what they
have met with of late among us, has so whetted their
Spirits against us, that if ever we are in their power,
the cruelty of their Religion, being quickned by their
private resentments, we can look for nothing, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be forced to worship a piece of bread, and to
renounce that Faith which we now profess, or to seal it
with our blood, and that perhaps in the cruellest manner.
I know it is not easie for flesh and blood so much as to
think on these things without horror; But Oh, what will
it be to suffer them! It will not be our living peaceably,
nor our keeping our belief to our selves that will secure
us: we must in all things comply, nay, and if we should
dissemble and comply, we must by an over-acting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54302:15"/>
zeal procure our pardon for what is past, and beget a
confidence in them for the future. I shall on this head
represent a little of what you may expect, by menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
some few passages of Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> never to be
forgotten, bloody Reign; that are not so generally known.
At first She promised the continuance of the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion, soon after She procured it to be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changed, even while the Laws were yet in force
for it; but then it was said, none should be forced in
their Consciences if they would live peaceably: but
when the change was fully brought about, then accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
to the Natural Genius of that Religion, an open
and undistinguish't persecution was resolved on. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were then sent from the Council Table, to the
Justices of Peace, to have spies in every Parish to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
every mans deportment: a bare suspition was
ground enough to proceed upon. Persons being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
upon suspition, were imprisoned: and, without
any proofs or witnesses brought against them, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were offered to them, to which if they did not in
all things answer according to the Doctrine of that
Church, and if they could not be induced to change
their perswasions, they were condemned to the fire,
tho they had neither said nor acted any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the established Religion. And it went yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Justices of peace having been often writ to,
grew more and more backward to these cruelties, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they saw them burn poor people single at
first, then by pairs, then six, eight, ten, and thirteen, were
burnt in one fire: neither the blind nor lame, aged men,
nor women near their time, no nor new-born Infants
escaping the rage of these Butchers: Then to make
way for the Courts of Inquisition, a Commission was
given to a selected number, of whom three was a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54302:16"/>
to make enquiry over all <hi>England,</hi> not only of
such as were suspect of Heresie; but of all that did not
express their zeal for the Popish Religion, in taking
holy Bread, or holy Water, or going in Processions;
which tho they are not things to which all in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
are obliged, yet these discovering the affections
and inclinations of the people, such as did them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were to be proceeded against upon these suspitions.
At first such as were burnt had their lives offered to
them at the Stake if they would recant, but as the
persecution went on they became more barbarous, so
that it was not enough for one to recant then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a
Sheriff was cast in, Prison and fined, for staying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of one who did it: It was said if he recanted
sincerely, it was better to burn him, than to leave him
to the temptations of becoming a relapse; and if he did
it not sincerely, it was pity to spare him. So which way
soever it was, dye and burn he must. And that none
might escape out of their Toils, care was taken to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all the Ports that none might fly beyond Sea.</p>
               <p>Here is a sad prospect before us; but in what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
are we to bear it? we have no reason to doubt
but great numbers will turn with the tide, as they did
then. Many who seem now to be hot and zealous for
the Protestant Religion, will then, perhaps, be as busie
to discover and accuse those whom they now censure,
not only rashly but maliciously. Men of ill Lives and
defiled Consciences, want that principle which must
strengthen them to bear the Cross, and make it easie
and comfortable to them. It is quite another thing to
own this Faith in our present circumstances, from what
it will be to adhere to it then.</p>
               <p>It is not yet come that, and God of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
preserve us from it. We are taught by him that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54302:16"/>
knew our nature well, <hi>to watch and pray that we enter
not into temptation, for though the Spirit,</hi> or our subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
powers may be <hi>forward and willing, yet the flesh is
weak.</hi> We are therefore to do all that is in our power,
and is consistent with that Religion which we prosess,
to prevent this. You of this Honourable Assembly are
now entrusted with the keeping this Doctrine, as it
is a part of the Law of the Land; the people have
trusted you with all that is dear to them; and it is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
you will acquit your selves as worthy of so great
a confidence. On this I shall enlarge no further, but
apply to you the message which <hi>Mordecai</hi> sent to
Queen <hi>Esther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esth. 4. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> when her people were marked out for
destruction: <hi>Think not that you shall escape more than
all the rest: for if you altogether hold your peace at this
time, there may come enlargement and deliverance to us
from another hand; but you and your houses shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:
and who knows if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are come</hi> into this trust
<hi>for such a time as this is.</hi> If any shall, either on the
one hand, give up this holy Religion, and those means
which are most effectual to secure it, for private or
base ends of their own; or on the other hand shall, to
gratifie their revenge, or to advance any ill design, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to drive things to confusion, so that we become
a prey to a formidable Neighbour, where Popery,
with it concomitant Tyrannie, shall subdue us at once;
These are the betrayers of their Religion and their
Country, and do entitle themselves to the heaviest cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the whole Book of God.</p>
               <p>But the Nation hopes better things from you: and,
and as we pray for it, so are we confident they shall
not be ashamed or disappointed of their hope. Your
maintaining the Laws, or providing such new ones
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54302:17"/>
as our present circumstances call for, for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our Religion, is not all that you are to do
for it; there are many other things besides, that
come under your care, which are also necessary, that
we may <hi>Hold fast</hi> this our profession. I shall name
two particulars. The one is, that there are so many
Parishes in this great and rich Kingdom, in which
there is so little provision left for those that labour in
the work of the Gospel, that it is not possible, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
speaking, to find fit and able Pastors to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
such a charge upon so mean an encouragement:
and many of these fall to be the greatest and the most
populous Parishes in their Neighbourhood: <hi>The labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
is worthy of his hire:</hi> but in many of these the hire
will not amount to the meanest and most frugal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
that can consist with the decency of that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
If weak or scandalous men are cast on such
places, so that the people are neither instructed nor
edified by their labours, but are rather scandalised by
them; it is worth your serious consideration to find
out effectual means for redressing so great an evil, by
which so many souls are lost, and such a door has
been opened to seducers and false teachers among us.
The other is, that we will endeavour to secure the
Reformed Religion among us, by doing all we can to
maintain the outworks of it, I mean the foreign
Churches, some of whom are now in a most deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and sinking condition. The methods that <hi>Julian</hi>
the Apostate used to extirpate Christianity, not by
the quick and sharp waies of persecution, but by
flower steps; being now taken to root out that which
main force could not do. To these we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
our compassion and assistance, as we would expect
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54302:17"/>
the like from others when we may be brought to drink
of the like bitter Cup, which how near it may be to
us, God only knows. But all these means will prove
ineffectual if we have not God on our side; except he
watch over us, and build up our ruines,<note place="margin">Psal 127. 1.</note> you that build
and we that watch shall labour in vain. This leads
me to the fourth particular, which is,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="point">
               <p>4. That the chief use we ought to make of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is to reform our hearts and lives, to repent of,
and forsake our sins. <hi>Repent.</hi> I shall not here run out
into a large discourse of this, but sum up in short
what is comprehended under it. The word imports
more than a bare sorrowing for our sins, or an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
change of our life, and does chiefly signifie the
inward change and reformation of our minds: when
we put on a new disposition, come under new prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and are inwardly turned in the value and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
we have of things, and in our practical judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and formed resolutions. Repentance is, when a
man having another sense of God, and true goodness,
another apprehension of vice and sin, other thoughts of
a future state, other impressions of the love of Christ,
and the truth of the Gospel; and all these things
growing into formed principles in him, his mind is
turned to such a detestation of his former course of
life, as engages him not only to forsake it, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon a quite different Course; so that he feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
inwardly regenerated and changed. Oh have I
not been discribing a thing little understood! Some
sorrow for sin, which is scarce possible for the worst
men to avoid, is all the notion too many have of it.
Others fancy to compound for their sins, with some
austerities, by an outward pageantry, or compounding
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54302:18"/>
with God or his Sains if they can, and doing it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where they can, with the Priest: believing that his
absolving them is of some other vertue, than a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them of what they may certainly expect if
they are sincere in their repentance. But if these things
come short of a true repentance, what is to be s<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id
of those who have not so much: who have no remorse
for their sins, but live on securely in them, or do
worse, <hi>Glory in their shame.</hi> These are far enough
from having repented, who are growing up daily to a
higher pitch in their impieties. You have expressed
your sense of the necessity of this duty, by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
about it: but if it goes no further than the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of a days vacation from business, or abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from meat, and the hearing some Sermons, or
joining in prayers; this can have no other effect but
to raise our guilt higher, by our pretending to draw near
to God with our Lips, when our hearts are far from
him. Our sins are drawing heavy judgements on us:
our repentance only can prevent them; not such a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
performance as I have described, but a sincere and
entire turn to God. We ought to be humbling our selves
in secret, every one for those sins by which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him, and have been adding to that great heap of
guilt, by which we have been too universally treasuring
up wrath against the day of wrath. We are apt enough
to censure the vices and failings of others, especially if on
other accounts we are displeased with them, and if we our
selves are not visibly faulty in the same kind: but there
are other sins besides Uncleanness and Intemperance,
which may involve us in the common ruine that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
us. And if we know our selves guilty, even of that
which we censure in others, we by judging them do
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54302:18"/>
condemn our selves. Let us recollect our Thoughts,
and ask our selves, What have we done? Have we
been adding Sin to Sin, and perhaps Hypocrisy, or a
counterfeit Zeal to all the rest? We are under the
Eye of the All-seeing God, to whom all things lie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and open, <hi>Darkness before him shineth as the Day;
the Darkness and the Light are both alike to him.</hi> Let
us not deceive our selves; God is neither to be
mocked, nor bribed. It is only our sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
that can again restore us to his Favour; and if
the Sins of the Nation are not grown to that height,
that, as is said of the Sin of <hi>Manasseh, God will not
pardon it; so that though</hi> Noah, Job, <hi>and</hi> Daniel,
<hi>were among us, they could only deliver their own Souls;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 24. 4. Ezek. 14. 14.</note>
We may hope, that upon our Repentance, either
that Cloud of Wrath now over our Heads, may be
broken and dissipated, or, at least, that our Peace
and Tranquility may be so lengthned out, that <hi>the
Evil shall not come in our days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we Repent truly, we will lay down our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities
and Quarrellings about lesser Matters; and
finding how guilty we are all in the presence of
God, we will be more gentle in the Judgments we
make of others, and more severe in the Censures we
pass upon our selves. We will change the course
and frame of our Lives, not only in such instances
as are more scandalous, and so may be a prejudice to
us in our other Designs, but will enter upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Method and Way of <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e, such as becomes
Christians. If this is not done, all that we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
will not be effectual to preserve us. If God is
still offended with us, he will not want Instruments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54302:19"/>
for our punishment, though we had not a Papist in
<hi>England,</hi> nor an Enemy in all the World.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, If we sincerely turn to
God, as we know in general he is gracious and
merciful, slow to Anger, and full of Compassion;
so we have, in particular, all the Assurances that
either his Promises, or the Experience of former
Times can give us, that He <hi>will receive us graciously;
that he will take away all our Iniquities, and heal all our
back-slidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Personal Repentance, and the mourning for the
Sins of others, are Duties incumbent on all: To
these you stand obliged in your private Capacities;
But as you make up this Honourable Assembly, there
is a further Repentance incumbent on you. You, who
represent the Nation, ought, in the Name of the
whole Body of the People, to think on such Laws
as are necessary for the restraint of Vice. It is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Impiety of the Nation has made way for
Popery; and though that were out of doors, yet if
the other continues still, it will prepare us to open
Atheism and Irreligion. God cannot be at Peace
with us, while our Adulteries are so many, while
Drunkenness is so common, while Religion is so
much scorned, even by those who seem zealous for
it; while Cursing and Swearing are the usual Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
while Profanity, scurrilous Talk, and many
other things which ought not to be named among
Christians, are so openly and bare-facedly practised
among us. By your endeavours to redress these, and
at least, to make People ashamed of them, if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54302:19"/>
they do not forsake them; You shall also, in your
publick Capacity, shew the reality of your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
both to God and the World. It is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
thing for all People, who have some one
great thing in their Eye, to look only at that, and
to over-look many other Things, if they do not
immediately belong to that of which they are chiefly
affraid. Popery is now in your Eye, and it ought
to be so, till you have to purpose secured us from
the danger of it: But at the same time you ought to
look further, to the Ground of God's displeasure
against us, to that which has brought us into all this
Danger, and must certainly bring ruin on us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
if effectual Remedies are not found out
in time. Our Irreligion and Impiety has made many
to be little concerned in these Matters; and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
about some inconsiderable Things, has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Thoughts and Endeavours of others, to
the securing of particular Interests, or making of
Parties.</p>
               <p>To these, if you provide effectual Remedies, both
for reforming and uniting us, then you shall be had
in perpetual remembrance, as the Repairers of our
Breaches, and the Restorers of our Ruins: so that
all shall bless you, and in their wishes, for a happy
Parliament, shall name you with Honour, and wish
it may be such a one as this has been.</p>
               <p>We have all the reason in the World to conclude,
that this Nation is dear unto God; and we are sure,
the Holy Religion we profess, is from him; why
should we then despond, and not still hope in that
God, who has hitherto given us such abundant Proofs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54302:20"/>
of his care of us, and of his regard to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
among us. When we remember by what steps
and methods it was brought in and established here;
How short the Storm was in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign,
and that she died without Issue, which might have
brought us both under Popery, and made us a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to a Forreign Tyranny; when we reflect on
the long and glorious Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> on
the happy disappointment of the <hi>Armada,</hi> believed
and called <hi>Invincible;</hi> the discovery of the <hi>Gun-powder
Plot,</hi> with the later Blessings yet in our Eyes,
we have from all these much reason to conclude, that
we are in a special manner favoured of God. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can break off this course of Mercies with
which he has followed us, but our obstinate persisting
in our sins: If we resolve on this, there is nothing
before us, but a fearful prospect of Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.
And this leads me to the fifth and last
Particular, of which I proposed to speak, which

               <p>5. That such as do not make this use of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as to be thereby led to Repentance, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to look for sudden and severe Judgments. <hi>If
therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come upon thee as a
Thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come
upon thee.</hi> God's Judgments are a great depth, and
the Methods of them are unaccountable: Some
wicked Nations, and Impious and Tyrannical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
have flourished long: Triumph and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
have seemed entailed on them. The <hi>Assyrian</hi>
of old, and the Turkish Empire at present, are great
Instances of this. These are Portions of the World,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54302:20"/>
which God for their other sins gave in prey to savage
Masters; whose Prosperity made them the fitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of his Justice. But it is observable, that
those Nations whom he has more specially favoured,
are more signally punished when their Sins have been
so notorious, that it seemed necessary to give publick
Evidences of the impartiality of God's governing
the World. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families
of the Earth; therefore will I punish you for your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 3. 2.</note>
The whole History of the <hi>Jews,</hi> till their
final, and almost total destruction, is one continued
Instance of this. The Roman Empire, when it
turned Christian, but was not much reformed by
that Light, was given up to be wasted by swarms of
<hi>Goths, Vandals, Huns,</hi> and other Northern Nations, who
for near two Ages together, laid it so wast, that what
by the Destruction they made, and the Famine that
followed upon that, which brought after it unheard of
Plagues, the History of that Time contains a Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the most terrible Miseries that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
The <hi>African</hi> Churches, that were the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
of any then in the World, yet having fallen
from their first Love, and being rent in pieces by
Schism, and becoming generally corrupt in their
Manners, notwithstanding the excellent Bishops that
were among them; St. <hi>Austin</hi> in particular, who
was the last of those that were sent to warn them of
the Jugments they might look for; which he did
faithfully, but nothing prevailing, they were first
destroyed by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and then so totally by the
<hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> that the Name of Christ is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on no more in them, except it be in their Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54302:21"/>
by those miserable Captives that are kept in
such slavery among them, that it should tear every
Christian's Heart to think on it. The Eastern Empire
was first by the <hi>Goths,</hi> then by the <hi>Huns</hi> and the
<hi>Avares,</hi> afterwards by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and finally by
the <hi>Turks,</hi> so wasted, that the small Remainders of
Christianity among them, serve only as the Ruins of
some great Fabrick, to shew what once it was. The
City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> once among the noblest of the
World, in which that glorious Name of Christian
first began, was by a frequent return of most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Earth-quakes, and devouring Fires, so ruinated,
that it is now but a small inconsiderable Village.
<hi>Sardis,</hi> in my Text, is no better: These Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
here writ to, are now under the slavery of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans,</hi>
and indeed retain little but the Name of
Christian; some of them are so entirely destroyed,
that it is not so much as certain where they stood.
When we hear of these things, we ought wisely to
consider of these Works of the Lord: Why should
we hope to escape, if we are as guilty as they were?
But to turn your Eyes to what is nearer you; After
the Gospel was planted here in <hi>Britain,</hi> while we were
under the Roman Yoke, and was watered with the
Blood of many Martyrs that suffered under the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Persecutions; The <hi>Britons</hi> being blest with
Peace and Prosperity, did soon forget God, and fell
from their first Love. Then what Judgments fell
on them? The Northern People being more War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
broke into the Southern Parts, who were soft
and luxurious: These hiring the <hi>Saxons</hi> to their Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
were thereby brought under a much more
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54302:21"/>
cruel Bondage; and those either rooted out the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, or drove it up into the mountainous
parts of this Kingdom. What the Sins, both of the
Clergy and Laity were, is set out by <hi>Gildas,</hi> that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not long after that Time, and they resemble our
present Condition so much, that it gives us cause to
fear the parallel shall be as equal in our Judgments,
as it is now in our Sins. When the Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
first in <hi>England,</hi> many run into it, rather out of
hatred to the Clergy, and love to their Lands, than
out of Zeal for the Truth. So that the Bishops in
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time, did, by some Letters which
they sent about among their Clergy, call upon them
to warn the People of the heavy Judgments of God,
ready to fall upon them: but they went on in their
Sins with a high hand, so that the Land was full of
Oppression and Injustice, Adultery and Sensuality:
God visited them for these things, and took away that
blessed young King, and left them in the hands of a
superstitious and bloody Princess, who fearing her
own Power was not strong enough to alter the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Religion, married the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
by a vast Treasure which he brought over into
<hi>England,</hi> corrupted the great Men, and the Publick
Councils of the Kingdom; so that all that had been
building up in twenty five years, was overthrown in
a little more than one, by Parliaments, over whom
Spanish Gold had greater influence, than the Sense of
their Trust, or their Regard to God and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Shall I put you in mind of the terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, that broke out lately on our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Island, where, the Barbarity of the Natives
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54302:22"/>
being sharpened by the Cruelty of their Religion,
and the Practices of their Priests, a Massacre and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
did almost wholly consume them? How
near were we brought to utter Ruin, and how long
were we ruled by the Sword, during the late
Wars?</p>
               <p>Are all these things forgotten? Or do we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them, only to furnish out Discourse with them?
We at present are all sufficiently apprehensive of our
ill condition, we see the great danger we are in of
Popery's subduing us; we see an overgrown Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ready to break in upon us, or at least, upon that
which is but a step from us. There is a Fermentation
among our selves, so high, that it is like to involve us
in great Confusions: The things that belong to our
Peace seem to be hid from our eyes. Is not all
this of the Lord? Most of the Evils we either feel
or apprehend, are the natural effects of our Sins and
Vices, as well as of the Judgment of God punishing
us for them. The Vices too common amongst us,
have corrupted the Minds, and darkned the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
of many, and are like to become their own
Punishments.</p>
               <p>All these things are but the beginnings of Sorrows,
which seem to be coming on us. What do we then?
Do we sit crossing our hands, accusing one another,
or it may be, faintly condemning our selves? We
perhaps imagine, if we were rid of Popery all would
be well; it is certain, we should be much better
than we are: but if the Root of our Distemper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
the carrying off one Symptom will but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the way to another. God can either plague us,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54302:22"/>
by delivering us up to a forreign Enemy, who shall
have no pity on us; or can again send his Arrows
among us, a Pestilence to sweep away our Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
or a Fire to burn down our Cities. He can
leave us to bite and devour another, till we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
one of another. And if he come upon us,
what can we do to withstand his mighty Arm? Can
we restrain his Thunders, or be Proof against his
Arrows? Oh how weak are all Devices, when God
blasts them! If our Distractions continue, we are like
the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> so divided, that nothing but
utter and irremediable Confusion is like to be the end
of them, if we once fall in pieces.</p>
               <p>Well, we are yet in Peace, we rise up and lie down
in quiet; how long it will be so, we cannot tell:
We seem to be near great Convulsions; we have no
reason to desire them. We are now full of Wealth,
our Trade is free, and much spread; we have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
both at home and abroad, of many things,
that might yet make us a great and happy People,
but want the Power to improve it. What shall the
end of these things be? It were too great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in me, nor proper for this place or occasion,
to enter into Particulars; but one thing I may adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on, which is, If you of this Honourable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
who have now bespoke the Prayers of the
whole Nation upon your Consultations, would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
address your selves to God, and set off such
Hours as your Business can admit of, for earnest
Prayer to God, to direct and bless your Councils,
and to bend all your Hearts, to that which is both
most for his Glory, the Establishment of his true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54302:23"/>
and the Security, Peace, and Happiness of the
Kingdom; we might justly hope, <hi>that God, even our
God, would give his Blessing</hi> to Endeavours so begun,
and so managed: Then should the Light of the
Gospel, which is <hi>our Glory, still dwell in our Land:
Mercy and Truth should meet together, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Peace should kiss one another: Then should
the Lord give us that which is good, and our Land
should yeeld her encrease. O that there were such an
Heart in us, that we might fear him, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
always; that so it may be well with us, and
our Children after us, for ever.</hi>
