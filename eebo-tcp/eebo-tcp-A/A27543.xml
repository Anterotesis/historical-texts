            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>INtereſt is a word of ſeveral definitions, but that which in Creatures, having reaſon, or ſenſe, is preſervation and propagation, is that in a State, which I mean by Interest: and this is either Domeſtick looking inward, as relating to the particular frame and kind of government, or foreign looking outwards, as regarding ſuch alterations abroad, as may be of good or evil conſequence to a State; and ſuch counſels, deliberations, or actions, as may improve good, or prevent evill, are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Intereſt of a Nation, and the contrary againſt it. And taking the words thus, the proſperity, or adverſity, if not the life and death of a State, is bound up in the obſerving or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of it's Intereſt. For as no Countrey was ever unhappy, that followed it, ſo none ever proſpered (except by chance) that forſook or miſsed it; and conſequently, it is matter of the greatest concernment to a Prince, to ſtudie, and make himſelf Maſter of it, that in keeping his Counſellors in awe, by his own knowledge and experience, in matters of State, he may have his affairs the better and faithfuller proſecuted; but in ſearching for his Intereſt, he ought to be exceeding carefull, of not being miſled by former examples, which are to Politicians, as of old, the Stars to Navigators, rightly underſtood, the beſt guide, and miſtaken, the moſt dangerous. For Intereſt in all Countreys is changeable, that which was in one Age, not being alwayes the ſame in the next, as the Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> do ſufficiently evince. For <hi>Spain</hi> being by corruption in Counſellors, and Miniſters of State, fraud, oppreſſion, and couſenage in Officers, and Servants,
<pb facs="tcp:59429:3"/>
with perſecution in the Church, and ſeverity in government, cauſing ſeveral revolts, brought at this time low, and into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition, the Intereſt of the <hi>European</hi> Princes, is changed from that of being againſt the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and for <hi>France,</hi> to that of being for it, and against <hi>France,</hi> the latter being at preſent, under more than ſuſpition, that having now got the advantage of <hi>Spain,</hi> they intend to improve it to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarchy, as <hi>Spain</hi> formerly deſigned. But as a Prince ought to be studious in diſcovering of his Intereſt, ſo to be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in examining the Integrity of Counſels given him, leſt by corrupt Counſellors, he ſhould be put (for private ends) upon deſigns prejudicial, if not contrary and deſtructive to the Intereſt of his Countrey. And becauſe the wiſdome, or defects of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, appears much in their choice of Counſellors and Miniſters of State (who under them, are the managers of their Intereſts) there ought to be in the Election of ſuch, a ſpecial eye to their principles, as well as abilities, avoiding with care, all avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious perſons, as men, who for advantage, will upon all occaſions, forſake, and deſert fidelity, the chief ingredient of a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor. For when men have parts without honeſty, they are but the greater instruments of miſchief; and we find that little more than common parts aſſiſted with integrity, induſtry, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, have done, and do the greateſt things in the world: Nay, that ordinary parts, with ſuch qualifications, do more, than the ſublimest without them, the art of Government, not being ſo miſterious, as State Monopoliſts would make it, honeſty (as King <hi>James</hi> uſed to ſay) being the beſt policy, and ſurely, that is the best Government, that provides moſt for the imployment of the honeſteſt men. For as no State can flouriſh, where their Intereſt is not purſued, ſo publick Intereſt will never be the rule, where Counſellors are not faithful, and when publick principles do not govern men, private Intereſt will, and render their Countrey as Merchandize for the higheſt Chapman; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, the Notion that Intereſt cannot lye is true, yet it is not (in Subjects) ſingly to be truſted. For ſince private, worldly, and carnal Intereſt (which in perſons wanting honeſty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes mercenary) may be changed by the bribing bounty of other
<pb facs="tcp:59429:3"/>
Princes, or States; it is a great error in thoſe, underſtanding their Intereſt, to rely upon their Counſellors, or Officers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examining, whether their counſels and actions are purſuant of, and conſonant to their Intereſts; or yet in great truſts, to preſume upon any other qualifications in Counſellors, and Civil and Military Miniſters, then either truly religious, or truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable moral principles, which cannot change, as private ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Intereſt, not bottomed upon the one, or the other principle, will ſurely do according to the greatneſs of temptations: and therefore, as upon good or bad Counſellors, and Miniſters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the happineſs or infelicity of a Prince, and State, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> affirming, that a Commonwealth is more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure where the Prince is not good, then where the Miniſters are bad, ſo they cannot ſhew more wiſdome, then inſignally reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and incouraging the former, and exemplarily puniſhing the latter. I know that Counſels are not alwayes to be judged of, according to ſucceſs, it being poſſible, that honeſt and well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded counſels may miſcarry, and to puniſh men in ſuch caſes, were to diſcourage the ableſt and moſt virtuous Perſons from ſerving of their Prince or State; but ſometimes deſigns are written in ſuch large characters of ſelfiſhneſs and corruption, the foundations of them being laid in lyes, and forgeries, as is legible to every impartial eye; and when ſuch appears, by a true diſcovery upon inquiry, the Criminals ought to be made examples to poſterity.</p>
            <p>Formerly the affairs of Chriſtendom were ſuppoſed to be chiefly ſwayed by the two great powers of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (wherein <hi>Spain</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) and <hi>France:</hi> from whom other Princes and States derived their Peace and Warr, according to the ſeveral parties they adhered unto. But now the puiſſance of the former being ſo much abated, that it deſerves no rank above its Neighbours, <hi>France</hi> of the two, remains the only formidable Potentate, of whoſe greatneſs, all Princes and States are as much concerned to be jealous, as formerly they were of that of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> For, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>French</hi> King, in relation to <hi>France,</hi> ſtored with good Officers, Men, Money, and Ammunition, to his ſeveral augmentations gained from all his Neighbours, by conqueſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or purchaſe (as from <hi>Spain, Italy, Germany, Lorrain,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59429:4"/>
and the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands)</hi> giving him free paſsage into their ſeveral Dominions, and to his preſent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſtrength, increaſed lately by an unhappy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <note n="*" place="margin">The late <hi>Dutch</hi> War.</note> he is accommodated for any deſign, his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition ſhall prompt him to, or at leaſt, ſhould the ſickly and weak young King of <hi>Spain</hi> dye childleſs, to diſpute uncontroulably, his right to all the Countreys in <hi>Europe</hi> belonging to that Crown, as alſo to contend for the Imperial dignity, ſhould be ſurvive the preſent Emperor, if he ſtayes till then: and if his aims may be gueſsed at by the writings of his Subjects, which are commonly the the tranſcripts or preſages of their Princes ſence and mind, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all the Lands, lying on his ſide the River <hi>Rhein,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the antient Kingdome of <hi>Auſtratia</hi> (his ſuppoſed inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance) which cauſed a learned man of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> (who ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their Commonwealth to be ſtruck at) to maintain in writing (ſome few years paſt) the Rights of their City againſt all pretenders. And thus upon the whole, conſidering <hi>France</hi> furniſhed with a King, not wanting high thoughts or activity, leſs cannot be expected from him, than to deſign an univerſal Monarchy, which conſequently makes it the common Intereſt of all <hi>European</hi> Princes and States (as they value their own ſafety) to unite, for the keeping of him within bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</p>
            <p>And now as <hi>England</hi> is not the leaſt in the general concern of <hi>Europe,</hi> and becauſe ſeated by it ſelf, and divided by Sea from all other Nations, I ſhall begin with it.</p>

            <p>The Iſle of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> of which <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is the moſt conſiderable part, and that which is chiefly taken notice of in the World, having the advantage of an Iſland, in being divided from all other Countries, by the Ocean; Narrow and Northern Seas is not ſubject to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions that Contiguous Countries are, not being in danger from abroad whilſt its Naval ſtrength is preſerved, by keeping their ſhipping in good repair, and their Marriners incouraged by good uſage: Neither is it fit for foreign acquiſitions, in regard of the uncertainty of winde and weather, and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of tranſportation; but contenting themſelves with the bounds that providence hath given them, making it their defigne to improve their advantage for trade, to increaſe their greatneſs at home, is their firſt Domeſtick intereſt; for as ſelf defence is the chief intereſt of every Creature, Natural or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59429:5"/>
Politick, and as without trade, no Nation can be fomidable, eſpecially at Sea, nor able to maintain a ſufficient Naval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarde, or deſend themſelves againſt their powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; ſo Trade, muſt be the principal Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi> And this Nature ſeems to admoniſh them unto, prohibiting their affecting Foreign Conqueſts, by placing them with advantages as they are an Iſland. Firſt, for preſervation, and without much for augmentation. Secondly, for viewing the actions of their Neighbours, and qualifying them with might, and ſtrength ſufficient to render them arbitrators in their differences. And thirdly, for advancing both their Home, and Foreign traffick, in endowing them with Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral helps for Trade beyond all other Countries: As with plenty of ſtaple Commodities, incompaſſing them with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and rich Seas, convenient and ſafe Havens, and Bayes, bold Coaſts, Rivers and good Portes, all affording matter of encouragement for foreign Commerce, incomperable means in their many harbours for increaſing of their Navigation, and great invitations to ſtrangers to make uſe of theſe advantages in trading with the Countrie. And yet beſides theſe Natural helps, <hi>England</hi> hath further the advantage of all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in ſome cuſtoms, and practices: As in that of breeding the younger ſons of Gentlemen, and ſometimes of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, to the Miniſtrie, Law, Trade, and Phyſick, without prejudice to their Gentility, their Heralds not requiring ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as any reſtauration in ſuch caſes; although it frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls out, that Gentlemen, during their Apprenticeſhips to Trades, come by the death of their elder Brothers to be Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets. In which particular, <hi>England</hi> may well be ſaid to come neareſt unto antient Prudence, and right Reaſon, of all other Nations. For if no Countrie can be rich or flouriſh without Trade, as indiſputable it cannot, nor be more or leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but according to the proportion it hath of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and that antiently men were eſteemed, honoured, and dignified according to the benefit, and commoditie their Countrie had recieved by them; the Traders of a Nation ought to be moſt encouraged, and Trade accounted the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59429:5"/>
moſt honourable of all profeſſions. Secondly, by their greateſt Nobility, marrying with all degrees, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes anſwers their qualities. Thirdly, in his Majeſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, for dignifying men of acquired eſtates, as he ſees cauſe. And fourthly, in that the ſingle poſſeſſion of eſtates, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in reputation the owners of them Gentlemen, all being vaſt benefits to the Nation (which other Countreys are ſtrangers unto) in preventing idleneſs in their numerous Gentry, and incouraging induſtry in all ſorts of people. In <hi>Germany, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> it is eſteemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the quality of a Gentleman, to be bred to either Trade, Law, Miniſtry, or Phyſick: (except that among the Papiſts, ſome are bred to the Church to get great eſtates, that leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no known poſterity, they may thereby advance their families, as they many times do in <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and other places.) Neither will the greateſt fortunes tempt them to marry into the families of any of thoſe Callings, they chooſing to live miſerably, as many of them do, rather than to match under their degree, or at leaſt, not into ſuch, as they eſteem noble. And indeed, they cannot well do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, without danger of degradation, one of the reaſons, for the depoſition of <hi>Errick</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Ouſtavus Adolphus,</hi> being the undervaluing himſelf in his marriage; and if the Emperour, or <hi>Northern</hi> Kings, conferr honours upon any of their Subjects, not of antient deſcent, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome laſt longer in eſteem, than the firſt Generation, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of theſe Countreys being ſo ſtated, as makes it almoſt impoſſible, upon any account to introduce a new laſting Race of Gentility, ſave that in <hi>Sweden</hi> they have in theſe latter ages allowed a general command in their Armies, the faithful and prudent diſcharging the employment of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador extraordinary, or the election into the Senate, which conſiſts of 40 perſons, to be a good original of new Nobility or Gentry. In the United <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are much upon the ſame punctilio's, except that in marriage (for good fortunes) they would mix; but that the trading party, not valuing Gentility, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59429:6"/>
eſtates, ſeldome, or never, willingly do it. And from hence it is (in a great part) that <hi>Gelderland,</hi> and <hi>Overyſsel,</hi> two Provinces that abounds in number of Gentry, are ſo poor, whilſt <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Frieſland,</hi> the firſt, and laſt, having few antient Gentry; and the ſecond, none but the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> are ſo rich. <hi>France</hi> is not ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyed up by theſe rules, as the preceeding Countreys are, their Nobility marrying any where for money, as the Nieces of the laſt great Cardinal ſhews, beſides that they allow of eſtates got by Trade, to be laudable foundations for new raiſed families, in both which principles, they are ſurely wiſe, and thrive the better, whilſt other Countreys are kept low by their contrary practices; for were it not for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that that Countrey reaps by the incouragement which is given there unto Trade, it were impoſſible for them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt under their great burthens; but no people comes ſo near the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the chief of theſe circumſtances, as the wiſe <hi>Venetians, Genoveſers, Lucreſers,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who all allowing the exerciſe of Traffick in their Nobility and Gentry, reap the benefit of ſuch prudence, as appears in the three firſt, exceeding their Neighbours much, in proſperity and wealth, and the Prince and People of the laſt, being abundantly the better by it; for were it not for their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Commerce, incouraged by ſome Liberty in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, connived at in <hi>Leghorne</hi> (the only Port-Town of Trade under that Prince) the people would be as poor, as they are thin, not able to live under the ſeverity of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: but if theſe Inſtances be not ſufficient to prove the profit that accrews unto a Countrey, by a trading Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there needs no further travelling for demonſtration, than <hi>England,</hi> where before the reformation of Religion, that Gentlemen had idle Convents to put their younger Sons into, Trade was there ſo ſmall, that the Cuſtoms amounted not to 10000 <hi>l. per an.</hi> whereas they are now, or have been lately, more than fifty times as much; which proves, Firſt, the advantage that Trade brings both to King, and People; and Secondly, that Trade hath been much increaſed, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59429:6"/>
taking younger Brothers off from their ſloathful way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and applying them, with their Patrimonies to Trade, and Commerce. The experience of this, may reprove thoſe, who both in <note n="*" place="margin">State of <hi>England,</hi> pag, 434, 435, 436.</note> diſcourſe, and writing, plead for the vain antient cuſtom of Idleneſs, in the younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>England,</hi> as if they preferred being their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt brothers ſervants, with the priviledge of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the lower end of their Tables, before the preſent laudable practice, and incumbant duty of induſtry, inabling them to live in equality with their eldeſt brothers. And ſurely, it is the glory, and not ſhame of <hi>England</hi> (as our new pretenders to Politicks would have it) that by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, they have made themſelves ſo formidable in the world, whilſt all other <hi>Northern</hi> Countreys (the United <hi>Netherlands</hi> as to their Gentry not excepted) by their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious adhering to their old cuſtoms, are ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And certain it is, that <hi>England</hi> could not have had thoſe great things to have boaſted of at Sea, as now they have; nor could they ſtand before their Neighbours, were it not for Traffick, which is the only thing that makes a Countrey rich,—Law, and Phyſick, by great Fees, and corrupt Practice, having a great ſhare in impoveriſhing this Nation, but none in the inriching of it, fees to both Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions being in all other Countreys very moderate, compaired with <hi>England;</hi> a Phyſician, in no other place, having for a viſit above 18 <hi>d. ſtar.</hi> except at <hi>Venice,</hi> where it is 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> and in ſome places, as at <hi>Newport,</hi> and <hi>Liſle,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>6 d.</hi> and even at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and at <hi>Antwerpen,</hi> the firſt equal to any place for wealth, and the latter next conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not above 12 Stivers, which is about 13 <hi>d.</hi> and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> for their opinion, and as much an hour, for a buſineſs that requires long conſultation and work, much of their pleading being caſt into that price; ſo that <hi>England</hi> may be reckoned to exceed in their fees to both Profeſſions, ten times the rates of other Countreys. But if the benefit of Commerce be not ſufficient to convince the enemies of trading Gentlemen, peradventure the impoſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59429:7"/>
the Gentry and Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> to the mode of other Countries, without utter ruine to them, may do it, and therefore, they may do well to conſider, that to anſwer other Countries in their Rules,</p>
            <p>Firſt, All the Families of the Gentry muſt be ſo ſtated, as that no way (not even by deſert) may be left for increaſing the number of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, None deſcended from them, either Males or Females, muſt marry any but ſuch as are of thoſe Families.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, None of their Sons muſt be bred to any Callings, either the Miniſtry, Law, or Phyſick; nay, nor be Court-Officers, except ſuch as they account Noble: (which are not many, Secretaries not being in that number) they reckoning all Callings a debaſement of Gentility, as well as Trade; and he that marries with the daughter of any perſon of a Calling, to deſerve the puniſhment of degr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dation; And therefore, ſhould Trade be maintained in <hi>England,</hi> in ſuch a way, as the riches got by it, would remain in the Trading partie, the Gentry would conſequently be poor, compared with the Trading-Families; and as honours and reſpect will follow Eſtates, ſo the Gentry would be little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, whilſt the Traders would carry away all Intereſt, and eſteem in their Countries, as the Trading-Families of <hi>Holland</hi> do at preſent, from the poor Gentry of <hi>Gelderland</hi> and <hi>Overyſsel,</hi> two provinces of the United <hi>Netherlands.</hi> But if theſe new Statiſts ſhall ſtill deſire the want of Trade, with poverty, rather than riches, with the practice of that they call the debaſement of Gentility, they ought farther to conſider, that the Caſe of <hi>England</hi> is not the ſame with other Northern Nations; for <hi>Denmark, Sweeden,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all upon the ſame Principle, of deſpiſing Trade in their Gentry, are alike poor, wanting Commerce, and ſo under the leſs danger one of another: But <hi>England,</hi> having rich and potent Neighbours, Trade is abſolutely neceſſary for their preſervation, in rendring them equal in power, both at Sea and Land, to their great and opulent emulators; ſo that in true <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they that plead for leſs plenty in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59429:7"/>
People of <hi>England,</hi> do no leſs in effect (though in Charity I will hope they think not ſo) than argue for expoſing them as a prey to their enemies; but theſe principles are not ſtrange in them, who, in pleading for keeping the people low, ſeem to have loſt all Natural affection to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in accuſing the Commons (by which I ſuppoſe is meant the Yeomandry of <hi>England,</hi> who, without oſtentation, may be called the beſt of their kind <note place="margin">
                  <hi>State of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, pa. 60. 61, 62.</note> in the world, the Peſants of other Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brutes in Religion, good Nature and Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, compared to them) of being the courſeſt Bran, and the worſt of People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaying, they are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſteful to their Gentry, that they wiſh their Country leſs plentiful, or more burthened with Taxes, as the way to refine the manners of the Common people. But, although the Competitors with <hi>England</hi> in Trade, may be glad of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Confeſſion of Pride, Inſolence, and ill Conditions in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from one of themſelves, to make uſe of abroad, for their own advantage, and to the prejudice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; yet if it be believed by any that know <hi>England,</hi> they muſt have changed their obſervations of it, that people, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never lain under ſuch a cenſure until now, that it is untruly, maliciouſly, and imprudently clapped upon them, by, I may ſay, a degenerate Countryman, who, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ſheweth little of that natural affection, that every one oweth to the Land of their Nativity, nor ſuitableneſs to the Care his Majeſty and Council take for promoting Trade, by ſeveral Councils appointed to that end, but what uſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Foreiners may make of theſe accuſations againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traders, and Merchants in other Countries. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the new Philoſophy of Poverty, and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of all Non-conformiſts, called the Sons <note place="margin">State of <hi>England</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Belial,</hi> (the ready way to penury) being beſt for a Nation, will have but few diſciples; for though all is thought to be made good, by accuſing the People of <hi>England</hi> of want of that humble reſpect, and awful reverence to the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy, that is due to them, thoſe to whom the Commons of <hi>England</hi> are not ſtrangers, know
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59429:8"/>
that they are not wanting in good nature, or due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance, to any of the three Orders, where there is Juſtice, and not Oppreſſion, in the two firſt, nor Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Ignorance, Profaneneſs, or Debauchery in the laſt; for although Greatneſs may procure Fear, nothing but Virtue, Honeſty, and Juſtice, can Love, and true Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. It may well be queſtioned, who it is, that the men of theſe principles aim to gratifie by them? for nothing can be more prejudicial to His Majeſty, than publickly to maintain, that Plenty in his people, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Peace and good Order in his Government, or that reducing the people to a complaining condition, is the way to make them happy, as this Gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates.</p>
            <p>This ſeeming digreſſion, is neceſsitated, for Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true and chief intrinſick Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it cannot ſubſiſt, thus much could not well be avoided, in the making out, that as well by ſome Conſtitutions and Cuſtomes, as by its Native Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Conveniencies, it ſo far excells all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Commonwealths in worldly advantages; that Providence may be ſaid to have leſt nothing more to the People of <hi>England</hi> to do, in order to their earthly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, than deſiring of it; the matter of Trade being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo prepared and fitted for them, that it may even be a reproach to them, not to advance Trade, though no great glory to do it; nothing, except ſome accidents extraordinary, or violent obſtructions, (as impoſing upon Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> or want of good Laws, or the execution of them, being capable of hindring the increaſe of it. And now, as from the growth of Trade, there doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſe, not alone riches to the Subject, rendring a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiderable, but alſo increaſe of Revenue, and therein power and ſtrength to the Soveraign; ſo it is the undoubted Intereſt of his Majeſty, to advance and promote Trade, by removing all obſtructions, and giving it all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59429:8"/>
As Firſt, By leſſening the over-great Impoſitions upon Native Commodities, and upon ſuch, as are neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be manufactured in <hi>England,</hi> or to be again tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By cauſing the Native Commodities to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and truly made, and ordered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By laying all Companies open, or at leaſt, by leaving them free, for all to come in to them that pleaſe, without fines, more, than a ſmall acknowledgement, tying them, in ſuch caſe, from burthening their own Manufactures with Taxes, as they uſually do for the raiſing money to ſpend profuſely and wantonly: what objections may be made againſt this general rule, in reference to the <hi>Eaſt-Indi's</hi> Joynt-Stock, I know not; but this I am ſure may be ſaid for it, that the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> driving their <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade by a Joynt-Stock, is no argument for <hi>England</hi> to do the ſame: for they having by the publick purſe of the Company, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and conquered ſeveral Countreys, and petty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which ingageth them often in Warrs with their Neighbours, and neceſſitateth them to keep up a ſtanding Militia of 30 or 40000 men, with many Garriſons, and 100 or more Ships, equipped as well for Men of War at Sea, as for Merchants uſe; the carrying on of ſuch a Government, and deſraying the charge of it, is no otherwiſe feaſable, than by a Society and Joynt-Stock, the maintaining of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety being impracticable by an open Trade; but the caſe not being the ſame with <hi>England,</hi> they having nothing in propriety, ſave the inſignificant Caſtle of St. <hi>George,</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> their Trade being all by Factories, there is not that reaſon nor neceſſity upon them, for a Joynt-Stock, as upon <hi>Holland:</hi> and Societies, in reſtraining the number, both of Buyers of the Native, and Sellers of Forein Commodities, muſt conſequently tend to the abating the price of the firſt, and inhancing the rate of the latter, nothing being more plain to reaſon, than that the fewer buyers of Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, the cheaper they muſt be, as the ſewer ſellers of Forein, the dearer they muſt be; and that which abateth the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59429:9"/>
price of Native Commodities, and raiſeth the price of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, muſt be againſt the Intereſt of a Nation: and thereſore the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> who certainly underſtand the Intereſt of Trade, equal to any people living, though by making the Intereſt of Trade matter of State, they have an eye of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation upon it, yet admits of no reſtraining Companies, as in <hi>England,</hi> except in their <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trades, where they have great poſſeſſions in propriety,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By carefully protecting Merchants abroad, from the wrongs and injuries of other Nations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, By making the transferring bills of debt good in Law, it being a great advantage to Traders (eſpecially to young men of ſmall Stocks) to be able to ſupplie themſelves with monie, by the ſale of their own bills of debt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, By conſtituting a Court Merchant, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of other Countries, to prevent tedious and chargeable Sutes in Law, taking men off from their buſineſs, and in making the advancement, and protection of Trade, matter of State.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, By having Regiſters of all Real Eſtates, as is profitablie practiſed in other Countries, and in this, within the Juriſdiction of <hi>Taunton,</hi> which in a natural way, will abate the Intereſt of mony, and make Purchaſes certain; for it is no little prejudice and blemiſh to <hi>England,</hi> that of all the Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> there is none, where Purchaſers, or Lenders of monie upon Land, are upon ſuch uncertainty in their dealings, as in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, By taking away all privileges (except of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) from perſons and places, tending to the defrauding Creditors of their debts, and extending the Statute of Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, againſt all perſons not Trading, as well as Traders, it being but equal Juſtice, that all men ſhould be a like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the payments of their debts.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Banks (not Bankers, but) ſuch as are in uſe at <hi>Venice, Amsterdam,</hi> and <hi>Hamburg,</hi> where the States are ſecurity, keeping particular accounts of <hi>Caſh,</hi> for all men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it, are of great advantage to Merchants and Traders,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59429:9"/>
in ſecuring their monies from many caſualties, and making receipts and payments, ſpeedie and eaſie; beſides, ſo certain, without the danger of loſing acquittances, or the death, or want of witneſſes, as takes away all occaſions of ſuits about them, Bank accounts being allowed for undeniable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in Law; but of theſe, I confeſs there are no thriving and flouriſhing examples, ſave under Republicks.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, By making Free Ports (which <hi>England</hi> of all Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> is moſt proper for) giving liberty to Strangers, as well as Natives, upon payment of a ſmall duty, to keep Magazines of goods ready for tranſportation to other Countries, according to the encouragement of Markets abroad, are great increaſers of Trade and Navigation, and ſo of riches; as appears, not only by <hi>Holland,</hi> which is a Commonwealth, but alſo by St. <hi>Mallows,</hi> under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Leghorne,</hi> under that of <hi>Tuskanie;</hi> the firſt, for its bigneſs, which contains but thirty ſix Acres of ground, being the richeſt City in <hi>France;</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all the places in that Princes Dominions, which, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to former times, can truly be ſaid to flouriſh.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Making buſineſs at the ſeveral Offices for Cuſtome and Exciſe, and in all other places, as eaſie, and as little vexatious as may be, in employing ſuch perſons of honeſty, integrity, and diſcretion, as will not abuſe their truſts, no more in inſolency than falſeneſs, is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Traders; as alſo, making paſſing in and out of the country by Strangers and Travellers, untroubleſome, is a motive and inducement to them, to ſatisfie their curioſity in viſiting the Kingdome, and ſpending their money in it. For to object, that the incivilities travellers meet with in going in, and coming out of <hi>France,</hi> hinders no reſort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is more than can be proved; beſides that, admit it is not, yet the like uſage in any other country, would be a prejudice to it, and would be ſurely ſo to <hi>France,</hi> were it not the humour at preſent of this giddy age, to run a madding after them; and certainly, the facility that is in doing buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the unmoleſted egreſs and regreſs that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59429:10"/>
Strangers and Travellers meets with there, is a great benefit to them.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Would the Trading Corporations, chooſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of <hi>London,</hi> and according to their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and reaſon of their inſtitution, their members for Parliament out of themſelves, the Intereſt of Trade would probably be better underſtood, and faithfullier proſecuted than it is, and it cannot but be a prejudice to Commerce, that they generally ſend Courtiers, Country Gentlemen, or their Recorders, to Parliament, who will be ſure to prefer their particular Intereſts before that of Trade, it being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all men, to ſeek their own profit, before that of others.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, As <hi>England</hi> hath ſome beneficial Cuſtomes, which other Countries are ſtrangers unto, ſo it hath others, as prejudicial, not known to Forein Governments; as the great expences of Corporations, undoing many Citizens and Townſmen; a Freeman of <hi>York,</hi> or <hi>Southampton,</hi> not being able to go through all their Offices, according to Cuſtome and expectation, in the firſt, under ſeven or eight hundred pound; and the latter, ſix or ſeven hundred; which may well be judged one cauſe, why <hi>York</hi> is ſo poor, and the other thrives no better; and the like obſervation may be made of the moſt of the other Corporations: The great charge of Sheriffs of the Counties, hath decayed, if not ruined many Families; and the expence of Barriſters, at their Readings, is a provocation to them, to increaſe their ſharking, and growing upon the people; all which bad effects, are to be wiſhed were remedied, ſo far as taking away theſe unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expences will do it: for I am not of their opinion, who think popular feaſtings and good fellowſhip, called Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, to be the Intereſt of the Nation, becauſe it conſumes the growth of the Countrey; but on the contrary, that it is altogether againſt it: For, beſides the provoking of the Judgments of God by ſuch inordinate living, Exceſs weakens mens bodies, ſpends vainly their time, dulls their wits, and makes them unfit for action and buſineſs, which is the chief advancer of any Government, and to ſupply the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59429:10"/>
want of people in any Land, by a riotous waſting the growth of it, is, at beſt, but a bad effect, of a bad cauſe, and againſt that rule which forbids doing evil, that good may come of it; and therefore, the true Intereſt of any Country is, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, priviledges, and libertie of Conſcience, ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and encreaſe the number of people, as they may rather be (in a ſober way of living) too many, than to few for their proviſions: and we do find, that in former times, when Hoſpitality was in <hi>England,</hi> much greater than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that merely in the expence of their own proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without <hi>French</hi> diſhes, or much of either <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Wines, the Country was poor to what it now is; and that it hath been the encreaſe of the Trade and People of that Nation by Liberty and Priviledges, indulging tender Conſciences, that hath advanced them. And (as to the retrenching of expences) this ſeems to be agreeable to the principles of that wiſe and great States-man, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who ſaith, that taking away all ſuperfluous char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and expences, as well in Hoſpitality as in leſſening the fees, allowances, and wages of Miniſters of little neceſſitie, as alſo of penſions, rewards, entertainments, and donaries, to be a laudable parſimony uſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other well-governed States.</p>
            <p>But, fourteenthly, impoſing upon Conſcience, in matters of Religion, is a miſchief unto Trade, tranſcending all others whatſoever, for if the Traders and Manufacturers be forced to flye their Countries, or withdraw their ſtocks, by vexatious proſecutions, the having Natural Commodities in a Countrey, or no great impoſitions upon them, will ſignifie little to the Prince or People; And Liberty of Conſcience is not only the Common Intereſt of all the Nation, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his Majeſty, in that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By it he obligeth all his Subjects equally to him, no man having juſt cauſe to be offended at another mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince he enjoyes the ſame himſelf; and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he obligeth all the Non-conſormiſts to him, who can have no other Intereſt than his, that in grace and favour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59429:11"/>
gives them Liberty; ſecuring thereby, in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all the ſeveral perſwaſions, from agreeing upon any thing, to the prejudice of their Common friend, whereas the Papiſts have, as others may have, other Intereſts. And, although a Prince arrived to that height which is above En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and all ſear from abroad, may ſometimes adventure in impoſing in matters of Religion, it is not in any kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in them, that are not in ſuch a condition, but that ſtands in need, in reference to the potency of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, of the hearts of all their people, eſpecially in this age, when the large experience the world hath had of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfulneſs and evil of it, hath made, (even) in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Potentates, a general abatement therein, and now, when it is too late, they grow weary of their rigour. The laſt <hi>Pope,</hi> as is affirmed, having diſſwaded the <hi>French</hi> King, from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting <hi>Geneva,</hi> when he thought to have obliged the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reducing of it. And oh that <hi>England,</hi> whilſt they have time, would be warned by the miſeries of others, to avoid the rock they have ſplit upon. Had the former Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> uſed in any degree, the lenity that that Crown at preſent practiſeth in their Netherlands, where now a known proteſtant may obtain his freedome of ſeveral Cities, without having his Religion enquired into, as at <hi>Bruges, Newpart, &amp;c.</hi> thoſe Countries had not been ſo thin of people, nor <hi>Spain</hi> ſo depopulated as they are, nor yet the whole houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſo low, as it now ſeems to be. Nay, had the <hi>Pope</hi> made formerly ſo little uſe of his Inquiſition, as he doth at this time, few places being leſs inquiſitive after mens belief, than <hi>Rome,</hi> where one may be as good as he will, and ſpend all his dayes without being proceeded againſt, either Eccleſiaſtically or Civilly, for not coming to their Churches, <hi>Italy</hi> had had more people than it hath, and been more conſiderable than it is: The <hi>French</hi> could never advance by Maſſacres, of which, they are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have had thirty or forty, at ſeveral times, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, nor yet get forward in power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, until they laid aſide Perſecution; confeſſing, as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59429:11"/>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. did at the taking of <hi>Rochell,</hi> that although it would rejoyce him to have all his <note place="margin">The Hiſtory of the Siege of <hi>Rochell.</hi>
               </note> Subjects of the ſame belief with himſelf, and that he ſhould uſe all ſweet means poſſible to draw them to it, yet ſince the experience of times paſt, had ſufficiently made <hi>France</hi> to know, that Religion is not to be planted by the Sword, but (to uſe his own words) that it is God alone that muſt incline the heart, and illuminate the underſtanding with his knowledge; he aſſured them he would never uſe Violence in matters of Religion, and to give that King his due, he truly inherited the merciful good Nature of his incomparable Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be concluded to be the Intereſt of the King and Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to grant Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe by a general conſent of Nations, liberty in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, invented by men, ſeems to be accounted neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the good of humane ſociety. For I believe I may without boldneſs affirm, that <hi>England</hi> is ſingular in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting them, who are one with them in Doctrine, for differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in ceremonies, no other Chriſtian Church that I know of, doing the like. In <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have ſcarce, in any two Cities, or Countries, the ſame ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; <hi>Nurenburg,</hi> and <hi>Leipſigg,</hi> having almoſt as many as the Papiſts, and yet differ in them; <hi>Hamburg</hi> hath fewer, and <hi>Strasburg</hi> none at all; and ſo it is through all the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Cities and Countries in the Empire, and yet agreeing in Doctrine; their differing in circumſtantials, make no breach of charitie amongſt them, although at the ſame Communion. I have ſeen ſome receive ſtanding, as others have kneeling. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their uſing the inventions of men, in the worſhip of God, ſeems (their Principles conſidered) to act rationally, becauſe they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the aſſiſtance of an infallible Spirit; but for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, who do not pretend to any ſuch help, to maintain that the Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his own worſhip, that under the Law, he ſeverely prohibited the adding to, or diminiſhing one little from,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59429:12"/>
what he had commanded, and under the Goſpel, gave no other Commiſſion, than to teach according to what he had commanded, that he hath left his Worſhip to the inventions of corrupt, frail man, inclinable above all things to ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and idolatry, and who are by nature, endleſly various in their imaginations, ſenſe, and underſtandings, ſeems to be irrational, and to accuſe Chriſt, of not having been, as a Son, ſo careful of his Church, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> a Servant, was of the Church of God under the Law: for had Chriſt intended to have left his Church under a negative obedience in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, making all things lawful that he had not forbidden, the command had been as readily made, to do whatſoever he had not prohibited, as it was to do whatſoever he hath commanded; And that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who pretends to infallibility, ſhould not exact Conformity in Ceremonies, where there is an agreement in Doctrine, as they do not even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, (where they might force it, without prejudice to Trade, having little to obſtruct) there being in that City ſeveral Popiſh Churches, differing from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Ceremonies, and all abundantly from that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and yet agreeing in Doctrine, have publick toleration, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; <note place="margin">The <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Popiſh</hi> cong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</note> And yet that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who pretends not to infallibility, ſhould to their civil prejudice, be rigid in impoſing them, upon thoſe that agree with them, not only in Fundamentals, but in all material points of Faith, Worſhip, and obedience, with puniſhment for denial, I cannot conceive the reaſon, except without Ceremonies, to adminiſter matter of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, in puniſhing tender Conſciences, they think they ſhould be without work, in any kind adequate to their great Revenues, and that they dread the conſequent of uſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Liberty of Conſcience to all Proteſtant Non-conformiſts, is the true Intereſt of King and Kingdome, in that it is abſolutely and indiſpenſibly neceſſary, for raiſing the value of Land, which at preſent is miſerably mean and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59429:12"/>
low, and advancing the Trade and Wealth of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe impoſition upon Conſcience, hinders the reſort of Strangers, and ſo the encreaſe of people, whereof <hi>England</hi> is greatly wanting, coming ſo far ſhort of <hi>Holland</hi> in numbers, (whereby that Province alone, is made more conſiderable than all the other ſix) that whereas they are calculated to have ſix Souls for one Acre of ground, <hi>England,</hi> I fear, hath hardly one for ten, and the riches of <hi>Holland,</hi> under ſuch multitudes, as the proviſions <note place="margin">Intereſt of <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </note> of their own Country, are ſaid not to be ſufficient to nouriſh above an eighth part of their People (all the reſt being ſupplied by the Sea, and Trade with other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, argues Plenty of Inhabitants to be a benefit to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Countries, and Foreign Conqueſts or Plantations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting men and money, where there is not an overplus of both, a prejudice which ought to be avoided.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Impoſition upon Conſcience, drives the ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt induſtrious ſort of Natives into corners, leaving trade into too few hands, and to a kind of people that do but rarely mind it; amongſt whom, though there are ſome that get large eſtates, it is not the thriving of a ſmall number, but diffuſive wealth, that makes a Country rich. And, as moſt of the Corporations in <hi>England</hi> have declined in their flouriſhing condition, ſince many of the ſobereſt, and publick ſpirited Citizens and Townſmen, have, by the impoſition of Oaths they could not comply with, been barred all ſhare in Government, ſo the influence would have been the ſame, upon the whole Nation, had not His Majeſty wiſely conſidered the good of his Kingdome, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his ſenſe for Liberty, and in ſome kind, conniving at it. And if men, ſetting aſide paſſion, would but ſeriouſly remember, and ponder the ſad conſequence of ancient popiſh Epiſcopal Perſecutions, in the deaths (by ſeveral brutiſh wayes and torments) of many millions of precious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in <hi>France, England, Netherlands, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Alpine Vallies, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> producing no other effects, than
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59429:13"/>
the depopulating of the two laſt, and increaſing the number of Diſſenters in all the reſt, beſides the irrepairable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of this Kingdom, in their former Biſhops, drive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the woollen Manufactures back into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> (as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had before driven them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England)</hi> by Perſecution, where they have ever ſince increaſed, and where they now remain, ſad Monuments to this Nation, of the impolitick ſeverity of thoſe times, they could not but be convinced of the vanity and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch practices, as well as of the civil prejudice they bring to Nations, in deſtroying of their people, and therein depriving them of the benefit of Induſtry, thinking charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of that ſaying, which was antiently in <hi>Voge,</hi> and is ſtill in ſome places remembred, that when a Biſhop is created, the Devil enters into him, and makes him his Executioner; which as it had its original in times of Popery, ſo it concerns their Biſhops only.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, As it is the King and Kingdome of <hi>Englands</hi> Intereſt, to give Libertie of Conſcience to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters, ſo it is not only to deny it to the Papiſts, after the example of other reformed countries, as <hi>Denmark, Sweeden,</hi> ſeveral Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the reformed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> but alſo to take care to prevent the growth of them, and that upon a civil ſcore; as firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they own a forein head upon the account of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which, they are carried on by ſuch a blind zeal, as cannot render them leſs, than Spies, and Intelligencers for that Intereſt, and ready upon all occaſions to appear for it. And even the wiſeſt Popiſh States, acknowledge the reaſon of this principle, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> affirming, that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as not holding it ſafe, to have any in their Counſels, who have dependance by Oath, Homage, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obligation, Penſion, or Reward, when their Senate is Aſſembled, cauſeth Proclamation (before ſhutting of the doors) to be made, for all Prieſts to depart, and he who in this Commonwealth, is called the Divine of the State (an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, to be adviſed within matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59429:13"/>
is commonly choſen ſuch a one, as is reputed the leaſt Bigot in that Religion, as in the memory of ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>Padri Pauli,</hi> and after him <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> both Succeſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed that office, and were eſteemed favourers of the Reformation, and correſponders with <hi>Diodati</hi> of <hi>Geneve,</hi> and if Papiſts dare not truſt their own Clergy in their Counſels, upon the account of their forein dependance, Proteſtants upon the ſame account, have no cauſe to truſt Popiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in their Countries, longer, than until they that are now living, die away, and that they can breed their Children to the Proteſtant Religion: I am not ignorant, that there are a ſort of men, who, with the Author of that Book, intituled <hi>The State of England,</hi> ſeek to infuſe a belief into the people, that the diſpenſing with the Laws againſt the Papiſts, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the prevention of perſecution to Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by their Popiſh Princes; but the impoſers of that opinion, perſumes more upon ignorance, and eaſie nature, in the moſt of men, than upon any ſtrength there is in their arguments: for this ſuggeſted danger, muſt referr to <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> the Emperour, or the <hi>French</hi> King; and for the two firſt, they have by former Perſecutions, (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depopulating of their ſeveral Countries) left no Native Proteſtants in them; ſo that however <hi>England</hi> ſhall deal with their own Papiſts, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the Pope, have any Proteſtant Subjects, to uſe better, or worſe, and for the few reformed Merchant-ſtrangers that are among them, they muſt (for their own Intereſt, in reference to Commerce) ſuffer them to enjoy a trading liberty, without having their Religion inquired into, and more than that, they are never likely to have. And as to the Emperour, he being through facility of Nature, acted by the Church, hath (to almoſt the ruin of himſelf, as well as his Proteſtants) ſpent all his Reign hitherto in a grievous and ſore perſecution of the Reformed in his Hereditarie Countries (having no power over them in other places of <hi>Germany)</hi> for by it, he hath loſt a great part of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and in a fair way of loſing the reſt, beſides that, he hath thereby much prejudiced Trade, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59429:14"/>
leſſened his people: for even the Proteſtant Gently and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who, by birth, have great Immunities, and ought not to be impoſed upon in matters of Religion, were (lately) ſome forced to leave their Countries, and others who ſtayed, to entertain none but Papiſt Servants in their Families, ſo that <hi>England</hi> by no kind of treatment of their Papiſts, can increaſe the Emperours perſecution (which is already ſo high) of his proteſtant Subjects. And for the <hi>French</hi> King, he cannot perſecute his Reformed, without breach of the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> (their <hi>Magna Charta)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> granted by <hi>Henry</hi> 4th. 30 <hi>April,</hi> 1593.</note> and ſeveral other Laws, giving them as good a right to exerciſe their Religion, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have for theirs, making them alſo capable of all civil offices, privileges, and preferments equal with Papiſts, and that upon conſideration of having been alwayes loyal and faithful to <note place="margin">The Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>Lewis</hi> 13th. the 22 <hi>May,</hi> 1610. and again 10 <hi>Nov.</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And the King of <hi>England,</hi> with the continued reaſon of his Laws (witneſs the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre in <hi>Ireland)</hi> his keeping, and executing them againſt his Papiſts, but further, thoſe that obſerve any thing of <hi>France,</hi> muſt confeſs, that that King, in matters of Religion, regards no examples of others, or any thing but his own deſigns, as in his preſent perſecution of his reformed Subjects, he may well be judged to aime at the advancing of his reputation, with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a means to help him forward in his aſpiring deſigns; for but few years ſince, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts were under the moſt ſeverity in <hi>England,</hi> the Proteſtants were under moſt liberty in <hi>France,</hi> and now they enjoy the greateſt liberty in <hi>England,</hi> the Reformed are the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in <hi>France:</hi> but beſides theſe circumſtances, it cannot but be of evil conſequence, and a leſſening unto Soveraignty,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59429:14"/>
to own the having an eye to other Princes, in the execution of their Laws, for nothing can be more diſhonourable to a Prince, than to be under the awe of Forein Potentates in his adminiſtration, within his own Dominions; but this Gentleman doth not alwayes ponder what he writes, for when I conſider his ſharpneſs againſt the Presbyterians <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> calling <note place="margin">
                  <hi>State of</hi> England, pa. 50, 56, 60.</note> them Muſhromes, Tares, and the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> inſinuating the tranſplantation and extirpation of them, I cannot but wonder he ſhould have ſo much concern for the reformed abroad, who are the ſame with the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore muſt judge it to proceed from favour to the Papiſts, towards whom, he ſo tenderly avoids all reflections and ſeverity, as if he thought the revolt of a Presbyterian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Popery, to merit a pardon from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation or extirpation, and not from any kindneſs he can have for the Proteſtants in other Countries. Nor do I know how to reconcile his boaſting of the tranſcending Charity of the Church of <hi>England</hi> towards other Churches, with his accuſing them of looking upon the Non-conſormiſts of <hi>England</hi> as baſtards, or making no account of any other Intereſt in them, than a man makes of the Vermin which breed out of his excrementitious ſweat, or thoſe <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> which comes ſometimes in his moſt uncleanly parts; but for ſuch homely expreſſions, ſurely the Church of <hi>England</hi> will not think themſelves beholding to him, no more than for rendring them ſo charitable to thoſe that differ from them both in Doctrine and Diſcipline, as the Papiſts do, who are the Church he muſt mean, and ſo uncharitable to thoſe that agree with them in all material points of Doctrine, and differ only from them in circumſtantials, as the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The growth of Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> ought to be prevented, becauſe there is a kind of natural unaptneſs to buſineſs in that Religion (compared to the reformed) as <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where they are the greateſt Bigots, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; beſides, that the ſame ſeems to be made good in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59429:15"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> in that for one Papiſt ſtranger of buſineſs, that is in it, there is thought to be fifty Proteſtants, or more, though, I fear, that the difference in the number of the one and th' other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is not much, and the fewer idle, and unprofitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons any Country hath, the more proſperous it muſt needs be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the vaſt ſums of money that go out of <hi>England,</hi> ſent by Papiſts, to ſuch uſes, as they call pious; for putting young Gentlewomen into Nunneries, and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentlemens ſons in Popiſh Schools and Univerſities, is a great impoveriſhing of the Nation, and ſo a prejudice to Trade, the School at St. <hi>Omers</hi> having ſeldom leſs than an hundred and twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> youths, and the Colledge at <hi>Doway,</hi> eighty or more Students, beſides their other Schools, Univerſities, Convents, and Nunneries, ſcattered over all the Popiſh territories, (ſounded on purpoſe to encreaſe that Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> corrupt, and pervert their Gentry) which are too many to enumerate.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Becauſe the multitude of lazie Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, ſent as Emiſſaries, to ſeduce Proteſtants, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Papiſts in their errours, are a vaſt charge to thoſe of that Religion, and in them, to the Nation, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing to the good of mankind: And if the <hi>French</hi> King thinks it his Intereſt, in order to the rendring himſelf Protector of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, to ſuppreſs his Proteſtant Subjects, who, by Law, have a right to Liberty of Conſcience, equal with the Papiſts, who own no other Head but their Native King, and who were ſo faithful to him, that when reduced to the greateſt extremities at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and forced to implore the aſſiſtance of <hi>England,</hi> yet would never depart from their Allegiance, in putting themſelves under <hi>England,</hi> when ſollicited to it; The King of <hi>England</hi> hath much more reaſon to think it his Intereſt, in order to his ſafety, and making himſelf Head of the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſuppreſs the Papiſts, who own another <note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, 22 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1603. and 10 <hi>Janu.</hi> 1606. &amp; the preamb. of the Stat. of 35 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2.</note> Head, and ſo have a Forein Intereſt, and who are bred to Principles which lead them to a reſtleſs plotting againſt their Sovereigns,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59429:15"/>
if contrary to them in Religion, never joyning with ſuch, but upon deſign for themſelves, holding the murther of King and people, rebellion, or any thing elſe, which they judge may tend to the propagating of their Religion, lawful, in the caſe of ſuch as they call Hereticks, as thoſe who have converſed with Papiſts abroad, where they ſometimes ſpeak their hearts, and own their principles, do know, as well as the Gun-powder Treaſon, the Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the many plots in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, (which cannot be forgotten) do ſufficiently witneſs: In contemplation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were (I ſuppoſe made thoſe wiſe Statutes, enacting, that the Popiſh Recuſants, ſhall <note place="margin">35 Eliz. <hi>ch. 2. and</hi> 3 Jacob. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.</note> be reſtrained to their private houſes in the Country, and not at any time after to paſs, or remove above five miles from thence, upon pain of forfeiture for life, of all lands, goods, and chattels; That none of them, convicted, or to be convicted, ſhall remain within ten miles of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> nor come into the Court, or Houſe, where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or Heir apparent ſhall be, nor have in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or in the hands or poſſeſſion of any others, at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, any Arms, Gun-powder, or Ammunition whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and by the Book of Thankſgiving appointed for the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> ſet forth by King <hi>James</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is enjoyned to pray upon that day, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the hand of the King and Magiſtrates of the land, to cut off with Judgment and Juſtice, thoſe workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the Papiſts, whoſe Religion is Rebellion, whoſe Faith is Faction, whoſe practice is the Murthering of Souls and Bodies, and to root them out of the Confines of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And now, ſince the wiſdome of the Nation hath judged the Papiſts ſo dangerous, it may ſeem ſtrange, that putting the Laws in execution againſt the Non-conformiſts, ſhould be thought a good reaſon for the proſecution of them, and be none againſt the other, of whoſe dangerons principles there hath been ſuch large experience; ſome obſervations here may peradventure be thought ſtrained and new, as that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59429:16"/>
is a kind of Natural unapneſs in the Popiſh Religion to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, whereas, on the contrary, amongſt the Reformed, the greater their zeal, the greater is their inclinations to Trade and Induſtry, as holding Idleneſs unlawful, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in moſt places makes it good: as in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> no one City can boaſt of any great Trade driven by their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the greateſt part of their Commerce being carried on by Proteſtant ſtrangers, <hi>Amſterdam</hi> alone, having more Trade than all the Sea Towns of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have, put together: but to come cloſer to the Obſervation; In <hi>Germany,</hi> even in thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties where they are Papiſts, without toleration to any other, there the Reformed may be ſaid to carry all the Trade, as at <hi>Colne,</hi> in other Towns where they are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> with a publick toleration to Papiſts, which is denied to <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> there the reformed carry the Trade clearly from both <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the latter having little, as at <hi>Frankford,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Main. In other places, where the Cities are half Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, half <hi>Lutherans,</hi> without toleration to any other, there the latter have the Trade, as at <hi>Augsburgh.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> the Reformed, for their number, are the greateſt Traders, though that people, being looſer from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> are more given to Induſtry, than either of thoſe Nations; but yet, that the Reformed are by much the more Induſtrious, appears, in that they have no beggars amongſt them, though calculated to exceed three or four millions of ſouls; it having been obſerved by one that travelled <hi>France</hi> round, and croſſed it ſeveral wayes, that in all his travels in it, he never met with one Proteſtant beggar, and yet the multitudes of Popiſh, are ſuch, that it hath upon tryal been ſound, that in going from the City of <hi>Rouen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> to the Proteſtants Church (two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles and an half out of town) to give every beggar but that which they call a <hi>double,</hi> (hardly the ſixth part of a penny) will coſt a <hi>Lewis d'or,</hi> which is at leaſt 17 <hi>s. ſterling.</hi> Theſe Inſtances cannot be denied by any traveller, that hath been curious to enquire into the condition of theſe places; and examples are the ſame in Politicks, as experience is in Naturals. Upon my own

obſervation hereof, being inquiſitive after the reaſon, a perſon of Quality, and Miniſter of State to one of the Electors of <hi>Germany,</hi> with whom I had the honour to be acquainted, granted the truth of theſe things, but went no farther for the reaſons, than that the Religion of the reformed, was an argument of their wit, and that their Underſtandings made them the abler Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <p>And now, upon the whole, ſince it appears that Trade depends much upon Liberty of Conſcience, the ſuggeſtions againſt it, either from unexperienced, or concerned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are not to be regarded; Country Gentlemen, bred only at home, to a Religion which exacts little from them, beſides, Conformity to humane Ceremonies, with oppoſition to every thing that is contrary, being tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of that which is ſo pleaſing and grateful to ſnail Nature, are not generally competent Judges of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, nor yet any ſort of people, who, having ſpent their dayes in ſtudying Books, more than Men, or Things, employing themſelves more in puniſhing tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for not obeying in the Worſhip of God, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men, than in the weightieſt duties of their Callings, as in ſuppreſſing Papiſts, ignorant, debauched and ſcandalous Miniſters, rendring their actions thereby to proceed more from Self-intereſt, than an enlightned and ſincere Conſcience, are not in this caſe againſt demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be harkened unto.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it is a work moſt ſuitable unto Soveraignty, the Grand child of <hi>Henry</hi> the great of <hi>France,</hi> and the large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his Majeſty in caſes of Religion in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to ſurmount all ſelfiſh oppoſition in this matter, for the advancement of his own Intereſt, and the good of his people, which whatſoever flatterers may ſuggeſt to the contrary, are bound up together. I know that the enemies to Liberty of Conſcience, do impoſe upon the world, an apprehenſion of danger in it; but the poſition hath no foundation in reaſon, preſidents, or any thing elſe, ſave a confident running down

of truth, for their own advantage, it no where appearing, that ever Proteſtants diſſenting from their National Church, having Liberty of Conſcience given them, did riſe up againſt their King, or diſturbed the quiet of their Countrey, as thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church have in all Ages, and Nations, done. For as the Reformed Religion obligeth its Members to worſhip God according to his will revealed in his word, ſo keeping good Conſciences in that, it teacheth them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Soveraigns, in civil commands. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the old <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> Subjects of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> have ſometimes fled to Arms for defence of themſelves, in the exerciſe of their Religion; but although the advantages they have often had of their Princes, have been great, yet no ſooner was ever Liberty granted them, then they laid down Arms, returning again to obedience, in which they alwayes continued, until their Articles were broke, which (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Faith) was frequently done: and the like cannot be denyed unto the Proteſtants of <hi>France, Hungary,</hi> and other places, whereas on the contrary, antient and modern Story, afford us plentiful relations of thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, riſing up againſt their Kings, when they have had full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Religion, and no reſtraint upon them in their worſhip: as who were greater Inſtruments in the Barons Wars in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> againſt their Kings, and in the changes that followed thereupon, than the Church in time of Popery; were not the many Tragedies, acted antiently in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſuch times, when they were all Papiſts? Did not the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks in <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding theirs was the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion, depoſe, and degrade, their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, arraigning, and condemning him to death, executing him in his Effigies by Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſhes, <note place="margin">Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> his Memoires.</note> none of which Traiterous and Rebellious uſage, did that great and excellent King (Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of His Majeſty of <hi>England)</hi> although he recovered all by force of Arms, in the leaſt revenge; by which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as well as politick carriage, he added to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59429:17"/>
of his Country, the conqueſt of the hearts of all his people, reconciling at once all the animoſities and factions, which had been the product of near forty years civil war: Are they not Papiſts in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> where, in our time, have been ſo many revolts and mutations, with the depoſition, or confinement of the preſent King of <hi>Portugal;</hi> the late Confederates in <hi>Poland</hi> againſt their King, were all Papiſts, and of a Country where <hi>Popery</hi> is the National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The preſent <hi>French</hi> Kings danger, in 1650, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was from his <hi>Popiſh,</hi> and was delivered chiefly by his reformed Subjects. The Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> had (as none can deny) liberty for exerciſe of their Religion, exceedingly above what the Non-conformiſts had at that time, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that not to be parallelled bloudy, and more than bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Maſſacre, in the year 1641. Nay, the ſteadie great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and quiet of <hi>Sweeden,</hi> is of no elder date, than ſince they caſt off <hi>Popery,</hi> pulled down their Biſhops, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> the Church, having been, until then, the occaſion of much trouble unto that Kingdome. And none of theſe particulars, being deniable, the Papiſts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without great impudence, boaſt (as many of them do) of their fidelity to their Princes, accuſing the Proteſtants with want of it, and eſpecially ſince if theſe inſtances were not enough to make good the aſſertion, that the Proteſtants are the beſt, and Papiſts the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt of Subjects, the like might be obſerved of every individual Country and Nation in the Chriſtian part of <hi>Europe,</hi> in the times of Popery; but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe to be ſufficient, I ſhall not give my ſelf any farther trouble, upon this point, or other domeſtick concern of <hi>England,</hi> but proceed to the external importances of that Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And firſt, As the Foreign Intereſt of a Nation looks out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and in order to its good and preſervation, regards the actings and deſigns of Foreign Princes and States (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Neighbours) endeavouring to reduce them to that which may moſt agree with their own good and ſafety,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59429:18"/>
ſo it is the Intereſt of the King and Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> to make uſe of the advantages their ſtrength and ſituation gives them, in weighing the Imperial powers of Chriſtendome, keeping the balance, by adding to, or diminiſhing from any of them, as beſt ſuits with Juſtice, and their own Intereſts. And as undoubtedly His Majeſty hath done more than any ſince good Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (if for a ſhort time a ſort of people not fit to be remembred did not the ſame) in hitting upon his true Forein Intereſt, in that triple League of which he was the Author, and into which he hath, with ſo much wiſdome and prudence lately entered, for oppoſing all growing greatneſs by Sea or Land, in the <hi>French,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already too potent for their bordering Neighbours, ſo conſtantly and effectually to adhere thereunto, in joyning with all others to that end; and particularly with <hi>Spain,</hi> with whom <hi>England</hi> hath a much more profitable Trade than with <hi>France,</hi> is (according to preſent affairs) the ſame; For ſhould <hi>France,</hi> by the acquiſition of thoſe convenient Provinces and ports of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> become Competitors with <hi>England</hi> in Trade, (to ſay no worſe of them) they would, in a ſhort time, make good Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> Character of them, in <note place="margin">Sir Walter Rawleighs Cabinet Counſellor.</note> being falſe, inſolent, and covetous neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands</hi> (which are, in ordinary diſcourſe underſtood by the name of <hi>Holland,</hi> that Province, by way of eminence, giving denomination unto the whole) are the two great Maſters of Naval ſtrength, and ſeated with ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for aſſiſting each other, that whilſt a true intelligence is preſerved betwixt them, it is not in nature for all their enemies, combining together to prejudice either of them, ſo it is the true Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> to maintain a firm and perpetual friendſhip and union with them; and that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe as the <hi>Netherlands</hi> are naturally ſtrong, ſo they are above all other Countries, fitted by ſituation, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59429:18"/>
the uſe of <hi>England,</hi> to give check to any aſpiring Prince, and be as invincible bulwarks, againſt the all devouring deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> King, in being able at any time, with the countenance of <hi>England,</hi> to deſtroy him at Sea, who being brought down there, and ſo in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, will ſoon abate of his power at Land; and ſurely nothing can be more for the ſecurity of <hi>Europe,</hi> than to reduce the Naval ſtrength of that threatning King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in former bounds, for the world found, that untill the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard loſt his Maritime force, in the year 1639. which he never after recovered, he maintained his deſign for the Univerſal Monarchy, very vigorouſly, and never ſunk till then.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is equally their Intereſt, with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in reference to their Navigation, to keep the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance betwixt the Northern Kings and Sovereigns, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any of them to engroſs that Sea, becauſe Naval Commodities coming thence, neither of them can be ſafe, longer than the Sea remains divided among ſeveral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, whoſe general Intereſt it can never be to deny them neceſſaries for their ſhipping (the chief walls of their ſeveral Countries) or a general Trade with them, as a Monarch, he being ſole Maſter of the whole, would peradventure, in ſome caſes, judge it his, and preſume to refuſe them all accommodations; and this principle, the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> have wiſely, in our dayes, ſeveral times owned, as in the years 1643. in ſiding with the Crown of <hi>Sweeden,</hi> when the <hi>Danes</hi> would (had not the States aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance been in the way) have run them down at Sea; as alſo on the contrary, in the year 1658, in taking part with the <hi>Danes,</hi> when the <hi>Swedes</hi> had otherwiſe done the like by them, by which means, both the Crowns are preſerved, and kept within tolerable limits and bounds.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe that as Providence ſeems to have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them with conveniencies for joyning with <hi>England,</hi> in keeping all other Maritime Princes, or Powers, in order ſo, without any capacity of being dangerous to their Neigh-Neighbours,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59429:19"/>
their Conſtitution being ſuch, as will not well admit of any further acquiſts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe as <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> are of one and the ſame Religion, ſave in ſome Ceremonies, ſo it would be of great incouragement, and countenance to all the Proteſtant Countries, to have a firm League betwixt two ſuch for midable Powers, of their own belief, and as great a trouble and diſturbance, to all the Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Becauſe the world having had ſuch large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the happy ſucceſs of their Conduct, in being principal Inſtruments in preventing the Houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> in their grand deſign for the univerſal Monarchy, and conſequently, in the propagation of the reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as at ſeveral times, in preventing both <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Sweed,</hi> from either of them devouring the other; it were ſurely high impolity, as well as in ſome degree ingratitude, to ſuffer ſuch uſeful inſtruments and allies, to whom this Generation is ſo much obliged, for their wiſe and excellent management of the general Intereſt of theſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Theſe States I know have many enemies, ſome envying their Trade and Riches, others their revolt from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as of bad example, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their eſtabliſhed National Religion, as that which is paſt ſhaking; but becauſe none of theſe arguments can be plauſibly made uſe of againſt them by the Papiſts, who dreads the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England</hi> with them, nor by thoſe Princes, and States, who aſſiſted them in their revolt, the grand reaſon for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of them, is made the greatneſs of their Trade, which being deſtroyed, would be divided amongſt their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, loading them ſometimes untruly, with accuſations of unjuſt dealings, exactions, and falſeneſs; to which I ſhall only anſwer this, that although I have no cauſe to become an Advocate for them, from any advantages or benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet having travelled their Countries, obſerved their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59429:19"/>
Manners, and read their Diſputes, and Tranſactions with other Nations, I think it but an Act of Juſtice to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that in the generality of their Morals, they are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to ſome Nations, (and particularly, in ſo little uſing that art of over-valuing their Commodities in their ſelling to <hi>France,</hi> who ſo ſhamefully uſe and practiſe it) and as to their Treaties, and Alliances, after which I have been inquiſitive, I have ſometimes found them wrongfully charged with breach of Articles, and do not find cauſe to accuſe them of having been in the obſervance of Treaties, leſs candid, or faithful, than other Countries, and I cannot think, their Trade, or Wealth, (although I believe, that <hi>Holland</hi> ſingly taken, is the richeſt ſpot of ground for its bigneſs, that ever was ſince the Creation) to be a good or honeſt foundation of a quarrel: for their Commerce being alone the effects of Induſtry, and Ingenuity, it is no reaſon for any to be angry with others, becauſe they exceed them in theſe Virtues; but beſides, that the deſtroying of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> would be the ſhaking the ſafety of theſe Northern Regions, the increaſe of Trade to other Countries, ſo much promiſed by ſome in their deſtruction, would ſurely fail; for were Trade ruined in <hi>Holland,</hi> as leſs cannot be the effects of Conqueſt and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the example and emulation of their Trade, which hath been the great increaſe of it in other Countries, being taken away, and Trade fallen to a ſort of people of leſs concern for it, men would grow lazy and weary of Commerce, every one thinking they did well, ſo long, as they were upon equal terms with their Neighbours; ſo that the ſubverſion of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would be no benefit to any, ſave to the <hi>French</hi> King, into whoſe mouth their Country would moſt fall, who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing for the making of him uncontroulable, but Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Ports to harbour Ships, nouriſh and breed Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, would find ſupply there, and whoſe Kingdom, being over-ſtocked with people, would be able to ſpair men to plant an un-inhabited Countrey, as would certainly be the fate of <hi>Holland,</hi> under a Conqueſt and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59429:20"/>
as it hath been to all the free Cities in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince they loſt their Liberty; whereas <hi>England</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Havens nor Ports, nor having an over-plus of people, it would be a dammage to them in the loſs of their Inhabitants, and an unprofitable charge to maintain Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Colonies, where the Seas muſt be perpetually croſſed for ſupplying of them with men, monie, and neceſſaries; inſomuch, that the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> under ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they would be reduced unto by ſubduing of them, would not be in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo much for their own ſecurity, as in theirs that now poſſeſs them, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and freedome makes ſo great difference in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that leſs than Liberty, incouraging Trade and Induſtry, would never be able to maintain their Walls againſt the Sea, which are kept up with incredible labour, charge, and ingenuity, but expoſe thoſe parts lying upon the Sea, which are many times more conſiderable than all the reſt, to be devoured by it, or laid much under water, and ſo rendred inconſiderable. And the truth of this principle in thus much advancing the benefit of freedom above Arbitrary Government, which would be the lot of <hi>Holland</hi> under any Conquerour, may be obſerved by the two Cities of <hi>Weſell</hi> and <hi>Maſtrick,</hi> which whilſt in the hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> were without Trade, miſerable, wretched, and poor, many of the houſes of the latter being left in ruines by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as wanting ability to repair them; and now in leſs than 38 or 39 years, that the States have been Maſters of them, they are both become flouriſhing places, the latter being in a great part new built, with one of the faireſt and beſt new publick Town-houſe that is ordinarily met with, next <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and <hi>Augustbourg</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> But if there were not theſe conſiderations in the caſe, as well as that of the advantage that the fall of <hi>Holland</hi> would be to the <hi>French,</hi> which alone is ſufficient to ingage <hi>England</hi> to ſupport them, it could no way be the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to ruine them, to the end to increaſe their own Trade,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59429:20"/>
becauſe if their aims be only traffick, the world affords matter enough to ſatisfie both Nations, and that <hi>England</hi> hath ſo much the advantage of <hi>Holland</hi> in natural helps for Trade, that if they do but improve them, they cannot miſs of exceeding all others in it; and if they will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of their common concerns, they ought not to draw an argument from their own neglects and ſloth, for the envying other mens activity and diligence.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, ſo long as a firm Peace and amity is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>England</hi> with the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> they may look upon them as the out-works, which muſt be firſt taken in by any invader that will attempt them, for as it never can be the Intereſt, or in the power of <hi>Holland,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>England,</hi> ſo their Intereſt in reference to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as Civil ſecurity, will alwayes oblige them not to ſuffer any others to do it, or to endanger them, in whoſe ſafety they can onely be ſafe, it being the clear Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> not to ſuffer any other Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to ſubvert their Government: So that upon the whole, ſince the ſubduing of <hi>Holland</hi> cannot be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit but loſſe to <hi>England,</hi> and may be of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>France,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt which they are impregnable Fortreſſes; with ſome ſmaller pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to other Popiſh Soveraignes bordering upon them; as to the Elector of <hi>Colne,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> &amp;c. It muſt be the chief Forreign Interreſt of <hi>England</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the preſent Governmeut of <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to hold a good Correſpondence with <hi>Spain,</hi> not onely becauſe that People being little inclinable to Commerce gives a Trading Countrey the more advantage in their Friendſhip, but alſo for that that Crowne is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be made uſe of, for the ballancing of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, as the French King ſtriveth for the Protectorſhip of the Romiſh profeſſion, ſo it is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59429:21"/>
ſurely the King of <hi>England's</hi> Intereſt, to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (wherein he can have no oppoſition) the General Protector of the Proteſtant Religion; whereby he will become more formidable, and glorious, then he can by other means: For as Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> adhering thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and cordially to that Party; advancing the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, holding intelligence, and taking part with them in all their engagements, and conſiderable treaties; was not onely able in the infancy of the reformation in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to maintain the reformed in <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> againſt their Enemies, their then ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Soveraignes, but alſo, at laſt to bring down <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Spain</hi> (one of the wiſeſt, and greateſt Kings they ever had) and in him, the whole Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Party; by which her memory is made famous unto poſterity; ſo his Majeſty having many leſſe difficulties, to ſtruggle with, than ſhe had by eſpouſing the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, cannot fail of the like glorious ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>And now, to ſum up the Domeſtick Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> it lyeth in the advancement of Trade, by removing all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions both in City and Country, providing ſuch Laws, as may any way help it, and make it moſt eaſie, eſpecially in giving Liberty of Conſcience to all Proteſtant Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, and denying it to Papiſts; In not covering Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Conqueſts, which have alwayes been prejudicial and can never be of advantage to them: and retrench the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Fees of Lawyers, Phyſicians, and Officers, as they are great iimpoveriſhers of the Nation: And as to the Foreign Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> that may be calculated, to be in keeping the balance among their Neighbours, and other <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean Princes,</hi> being in order thereunto, firm to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tripple League, and in that eſpecially to <hi>Holland,</hi> in holding a good correſpondence with <hi>Spain,</hi> and in being jealous of all growing greatneſs in the <hi>French,</hi> keeping the Baltick Sea open, in His Majeſties making himſelf Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the whole Proteſtant party, and as Peace is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advancer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59429:21"/>
of Trade, to ſeek it, and not war, except an inavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity require it. And thus I ſhall conclude this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in it, the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> with begging pardon of the Author of that Book, intituled, A Diſcourſe of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical politie, for my Non-conformity to his Doctrine, which teacheth, That it is ſafer for a Prince to allow Vice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, than Liberty of Conſcience, whereby he prefers the breach of the ten Commandments, and that which the whole Word of God, the Old and New Teſtament, the Law and Goſpel, ſo dreadfully threatens, and declares againſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, which neither the practiſe of our Saviour, nor his Apoſtles, nor any Text in Scripture forbids, or at leaſt, himſelf being Judge, not poſitively, and indiſputably, as they do the other; wherein, I confeſs, I am ſo far from agreeing with him, as alſo in many of his other railing principles, not much better, that I think the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath reaſon to wiſh his Book had been writ by ſome of another Coat, and of a more remote relation to the Church, then the Author is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be, by reaſon of the advantage that their enemies may have, of drawing arguments from it, to prove their old Charge, that the power of godlineſs is ſo far from being held out, in the Lives, Converſations, and Principles of many of their Prieſts, that they rather ſeek to debauch, and make the people wicked and profane.</p>
            <p>This is all I have at preſent to ſay of this Country, beſides adventuring to Propheſie, that when <hi>England,</hi> (neglecting Church Politicks, which are commonly founded in paſſion, revenge, and ſelf, and Lawyers Divinity, which is generally collected out of their own Books, more than the Books of God) will effectually purſue their true Intereſt, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail (their natural advantages for trade conſidered) of being more great and glorious than any other Nation.</p>
