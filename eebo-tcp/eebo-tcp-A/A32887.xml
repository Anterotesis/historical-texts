            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Admirable and Glorious Appearance of
the Eternal God, in his Glorious Power, in and through a
CHILD, of the Age of betwixt Eight and Nine Years,
upon her dying Bed, opening her Mouth to ſpeak forth his
Praiſe, and Extol his Reverent Holy Name and Power:
A ſhort Relation whereof, together with her Exerciſe
throughout her Sickneſs, is hereafter collected, or ſo much
thereof as was by us certainly Remembred.</head>
            <p>UPON the 13th day of the 7th month, 1682. did the
Lord Viſit <hi>Sarah</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Ann
Camme</hi> of <hi>Camſgill</hi> with Sickneſs, the which for about
two days was but gentle upon her, but afterwards grew
more hot and extream, increaſing almoſt continually, till ſhe
was in Mercy taken to reſt with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Many ſweet and comfortable Expreſſions paſſed from her all
along in her Sickneſs, when ſhe was ſencible, being ſatisfied ſhe
ſhould be taken away, often ſignifying the ſame to us; ſaying
alſo, <hi>That ſhe was neither afraid nor unwilling to Dye, but freely given
up thereto in the will of her God;</hi> deſiring us many times <hi>to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</hi>
and if at any time ſhe ſaw us her Parents or Siſter ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
as to weep, ſhe would cry, <hi>Oh! do not ſo, do not ſo;</hi> and
take us in her Arms, tenderly Kiſſing and Imbracing us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>About an hour and a half before her departure, the Lord in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mercy was pleaſed to give her a time of eaſe, and perfect ſenſe;
and alſo, in a wonderful and more eſpecial manner, in opening her
mouth to ſpeak forth and declara his high Praiſes, who out of the
Mouth of Babes and Sucklings can perfect the ſame, and verily did
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31492:2"/>
at that time through this tender Child, to the admiration of all
that were about her, and unſpeakable Joy of her Parents and
Relations; part of thoſe Memorable and Weighty ſayings, that
through the Operation of the Power and Spirit of Jeſus, through
her were uttered, were preſently written down, as ſpoken, and
the reſt added thereto, as brought to our Remembrance, for
that end chiefly, that God may have the glory of his own Work,
who is worthy forever.</p>
            <p>The aboveſaid 13th day, being the 4th day of the Week;
and the day following, her Sickneſs was not ſo Extream, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it grew to be, but more mild and gentle, as beforeſaid;
but upon the 6th day of the Week, being the 15th day of the
Month, her Diſtemper increaſed to a great height of Extremity,
ſo that her Pain and Exerciſe was great; yet notwithſtanding ſhe
was very patient under the ſame, only many Deep Sighs, and
Heart-afflicting Groans, proceeded from her; wherefore her
Father asked her, <hi>If ſhe could not breath and pray to the Lord for Help
and Aſſiſtance?</hi> Her anſwer was, <hi>She could and did;</hi> and further
ſaid, <hi>It was her Belief, that the Lord, the great God of Heaven and
Earth, he would keep her and preſerve her Soul, whatever might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of her Body;</hi> and often ſhe ſweetly ſupplicated the Lord for
his Aſſiſtance and Help, &amp; alſo bleſſed &amp; praiſed his Holy Name,</p>
            <p>And thus ſhe continued in exceeding great Pain and Exerciſe,
yet very patient under it, and ſenſible, till about the middle of
the firſt day of the Week following, not having ſlept above a
quarter of an Hour, all thoſe ſeveral days of her Sickneſs ſo that
through want of Sleep, and the violence of the Diſtemper, her
head grew light, and ſhe was at ſeveral times not ſo ſenſible in
her Expreſſions, yet very Harmleſs and Innocent; for ſhe ſtill
retained ſo much ſenſe as to know all that were about her, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
deſireing and begging to be helped home to her own Bed;
ſaying, <hi>That ſhe could not Rest nor Sleep till ſhe came there,</hi> and the
like, and thus ſhe lay till about the middle of the morrow, being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31492:2"/>
the ſecond day of the week, and the 18th day of the month,
only weakened and ſpent very much; and then as we were help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her a little up upon the Bed, ſhe on a ſudden (as we thought)
fainted, her head bowing down into her boſom, whereupon we
lifted it up, but perceiving that ſhe did not faint, but lay ſtill in
her Fathers arms, we waited by her a little while, her Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible, and ſignifying the ſame to the Family that was
ſtanding by, that there was a more then ordinary Exerciſe upon
her Mind and Spirit, notwithſtandi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g ſhe lay ſo quiet and ſtill,
yea, more then ſhe had done for four days before, for her Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
had been ſo great, that ſhe turned every way, and removed
her Head, Hands, and Feet often from place to place, before
that time; but after a little ſpace, through the power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Life, ſhe was revived both in Body and Spirit, and bore up
her head, and ſate upright in the Bed, as if ſhe had been well,
looking upon her Parents, Brother and Siſter, with ſeveral others
about her, with an exceeding Cheerful and Beautified Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
being overſhaddowed with the Glory of the Eternal God,
and his living precious Power filling her Soul, by the Operation
whereof her Mouth was wonderfully opened in many weighty and
living Expreſſions, many of which, as to the Subſtance and ſenſe,
as near as we could remember, are inſerted as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Sins are forgiven me, and I ſhall have a Reſting-place in Heaven.</hi>
Then looking upon her Mother, ſhe held out her Arms to her,
and renderly Embraced and Kiſſed her, ſaying, <hi>Oh! my Dear
Mother! there's alſo a place prepared for thee in Heaven, and thou ſhalt
as certainly enjoy it as any here: I do not,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>deſire my Mothers
death, or to be removed from you; yet we ſhall meet in Heaven</hi> (whether
ſhe ſaid <hi>in a ſhort time,</hi> or <hi>in Gods time,</hi> we could not certainly
underſtand; for her Voice after a while ſpeaking grew low and
weak, and then ſhe would pauſe a little, and lye ſtill, till the
Lords Power again revived and gave her Utterance, in the time
of her Stilneſs) ſeeing her Mother and moſt about her weep,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31492:3"/>
ſhe ſaid, <hi>Oh! do not weep; do not ſo; you ſhould not do ſo; I am well,
I am well; never better ſince I had a day;</hi> and kiſſed moſt about her
one by one, ſaying, <hi>Do not cry, but be content in the will of God, for
I am ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her Father perceiving that 'twas an Exerciſe to her, to ſee thoſe
about her to ſorrow, deſired all beſides himſelf, who were on
the Bed with her, to withdraw for a while; but quickly ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them in again, and began to ſpeak on this wiſe: <hi>Shall I go
down to the horrible Pit? nay; the Lord hath redeemed my Soul to
praiſe his Name on High forever: Oh! Praiſes, Praiſes to the
Lord; Bleſs his Holy Name, O my Soul;</hi> and ſo went on in many
ſweet Expreſſions of Praiſe, and ſweet melodious Sounds, for a
pretty time; then ſhe called her Brother unto her, and ſaid,
<hi>Ah!</hi> John, <hi>What hath it profitted thee, that thou haſt ſo grieved thy
Dear Mother, that hath ſo tenderly brought thee up?</hi> with more words
to that effect, together with tender advice, <hi>not to do ſo any more,</hi>
which we could not exactly take from her, becauſe her voice
grew low; ſo pauſed a little, after which ſhe called for her Siſter,
and Embraced and Kiſſed her often very tenderly with great
Affection, and a very Amiable Cheerful Countenance, beyond
Expreſſion, and bad her Siſter <hi>be content; for it is and will be well
with me,</hi> ſhe ſaid, <hi>and I muſt go to a more fine place then ever mine
eyes beheld, it will be well with me, and all that fear the Lord; for we
ſhall have everlaſting joy in Heaven, when the Wicked ſhall be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Hell;</hi> and ſeeing her Siſter full of Sorrow and Weeping by
her, ſhe pulled her unto her, and Embraced her, ſaying, <hi>Do not
ſo, Dear</hi> Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>do not cry, leſt thou grieve the Lord; be ſubject to
the Lord, will all things, and love and be faithful to the Truth; and
do not forſake the Religion, whatever thou may ſuffer for it; though
thou ſhould <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

If thou doſt,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it will not be ſo well:</hi> Then ſhe ſpoke to the
Maid Seruant, and bade her alſo <hi>be Faithful, and not forſake the
Truth, and her Riligion, when tryed; for they will try thee,</hi> ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31492:3"/>
but whom ſhe meant, when ſhe ſaid, <hi>they will try thee,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not.)</p>
            <p>Further ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am ſatisfied in the Truth, and with my Religion;
I would not forſake it, though I ſhould be fed with the Bread of Adverſity,
and the Water of Affliction; Oh! Praiſes, Praiſes, to my God, my
Father, and Our Father, which art in Heaven, Hollowed be thy Name,</hi>
&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end of that Prayer twice over, with a low voice,
yet might be heard; and then the third time begun it with a
more audible Voice, and went on to that Sentence, <hi>[Thy will be
done in Earth, as it's done in Heaven.]</hi> which ſhe ſpoke very
weightily and deliberately; and then ſignifying unto us, <hi>that
we were all to mind that; for I am freely given up,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to his
bleſſed Will in all things; Praiſes, Praiſes, to my God; bleſs his Name,
Oh! my Soul;</hi> and ſo pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſed a little, being in her Fathers Arms,
and in a little time looked cheerfully upon him, and kiſſed him
often, ſaying, <hi>Oh! my dear Father, thou haſt been very tender and
carefull over me, and haſt taken great pains with me in my Sickneſs,
but it availeth not, there's no help nor ſuccour for me in the Earth;
it's the Lord that's my help and Phyſician, and he will give me eaſe and
rest Everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About two days before we had ſent for a Doctor, who came
twice to her two ſeveral days; the firſt time ſhe asked, <hi>Whether
he was a Friend? if ſo, ſhe would take what he preſcribed; othewiſe
ſhe would not willingly:</hi> at his ſecond coming, one came and told
her, <hi>Her Doctor was come; My Doctor!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>he is not my
Doctor, he can do me no good; its not he, nor any thing in the Earth
that can help me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to what was further declared by her; ſhe called
to all the Family to come unto her, and they came, and ſome others
alſo that were come into the Houſe; and then ſhe Kiſſed her
Father and Mother, Brother and Siſter, Grandmother and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and took leave of every one in particuler; ſaying <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Farewell,</hi> with an exceeding pleaſant and cheerful Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31492:4"/>
as if ſhe had been overcome with joy and gladneſs, her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being gone out of her ſight to write down part of her words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
written, ſhe call'd him by <hi>name,</hi> &amp; kiſſed him again, &amp; ſpoke
ſeveral words to him, but her voice was ſo low, that we could not
take them exactly; but tended to Advice, to <hi>Fear God, Love Truth,</hi>
and <hi>Obe his Mother;</hi> and then pauſed a little, and lay ſtill; after a
little time ſhe reached to us again, and kiſſed us one by one with
great Affection and Cheerfulneſs, and biding every particuler of
us <hi>Farewell, Farewell,</hi> then looking round about upon all that were
about her, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Farewell unto you all, only Farewell, Amen, Amen;</hi>
ſignifying thereby that ſhe had no more to ſay to us, but to bid us
Farewel; ſo went on ſweetly Lauding and Praiſing the Lord, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Oh! Praiſes, Praiſes, to the Lord, O my Soul, Bleſs and Praiſe thou
his Holy Name for Ever, and for Evermore;</hi> and ſpoke few or no
more words, but continued a pretty time in a ſweet &amp; harmonious
Sounding forth Praiſes, making Melody in her Heart to the
Lord, very comfortable and refreſhing, tendering all that were
about her into Tears, being as cheerful in her Countenance as
ever, nay, far beyond what it was in her perfect Health; the
glory of God overſhaddowing and reſting upon her, the ſenſe
whereof gladed our Hearts abundantly, and the Remembrance
thereof is ſweet to us beyond all Expreſſions, being thereby raiſed
in a great meaſure over the ſenſe of ſorrow for the loſs of her,
and we acknowledge it to be an eſpecial Kindneſs which our
God in mercy bleſſed us with, not only in reſtoring her to perfect
ſenſe over the violence of her Malignant Diſtemper, which had
for ſome time, as aforeſaid, made her unſenſible in her Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but alſo in his Wonderful Appearance, in giving Mouth
and Wiſdom to this tender Child, to ſpeak forth ſuch weighty
and admirable things, his favour herein we hope ſhall by us
never be forgotten; but he ſhall by us have the Praiſe and the
Glory of his own Work, who is Worthy, God Bleſſed for Ever.</p>
            <p>In the end of that Melodious Sounding, which continued near
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31492:4"/>
half an hour, ſhe ſeemed to faint; ſo that we ſuppoſed ſhe would
preſently depart; yet notwithſtanding continued half an Hour
longer, and paſſed through ſeveral ſharp Pangs; but in the end
finiſhed very ſweetly, and our Spirits were ſenſible of her Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
into endleſs Glory; and there ſhe reſts with God the
Father of Spirits in Joy Everlaſting, being taken from the Evil
to come, and freed from all Sorrow and Pain, and Tears for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
wiped from her Eyes, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From her Cradle ſhe was a Child of a weak Conſtitution of
Body, afflicted with ſeveral Sickneſſes, by which ſhe was kept
low and tender in her Spirit, exceeding ſober, never addicted to
any Evil; we know not of any that ever heard her ſpeak any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury
word; tenderly affected to all, but eſpecially her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and Relations; delighted much in reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and eſpecially ſuch places as had relation to God's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and Providence to Children; ſhe alſo took great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to read the Teſtimony of Friends to the Appearance of God's
Power in Young Children, whether in their Health, or on their
Dying Beds; and had got ſeveral printed Books that had relation
thereto. Furthermore, She had great delight in reading of the
faithfulneſs of ſuch as had ſuffered for Truths ſake, whether in this
Age, or Ages paſt; and before ſhe could ſpeak plain, or read
perfectly, ſhe had got off Book by heart moſt of thoſe ſenſible
Letters, written in Verſe by <hi>Robert Smith,</hi> Martyr, to his Wife,
Brother and Children, as they are inſerted in the <hi>Book of Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Pity ſhe had to Poor People, that came to ſeek Relief,
eſpecially Children, that ſhe would not only have fed them, but
many times would have brought them on their way, and ſitten
down with them in the Fields; and often when ſhe had ſeen plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Victuals, <hi>Oh!</hi> would ſhe ſay, <hi>that ſuch a Poor Child had this,
or that; how glad would it make them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, She was one in whom we her Parents had great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and Comfort <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lso tender and obedient was ſhe at all times,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31492:5"/>
that her Father had never occaſion given to uſe the Rod. The
Loſs of ſo good and hopeful a Child, in whom we might have
expected ſo great Comfort, often comes near us; yet with true
Submiſſion to the Will of God, where we find Peace and Reſt,
knowing that our Loſs, in her being removed from us, is her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
Gain.</p>
            <p>Her Diſtemper was ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>
accompanying them, although there was but little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the <hi>Pox;</hi> for they came little out, only ſome ſmall ones
about her Face and Hands. She Dyed in the Ninth Year of
her Age, wanting about Eleven Dayes of Nine Years, being
the 18th day of the 7th moneth, in the year 1682.</p>
            <p>And inaſmuch as we have a hope in the Lord, that there may
be a ſervice (in publiſhing in print what is above written) to
many, eſpecially ſuch as are young in years; and alſo that it
may tend to the Glory of the living, eternal, powerful, wiſe God,
who is wonderful in his Works o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in the diſcharge of our Duty, to publiſh the ſame in print, being
alſo much preſt thereto by many Friends, who have heard and ſeen
the ſame; and now leave the Iſſue to the Lord, who is worthy of
all the Praiſe, Glory and Renown, World without End, <hi>Amen.</hi>
