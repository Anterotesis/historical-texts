            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ABSTRACT Of the Title to the Lands in Wapping-Marſh, And other Places near Adjoyning, belonging to the MANNOR Of <hi>Stepney</hi> or <hi>Stebunheath,</hi> Called Ewell <hi>alias</hi> Tilehouſe.</head>
            <p>THE Inheritance of the Mannor of <hi>Stepney,</hi> called <hi>Ewell</hi> alias <hi>Tilehouſe,</hi> reaching from St. <hi>Catherines</hi> to <hi>Ratcliff-Town,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Abbot of <hi>Graces,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Acons,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Windham</hi>; All which Intereſts, <hi>Stepkin</hi> (the Lady <hi>Ivie's</hi> Anceſtor) purchaſed above one hundred years ſince.</p>
            <p>Part of thoſe Lands were afterwards Sold by <hi>Stepkin,</hi> part by Grants let out upon long Leaſes, reſerving Pepper-cornes, or ſome ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Rents; and part in Poſſeſſion, together with the Reverſions of thoſe Leaſes deſcended to the Lady <hi>Ivie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Leaſes lately generally expired; the Lady <hi>Ivie</hi> thereupon claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and endeavoured to recover, the Reverſions, as her proper Right; but met with theſe difficulties.</p>
            <p>The difficulties of diſcovering the Antient Boundaries, occaſioned by the Buildings, the alteration of Names, the changing Water-courſes, the adjoyning to and mixture with ſome Ancient Purchaſers, under the ſame Title; and Ancient Leaſe-holders, under ſome other Titles: And the Oppoſitions of divers men of potent Intereſt and Influence: All which notwithſtanding ſhe overcame, and made out her Title by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Records, at ſeveral Tryals.</p>
            <p>There have been ſome Aſperſions lately caſt upon the Lady <hi>Ivie's</hi> Title, and by Conſequence upon the Title of the Purchaſers, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mortgagees: All which Titles ſpring from one and the ſame Root, and have one and the ſame Original: None of which Aſperſions

(tho' moſt notoriouſly falſe, as will in due time appear) affect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, by which the Title hath been or may be hereafter fully made out.

            <p>ABout <hi>one hundred and thirty</hi> Acres of this Mannor were drowned about the 25th. year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> reaching from St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therines</hi> on the Weſt, to <hi>Ratcliff-Town</hi> on the Eaſt: It was drained by one <hi>Vanderdelff</hi>; who, by agreement of the Proprietors, was to have one Moiety for his pains; which he ſold to <hi>Richard Hill.</hi>
