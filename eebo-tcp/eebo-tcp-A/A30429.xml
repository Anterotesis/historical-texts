            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 SAM. XXIII. 3, 4.</bibl>
               <q>The God of Israel said, The Rock of
Israel spake to me: He that ruleth
over men, must be just, ruling in the
fear of the Lord.</q>
               <q>And he shall be as the light of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when the Sun riseth; even a
morning without clouds; as the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grass springing out of the earth by
clear shining after rain.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the peculiar glory of
Humane Nature, that Man is
made after the Image of
God: and therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
of Honour among
Men, ought to be taken from
the Characters of the Divine Nature and
Perfections that appear in them. Higher
degrees of Capacity bring men so much
the nearer to the Infinite Compass of that


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65545:5"/>
Eternal Mind. The Elevations of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
are approaches to that unbounded
Power to which all things are subject.
Yet, though there is somewhat in these
which is apt to strike the World with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is another resemblance of the
Divinity which has a more peculiar beauty
in it, that consists in Justice and Goodness.
The other may subdue the World, but this
only overcomes mens hearts, and triumphs
over their Thoughts, as much as the Greatest
Monarch can do over their Persons. Power
without Goodness is the justest Object of
mens fear and aversion; and every man is
on his guard against Wisdom, when it is
not guided by Justice. An Elevation of
Condition, without a more real Dignity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the mind, is only the exposing of
those who are cloathed with that ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Greatness to a brighter light, and
more observation, by which their Defects,
which might have passed without any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
Comments made on them, if they had
lived in a greater obscurity, become the
more Conspicuous, and are by consequence


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65545:5"/>
the more censured. Those who are raised
up to a high Eminence of Dignity, are so
much the more accountable both to God
and man, not only for all the Ill which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they themselves, or others acting in
their Name, or by their Example, may have
done, but likewise for all the Good which
they might have done, but did not. And
as they have much to answer for to God,
so likewise men expect much from them;
and will be severe in exacting that, to which
they think they have so just a right. God
will indeed forgive their Errors, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of them; but men will not be so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful.
They will vent their Indignation, if
they cannot on their Persons, yet at least
on their Memories. The Flatterers of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperors were not more Ingenious
in Inventing new Rites of Divine Adoration
to their Arrogant Masters, during their lives,
than their Oppressed Subjects were to find
out peculiar marks of Infamy for the loading
their Memories after their death. And it is
certain, That as the Memory of Good Princes
shall be in <hi>everlasting remembrance;</hi> so the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65545:6"/>
of Bad ones shall either quite <hi>perish,</hi> or
shall <hi>rot;</hi> either they shall be quite forgotten,
or they shall be remembred indeed, but it shall
be with all possible scorn and horror.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is that <hi>David</hi> being to leave
these as his <hi>last words</hi> to all posterity, as well
as to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and such as should descend
from him; and intending to put all the
weight in them, that could be in words, he
introduces them with much pomp, to give
them the more authority. It is not only said,
that these are <hi>his last words,</hi> tho that must na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
create respect, especially when it is a
King that speaks after long Experience; and a
Reigns as full of all varieties of Accidents as any
is in History; But Attention is also here raised
by a Poetical redoubling of many lofty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
<hi>David, the Son of Jesse, said; the
man that was raised up on high, the Anointed of
the God of Jacob, and the sweet Psalmist of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
said.</hi> And because the Instruction that
was to be given, was too Important to rest
upon a Human Authority, how eminent soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it might be, another set of Expressions
that are yet more sublime, comes after these.


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65545:6"/>
               <hi>The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his
word was in my tongue: The God of Israel said,
the Rock of Israel spake to me: He that ruleth
over men must be just, ruling in the fear of the Lord.</hi>
Here are the true measures of Government;
it is a <hi>Rule,</hi> and not an Absolute Dominion;
it is a <hi>Rule over men,</hi> and not a Power, like
that which we have over Beasts. In a
word, it is the Conduct of free and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Beings, who need indeed to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but ought not to be broken by the force
and weight of Power.</p>
            <p>Those who manage this Power, and Rule
over Men, <hi>must be just,</hi> and act according to
those Eternal and Unalterable Rules of
Truth and Goodness, which are both inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the word <hi>Just.</hi> This is Universal, and
binds all Princes equally; but such as have the
advantages of a more particular Revelation of
the Will of God, come under another Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
of <hi>Ruling in his fear,</hi> and of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
that Authority which is put in their
hands, according to that light with which he
has blest them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65545:7"/>
These words contain the Duty, and give
the Character of a good Prince; and those
which follow, set forth the Happiness of such a
Government, from two very natural Figures,
which are apt to make great Impressions on
us: A temperate Air, and a clear Sky; a fair
Morning, and an unclouded Sun, are things
which do not only please, but animate; they
quicken and exhilarate our Spirits; and a
kindly Spring, in which all the Productions
of the Earth shoot out abundantly upon the
due intermixtures of Rain and Sun, of
Heat and Moisture, gives the Earth a new
Face, and a new Life to all that dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>And he shall be as the light of the morning,
when the Sun riseth; even a morning without
clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the
earth by clear shining after rain.</p>
            <p>These being Blessings which all Men feel,
and in which every Man rejoices; it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
natural Piece of Rhetorick, to set forth
the Happiness of a good Government under
such Figures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65545:7"/>
This then which is so Elegantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to us, is a <hi>Rule,</hi> and a <hi>Rule over men.</hi>
It is a <hi>Rule,</hi> and not an Arbitrary Power,
without Laws and Measures. Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
born free, and so he has a Right to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
but he is born likewise with so much
frailty in his Composition, that he wants
Conduct, and must be kept under Rule. It
is a Question not easily determined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a State of Liberty, without any restraint,
that leaves all Men to a full freedom of
acting as they please; or a State of Restraint,
that shuts out all Liberty, is the more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the two. The one subdues whole
Nations to the Humours of one flattered and
abused Tyrant; and the other exposes Men
to the Frauds and Violences of all their
Neighbours; this keeps all Men in a constant
State of War, and that makes them languish
under a base depression of Spirit. In one
word, the one makes Men Beasts of Prey,
and the other makes them Beasts of Burden.
The Mean between these two Extreams, is a
Just Government, that conducts those who
are under it, by constant and fixed Rules,


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65545:8"/>
that limits Mens Rights, and restrains their
Passions; that subdues the Haughty, and
protects the Humble; that assures to every
Man both his just Birth-rights, and the
fruits of his Industry; and, to sum up all
that renders every Man safe, and that puts
him in a way to make himself happy.
Without this, Man-kind would grow into
so much disorder, that the World would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Desert, and Life it self would be a
Misery, if to live without all Rule over Men,
were the Condition of living. A firm and
steady, an equal and uniform, but above all,
a just Government, changes the whole Scene;
every man feels that he is secure, and sees
how he may be happy: and unless the whole
Government falls under a General Distress, no
man can be miserable without Remedy, but
through his own fault. This is the Sum of
all the Happiness that can be expected from
Government: But as it is a Rule, and not a
sullen Authority; so it is a <hi>Rule over Men,</hi>
suitable to the Principles of Reason, to the
Nature of man, and to the Ends of Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
To govern by Humour or Willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65545:8"/>
either shewing an unreasonable Stiffness,
in adhering too sullenly to received Maxims,
or an unfixed Levity, that has no measures,
to impose things meerly because those in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
will shew their Power, and will be
obeyed; to put the Frailties of Men to trials
in their Obedience, that are above Humane
Patience; to exact of them that which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impossible or unreasonable, and to carry
this Rule too far into that which is God's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Province, I mean, <hi>Mens Consciences:</hi>
All this is not the Ruling over Men, either as
Men or as Christians: God himself has made
<hi>his Yoke easie,</hi> and therefore those who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no higher than to be his Vicegerents,
should not exceed those Limits, within which
the Author of our Being has restrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Undue Impositions, and unrelenting Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities;
a Rigour in Commanding, and a
Cruelty in Punishing, must find Patterns else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
then in Gods Governing the World,
or in Christs Governing the Church. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
we, who are delivered from both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
who neither lie under the Terror of
a Despotick Power, nor are cast loose to the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65545:9"/>
wildness of ungovern'd Multitudes; who
neither groan under the Tyranny of Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
nor the Madness of Lawless Men; and
whose Laws are neither writ on Sand, nor
with Blood; neither easie to be defaced; nor
cruel in their Execution.</p>
            <p>But how well tempered soever our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
may be, nothing can compleat our
happiness, but the Justice of those who rule
over us: Then may we reckon our selves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
happy, when they are truly <hi>Just; Just,</hi> I
say, to their People, and to themselves; to
their Laws, and to their own Words and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
chiefly to such as is the Sacred
Oath of this Great Day; and when they are
so exactly scrupulous in point of Truth,
that all men see, that there is no part of the
Government so unalterable as their Faith is:
<hi>Just</hi> likewise to every one of their Subjects,
sheltring them all under an Impartial Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
neither perverting Justice themselves, nor
suffering it to be perverted, as far as in them
lies, by any that act in their Name; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to make severe Examples of all that
they can discover, who make them the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65545:9"/>
of their Oppression: <hi>Just</hi> to the whole
Society, and the Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as to every Individual Member
of it; not breaking through the Limits of
their Power, nor invading the Rights of their
People; neither inventing new Pretensions of
Prerogative, nor stretching those that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to them, to the Ruine of their Subjects:
<hi>Just</hi> in distributing the Publick Rewards, with
a due regard to mens Capacities and Merits;
and even <hi>Just</hi> in that which to Good Kings is
always the least acceptable Exercise of their
Power; I mean, in punishing the froward
and disobedient, when the ill Effects of their
Lenity are visible; for there are Cases in
which Gentleness to particular Persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an Injustice to the whole Body.
When Blood is shed, it cries against the
Murderer, till it is pardoned; but then the
Cry turns upon those that pardon it, and
upon the Land that is <hi>defiled with Blood.</hi> There
is, after all, a Justice in shewing Mercy, as well
as in punishing; otherwise Princes may fall
into the Error of being <hi>righteous overmuch:</hi>
And when the Motives for Mercy are brought


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65545:10"/>
near an Equality to those of the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
the Ballance should ever turn to the
merciful side. He understood Government
well,<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 28.</note> that said, <hi>Mercy and truth preserve the
King, and his Throne is upheld by mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Character of a <hi>Just Prince, who
sitteth on the Throne of Judgment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and scattereth
away all evil with his eyes.</hi> There is a Majesty
in Justice that makes all unrighteousness fly,
and hide its face before it:<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 12.</note> It is <hi>by righteousness
that the Throne is established.</hi> When every
man feels the Blessings of such a Ruler, all
men are easie, and pursue their Industry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they know they shall reap the Fruit of
their Labour; and every man becomes a
Guard to the Government, that finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
guarded by it. It is neither the Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of a few ambitious and restless Spirits,
nor the Practices of those who are corrupted
by the Enemies of a State, that can throw
it into Convulsions, as long as Justice and
Righteousness issue out from the Throne in
so free a course, that they run down like a
River.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65545:10"/>
When <hi>righteous lips are the delight of Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16. 13.</note>
and when the <hi>wicked are put away from before
them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25. 5.</note> and when they esteem it <hi>their honour
to search out matters,</hi> not being abused by
bold Calumnies, or unjust Representations:
When they relieve the Poor, and protect the
Oppressed, then by a noble sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and Enlargement of Empire and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
they become the absolute Masters
of the Hearts and Hands of their Subjects:
When instead of making their Will the
Measure of the Law, they make the Law
the Measure of their Will, they will then
feel the easiness of Ruling justly, as sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
as their People will the happiness of
it; for here they will see their way very
plain before them, whereas in all other
paths they must be often divided between
an irreconcileable variety of Interests and
Passions.</p>
            <p>But after all, though it is a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
when Rulers seem to have Justice so
deeply rooted in their natures, that every
act of Injustice is as a Violence done them;


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65545:11"/>
yet unless there is a more lasting Principle
formed in them, their Noble and Vertuous
Inclinations will be so often crossed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Interests, and they will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so often beset with corrupt Men,
who court forbidden Gain, and love the
<hi>wages of unrighteousness,</hi> that it will not be
possible for them to maintain their Integrity,
if they have not a Principle within them
of such force, that it bears all things down
before it; and that is the <hi>fear of God:</hi> This
will possess their minds with a secret awe
of that Supreme Being, which sees <hi>all things,</hi>
and discovers even <hi>the hidden things of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty:</hi>
This will accustom Princes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that how much soever they may be
raised above their Subjects, yet they are as
nothing before that God, who as he set
them up by his Providence, so he can pull
them down at his pleasure.<note place="margin">Psal. 107. 4.</note> 
               <hi>He poureth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon Princes;</hi> and when he blasts the
Counsels, and intends to defeat the Designs
of the Greatest and Loftiest Monarchs, how
easily do Crowns fall, and Thrones shake?
This <hi>fear of God</hi> will make Princes often


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65545:11"/>
remember,<note place="margin">Psal. 82. 6, 7.</note> even in the Pride of all their
Glory, that though then they look <hi>like Gods,</hi>
yet they must <hi>die like Men;</hi> this Prospect
will make them think sometimes on the
melancholy Reflections which the approaches
of Death will probably raise within them,
if they at any time for the encrease of
their Treasure, or their Power, or for any
ambitious or ill Design, have perverted
Judgment, or denied Justice; if they have
shed Innocent Blood, or shut their Ears
against the Cries of the Miserable: The
remembrance of these things will then raise
Agonies in their Minds, which they will
not be able to soften by any of all those
Diversions with which they entertained
themselves in their Health and flourishing
Condition. The Violences that they have
committed, and the Blood which they have
shed, will then stick too close to their
Thoughts to be easily shaken off by them:
Or if they could be so charmed with the
sweetness of Empire, that it should make
them deaf to all Clamours in this World;
yet as soon as their Souls pass out of their


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65545:12"/>
Bodies, they must leave their Crowns and
all their Glory behind them, and go into
a state where all the Distinctions that now
look so gay and so shining, will signifie
nothing, unless it be to add to their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
to encrease their Guilt, and to
heighten their Condemnation. Then they
must appear at a Tribunal, where there is
no respect of Persons; where the Cries of
those Widows and Orphans whom they either
made, or oppressed, or at least refused to
relieve, will be heard; and every one of
those Complaints against which their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
secured them when on Earth, will be
weighed in the Scales of Impartial Justice.
Then those Princes who have hardned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the Miseries of Mankind,
against all that effusion of Blood and Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
which their desire of Glory, their
Ambition, or their Revenge occasioned in
the injust Wars which they have made,
will find that they have a just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God to deal with,<note place="margin">Joh. 34. 19.</note> that <hi>accepteth not
the Persons of Princes,</hi> that <hi>revengeth Innocent
Blood,</hi> especially the <hi>Blood of his Saints,</hi> and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65545:12"/>
that will <hi>reward every man according to his
works.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 27.</note> These are all Considerations of
such mighty force, which rise out of the
<hi>fear of God,</hi> that if Princes do not shut
them quite out of their minds they will
certainly make all their Maxims of Justice
so much the firmer, as they are graffed upon
this stock, and nourished with these and
such like Reflections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruling in the fear of the Lord,</hi> does not
only import, that this is the Prince's se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Motive and constant Remembrancer,
but that the <hi>Fear of God</hi> becomes the Rule
of the Government, as well as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of him that governs. Few Princes
are so bad as to own that they have no
regard to Religion in any thing they doe:
It is a strong temptation to their Subjects to
shake off their Yoke, when they openly
shake off God's: but as many as
make a pretence of their Religion, do
with it, as they do who wear Masks,
which rather hide than disguise them; for


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65545:13"/>
none take the Vizar for the true Face,
though it covers it: They use Religion
for the hiding some secret deformities;
but the Mask is so course, that though all
Men cannot see what is under it, yet they
plainly discern that it is but a Mask. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
as all other things that we wear,
is capable of new Fashions, and of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Modes; and the Skill of those who
use it, is to find out that which is most
likely to take, and to suit it with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion. In one Age, the endowing
of Monasteries, and the building of
Churches, could sanctifie the greatest Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
The Devotion of another Age, was
the carrying over vast Armies to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
in the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> At another time,
a Zeal for some new Doctrine, or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
piece of Worship, was the Holiness
in Vogue: The being given up blindly
to a Confessor, the breaking of Faith, and
the persecuting of Hereticks, to signifie a
zeal for Holy Church, can serve with some
to cover a multitude of Sins. At some


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65545:13"/>
times the Praying and Preaching with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of Fervour and Devotion, has
a Charm that carries Nations after it:
And a Rigour in supporting Established
Forms, and the ruining of such as do
not comply with them, will also draw
to it self great Applauses. After all these
Mistakes or Impostures, the true Notion
of <hi>ruling in the fear of the Lord,</hi> is when
Princes make that Religion which God has
revealed, the chief mark and measure of
their whole Government: When the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
and promoting of a vigorous
Piety, and sublime Vertue, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and propagating of True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by ways and means suitable to it,
is the chief design of their Rule: When
Impiety and Vice are punished, and Error
is repressed, but without the ruine of such
as are involved in it: When the decency
of the Worship of God is kept up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
adulterating it with Superstition: When
Order is carried on in the Church of God,
without Tyranny: And above all, when


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65545:14"/>
Princes are in their own deportment, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> but without
Affectation; and when it is visible that
they <hi>honour those that fear the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 5. 4.</note> and
that <hi>vile men are despised by them,</hi> then do
they truly Rule in the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> When
we see Kings become thus truly Christian
Philosophers, then we may expect to see
the City of God, the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> quickly
come down from Heaven to settle among
us; and if we may look for a glorious
Thousand Years on Earth, we may reckon
that it is not far from us, when we see
Kings fall down before him that is the
<hi>King of Kings,</hi> and offer up their Crowns
to him by whom they Reign. Kings
have one Prerogative which few of them
are indeed willing to use much, and that
is, the Converting the World, not by
Dragoons, Sanguinary Laws, or Cruel
Edicts; but by Examples of true Religion,
and good Life. Kings Examples have
an Efficacy which few can resist, and
none will affect to do it. If Events


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65545:14"/>
that happen seldom, may be called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi>
this may well deserve that Name;
and indeed considering that as Princes
carry the Frailties of Human Nature
about them, so they have Temptations
ever near them to work on these, that
the constant distraction of Affairs dissipates
their Thoughts, and exhausts their Spirits,
that they are always encompassed with
Flatterers, who are on all Occasions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
how they may please them, even
when it is by deceiving them, and that
pleasures of all sorts wait on them and
follow them; when all this is laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Miracle of a truly Religious
Prince is perhaps none of the smallest
effects of Omnipotence, and it runs not
the hazard of losing its Value by being
shewed too often.</p>
            <p>But when there is a solid Morality and
genuine Piety, well tempered and mixed
together, and that Princes are both <hi>Just</hi>
and <hi>Fearing</hi> God, and that they govern
Themselves and their People by those
measures, then we must acknowledg that


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65545:15"/>
not only the Figures which are here
made use of, tho with never so much
Beauty, but all that the Richest Fancy
can invent, come far short of setting
forth the Happiness of being under such
a Government. The Injust Vexations of
Law-Suits would cease, if it appeared <hi>that
Righteousness sate in the place of Judgment,</hi>
that the <hi>Persons of the Rich were not Regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
nor their Presents accepted: Men durst
not offend, if they saw that nothing
could redeem them from deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Factions and Animosities could
not be kept up in Cities and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
if those indirect Arts by which they
might hope to biass the Prince were cut
off: When true Merit is the sure way to
high Dignities, then Men will take to the
long, tho slow Method of honest Industry,
instead of the shorter way of Flattery and
Importunity. When Men are put out of
countenance that will be vicious, and are
denied all those Favours that the Prince will
have to be the portion of the Vertuous:
When the Decencies of Vertue are more


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65545:15"/>
necessary to make a Man look well at Court,
than the wearing Cloaths in Fashion; when
Atheism and Impiety are Things which
Princes cannot bear; when a drunken
Man is a most loathsom sight, and Oaths
and Curses are the most offensive sounds
to them; when Slanders, Lies and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
can only hurt those that make them,
and next to the Authors, those that scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them about. When all these, or if
that is too much to be hoped for, when
but some of them appear in the conduct
of Government, Men will be tempted
to doubt whether they should wish to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
still here on Earth, or not: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our Passions would then fall off,
when we should have no more occasion
for them, nor provocations to them:
Fears and Jealousies, Discontent and Ill-nature
could not thrive, as they do, if
all that Nourishment which the Errours
of Government afford them, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.</p>
            <p>But to compleat the Picture, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set before you the different State of the


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65545:16"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> when they passed from the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reigns of such Execrable Monsters,
as <hi>Tiberius, Caligula, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi>
to the happy times of <hi>Trajan, Hadrian,
Antonine,</hi> but above all, of that most
sublime pattern of Vertue and Philosophy,
<hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> In the former, nothing was
studied but Vice and pleasure: Nothing
could raise a Man but sordid Flattery,
and an obsequious courting of every
Creature of Fortune and Favour. The
whole business of the Court was to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and debase the Senate; and to destroy
those who still retained such a Tincture
of their ancient Liberty, that nothing
could subdue it: Spies and Informers
were every where imployed, to engage
Men into Discourses and Plots, which
were to be betrayed, while corrupt Judges
and false Witnesses were sure to carry all
things before them. And their very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
false as it was, was vitiated by the
impudent mixtures of the most shameful
Idolatry, while their Emperours that were
the reproaches of Humane Nature, had


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65545:16"/>
divine Adorations payed them, and that
with all the refinings and profusion of
Pomp in it, that nauseous Flattery could
invent. Their great City was laid in Ashes,
only to gratify the wild Frolicks of an
extravagant Tyrant; the Warlike Spirit
of the <hi>Romans</hi> was enervated by Luxury
and dissoluteness; and the Empire it self
was exposed, first to the contempt, and
then to the Inroads of their formerly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
Provinces, while a publick Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
an Entertainment, or a Play, were
the only cares of a Court that hated the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
appearances of Vertue, and yet still
fancied it self to be the Terrour and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the World, till a fatal Revolution,
or a deadly stroke awakened Men out of
their Lethargy.</p>
            <p>But this side of the Picture, is not more
hideous than the other is Glorious; the
return of good Princes put a New Face
on the whole Empire: Their Ancient
Sense of Liberty was revived, which must
ever carry with it, all that is Great, or
Noble in humane Nature; with it Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65545:17"/>
and good Sense, Wit and Eloquence,
were again recoverd, Frugality and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
were again honoured, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and Simplicity of living shined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh:
Truth and Vertue, and Philosophy
it self began to reign. <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,
Epictetus,</hi> and beyond them all
<hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> himself, were such Men,
that one would bless a whole Age, if it
should but produce one of that force.
<hi>Marcus</hi> in a Reign of almost twenty Years
continuance, is represented by all the
Writers of the succeeding as well as of
his own Age, as so perfect a Pattern,
that there never appeared either in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Deportment, or in his Government,
one Single Blemish. He was never once
seen either transported with Anger or with
Joy. He was never charged with one Light
Word, or any one Rash Action. He lived
in a perpetual Application to the Affairs
of the Empire, and in the intervals of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
even in his Expeditions and Camps,
he was imployed in those profound Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
of Philosophy, which carry


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65545:17"/>
this Noble Title <hi>Of Himself to Himself;</hi>
and in which we see the most natural and
unaffected contempt of all things, besides
Vertue and Goodness, expressed with the
greatest force, and yet with the truest sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of any thing that Antiquity has
left us.</p>
            <p>Under such Princes, the <hi>Romans</hi> could
not but recover their ancient Discipline,
and their wonted Valour, and the Empire
was again raised to its former Lustre, and
regained its lost Authority; but which
was much more, in them the World saw
patterns of Vertue, that were too high for
that corrupt Religion which then prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and this perhaps disposed it, not a little
for Christianity, that could not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with such Morals, but carry them far
higher.</p>
            <p>If the opposition of these two different
Scenes of Government affect this Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and if the change seems sensible,
when set out in Words, it is You, GREAT
SOVERAIGNS, that must give this
its best Light and utmost Force. It is


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65545:18"/>
from You that we expect the Glorious
Reverse of all cloudy days. You have
been hitherto our Hope and our Desire:
You must now become <hi>our Glory and
Crown of rejoycing:</hi> Ordinary Vertues in
You, will fall so far short of our hopes,
that we shall be tempted almost to think
them <hi>Vices.</hi> It is in Your Persons, and under
Your Reign, that we hope to see an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Glorious Scene, which seems ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.
May You not only accomplish,
but exceed even our Wishes. May You be
long happy in one another. May You
Reign long in your Persons, and much
longer in a glorious Posterity. May You
belong the Support of the Church of God,
and the Terrour of all its Enemies. May
You be ever happy in obedient Subjects,
in wise Councellours, and faithful Allies:
May your Fleets be prosperous, and
your Armies Victorious. But may You
soon have cause to use neither; by
setling both at Home and Abroad, a
firm and just Peace, and by securing
the Quiet of <hi>Europe</hi> from those who have


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65545:18"/>
so often, with so little regard to the Faith
of Treaties, and now at last beyond all
former Examples, disturbed it. In order to
the obtaining all these Blessings, and in
Conclusion a sure, tho a late admittance
to the Kingdom Above, where you shall
exchange these Crowns with a more lasting,
as well as a more glorious One, May not
