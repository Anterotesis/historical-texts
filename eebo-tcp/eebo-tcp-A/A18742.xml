            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Emperoure not long after, wyth a puissante po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and a mightie armye, beséeged <hi>Meatz</hi> in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> in whyche Towne was a greate number of the floure of <hi>Fraunce</hi> placed, as Duke <hi>D'Aumail,</hi> Duke <hi>De Namures,</hi> and the <hi>Vidaem de Chartoys,</hi> a lustie and noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, wyth whyche <hi>Vidaem</hi> was the Lorde <hi>Charles Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde</hi> of <hi>Effingham</hi> that nowe is.

            <p>From <hi>Artoys</hi> the meane whyle, <hi>Monsieur Grande Maeter,</hi> with a greate power, wente along the water of <hi>Some,</hi> and spoyled two Townes of good strength, the one called <hi>Noyon,</hi> and the other <hi>Roye,</hi> wyth a number of other Uillages.

            <p>At the same instant, or very soone after, the Frenchmen beséeged <hi>Hedding</hi> agayne, where <hi>Monsieur Byron</hi> was, as Generall. His Father <hi>Mon. Grand Maeter</hi> came to raise y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

séege with a sufficiente power, but came too late, for the French hadde wonne it the same nyghte that we laye in Campe, within two leagues of <hi>Hedding,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur Byron</hi> commyng away wyth bagge and baggage, sente vs worde of hys misfortune, whyche newes so tooke away the courages of oure people (I meane <hi>Burgonyons,</hi> and suche as were in oure Campe) that we marched without sounde of Drumme or Trumpet that nyght, to <hi>Saint Poule,</hi> a neutre Towne on the frontiers, and the season was then so terrible cold, that all the way we had but Snowe and sléete in oure faces, with suche a winde and blustering storme, as many dyed by the way, and many fell sicke of their suddayne and sore trauell.</p>
            <p>Héere I must a little tell you of the strange manner of both oure Camps at all times and extremities, whyche in déede was of the worlde to be wondered at: for the French woulde sometimes make hast to followe vs, but when they came néere, then woulde they retyre, wyth as greate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, as they made hast before: and in lyke sorte, we followed them vppon the lyke aduantage. But when our Campe came in the smell of theyr Poulder, away wée trudged as fast (God knowes,) without any greate occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And in this trade and manner the whole forces of both the sydes continued a maruellous tyme, and yet assuredlye on both partes were manye stoute and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ante Captaynes, and menne of suche fame, as to these dayes there are but a fewe lefte alyue of theyr worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Rentie</hi> was besieged, where manye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things were done, so valiantly, and with suche courage and conduct, as merits great praise: but in fine, the French were faine to withdraw themselues, and the <hi>Burgonians</hi> succoured the Fort with no little losse or hazarde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:5278:11"/>The greate Citie and Towne of <hi>Arras</hi> had like to haue bin betrayed, but the treason was espied, and the practise preuented, to some losse of the French side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monsieur Dernes</hi> dyed, and in his place came <hi>Monsieur Benningcourt,</hi> who, being Graund Maister, prepared to besiege <hi>Dorlean,</hi> and laye neare it with a huge power, the French by a great pollicie, laide an ambushe of horsemen and footmen in a place conuenient, and the <hi>Burgonions</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting no doubt, went about some enterprise, and fell in the lapse of the French, where was a maruellous great fighte and sharpe encounter, horsemen to horsemen, at the leaste fiue thousand on a side, and the <hi>Burgonians</hi> at the first wan a gyddon or two from the French, and tooke manye priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But in the end, the broile began to be so hote, that the Prince of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Hedding</hi> was againe besieged by the <hi>Burgonions,</hi> and wonne from the French, and rased to the verye grounde, to the vtter disgrace of the Frenche, and great glorie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side.</p>
            <p>The Emperoure his owne person, and his sister the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, came with a wonderfull great armie to <hi>Cambris,</hi> and abode the French Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, for a battell. The French King came, and presented the battel, with such a multitude of braue Souldyers, horsemen and footemen, as seldome I euer sawe before, and in déede they marched full in the face and viewe of the Emperours campe, which was so entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that the French coulde not haue any aduauntage, and so, after the great ordinance had gone off a long season, the Frenche in a moste noble and braue order retired.</p>
            <p>A strong and goodly Towne called <hi>Turwaine,</hi> was besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5278:12"/>
by the <hi>Burgonions,</hi> battered and assaulted, at which assaulte we lost many men. But the <hi>Spaniardes</hi> were euen with the towne after: For at a parlée, the <hi>Spaniarde,</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely entred the towne, and so a greate murther of all sortes of people was made, in somuche, that I sawe sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye wounded and sicke Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, leape downe from the toppe of the walles, but that preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not, for the murther continued, and the towne was cleane spoyled, throwne down, and rased in moste cruell dispite.</p>
            <p>There was many other seruices in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> the whiche I saw not at that seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherfore I do commit the reporte thereof to those that are better experimented with the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and haue a minde to set them out at large. For my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye meaning was, but briefly to make a rehearsall of suche things as I knewe to be true, and may not wearye a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Reader.</p>
            <p>Nowe after a number of broyles and warlike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires were ended, the Emperour and the Quéene of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie</hi> tooke shypping, and went into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ended their liues in a Monasterie, and in <hi>Flaunders</hi> was placed, King <hi>Phillip,</hi> in whose time was many great actes done, and sundry battels worthily gotten.</p>
            <p>The greatest of those victories was at Saint <hi>Quintines,</hi> whiche towne King <hi>Philip</hi> besieged. To the rescue of the same towne, the French King sent the chiefest of al his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie with a puissaunt power, but the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hys hap was to encounter them, and ouerthrowe them: and making a greate slaughter, tooke the highe Conestable of <hi>France,</hi> and many other honorable and mightie personages prisoners. The town of Saint <hi>Quintines</hi> notwithstanding, stoode to the mercye of the sworde, and woulde not yéelde in any respect. Wherevpon a Generall assaulte was roundly

            <p>At this siege was the Erle of <hi>Penbrooke</hi> sent from Quéen <hi>Mary,</hi> as Generall ouer fiue thousande Englishemen, and in that company, the Lorde <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>VVilton,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Leycester,</hi> called then Lorde <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Henry</hi> his brother, Lorde <hi>Bray,</hi> Lorde <hi>Delawaer,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Courtney,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Pollard,</hi> and a greate number of nobilitie, and worthy Gentlemen, which being mustred and putte in order of battell on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> gréene by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> made as gallant a shewe as was séene in those partes a long season before.</p>

            <p>At thys tyme, a greate Citie called <hi>Valentian,</hi> taking holde and sauoure of Religion, reuolted from the Regent, whiche towne was besieged a long season by the Regents power, and by practise and policie surprised, taken, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly handled.</p>

            <p>The seconde daye, the enimies beganne newe practises, and the Margraue and <hi>Burgo</hi> maisters went busilie about some mischiefe towards vs, and deuised many wayes how they mighte weaken our power, and augment their owne strength, and had secret communication with many of our camp (who were rich men of the Towne) to bring to passe the effect of their deuises.</p>
            <p>Aboute dinner time, I being with the Prince at the Table, the people had broken into the Friers, and spoyled their house, which was a beginning of a bloudie businesse, had it gone forward. The Prince hearing thereof, sent me to pacifie the hurly burly, and I came, when sixe Friers were going to hanging, and the people were determined to kill all the Papistes in the Towne, especially the Priests, Monckes, and Friers: but I persuaded the people to be in quiet, and preserued the liues of the Friers, and thousands of their betters, both honest Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and wealthie Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geses.

            <p>Then I was sent to the Prince from our people, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund what was the meaning of these matters, for he had daylie conference with the <hi>Borgo</hi> Maisters, and others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a common quietnesse (which our rude and basest sorte of Souldioures vnderstoode not.) And the Prince to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde aunswered some what sharplie, and declared, that the <hi>Calui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore he willed the people to vse more temperance, and shew more fidelitie and seruice to God and his person.</p>
            <p>This message so vered the vayne heads of numbers in our Camp, that they determined to the last droppe of their blouds to maynteyne their purpose for their liues and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. And the grauest and wisest sort, who were of great wealth and experience, confessed openly, that the brute rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for the killing of the <hi>Martinistes,</hi> was a deuice of some diuelishe inuention, to set bréethren at variance. But in a little while after, our company grewe so weake, that wée were but fiftéene thousand left, of fiue and twentie, whych fiftéene thousand were become so resolute, that they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the nexte morning to giue all their enimies a battell, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And in this heate and furie, they badde me looke to my promise, and kéepe my faith, for they doubted not, but God would giue them vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, for their quarrell was onely for the aduancemente of Gods glorie and hys word.</p>
            <p>The next day, the enimies grew very strong, what with <hi>Spanyards Easterlings, Burgonions, Almaynes,</hi> and <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes,</hi> the stréetes were all couered with their assemblyes. And we hearing they were sparckled abroad, and without

order, suddaynely we thought to charge them: and so put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selues in battell, began to march: the brute where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of so amazed the enimies, that they caused the Prince to send and stay vs, and that they were glad to talke of peace, and would not any way offend vs, the Prince sent. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we stayed, and I was agayne sent from the people to the Prince, to will all our aduersaries immediately to lay downe weapon, and goe home to their houses, for otherwise there was no hope of peace. The Prince willed me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them to goe home first, and promised that all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie should be in quiet, so soone as they were in their houses: to the which I replyed, and sayd, that our people were now able and strong ynough to debate the matter in any maner of sort, and being in their houses, and the enimie in armour, the suretie of our people mighte be doubtfull. And I knew I shoulde but offend the people, to bring them newes, that they must giue place to their enimies, when they were maisters of the Towne, and the enimie scattered abroade, and not like to be in order, if we tooke the aduantage that God had put into our hands.

And in greate post hast came a messenger from the enimies, that they woulde lay downe weapon, and agrée, that there shoulde be a frée libertie of Preaching, and no person shoulde (of this our assemblie) be troubled, for anye matter or cause co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. And to performe this that the enimies offered, they promised to sweare on a Bible, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:5278:18"/>
so they did, at which othe and offer our people reioysed, and clapped handes, but still they manfullie stoode in order of battell. The enimies duly obserued the appoyntme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made, and went euery man to his lodging, accordingly as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was taken, and when we sawe and found all things in quiet, we marched along the stréetes with Anciente dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, and as euery man came by his owne house, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. But before we wer all placed in our lodgings, it grew very late. Thus ended this greate reuolte, without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed or hurte to any one person liuing. And for our paynes, and true performance in things that we promised, we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped trouble and persecution: and in a little season after, both Prince and people were driuen through a thousande hazards, to saue life and libertie. The Prince was fayne to depart to a Towne of his owne called <hi>Breda,</hi> and hauing hast away (or for some great cause) left his sonne and heyre called <hi>Monsieur Debuer</hi> in <hi>Louaine</hi> at Schole: and dyuers Gentlemen shifted away as they might: among the rest I seambled hardly into <hi>Englande,</hi> being layde for, and yet so desguised, that I escaped the handes of my enimies, who hadde a commaundement from the Regente, to put mée to death with Martiali law (a badde recompence for so great good and diligence bestowed on hir people, and a naughtie reward for the frute of a good meaning mind.)</p>

            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hauing hope, that sundrie of the towns and stréets of the Countrey, in this extremitie would haue ioyned with him (for the recouering of their libertie and priuiledges) drewe himselfe among his friendes in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> and practised for money and men to be ready with an army to encounter the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> and either by battaile to ende tho miseries of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> or by strong hande to driue oute the perturbers of their publske state and quietnesse.</p>

            <p>It came well to passe after a long prouision, and that a braue regiment of Frenchmen were readye (that <hi>Monsieur Maulberg</hi> brought out of <hi>Fraunce</hi>) that the Prince &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple met &amp; assembled at this Abbey, in such warlike sorte and order, as gaue a great hope of some high attempt and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.

For in verie troth, the Counte <hi>de Hostraet,</hi> a noble worthye manne, the Counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> a moste valiaunte souldiour, were come to the Prince, and brought with them a great bande of <hi>Burgonions</hi> of great and good houses, and suche as hadde bin well experimented in wars. And a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous companye of <hi>Swarfe Rutters,</hi> high <hi>Almaines,</hi> and Sweessers were come from <hi>Germany,</hi> and at one instant and time they met all togither, and muster was taken of aleauen thousand horsemen, and two and twenty thousande footmen, whiche made so noble a shewe when they were assembled, as (me thoughte) was worthy the noting, and mighte encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage anie souldiour to march among, and kéepe companye withall.</p>
            <p>The Prince hadde prepared so great a treasure, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the army was mustred, there was a generall pay for two moneths, and out of hande order was taken for to passe ouer the great riuer of <hi>Rhein,</hi> not far from <hi>Andernak,</hi> the towne being gladde to stand as our friendes, and aide vs with all that they might. And so marching forwarde as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a way towards <hi>Flaunders,</hi> as was thought necessarie, we encamped betwéen <hi>Boen</hi> and <hi>Collen,</hi> where the <hi>Flemings</hi> and highe <hi>Almaines</hi> hadde of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> in our Campe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued some words of reproche, touching the ouerthrow that the Counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> hadde at <hi>Groening</hi> in <hi>Freeslande:</hi> on which words, the <hi>Almaines</hi> being ful of wine, made a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and put themselues in battel, and shotte off their small péeces, and began a foule businesse. To appease the same broyle, all the whole army were in armes, and the <hi>Swarfe Rutters</hi> were mounted, and were come into the fielde, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Burgonions</hi> tooke one side, and the <hi>Almaines</hi> and <hi>Rutters</hi> another, and so there was a greate murther: but it dured not long, for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> &amp; his brother Count <hi>Lodwike,</hi> by muche entreatie stayed the strife.</p>

            <p>After this, we encamped before <hi>Ayex Ocorken,</hi> where commonlye the Emperoure is crowned, a greate Cittie not very farre from <hi>Mastricke,</hi> the people wherof did feare to be besieged, and so with a great summe of money redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their towne.

And when oure people beganne moste to doubte some danger, &amp; talked of the hazard, the Prince caused our army to turne their faces, (&amp; by that time night approched) and hauing good guydes, we marched swiftly without making

The Duke (to occupy y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> tune til his purposed deuice tooke place) made as though he would haue bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> battel, &amp; came ful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reregarde of the Prince, to a waters side, hauing on both his wings a mightie wood, and guarded behinde with waggons &amp; cariages, &amp; hasted apace towardes the Prince with al his power. The Prince very glad to sée the enimie so desirous of battel, approched with his reregard néere the enimy, &amp; sent with spéede for the vangard &amp; maine battel, to come backe agayn for causes conuenient, which came, &amp; in open field presented themselues in order of battell to the enimie: but the Duke kept him and his power beyonde the water, and yet put out dyuers bands to holde the Prince in play, &amp; drawe our people neare the great and small shotte. The <hi>Burgonions, Rutters, Almaines,</hi> &amp; most of the lustiest souldiours about the Prince, ranne so couragiously to thys encounter and péece of seruice, that sundrye were galled &amp; hurte at the first charge, and fewe or none that aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red anye thing at al, but escaped hardlye the daunger of body, &amp; losse of life, the ground which the enimies had chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was so ful of adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, &amp; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> so valiantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the skirmish. Notwithstanding, the Princes power
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:5278:23"/>
augmented continuallie, and plyed the seruice, in such sort, that the enimies perforce were driuen into their mayne battel. But this bickering endured so long, that the day was farre spent, and numbers of oure men were hurte. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the chiefe a noble man (and a speciall sparke of life) called the Count <hi>De Hostraet,</hi> was shotte through the legge, of whych wounde, after he dyed. And as many stoute Souldioures that season serued well and worthylie, so was none more to be commended, than the Count <hi>De Lume,</hi> a <hi>Leagoyse,</hi> otherwise called Count <hi>De la Marsh,</hi> who onely came to the Prince with a braue bande of Horsemen, for the reuengemente of his Cousins deathe the Count <hi>Deg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> which lost his head, as before you haue heard.</p>
            <p>Now what should more be sayd of this matter, but that the Duke in this mean season had conuayed fiue thousand shotte (the leading whereof hadde <hi>Iulian Romero</hi>) to the bridge and strayte passage, not farre from <hi>Tillemont.</hi> And this <hi>Iulian,</hi> as he was a maruellous valiant and good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, of greate experience, fame, forwardnesse, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, so did he so cunningly in a woodde at this presente lay an ambushe, that it was to be wondred at: the manner whereof followeth.</p>
            <p>First, when he came to this strayte, he caused the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes</hi> (which in good sooth were noble Souldioures, and resolute men) to lye flatte on their faces, and as closely as could be deuised, withoute making brute or businesse: and commaunded, that no one man shoulde be so hardie as to stirre, til he gaue a warning and watchworde. Which the <hi>Spanyards</hi> obeyed in euery poynt, for they are men of great obedience &amp; vigilancie, where they ought to be readie, &amp; at commaundement.</p>
            <p>The Prince hauing a minde and good occasion to passe this straite before the night came on, marched towardes the brigge, and all the way the Duke wayted on him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many offers to haue giuen battell: and still greate
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:5278:24"/>
seruice was to be séene, and the enimie was euer occupyed, to bleare our eyes the better. And yet the Prince to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent mischiefe, sente a number of <hi>Almayne</hi> shotte (named the <hi>Forlorne hope</hi>) to the selfesame woodde, where <hi>Iulian Romero</hi> lay, to be as it were a succoure to his armie, if the Duke had charged on the reregard, as was presupposed he woulde, the aduantage was so great. And this <hi>Almayne</hi> shotte were so carelesse, that as soone as they came into the woodde, they lay loking ouer a high dyke, how the Princes cariages, stragglers, vangarde, mayne battell, and wings thereof should passe ouer the bridge, and had no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, but gazed before them, when behind their backs the enimie was priuilie placed. Well, in fine, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces power came on, and the artillerie, the stragglers, the cariages, the vangarde, the mayne battell, and all, sauing the reregard, passed ouer the bridge, but the reregarde, bycause it was nexte the Duke, and in danger to be sette vpon (by the Dukes power) was double garded with horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, besides the ordinarie bandes it was wonte to haue. And further, the vancurrers, and gallantest Gentlemen of person and manhoode, attended on the reregard, to sée the ende of the matter. And so soone as the reregarde came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the two wooddes, the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> did shewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues suddaynely, with suche a terrible shotte and thunder, of Muskette, and Calyuer, that the <hi>Almaynes</hi> by terror of the same, flang downe theyr péeces, and woulde haue fledde, but most of them were immediately spoyled and flayne.</p>
            <p>The Horsemen of the reregarde were so amazed at thys aduenture, that they scarce knewe what was best to bée done: yet in conclusion, a noble Captayne, called <hi>Rides,</hi> and diuers other bands of <hi>Swarfe Rutters</hi> whéeled about, made head to the enimie, and were readie to giue a charge on Captayne <hi>Iulian.</hi> And albeit a greate dyke was a lette for the charge, yet the <hi>Rutters</hi> scambled ouer the same, and as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5278:24"/>
they myght, in the woodde, slewe diuers of the <hi>Spanyardes.</hi> But the Duke plyed the matter so sharply vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the backes of the reregarde, that <hi>Monsieur Maulberg</hi> (a Baron, with a regiment) and most of his band of braue French Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oures, were put to the sword, or drowned, and many <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonyon</hi> Gentlemen and Souldioures of all sortes were likewise slayne or ouerthrowne in the water: in whyche conflict, we lost foure or fyue thousand men. But the Prince beholding this murther, and in danger of the shotte conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, was dismayed no whitte: for being on a high ground, ful before the Dukes Camp, he sente downe suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coures to hys people, and bent all his great Ordinance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Duke, and stayed his whole straggling armie in the very view and shotte of the enimie, a thing most rare and strange to be séene.</p>
            <p>The Dukes power, as they mighte notwithstanding, followed victorie, and till the darke night did separate the armies, the shotte on both sides neuer ceassed. And looke what prisoners the Duke did take, before the day went out of the Skye, he caused them to be burnt all togither in one house, the smoke and smell whereof came with the winde full into oure noses. Thus we encamped in that presente place, hoping for a reuenge the next morning, at whyche season was <hi>Monsieur Ianlees</hi> to come oute of <hi>France</hi> to the Prince, and with him two thousande Horse, and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand footemen.</p>
            <p>The Duke hearing of <hi>Monsieur Ianlees</hi> commyng, wente to méete hym, but woulde not encounter hym that tyme, bycause the Princes Campe was so néere. And <hi>Monsieur Ianlees</hi> came ouer the water at <hi>Namure,</hi> where the garrison resisted him to theyr po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>er, and lost a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth or fourescore Souldioures at that tyme. <hi>Ianlees</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with bloud, marched forwarde brauely with hys little Campe, in the whyche hée hadde fyue good péeces of artillerie. And at length he came in the view of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5278:25"/>
Duke of Aluaes Camp, and being resolued to fight, rather than retire, he put his power in battell, and tooke the nexte way to the Prince, in most manly manner, as indéede hée was a stoute Gentleman. The Duke séeing his boldnesse and courage, gaue him the looking on, and let him passe, and so our Camp and his ioyned togither.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Ianlees</hi> comming, who broughte a maruellous gallant companye (of Gentlemen, &amp; experimented Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oures) it was thought, that without delay we should haue soughte out the Duke, and haue giuen him battell: and in that minde was oure whole power many a long day, but what was the occasion to the contrarie, I knowe not, and what did kéepe vs asunder so long, dothe passe the reache of my reason. A wéerysome time in this sort poore Souldiours turmoyled, who were visited with so many wants &amp; extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that it would haue pitied any Christians heart and minde to consider of: yet the willingnesse of people to doe some worthy acte or enterprise, tooke away a péece of the heauie burthen, and made the fardell of affliction the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to beare, and the lesse repined at: and it was a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter, for men (as some may alleadge) to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bread, béere, ale, or wyne, so great a time as we did: for most certaine, the scarcitie was such of the same, that some in the Campe (and right good men) for the space of twentie or thirtie dayes, neuer tasted of bread, nor dranke better than water: yet what with Apples, and frute, and other moyst things we found, the Camp was satisfyed, and men (in hope of better sustenance) shifted out a sorowful season, and nothing gréeued their heartes more, than that they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Nowe when necessitie compelled the Prince to wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his power, or desperate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

(that the Horsemen myghte charge them.) The Prince marched towards <hi>Leeg,</hi> and beséeged that great and goodly City, although the <hi>Rutters</hi> stiffely refused that seruice, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was imperiall, and a Towne they ought not meddle withall. But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that reason was racked, or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that answere did smel, I report me to those that knowes the handling and scanning of such cunning mysteries.</p>
            <p>The Cannons were planted, for all this contradiction, and the greate péeces did play vpon the Citie two or thrée dayes, and the Duke hearing thereof, came (as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) to set on some of the Princes people and forces. The Prince hauing examined a prisoner that was taken at that present, &amp; vnderstanding where and which way the Duke might be found, sent for his chiefe Captaines, &amp; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded anone after midnight, to dislodge quietly without sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Drumme or Tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, &amp; march (as they might) towards the Duke: albeit the night was darke, and the weather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, which was a great trouble to the Camp, yet the Prince was resolued to trie out by aduersitie, whether the Duke or he had the more hard destiny and aduerse fortune. Nowe the Souldioures beganne to reioyce, and although the way was combersome, and the nighte darke and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, yet euery man bore a portion of the trauell, in hope to come quickly to an end of the trouble. And by my troth, the maner of our march was so difficult and strange, (and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Camp went so scattered abroade at all aduentures) that we were like ynough before day to be some of vs t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y wandred. Yet by this blind occasion, the Duke gat lightof the Princes purpose, and thereon entrenched himselfe and his Camp in a strong ground, to his greate suretie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.

And at the breake of day, our Camp bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chéere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to sounde a marche, full in the hearing of the Dukes power. I doubt, if I made mention of the mirth that oure people had, some fyne fellowes woulde scarcely beléeue it: wherefore I procéede to my matter.</p>
            <p>The Campes thus being néere togither, were both in order of battell, the Dukes entrenched, and the Princes in open playne: and the Princes power presented the battell in a braue and goodly order, but it was refused.

And the Duke min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to shew some rescue to the Towne, came in the sighte of our Camp, and lodged betwéene two great wooddes. Yet nothing worthy noting was attempted.

For I haue written nothing, but eyther mine owne eyes behelde it, or at some one time or other I was in the Countrey whyle it was a doing. And so, the losse of the <hi>Breell,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, caused <hi>Flushing,</hi> and other places to reuolt, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in the necke of those changes, would happen an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of vnwelcome chances, to suche as thoughte themselues of fortune most assured.</p>
            <p>The whole Countrey through, was so farre out of quiet, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Duke not only fylled the new Citadell in <hi>Antwerpe</hi> with Souldiers, but lykewise, put great garrisons in all places &amp; Townes of strength, whych garrisons peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture behaued themselues not so well towardes the people, as they looked for. And as they mighte méete to reason of those matters, and other thyngs of weyghte, they muttered, in muche mislike at many occasions, but more for feare than fauoure, they followed the Dukes deuice, and both with money and men ayded the Duke, agaynste

those that were disturbers of his state. Yet suche broyles were abroach, as coulde not be remedyed without muche bloudshed, and hardly that way, as experience in processe of tyme did declare.</p>
            <p>Now in the heate of this murmuring, an infinite sort of scattered people drewe to the Counte <hi>Lodwike,</hi> and many made sute to the Prince, to steppe in and thruste out stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, especially <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> that then were generally des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised. The Prince hauing many iniuries offered him, and remembring olde wrongs and newe displeasures, beganne to giue eare to such persuasions, as touched the priuiledges and liberties of those Countries the Duke hadde gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and by déepe foresight and iudgement, auoyded the daunger of his enimyes, and so stoode on hys guarde in all thinges he went about. At which resolution, his friends a folowers reioiced, and euery one according to his ability, put to a helping hand, &amp; sent him such succoures, as he was able in person and power in a shorte time to méete hys eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye on land or on Sea, such was his foresight, his force, &amp; good fortune.</p>
            <p>Nowe the towns in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> began to bende apace, to be at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Princes deuotion, and the Prince hadset oute a number of Shyppes, whyche often encountred their enimyes, and wanne greate and riche prizes, and seldome loste anye thing, but still foughte it oute so valiauntlye, that victorye séemed to be theirs by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.</p>
            <p>A fléete of Shippes came from <hi>Spaine</hi> to the Dukes aide, and some of the beste of them happen into the Flushingers handes, commyng into the Hauen, whiche shippes were fraught with treasure, that serued the Princes turne a long time after The Counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> had done verye greate things in sundry enterprises, and seruice of no little charge and hazarde, and was like to proue the oddest Souldier of a noble man in his dayes: but the Duke did alwayes so

            <p>Uery many practises the Duke both by force and finesse wrought against the Prince, and was assisted and aided with many of the states of the low Countrie, to entrap the Prince, or take the Townes he had in his hands from him, but nothing could preuaile, although great &amp; huge armyes of men went aboute the ouerthrowe of the Prince and his fortresses.

All this season, and a long whyle before, was the right Honorable Maister Doctor <hi>Wilson</hi> (now Secretary to the Quéenes Maiestie) Lorde Embassador in <hi>Flanders:</hi> and two seuer all times was sent in Embassage thither, at that time, the Captayne of the Ile of <hi>VVight,</hi> called May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Edward Horssey,</hi> for to make peace, and for suche cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as pleased our Prince.</p>
            <p>Embassadors were sente thither from the Emperoure, and from the Electors and States of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in long debating of matters (to the which the Bishop of <hi>Leeg</hi> came, a great Segnior, and stoute Prelate) a peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and for the ioy thereof, I saw a generall Procession in <hi>Bruzels,</hi> where all the Embassadors and States were (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Embassador of <hi>Englande,</hi> and all the Nobilitie of <hi>Flaunders</hi>) whiche made such a shewe, and reached suche a length in the stréetes, and tarried so long there, as was a wonder to beholde, and the strangest viewe that hadde bin séene in that place many yeares before, the number of Gentlemen was so great, and the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people so many.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:5278:33"/>The estates nowe beganne to leane to the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> and deale throughly and playnely with him, whyche was a greate strength vnto them, and an occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the rest of the nobilitie to drawe one kinde of way, if they determined to withstande <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> as they made shew they would. But some that made promise there vnto, brake suddayncly, and turned to <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> who was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying of a power to inuade <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and had togither both footemen and Horsemen, a very gallante company, and those were auntient and perfite Souldioures, that had serued many yeares in great aduentures and hazards. And to speake as the common fame wente (and right wise and noble men did report,) <hi>Don Iohn</hi> for his owne person was a wise and most famous noble man, that well was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie (for many good partes in him) to haue had the leading of a Camp as great as King <hi>Alexanders</hi> army of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> whose men of warre were at the conquering of most parte of the worlde. Thus was <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and his power in a manner readie to marche, and lay aboute <hi>Namure,</hi> to tarrie the comming of some such bands of Horsemen as he looked for, and be fully furnished of such things as he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The States had in like sorte assembled a very great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and were as readie to marche, as occasion fell out: and knowing that their enimies must haue much adoe, before they could winne any Towne of credite, the States deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to wéerie <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and so by policie and practise to striue with him, rather than with playne force and fight to encounter him: for their mightie walled Townes were a great blocke in <hi>Don Iohns</hi> way, whiche neyther coulde bée wonne by their enimies, nor yet well could be beséeged, but that the States hadde a meane to aide the Townes, and power ynough to rayse the seege, and could at any aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage giue <hi>Don Iohn</hi> battell, without whiche aduantage it were no wisedome to deale with a strong and stout enimie.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5278:33"/>
And on that resolution stande the noblest Souldioures now liuing. And woulde to God that towardly Prince and good Gentleman, the King of <hi>Portingall,</hi> had stoode on that poynte, whiche shall be spoken of in another matter, God sparing me life. But now to my purpose I procéede. But as the States looked to take <hi>Don Iohn</hi> at aduantage, or awéerie him and his Souldioures with long warres and much labour, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and his company were so well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented with paynes, and accustomed so often to suffer the miserie of warres, that they had such able mindes and bodies to endure and beare off the burthen of aduersitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the states should not easily that way haue had their willes, ouer them, although that the <hi>Spanyardes,</hi> by long rest and delicacie of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> were become some what slouthfull and effeminate: yet are they of such courage and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when force doth compell them to trudge &amp; to toyle, that straightwayes, theyr nature is conuerted to their old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and custome, and they coulde for a néede frame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to a new trade of trauell. Whiche shewes them as well armed within their mindes (where the man is beste knowen) as clad and defenced without, where nothing is good, if the minde set it not forwarde, and maintaine it to the vttermost. And the opinion of some souldiers is, both at home and abroade, that who so euer is daintie and vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and can not martch in hardnesse, without a bagge and a bottle, were better be by a warme fire, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a cold field, &amp; will do more harme in a little péece of béefe, than he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to good in a great battaile, he is so loaded with his trinkets, &amp; mindes so much his meat. And although in a splene I haue spoken of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> (yet no other than he deserues) so haue I séene both Frenchman and Borgonyon (and somé of our owne nation besydes,) that in the féelde are more gréedy of glorie, than hungry in the house, when a banquet is on the table. I must leaue off this spéech, and follow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other humor. So <hi>Don Iohn</hi> &amp; the states, as you haue heard,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5278:34"/>
deuised how the one might deceiue the other: and yet ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them both ventured further than good occasion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. And in this colde kind of seruice, the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours remayned, amyd the heate of Sommer a long sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, till <hi>Don Iohns</hi> power began to bidde the bace, and by a great mischaunce tooke the power of the states at aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and slewe some of them, and hadde the reste in chace as farre as they durste followe, and so that byckering en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The states vpon this little ouerthrow (wherin the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish bands had the most hurt) attended both horsemen and footemen, out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> &amp; gaue <hi>Don Iohn</hi> leaue a while to march about a péece of the Countrey, minding as soone as the <hi>Cassemeer</hi> came down, to goe to the fielde agayne.

            <p>When time came on to set abroch matters that mighte not runne cleare till the lées were settled (and Wine wold be knowne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vineger &amp; Ueriuice,) the euents of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter burste out, and made euery man of both the sids, <hi>Don Iohns,</hi> and the states, loke wel to their footing: for of necessitie, and countreys cause (besides the desire of fame &amp; honour) both these armies must march, to view the one the other, and in open field, do somewhat for reputations sake, and that they came for.

And with these English Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ioyned for good will in the fielde, the Scottish regiment (as I hearde.) And the English had an intente to march to the Camp, of the states. <hi>Don Iohns</hi> power hauing intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof, made haste to preuente them, and so the skirmishe beganne, and lasted a long season, and for certainetie, had not the Englishe and Scottishe nations done theyr due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and verye well withal, they hadde bene repulsed, and peraduenture ouerthrowen. I woulde praise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende anye manne that did well that daye, but for that

I am ignoraunt of that which was truely done, and would be loath to flatter one, and offend another, I omitte al their names, but master <hi>Iohn Norrises,</hi> for this presente, til my next booke of other warres be printed and published, at whiche time I shall know the truth of that I treate of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Casameer</hi> with a greate power of horsemen, and footemen, was come at this presente, or in a short while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and <hi>Don Iohn</hi> then was to consider and aide the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might haue followed, for his armye was a great deale lesse in number than the power of the states, and ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times the states were in minde to besiege <hi>Louaine,</hi> but neuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie to watch for the enemies, &amp; offer the battel, whyche was loked for daylye: the <hi>Burgonions</hi> side were also well disposed, &amp; it was certainly thought, that <hi>Don Iohns</hi> side was as gallaunt. Nowe were pollicies and strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes to bée séene. Nowe the shewe of warre, and clatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of armes might be hard. Now the poulder and bullets were prepared, and stoute and manly skirmishes began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe, and the souldiers bespredde the plaines, as thicke as the blacke crowes, that flyes swarming out of the wilde wooddes: and the whole people and commons of <hi>Flaunders</hi> thought they should be rid of their enimies, that so long had enpouershed their rich and plentifull countrey. For they smarted (poore soules) that often had bin spoyled, &amp; they felt al the wrong, that knewe not howe to righte themselues, but by Gods grace, and gaping after victorie.</p>
            <p>At this present time, victualles began to be maruelous déere, and after the <hi>Rutters</hi> and <hi>Casemeeres</hi> company were payed, money among other bandes was harde to come by, and in that sort, a verie long time was spent and consumed, yet some were relieued with that treasure the States could spare: but in fine, suche scarcitie and miscrie came on and fel among thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that both sicknesses and sodaine death ensued. And at length, the plague, (of whiche manye made an ende of their liues) was sparkled both in Campe and in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5278:35"/>
Country, &amp; no one place was frée from one disease or other, that either stoode neare the Campe, or where the sicke soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers repaired. And some of our English Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dropped downe in that visitation, as Mayster <hi>Thomas Cobham,</hi> and others, no greate number. This sorrowfull and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sicknesse as much vexed &amp; troubled the poore people, as any miserie they felt, &amp; made the troubled conscience more afraid, than the view of all <hi>Don Iohns</hi> power.</p>
            <p>Much practising and working there was for a peace by oure Princes Ambassadors, that were sorie to sée so much bloudshed and mischiefe as might fall oute vppon a battell. And manye times peace was expected, and likely to haue happened, if <hi>Don Iohn</hi> woulde haue agréed to any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conditions. But in conclusion, <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> by a hope hée had in some faction or practise (either among <hi>Pater Noster</hi> men, a company so called, or others fauorers to <hi>Don Iohns</hi> doing) woulde not agrée to the peace, nor do any thing that stoode againste his determination. So, continuing in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute minde, he thruste diuers bands of <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther souldiours, into such Townes and Fortresses as hée hadde possessed, and with suche power as he had lefte, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towardes <hi>Namure</hi> or those parties, meaning not, as he made shew therof, to trouble the States any further for a seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There were some that threw down churches and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed and troubled religious persons, againste whome rose a company of <hi>Wallons,</hi> naming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues <hi>Pater Noster</hi> men, &amp; sometimes encountred those that destroyed religious hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; made slaughter on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they might make their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie good: &amp; that matter is not yet pacifyed, for about <hi>Gaunt</hi> &amp; other townes are many that séeke to doe mischiefe, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their owne nation and countreymen. Which is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of sorrow, &amp; a sore dangerous thing to continue.</p>
            <p>The power of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> in manye sortes of seruices hath done what they coulde, to vistresse the bandes that the states giue entertainement too, but the states and their
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5278:36"/>

For, he that shall write of euerye thing was done, hadde néede to haue manye bodies, to be in euerye place at once, and twice so many eies, to note in what order the thinges fell out, or otherwise he maye misse of the troth, as some haue, that were in the fielde when seruice was to be séene, whose intelligence I hadde, and yet an other in the same company doth tell me a contrary tale: For whiles one is in the skirmishe, and another is a forraging, they are seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callye occupyed, and will make sundry discourses: and for my owne parte, I proteste before God, I hadde rather followe the truth of the matter, than the flatterie of the time: so that if anye error haue passed my pen, it oughte to be pardonable, for that I hate to publishe &amp; set out a fable, and loue to preferre the knowledge and vnderstanding of a troth: and speaking of any man or matter, enimy or friend, I woulde yéelde them due praise and commendation, not onely for to winne my workes the more credite, but lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to vse a kinde of duetifull courteste, and so to pay in reporte euery person lyuing, the debt that I do owe him.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is to be vnderstoode, that whiles <hi>Don Iohn</hi> was busie aboute his warres, the Quéenes Maiestie sente Embassadours to treate of amitie and peace, (as you haue hearde before) and the laste that went ouer aboute these chargeable affairs, were two most honorable personages, the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> &amp; sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> on whom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as gallant a traine of Gentlemen, as wente from hence to <hi>Flaunders</hi> these twenty yeares. And as the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte goeth, these noble Embassadoures helde and kepte suche chéere (in a déere and scarce season for victualles) that the like hathe not béene séene, neyther of late, nor manye

yeres agoe. And the bountie that one of the Embassadours vsed (whose déedes shall shewe his name) out of hys owne purse and francke liberalitie, excéeded, and is to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for euer. And when these Embassadors had laine there a greate while, (and finished that was thought necessarie &amp; méete) they returned to the Courte. Since whiche time (as God ordaines all thinges) <hi>Don Iohn</hi> is dead, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble men more. And the plague is so hote among the <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> and the rest that lies in camps (as is to bée pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that euen as a shephearde doth point oute his shéep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ulles out those lambe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that he sendes to the slaughter house: so God (as it séemeth) with his stretched out arme, toucheth whome hée pleaseth, &amp; by the finger of hys wrath and scourge of plague, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this is a thing maruelously to be noted (not specially abroade, but wisely here at home) that some haue no power to goe from the plague, and some, goe where they will, the plague doeth followe them. For it skippeth ouer houses and housholdes, and enters in their doores, that maketh sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now, if men would looke narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the sore affliction of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> for the space of thirty yeares, they would thinke they haue had plagues ynowe (if God so were pleased) besides the fearefull pestilence it selfe, which of all things is most terrible, and yet the more is the pitie, there cannot be a worse plague among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than disagréement, and publique dissention, whiche is to bée feared hathe taken suche déepe roote in <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> that it wil not, nor can not be holpen, but by the

            <head>¶ To the VVorlde.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>GO sillie Booke to suttle Worlde, and shevv thy simple face,</l>
               <l>And forvvard passe, and do not turne agayne to my disgrace.</l>
               <l>For thou shalt bring to peoples eares but troth that needes not blush,</l>
               <l>And though Maell Bouch giue thee rebuke, care not for that a rush,</l>
               <l>For euill tongs do ytch so sore, they must be rubbing still</l>
               <l>Against the teeth, that should hold fast the clapper of the Mill.</l>
               <l>Desire those men that likes thee not, to lay thee dovvne againe,</l>
               <l>Till some svveete nappe, and harmelesse sleepe hath settled troubled brayne.</l>
               <l>And vvhen one house doth shutte thee out, creepe to another streight,</l>
               <l>And though thy mayster be but playne, yet looke thou vse some sleight</l>
               <l>To purchace loue, and credite both, for that shall breede good bloud,</l>
               <l>And thou vvith prayse, and honest brute, mayst do thy Maister good.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5278:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>But if they reade thee in disdeyne, slippe from them if thou may,</l>
               <l>Let enuye svvell, and malice poult, I heare not vvhat they say.</l>
               <l>I made thee for to please the best, the vvorst may mend the vvhile,</l>
               <l>So vvisedome bids thee vvelcome Booke, thou mayst at folly smile.</l>
               <l>An ounce of prayse from vvise mens mouth, vvayes dovvne a pound of fame,</l>
               <l>That fooles do giue, vvhose slender skill, scarce scannes mens honest name.</l>
               <l>If Court embrace thee for my sake, to Countrey then in post,</l>
               <l>Be sure then neyther thy bare vvords, nor my poore vvorke is lost.</l>
               <l>Where Souldioures are, aduance thy selfe, for though some faults they spye,</l>
               <l>Their martiall minds vvill make them cast on thee a friendly eye.</l>
               <l>Among Diuines and Scholemen oft, come not, but for a change,</l>
               <l>For at thy levvde and rubbish phrase, the learned vvill looke strange.</l>
               <l>To men of Lavv do freelie goe, for they good fellovves are,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5278:38"/>And can vvith toyes sometimes vvell ease, the vveight of Countreys care.</l>
               <l>With Merchant men make thine aboade, vvho loues to heare of Peace:</l>
               <l>So shall it be, vvhen bloudie broyles in Flaunders ginnes to ceasse.</l>
               <l>Thus haue I taught thee vvhat good course thou oughtst of right to hold,</l>
               <l>Thou art a Booke, goe vvhere thou vvilte, like Bayard blind be bold.</l>
               <l>Thou shalt haue mates to follovv thee, and help thee if thou fall.</l>
               <l>I haue vvide scope at vvill to vvalke, yea Penne and Muse at call,</l>
               <l>And other Bookes that I must needes committe to Worldes report.</l>
               <l>He is thrice blest that vvell doth vvorke, our time is heere but short.</l>
