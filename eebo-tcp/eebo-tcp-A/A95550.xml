            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from Horſum in Suſſex, Relating the preſent
Eſtate of that County to his friend in London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received Yours of the 27 of <hi>June,</hi> and thanke you for your Intelligence: You tell
mee that upon the requeſt of Colonell <hi>Morley,</hi> it was granted him of the Houſe of
Commons to raiſe our County of <hi>Suſſex.</hi> Such are the ſuddaine commotions of the
Times, that it is done already; ſo that that noble Colonell may now ſpare his pains, unleſſe
hee make extreme haſte into this divided County. The Countrey is generally riſen about <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>
and proteſt they will fight for the King and the Countrey. At <hi>Pulborough</hi> they are in
the ſame condition, for the People there are much exaſperated to heare ſome of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are impriſoned by a Warrant from Colonell <hi>Stapley</hi> and others, for daring to Petition
the high and honourable Court of Parliament. With us at <hi>Horſum</hi> here are now 500 luſty
men in Armes, the occaſion was this. Upon Friday <hi>June</hi> the ſixteenth, the Magazine which
was laid up at this Towne was commanded away by the Committee to <hi>Arundell,</hi> but our
Countrey-men are generally ſo ill affected, that they roſe, with one Conſent, and two or three
hundred appeared in an inſtant, leaving their Mattocks and Plowes to reſcue the Swords and
Muſquets: To the Market-houſe they come immediatly, and cauſe <hi>George David</hi> (who thanks
God hee is well mended in theſe times) and the reſt of the pious zelots, who had loaded the
Carts with countrey-Armes, to carry them back into the Market-loft: Since that, theſe ſtout
Ruſticks have endured watching every night, and by turnes have attended the Armes ſome
nights ſixtie at a time. On Tueſday night laſt at a full Aſſembly in the Market-place it was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unſeaſonable, unreaſonable (as Maſter <hi>Chatfell</hi> ſaid of the Petition) to watch them any
longer, and Reſolved upon the Queſtion, That the day following, being Wedneſday, at the
ſound of Drum and ringing of the Bells, thoſe men both in Towne and Countrey who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to fight for the King and the Liberties of the County, againſt the encroachments of one
<hi>Freeman,</hi> and his Followers, ſhould come in and take what Armes they pleaſed. About eleven
of the clock yeſterday, there was a great appearance, two or three hundred at leaſt, every one
choſe his Muſquet and other Armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then marched out to trayne in the Common. On this
day, <hi>June</hi> 29, there came in as many more Countrey-men, expecting Armes likewiſe; ſo that
now there are five or ſix hundred well Armed, and many of them very good Horſe. This wee
doubt will bee but the beginning of ſorrow to our diſtreſſed County, for all the well-affected
begin to leave us, and then what can wee expect but miſchiefe? As ſoone as the Drum beate
Captaine <hi>Shepheard</hi> felt himſelfe not well his Belly-ak't, as if hee feared the Egyptians would
make a Drum of it, and hee thought beſt to goe to <hi>Lewis</hi> for ſome Phiſick. Lievetenant
<hi>Hunniwood</hi> that knocking agitator left his forge and went to <hi>London</hi> for ſome forces Miſtris
<hi>Chatfield</hi> adviſed her husband to withdraw for feare they ſhould doe him more miſchiefe then
with ſongs.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers ſay had they known of their going they would have held their Styrrops. Their
words and demands are very high; as yet they hurt noe man, but threaten to diſ-Arme three
or foure which is the totall number of us that are well-affected. But that was allwaies the
ſubtletie of our deſperate Malignants to pretend they would doe no body any hurt; that
they may gaine the more love, but wee have learnt they are <hi>Egiptians</hi> and therefore may and
muſt bee plundered: But good Sir how ſhall wee doe it? Our Miniſter is gone and dares
not ſtand to tell us; the well-affected are all fled: Maſter <hi>Dod</hi> and <hi>Penfold</hi> are truſſing up
their packets for <hi>Arundell</hi> again, and thoſe who are accounted the godly; ſo that wee feare
the wicked will inherit the earth again. To conclude, our feares are great, the County is riſen
both heere and at <hi>Pulborough</hi> and they pretend the bottome of the buſineſſe to bee, becauſe
their Petition was not anſwered: Bold varlets; had they beene anſwered as their neighbours
the <hi>Surry</hi> men were, perhaps they would have beene as quiet as they. But the better wee uſe
them the worſe they appeare; their number is ſo great and likely to increaſe ſo much that
unleſſe a thouſand bee ſent downe preſently they are like to bee as high heere as in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> For
your comming down I know not what to adviſe you, if you come your perſon will bee in
danger, if you come not, your Armes. Farewell.</p>
