            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Miniſters and godly men about me, ſeeing ſo many miſeries and calamities daily befall me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one was over an another coming on me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, hardly giving me breath, and ſtill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and greater: they did conclude, that certainly theſe fearful afflictions could not be laid on me for triall, or as afflictions that God layes on his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but muſt be for ſome notorious ſins formerly committed, or that now I lived in, and therefore they looked into the actions of my life: and when they had made a Catalogue of what they thought fit to charge me with, they came fairely and privately to me, and told me, they were the Servants and Miniſters of God, and thought they were obliged by their office, to let me know wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived I had done amiſſe, and what might be the cauſe of all theſe puniſhments that befell me.</p>
            <p>I told them I took it kindly at their hands, and thanked them heartily for it, and that I would deale clearly and ingenuouſly with them, and conceal nothing of truth that I knew: and I could not but confeſſe that my afflictions had been great and many, and that for theſe twenty yeares laſt paſt, I have hardly any time been free; as the loſſe of my Wife and many Children when they were young, and now my two onely Sonnes, when they were come to Mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and I began to have comfort in them, the youngeſt ſo foulely to murther the eldeſt in his bed ſleeping, and thereby to ſuffer ſo ignominious a death at the Gallows, his foul offence juſtly deſerving it. Then I remembred my perpetuall Impriſonment for almoſt theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen years, and the worſt of Impriſonments, Ship board, and the Sequeſtring my Eſtate for many yeares, and taking away all my ſtock, and goods, to the value of twenty thouſand pounds and more, and for divers yeares, not allowing me any thing to keep me and my Children: and now to be taken from my houſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and clap'd up in a Countrey Caſtle, there to remaine during pleaſure, and God knowes for what. For I profeſſe to you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that notwithſtanding all theſe Impriſonments, and Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings, and clappings up, I never acted any thing againſt the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, or State that now is, nor ever in all this time was in Armes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30430:3"/>
againſt them, or ever any wayes aſſiſted the contrary party, or joyned in any Petition againſt them, or ever held any correſpondency in any Plottings againſt them, nor in all their Examinations and Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, nor in the time I was forced to Compound for my Eſtate, could they charge me with any Delinquency, but onely of that for not paying a Taxe for my Parke, which I refuſed to pay, becauſe it was over rated, and upon abatement paid it. And this is all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency they could ever charge me with, though I had been Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred ſeven yeares, and Impriſoned, and forced, before I could get off the Sequeſtration, to pay for Compoſition three thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. And I hope Gentlemen, ſaid I, this is no ſuch crying Sinne againſt God, to draw down the plagues of Heaven in ſuch a fearfull manner upon me.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid they, we know you have ſuffered very much, both in your Perſon and Eſtate, and have had very hard meaſure; but that is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of State, and therefore we meddle not with it; but we come to treat with you, onely about thoſe things, wherein as we conceive, you have failed in your duty towards God.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, ſaid I, let me know wherein, and I will give you the beſt ſatisfaction I can; and wherein I am faulty, I ſhall ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſe it, and I hope then, you will joyne with me, to beg Heavens pardon for me.</p>

               <head>THE ANSWER.</head>
               <p>'Tis true, ſaid I, Sir <hi>Thomas Sondes</hi> did erect a Free-Schoole in <hi>Throwly,</hi> and gave ſix pounds a yeare to the Maſter, but not twenty Nobles, nor his Diet; And it was ſo good and neceſſary a work, that I alwayes liked very well of it, and intended, as the Neighbours know, not onely to have continued that ſtipend, but to have made it as much more, and ſo poſſibly may doe yet. But the Schoole-houſe being falne down, and my many troubles and Sequeſtrations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon me, for the preſent diverted me; and now upon the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning of it, looking better into the Will, I doe not finde that Sir <hi>Thomas Sondes</hi> bindes his Heires, but onely his Executors to performe the ſame; and that he gives ſix pounds a yeare out of his lands, but ſayes not for ever; beſides in the cloſe of that part of the Will in which he gives his Legacies, and this and other charitable bequeſts, in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30430:3"/>
close of all he hath theſe words, <hi>That for the fulfilling of every bequeath in this my laſt Will and Teſtament, therefore, as alſo for the brotherly love and affection which I beare to my deare and wel beloved Brother</hi> Michael Sondes <hi>Eſq. I give and bequeath to my ſaid Brother, the Leaſe of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of</hi> Stausfield, <hi>the Leaſe of the Woods there, the Leaſe of the Parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of</hi> Throwly, <hi>the Leaſe of</hi> Ruſhmore, <hi>and all other Leaſes whatſoever I have in right or poſſeſsion.</hi> Theſe Leaſes are all given to perform that Charitable Deed of the School, and the other Charitable Uſes in his Will. Now the longeſt of theſe Leaſes were but for forty yeares, or three lives. The Leaſes for yeares being long ſince expired, it being threeſcore years ſince he dyed: and the Leaſes for Lives ended with my Father Sir <hi>Richard Sondes,</hi> ſo that I have nothing of all the Eſtate that was to maintain this School, nor one foot of Land as Heire or Executor to him or to his Executors, and therefore neither in Law nor Conſcience am I any wayes bound to maintain it, having neither Lands nor any thing of an Eſtate from him. Notwithſtanding I like ſo well of the thing, as I intend, (and that ſuddenly, if I can be at quiet) not onely to give that penſion of ſix pounds a yeare, towards a Free-Schoole, but alſo as much more, and a conveniency of an houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an addition of a certainty in mony for the reliefe of the Poore. Upon this, they, peruſing the Will, and finding it to be as I ſaid, reſted ſatisfied, and approved of my good intention.</p>

               <head>THE SECOND CHARGE.</head>
               <p>Next, ſay they, we underſtand that you were Executor or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator to the Will of Alderman <hi>Freeman,</hi> and that he gave great ſummes of money to many charitable uſes, and great Legacies to his friends and kindred, which you have not ſatisfied.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>THE ANSWER.</head>
               <p>It is true, upon my Couſin <hi>Freemans</hi> renouncing the Executorſhip, I and my Wife ſhe being his onely child) did take out Letters of Adminiſtration, and to my beſt ability, did indeavour to get in all his Eſtate, and did as it came in, pay his debts, and Funerall Charges, and all the petty Legacies to divers friends, and the Legacies to his poore kindred and Servants, and was in hope there would have come in enough to pay all, but till the debt of ten thouſand pounds, which the Alderman made his kindred (certaine Merchants) to owe him, and the returne of the Muſcovy ſtock, wherein the Alderman accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he had twenty five thouſand pounds adventure, till theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſummes were aſcertained, it was dubious how the Eſtate would prove. I therefore treated with thoſe Merchants his kindred, Sir <hi>Thomas Soams,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Flyer</hi> to pay the debt, they refus'd it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd it to account, and ſo, much time was ſpent about it. Then I put it in ſuit, and it was referr'd to Merchants to certifie, who when they had examined all Books, in fine, made the Alderman indebted to them, two hundred and odde pounds, and ſo decreed for that ten
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30430:4"/>
thouſand pounds. And for the five and twenty thouſand pounds in the <hi>Muſcovia</hi> ſtock, there never came of it to the Aldermans eſtate above eight thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>Theſe two great ſums falling thus ſhort, ſtopt my hand from paying any more Legacies, and thereupon followed divers ſuits from the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and others, for their Legacies, in Chancery, where I delivered in an account upon Oath, in which is ſet down the ful of all the receipts and disburſements of the Eſtate, and proved it by the oath of him that managed the Eſtate, who was a Servant of the Aldermans, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by conſent of all parties to doe the ſame. And I am confident there is not in that account any thing omitted that ought to be put in, nor any thing charged that was not truly paid and disburſed. And in that account there is more disburſed by me than received, eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds or thereabout, I am ſo much a gainer by it. At laſt the whole buſineſſe upon Suit being referr'd to a Maſter of Chancery, and from him to Merchants, and from them to Accomptants, to ſee what the Eſtate would produce, after long time ſpent, they certified (ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off my owne Legacie of ſeven thouſand pounds, and almoſt all other, allowing onely juſt debts and other neceſſary payments) that the Eſtate would produce toward payment of Legacies but foure ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and a penny in the pound, the Legatees giving ſecurity to repay proportionably, if more be recovered out of the Aldermans eſtate, there being ſix thouſand pound debt ſtill in demand. And thus ſtands the condition of the Eſtate, and therefore I conceive there can be no blame in me, for not paying every man his full Legacy. I proteſt, that I was ſo willing to doe it, that if a thouſand pounds or two would have done it, I would have disburſed it out of my owne purſe.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the falling ſhort of the Eſtate was from theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following, which was not in my power to remedy:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the loſſe of ten thouſand pounds by his kindred, which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman accounted a ſure debt, but it could not be recovered.</p>
               <p>Next, the falling ſhort of the Muſcovia ſtock, at leaſt fifteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds of what he accounted it; and this could be no fault of mine, being managed by the Company, I but received the mony as they paid it in, and ſo put it to account.</p>
               <p>Then the loſſe of his two Ships in the Straits, taken by the Turks, that Summer before he dyed. Thoſe Ships were the <hi>Hector,</hi> and the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ralph,</hi> which if they had come home, he computed would have been worth him eight thouſand pound.</p>
               <p>Then he bought the Fee ſimple of his houſe, which coſt him two thouſand pounds, and the building and fitting of it againſt his Mayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty coſt him two thouſand pounds more. His Caſh-keeper <hi>Rowland</hi> ranne him out of caſh fifteen hundred pounds; and his expences in the time of his Mayoralty, and his entertainment of the King and Queen juſt before his death, coſt him at leaſt foure thouſand pounds more.</p>
               <p>All theſe loſſes and expences hapned ſince the making of his Will, and the diſpoſing of his Eſtate. And beſides all this, his Debts came
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30430:4"/>
to almoſt four thouſand pounds more than he accounted them, which muſt be and are paid. All which ſummes amount to forty ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and five hundred pounds. Enough to ſink a good eſtate. And therefore the world need not wonder, that his Eſtate which remaines will pay but foure ſhillings and a peny in the pound.</p>
               <p>I am ſo much a gainer by the Adminiſtration, that let me be but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied what I can prove I have truly payd out for him, I ſhall willingly quit mine and my Wifes Legacy, which is ſeven thouſand pounds, and demand nothing for it; and I am ſure my Childs part would have come to twenty thouſand pounds at leaſt. All my paines and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance about it for theſe twenty yeares, I will rate at nothing; a great deale of money ſhall not hire me to doe ſo much.</p>
               <p>Many think foure ſhillings and a peny a ſmall proportion; let me be free and quiet, I will be content to loſe all. And I profeſſe to Heaven, not a farthing that I have any wayes got by it that I know of, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a world of care and trouble. No man ſhall be content with a leſſe ſhare than my ſelfe, I deſire nothing, and others may have what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the Eſtate will produce, and I think, no man in conſcience can demand more.</p>
               <p>The Cloath workers of late, ſince the time of this ſad accident, ſent a Letter to me for their Legacie, thinking now to hit the bird in the eye: They had formerly with a long and chargeable Suit kept me in the Chancery about it; and being able to doe no good with me there, then they had me to Guild-Hall before the Commiſſioners for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Uſes; and being caſt out thence, cunningly under colour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of poore Priſoners, they got me into Salters-Hall, and there (ſuch was the wiſdome of that Court) they got a Decree for the Legacy with treble damages, ſuch being their power, in ſome caſes, though not in mine. This blind Decree was made, when neither I my ſelf, nor any Counſell for me was there that could ſay any thing to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and ſo peremptory they were, that upon my coming to town, I was ſerved with the Order, to pay the money, and with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I got leave for me and my Counſell to be heard, and upon the Hearing they reverſed the Order, and referred the buſineſſe to M. <hi>Wilde</hi> and M. <hi>Fountaine,</hi> authoriſing them to take two Accomptants to them, to examine what the Eſtate would produce; Mr. <hi>Bremstone,</hi> then Chaireman, ſaying, <hi>God forbid we ſhould ever doe ſo unjust an act, as to enjoyne an Adminiſtrator to pay more than the Eſtate will produce.</hi> They had ſome meetings about it, but Salters-Hall being put downe (as I think moſt juſtly) nothing was done. And now they come upon point of Conſcience, hoping that upon this my ſad loſſe, the Lord (as they ſay) would open my heart to pay the Legacy, and relieve the Poore, and that God would bleſſe me the better for it. They began their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thus, <hi>The Wiſe-man ſaith, That words ſpoke in ſeaſon, are like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi> and then they tell me that the Judges above a yeare agoe ordered the payment of it.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwered, That to ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon, was much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30430:5"/>
commended by wiſe <hi>Solomon;</hi> and certainly then they are as much to be diſcommended, who move things unſeaſonably, and ground them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on things that are not true. Indeed if the money had been juſtly due, I think now had been no ſeaſonable time ſo haſtily to preſſe it. And it is a great miſtake, where they ſay there is an Order from the Judges of Salters Hall, that Order being vacated. So that, if the Poor have not what is due to them, it is their fault and not mine; I long ſince offered them what proportion the Eſtate would produce, and more they ought not to deſire. I ſaid moreover to them, that neither my thoughts nor my conſcience were troubled for not well performing the Aldermans Will, I had done it with all the ſincerity of my ſoule, and ſo little to my advantage, that I was a great loſer by it. And when I have endeavoured what I can, if the Eſtate fall ſhort, the blame is not mine; I had given in a true and juſt account of what I had received and paid.</p>
               <p>And for the afflictions that befell me, I told them, <hi>I muſt and doe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſubmit to the will of Heaven, and ſay, Gods will be done, he may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh when, where, and how he pleaſeth; I wiſhed them not to judge raſhly, nor inſult over another mans miſeries, for thou knowest not O man what may befall thee next. The like to this of mine I deſire God to divert from them all.</hi> And ſo I concluded my Letter.</p>
               <p>Now what I ſaid to the Cloathworkers, I ſay to all Legatees yet unſatisfied, they may have that proportion the Eſtate will produce.</p>
               <p>Upon a ſuit of Mr. <hi>Henry Pettit</hi>'s for his and his Fathers Legacy, it was referred out of the Chancery to Merchants, Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rous,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Abdy,</hi> who appointed Accomptants to caſt up the Eſtate, and certifie to them what it would produce, and they have made it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce foure ſhillings and a peny in the pound, allowing me neither my owne Legacy of ſeven thouſand pounds, nor hardly any other, nor my charges, which came to three or foure thouſand pounds. And this four ſhillings and a peny in the pound, the Legatees are to have, giving Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to re-pay proportionably, what more ſhall be recovered from the Aldermans eſtate, there being ſix thouſand pounds debt ſtill in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and two lately recovered of me.</p>
               <p>This proportion upon ſuch ſecurity I am ſtill contented to pay, or two ſhillings in the pound without ſecurity, as ſome for quietneſſe ſake have taken, and this I leave to every mans choice. And thoſe that will ſo doe, let them this Michaelmas Terme enter their names at Mr. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingtons</hi> neere <hi>Moore fields,</hi> who is one of the Accomptants, and they ſhall forthwith be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>And I hope thoſe who are already over-payd will without farther trouble repay their proportion, otherwiſe I muſt pay all theſe monies out of my owne purſe, nothing of the Eſtate being left to doe it.</p>
               <p>But I returne to the Miniſters, who as they ſaid had yet ſome great matters to charge me with. I deſired to know them.</p>

               <head>THE THIRD CHARGE.</head>
               <p>Then they ſaid, That it was generally reported that my Son <hi>George</hi> was marryed to a vertuous and good Gentlewoman, and that when I came to know it, I would by no meanes give way to it, but upon my bleſſing forbade him to accompany with her, and that if he did not leave her, I would never look on him, or give him anything I could keep from him. And that to be ſure to keep him from having her, I had conſorted him with one of the moſt debauched young men of the Countrey, ſo that it appeared, I cared not what became of his ſoule, if I could keep his body from her.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>THE ANSWER.</head>
               <p>I never knew that he was marryed to her, nor doe I yet believe that ever he was, either according to the old or new forme. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme me in this beliefe, I have it under his owne hand. In an anſwer of his to a Letter of hers, he ſayes, <hi>All that ſhe can pretend to, is, that he promiſed her marriage, wherein he confeſſeth that he might perhaps have uſed ſome fooliſh expreſsions tending that way, but conceived ſhe would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made uſe of them to his ruine; and withall tells her, That ſhe must now lay aſide thoſe thoughts; for he did ſee ſo much inconvenience in it, by reaſon of the neerneſſe of blood, and the high distaſte of his Father, that it would be unhappy for them both.</hi> Theſe are his own expreſſions in a Letter to her.</p>
               <p>Now the firſt notice that I had of the buſineſſe, was in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1654. which was by a Letter from my Brother <hi>Huginſon,</hi> wherein he writes, That he had thought his couſin <hi>George</hi> had come to his houſe out of love to Bowling, but he ſaw now that it was out of love to his couſin <hi>Anne Delaune,</hi> and that if it were not timely prevented, they might make themſelves ſure together.</p>
               <p>This unexpected newescame to me late at night. I ſaid nothing then to it, but the next morning went to <hi>Lingſted,</hi> and asked for my Siſter, and told her, I hoped ſhe had not ſo ſerved me, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured my ruine. She pleaded ignorance, and that ſhe knew nothing of it, and that ſhe utterly diſliked it. I asked then to ſpeak with her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who with ſome difficulty was brought to me. I ſaid to her, Couſin, there is a buſineſſe going on between my Son and you, altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the liking of your Parents, and if you goe on, it will be the ruine of you both, for I ſhall never give way to it, I hold it ſo unlawfull for Couſin Germans to Marry, and therefore if you will now lay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and goe no farther in it, I ſhall be a good friend to you, and take care to provide you a fitting Husband.</p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, it is gone ſo farre that I thinke my Couſin <hi>George</hi> will not conſent to what you propound, but if he be willing, I ſhall not be againſt it, yet I thinke he will not. That I ſhall try, ſaid I, when I come home, having not yet ſpoke with him about it.</p>
               <p>When I came home, I let my Sonne know, that I had heard of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30430:6"/>
ſuch a buſineſſe, and had ſpoken with his Couſin about it, and that ſhe, finding it ſo diſtaſtfull to her Mother and me, ſeemed willing to lay it aſide, if the like willingneſſe were in him. Is ſhe ſo, ſaid he? yes really ſaid I, I doe not ſee but ſhe may be perſwaded to it, and ſo I would have you, for I tell you, if you goe on, it will be the ruine of you both. Perhaps this familiarity may have ſomewhat ſetled your affections to one another, and therefore for the preſent, I would have you forbeare going to her, and that will leſſen it.</p>
               <p>Upon this he abſented for a few dayes, but being under-hand ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by them to come thither, he was very importunate with me to goe. I confeſſe I was much againſt it, but becauſe he ſo earneſtly preſt it, at laſt I gave way to it, telling him, I hoped it might be ſo good, and that he would ſo fully tell her his mind, that ſhe might have no more thoughts of it. About an houre after he was gone, I went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and when I came to <hi>Lingsted,</hi> I asked for them, and my Siſter telling me they were in the Parlour, come ſaid I, let you and I goe to them, and when we came to them, Couſin and Sonne, ſaid I, I have already ſpoken to you both apart, now I will tell you my minde together. It is this. I ſhall never give my conſent that you two ſhall be Marryed together, for I doe, and ever did abhorre the Marriage of Couſin Germans, and therefore if you will both fairely lay it down, there need be no more words of it, and I thinke no wrong to either party. For if you have been ſo fooliſh, as to make engagements to one another, it was without your Parents conſents, or knowledge, and between parties not fit to marry together, and now your Parents know of it, they are utterly againſt it, and therefore you may both diſingage each other of your promiſes, and I think no harme done, but all well, and then Couſin <hi>Anne,</hi> be aſſured, I ſhall be a good friend to you.</p>
               <p>Upon this the young couple began to be ſomething at a ſtand, when preſently my Siſter ſaid, Brother, what if my Daughter be with Childe? Truly Siſter, ſaid I, it is a queſtion very unſeaſonably put, and I thinke upon no ground, for I am confident that he did never lye with her, (which he hath often ſince profeſſed, and that he did not know whether ſhe were Man or Woman) but if ſhe be with childe, ſaid I, the Baſtard muſt be kept; better ſo then worſe, for I tell you <hi>George,</hi> if you Marry her, you muſt not look to come within my doores. Upon this my Siſter preſently replyed, Couſin <hi>George,</hi> be not diſcouraged with that, for if your Father will not receive you, I will, and you ſhall be welcome to me ſtay as long as you pleaſe. This is right, ſaid I, now you have fully diſcovered your ſelfe to be what I thought you, the maine contriver of the match, I have done. Come <hi>George,</hi> ſaid I, if you will goe home with me, well and good, if not, take what comes of it, and ſo away I went. About halfe an houre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, my Sonne followed me home, I told him, it was well he was come, and wiſht him to forbeare going thither anymore, he followed my advice, and kept with me. But privately under-hand my Siſter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30430:6"/>
and his Couſin ſent to him, and then ſhe carryed her Daughter up to <hi>London,</hi> and there indeavoured to have them Asked at Church, and Cryed at Market; which comming to my eare, I prevented, and that moſt fearfully madded her and her party. And to prevent farther at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the like nature, his Uncle <hi>Dudly</hi> comming in the nick of time, and offering himſelfe, my ſonne alſo deſiring it, he was admitted his companion and bed-fellow to ſtave them off; for as ſoone as my back was turn'd, they were ſtill ſoliciting of him. Then my ſonne preſently wrote a civil Letter to her, that whatever his intents were heretofore, yet the matter being now known to his Father, he did ſee ſo much averſneſs in him, that he could not goe on; and that they were ſo neer of blood, that he feared God would never proſper ſuch a Mariage, and therefore deſired her to have no more thoughts of it. After this, her friends ſoliciting and troubling him, he went into <hi>Suſſex</hi> with his Uncle <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and was abſent from me neere ſix months. In all that time, for ought I ever heard, they kept very good company, and lived orderly, and what ever his Uncle did himſelfe, I am ſure he was carefull that my ſon ſhould no wayes be debauched, neither did I at his return find him tainted with the vices of the times, but every way very well. I am ſure he did run far greater hazards when he kept her kinred company, for I have been informed by a good hand, that there were ſtrange plots to intoxicate him, ſo to work their ends, I am aſhamed to mention the manner of it. Indeed they could never compaſſe their deſigne, for he hath very often profeſſed that he did never lye with her, nor was ever marryed to her: Something they talk of, was ſaid by a man of their procuring in a Chamber, but ſure it ſignified nothing; for ſhe hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged him of that and all his other promiſes to her, and as he ſaid, did give him free liberty to marry whom he pleaſed. And I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, had it not been for the Mother, little diſpute had been about it; For not long defore his death, he was heard to ſay, that he would not for ten thouſand pound that he had been marryed to his Couſin <hi>Anne de Laune,</hi> for I could not have lov'd her, ſaid he, a moneth to an end. And I am ſure of late he was ſo averſe to them, that he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any mention of her or her Mother.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſtory of that ſo much talkt of marriage. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I pray you lies the hainouſneſſe of my ſin in this buſineſſe, if I did forbid my ſon to marry, where to me it ſeems abſolutely forbidden by the Word of God, by Decrees of Ancient Councils, and not allowed by the moſt Orthodox and beſt men? I am ſure the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not approach to any that is neere of kin to thee;</hi> and I am ſure Couſin Germans are very neere of kin. Let others doe as they will, and make what conſtructions they pleaſe, the words of the Text have and ever ſhall prevaile with me. So long as God hath given us choice enough, I think I ſhall not venture within the line. And what ever may be talked, it was neither ſmalneſſe of portion, nor want of proportion and handſomneſſe, nor meanneſſe of birth, nor unfitneſſe of yeers, or any outward thing, (though perhaps there might be enough to except
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30430:7"/>
againſt) that made me ſo averſe, but onely the prohibition of Heaven, which ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not approach, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now Gentlemen, if I muſt be puniſhed for cauſing my ſon to obey that which I conceive to be the Law of God, <hi>Fiat voluntas Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, ſaid the Miniſters, we cannot think, neither muſt you, that God will puniſh you for keeping his Lawes; and being you are perſwaded, that it is unlawfull for Couſin Germans to marry together, and that your ſonne was never marryed to her according to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor had ever carnally known her, we cannot conceive you were at all too blame to forbid it, as ſoone as it came to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but that you did well in it; ſuch Marriages ſeldome or never proſpering.</p>
               <p>But Sir, ſaid they, being you are pleaſed thus fairly to treat with us, give us leave to be plaine with you, and come a little neerer home to you, and tell you of ſome perſonall vices, which we think ſtick cloſe to you.</p>

               <head>THE ANSWER.</head>
               <p>Gentlemen, ſaid I, now you touch me to the quick, and make mee examine all my wayes, and the ſins of my youth; What man is there that liveth and ſinneth not? Who can ſay that he is cleane? I confeſſe I have ſinned, and doe daily, and while I live in this body of fleſh, it is hard not to ſin. While we live here on earth, we are ſtill but men, and not Angels or Saints.</p>
               <p>But to anſwer to the particulars of the Charge, and firſt to that of Covetouſneſſe. Covetouſneſſe is that which reſts, as I conceive, in the affections and deſires of the minde; And I profeſſe, as far as I know my owne ſoule, I doe not, nor ever did covet my neighbours houſe, Lands or Goods, or any thing of another mans, ſo as wrongfully to deprive him of it. <hi>I never ſaid to gold, Thou art my god, nor truſted in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain riches. If my owne ſoule deceive me not, I could act that part
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30430:7"/>
Chriſt commanded the young man in the Goſpel, Sell all that thou haſt, and come and follow me: I could eaſily part with all when he commands.</hi> I have been deprived of Houſes, Lands, Goods, Liberty, and that cauſeleſly, in an inſtant, my loſſes have been to the value of thirty or forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds; <hi>And I thank Heaven, I never ſhed teare, nor broke nights ſleep for it. I have peace and quiet within. Theſe outward loſſes never troubled me. They ſeemed ſo looſe upon me, and cleaved ſo little to me, that the parting from them never drew drop of blood from me, or cauſed ſo much as one ſigh. I found my ſelfe ſtill, and a contented and happy man, though I wanted them. I ſaw they added little to it. And ſhould the like befall me againe, I doubt not but I ſhould ſtill be the ſame. By this I finde my heart is not ſet on Covetouſneſſe. But if an honest indeavour, not to ſuffer a mans ſelfe to be defrauded and couſened (though I thinke I have been ſo as much as any) and if to manage an Estate as neere as I can to the beſt, if to improve it and buſie a mans ſelfe about it, if that be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, I thinke I am guilty of it. Sure there is good warrant, both from Reaſon and Scripture, that every man ſhould labour and indeavour in that way God hath placed him, and ſhould tend to ſomething. If God hath bleſſed my indeavours in theſe wayes; men may envy it, but ſure no blame is due to me for it.</hi>

                  <head>To the Charge of Hoſpitality.</head>
                  <p>You charge me for defect in Hoſpitality. I am ſure no mans houſe in the Country is more open to Poor and Rich then mine; and if the jealouſies of the times, and my owne reſtraint did not now hinder, it would ſtill be more open. As it is, I am ſure there are conſtantly twenty poor people at leaſt weekly relieved, and that more then once. My loweſt proportion in my houſe, whether I be there or not, is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week a Bullock, of about fifty Stone, a Quarter of Wheat, and a Quarter of Malt for drinke, which makes about a Barrell a day for my houſhold. I mention not Sheep and other things more or leſſe, when I and my Children (when I had any) were at home. Sure this is no very niggardly proportion for a Family.</p>
                  <p>And for ſetting poore people to work (which I take to be as good a deed as moſt) I think few have exceeded me. I am ſure for well nigh thirty yeeres (except three or foure that I was in priſon) I have expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Labourers and Workmen, at leaſt a thouſand pounds a yeare. And I doe not know of one that I have imployed in all this time, or in all my life, Servants or others, whom I have defranded of their wages, or not paid them their hire.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, there is a Smith who did ſome work about Plowes and Carts, and ſhooing of Horſes, juſt at the time I was Sequeſtred and carryed to Priſon, when he demanded money of me, I told him, the Sequeſtrators, who had the Ploughs, and Carts, and Horſes, and the Corne, and all, ought in conſcience to pay him, and not I, who had no benefit of it; Him I turned over to the Sequeſtrators, as I thought I had juſt reaſon to doe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:30430:8"/>
There is likewiſe a <hi>Sandwich</hi> man, in a ſtore-houſe of whoſe, I had about thirty or forty Quarters of Wheat. This the Sequeſtrators alſo tooke away, and when he demanded Money of me for the hire of his Room, I refuſed to pay him, telling him, thoſe that have the Corn ought to pay for the Room. Other then theſe I know not any, to whom I have denyed payment, and I conceive there is much reaſon why they ſhould not be paid by me, and therefore I hope no great offence to Heaven in this.</p>

                  <head>To the Charge of being an hard Land-Lord.</head>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid I am an hard Land-Lord, and raiſe my Rents. I confeſſe as Tenants Leaſes expired, I took no Fines to renew, as my anceſtors uſed to doe, but let out my Farmes at improved Rents, both the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and my ſelfe better liking of it. But I doe not know that I let Farme to any Tenant, for more then I thought, (and I had ſome little skill) it was really and honeſtly worth, nor for more then, (had I been to have taken a Farme) I would have given for it my ſelfe. Nor have I any Tenant (though the times be now very bad) who ſhall ſay, Sir, my Farme is too deare, I cannot live upon it at the Rent, if he leave it to me but as good as it was when he took it, I will take it againe. Nay, notwithſtanding Corn is ſo cheap, I give any Tenant I have, liberty to leave his Farme, and I will take it. I never did, or ever will, force any Tenant to keep his Farme. Neither in all this time, hath any Tenant come to me to take his Farme again. Some indeed I would have outed of their Farmes (being none of the beſt Tenants) but could not perſwade them. I never arreſted or impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any Tenant for his Rent, nor willingly uſed any ſevere courſe, if I could indifferently be ſatisfied any other way. I have ſcarce deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my Rents of late, becauſe of the cheapneſſe of Corn, but have made all the ſhifts I could to get money to ſerve my occaſions, and ſpared my Tenants, that they might not be forced to put off their Corn at too mean rates. If theſe be the ſigns of an hard Landlord, then I am one.</p>
                  <p>There is one <hi>Ellen</hi> of <hi>Stausfield,</hi> I heare, hath complained of me for being ſo. I will tell you the caſe, and then you ſhall judge whether I deſerve it or not.</p>
                  <p>Laſt Michaelmas was two yeare, I let a Farme there to him of forty pounds a yeare. At the end of the yeare, I ſent to him for his Rent; his anſwer was, that it went hard with him the firſt yeare, being to buy all his ſtock and ſeaſons, therefore he deſired me to have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till he could make money of his Corne; upon his deſire I did forbeare him. About halfe a yeare after, I ſent to him againe, and then he ſaid, Corn was ſo low that he could make but little money of it. Upon this I forbore him till the other year was up, and he indebted to me two years rent, and went my ſelfe to him, and wiſht him to leave the Farme if he ſound he could doe no good upon it. Hee deſired to keep it, hoping the times would mend, and offered to make over his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30430:8"/>
ſtock to me for my ſecurity; this he did, and continued in his Farme, and at Lady day next promiſed to clear all. About a month after the time, I ſent to him to fulfill his promiſe, and was informed that he had ſold all his Corne, driven away his Stock, and carryed all his Goods, and was gone himſelfe, and had left me about twenty pounds worth of Corne on the ground, to ſatisfie for three yeeres rent, which was ſix ſcore pounds; ſo I was to be a loſer one hundred pounds by him. This is the truth, and who now doe you think did the wrong? Many of theſe hardneſſes have I uſed to my Tenants, and have been ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them.</p>

                  <p>To that Charge of my being unmarryed, and not living ſo chaſtly and vertuouſly as a Chriſtian ought to doe; I confeſſe, that for almoſt theſe twenty yeeres I have lived unmarryed, and I thank Heaven, I have an healthy able Body, and have naturall and carnall affections in me, and a love to Women and their company, and I think he deſerves to be un-mann'd that hath not.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I have been more vain and fooliſh with them then I ought to have been, Heaven forgive me. But for committing Fornication or Adultery with any Single or Marryed woman, I proteſt before Heaven (though perhaps few may believe it) I am clear from it. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had illegitimate iſſue, nor ever had carnall knowledge of any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſave of my owne Wife; nor of her, but as was fitting for procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; ſeldome or never, after I knew her to be with childe.</p>
                  <p>Neither was this abſtinence in me, from any frigidity or diſability in Nature, for my diſpoſitions that way, were (I thinke) as ſtrong as moſt mens.

                  <head>To the Charge of neglecting Family duties.</head>
                  <p>To that of ordering my Family and duties thereto belonging, I confeſſe, it is an excellent thing, when the Maſter can ſay, <hi>I and my houſe, doe and will ſerve the Lord.</hi> But it is hard in a great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family, to have all ſo well minded. It is the Maſters part to ſee them performe the outward duties of Gods ſervice, as Prayer, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church, and to ſhew them the way by his own godly example; this I was alwayes mindfull of, frequenting the Church on the Lords day both Forenoon and Afternoon, if not hindred by the weather, or ſome extraordinary occaſion, and calling upon my Servants to doe the ſame. And all the week after, it was my conſtant courſe, to pray with my Family once, if not twice every day; and if I had not a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> in my Houſe, I performed the office my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, though in my owne private devotions, Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30430:9"/>
Iuſed conſtantly, without failing, my owne conceived Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to Heaven, yet, to my Family, after the reading ſome part of the Scripture, I commonly uſed the ſet formes of Prayers of the Church, or of ſome other godly men: which in publick meetings, and no extraordinary occaſion hapning, I conceive to be very fitting, and ſufficiently warranted, both from <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> who compoſed Prayers for the Church; as likewiſe from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who made a Prayer for his Diſciples, and bid them pray This; <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. It is warranted alſo by the practice of Chriſt, who ſure had the Spirit of Prayer as much as any, yet in his Agony he uſed no variety, but three ſeverall times, as the Text hath it, went and ſaid the ſame words, <hi>Father if thou wilt, let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> He quarrelled not at the ſet forme, nor doe I know why any man ſhould. If another man have compoſed a Prayer, whoſe words ſpeak my minde to the full, and peradventure more full then my own words can doe it, why ſhould not I uſe them? Let thy heart and affections goe with his words, and then they are thine owne.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe I like not praying by roat; and I think him but a dull Chriſtian, who cannot or does not upon extraordinary occaſions, pour out his ſoul to God in his owne words. Thou mayeſt have ſome ſoars, which none but thy own words can diſcover. But at a publique meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; upon a generall confeſſion of our ſins, when we all joyn together in Prayer, what a pleaſant harmony, or rather thundering violence doth it uſe to Heaven gates, to bring down a remiſſion of our ſins? And this hath the Church of God uſed heretofore. For my part I cannot diſlike it, ſo the publick be not omitted, for I confeſſe, <hi>Nothing ſpeaks a Chriſtian better, then frequencie in prayer, no duty comes neer it. It makes thee acquainted with Heaven, it begets a familiarity between thee and thy god: that ye ſhall not be ſtrangers one to another; you have a friendly converſe together: it brings down Heaven to thee, it lifts thee up to Heaven. It is the key that unlocks all Gods treaſures. It is the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, <hi>which diſcovers and brings home to thee, that</hi> Terra incognita, <hi>and more then Indian treaſure. It makes Heaven and Earth all one. It makes thee ſee and enjoy God himſelf, without thy diſſolution. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Owles and Bats of this world, ſee not God, except he expreſſe his goodneſſe to them, in giving them Riches and Honour, and Wives, and Children, and ſuch outward bleſsings; and more or leſſe, as they receive of theſe, they judge of God accordingly. But thou ſhalt, when God hath taken away thy Children, and all other outward things, thou ſhalt ſee them really in him, and with more comfort then when thou hadſt them here. For here thou enjoyedſt them with a mixture of ill, in him thou enjoyeſt them pure, and all other happineſſes beſide. Thou haſt the Fountaine Head, and Body of the Sunne, from whence all theſe Rivulets and Beames proceed. This Elixar and Soveraigne balme, a wiſe Chriſtian will not loſe. I have found it the ſole medicine for all my afflictions, and as I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have, ſo I ever will make uſe of it.</hi>

                  <p>But I pray <hi>Paul</hi> let us reaſon it a little. <hi>Pray continually? must we pray when we enjoy? Prayer implyes want, and want cauſeth ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and mourning.

Thou injoyeſt not him, if thou wanteſt, or deſireſt any thing beſides himſelfe. And if thou injoyeſt him, what haſt thou to pray for? thou haſt already the fruition of what thou canſt pray for, or deſire. Sure then thou art to rejoyce, and ſolace thy ſelfe in thy God. Thou art already arrived at this Harbour and Haven of happineſſe. Thou needeſt then no more Windes, no freſh Gales of Prayer to fill thy Sayles, and carry thee to thy Port. Thou art come to it, thou maiſt now strike Sayle, and be at reſt, thou haſt no farther to goe then to thy God. Whither wouldſt thou ſayle? what? goe from thy God againe? wilt not thou reſt thy ſelfe now thou art come to him? what wouldſt thou have?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh but poore Soule, thou canst not alwayes injoy theſe feast dayes. The Sunne of righteouſneſſe will not alwayes ſhine ſo clear upon thee. There are Miſts and Clouds, that doe, and will daily ariſe from thy owne Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which will obſcure and darken that Sunne, and keep his cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light from thy Soule, and cauſe him to hide his face from thee. There will be times when the Bridegroom ſhall be taken away, as our Saviour ſayes, when thou ſhalt have loſt him whom thy Soule loveth. What wilt thou do then? that will be a ſad time indeed, and then thou hadſt need Faſt, and Mourne, and Pray, and night and day ſeek after him, thou hadſt need Hoyſe all thy Sayles to follow him, and run about the streets, and call to the Watchmen to help them, and uſe all meanes, both by thy ſelfe and others, to finde him out, and when thou haſt found him, be ſure to bold him faſt, and not let him goe.</hi>

                  <head>To the Charge of the Education of my Children.</head>
                  <p>Now for the Education of my Children, this I ſay. In their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yeares, they were tender and weake, and when I had buried many other, and had onely them two, I confeſſe, I was more fond and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent, and gave more way to them, then otherwiſe I ſhould have done. Yet I doe not know that I omitted any thing that was fitting for them. As ſoon as they were of yeares convenient, I put them out to very good and carefull Schools, <hi>Brumly</hi> and <hi>Wye,</hi> where I was often
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30430:10"/>
my ſelfe with them, to ſee that their Maſters educated them well, both for Religion and Learning, and was ever carefull to have them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with all other Maſters, to learne from them ſuch things as their ages were capable of. From School I carryed them to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> where I made choyce of an able and godly Tutor, and placed them in <hi>Sidney</hi> College. When they had been there two or three years, I brought them to <hi>London,</hi> intending to ſend my Eldeſt abroad into <hi>France,</hi> and my Youngeſt to the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> becauſe he had no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to travell. I went with my Eldeſt once or twice to <hi>Dover</hi> for that end, but <hi>France</hi> being at that time in much garboile, I durſt not venture him. After that, ſome overtures of Matches ſtayed him, and the Eldeſt not going abroad, the Youngeſt would not be perſwaded to goe to the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> (though I much preſt him to it) but would keep with his Brother. I deſired nothing more, then putting him upon ſome imployment, and gave him his choyce to take to what he would, but never could get him to take to any.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt they were in <hi>London,</hi> I had ſeverall Maſters, who came to my lodgings to inſtruct them. Their Singing, Dauncing, and Fence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Maſters, and one who read the Mathematicks. Thrice a week they went to the Mues to ride the great Horſe. Theſe Exerciſes they had conſtantly, and their Maſters, who were accounted the beſt in town, coſt me about ſix pound a week.</p>
                  <p>Every night I cauſed them to reade a Chapter or two, and then prayed with them, and willed them to uſe alſo their own private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>
                  <p>On the Sabbath dayes I carryed them to hear (as I thought) the beſt Preachers, and diſcourſed with them of what they heard.</p>
                  <p>On the week dayes, they often went to Lectures, and I took the beſt care I could, to keep them from idle company, and not fitting ſports, though Youth will have its vanities.</p>
                  <p>By my owne example, and beſt counſell, I diſſwaded them from debauchery. For I thanke Heaven, no man can taxe me for Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, or Gaming. I never to my knowledge, ſwore an Oath, but before a Magiſtrate, nor ever drank ſo much as might unman me, and make my ſelfe a Beaſt, I ever abhorred it. Though I muſt confeſſe, that I have ſometimes (yet but ſeldome) for company ſake drank more then enough, or did me good.</p>
                  <p>I never was in Whore-houſe, or uſed Whore, nor ever gamed for more then I was indifferent whether I won or loſt. I never played for love of Money, onely for company and recreation. And I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently ſay it, my Sonnes were alſo free from thoſe vices, except Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. I doe not thinke they did ever ſwear or whore. My youngeſt could not indure Wine or ſtrong drinke, and my eldeſt but ſeldome drank it. To that fooliſh ſport of Cocking they were addicted, but the youngeſt moſt, as alſo to Carding. He would play ſomewhat deep at thoſe games, but never at Dice. I often chid him, but could never break him of it. My eldeſt had handſomely left both, and was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30430:10"/>
ready to hearken to his Fathers advice, and I thinke, was virtuouſly diſpoſed. I am confident, all the world could not make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a known ſinne. He never failed Morning and Evening, to betake him ſelfe to his private Devotions, that I obſerved, neither do I know any vice that he was inclined to, he was of an affable, milde and ſoft nature, which won him the hearts of his friends and acquaintance; but his Brother of a contrary, pleaſing and courteous to none, but croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd to all, as much to his Father as any, and I knew not how to break him of it. I was in hope, that yeares and diſcretion might in time have made him to leave it, and ſo poſſibly it might, had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his Brothers vertues, and growing goodneſſe, thruſt him upon that divelliſh fact, which cauſed him moſt deſervedly to be cut off by a ſhamefull death, before he was come to the age of twenty yeares.</p>
                  <p>This is all I ſhall ſay for the Education of my Children. I am ſure, night and day my care, and my prayers has been for them. More then I did, I know not what to doe. Many a Father who hath not been at halfe that care and coſt I have been, have had their Children doe much better, could not doe worſe. But Gods will be done. Many are made to believe that I kept the youngeſt very ſhort of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. To that I ſhall ſay nothing here, but what Maſter <hi>Boreman,</hi> a Reverend and grave Divine, had from his owne mouth, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to teſtifie. That Gentleman who was with my Son <hi>Freeman</hi> to the laſt, once put the queſtion to him, what maintenance his Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; he anſwered, I never asked any thing of my Father, but I had it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed he might well ſay ſo, for I ever gave them, not onely when, but commonly before they asked; and then, not bread for ſtones, but uſually better and more then they deſired.</p>

                  <p>To that of my younger Brothers by a ſecond <hi>venter,</hi> I ſay, I did more for them then their Father either would, or could have done, had he lived.</p>
                  <p>I took the ſame care for them in their Education, as if they had been my owne; if they will not make good uſe of it when they come to age, it is their owne fault; not mine.</p>
                  <p>When my Father ſetled an Eſtate on me upon my Marriage, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at leaſt one thouſand pounds a yeare, to raiſe Portions for his younger Children. But before his death, this was ſold away, and he was indebted beſide, neer four thouſand pounds. He had a Siſter, and another Son my whole Brother, to whom he left nothing.</p>
                  <p>All his Eſtate and goods appriſed, amounted not to above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds. Yet I adminiſtred, and paid all his Debts, there was not any could juſtly demand a farthing, Indeed, I took ſome time to doe it, but at laſt paid all; which coſt me three thouſand pounds more then his goods were appriſed at.</p>
                  <p>To my Fathers Siſter during her life, I gave her dyet with me, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30430:11"/>
fifty pounds a year out of my own Eſtate, and to my Brother who was a Student in the Law, I gave one hundred pounds a year, as long as he lived, out of my owne Eſtate likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>My halfe brothers were thus provided for. The eldeſt, who was then a Man growne, I ſent to travaile, and allowed him one hundred pound a yeare; I am ſure, he never before ſpent my Father twenty pounds a yeare. The ſecond having ſomething of a Scholler, I ſent with Letters of recommendation to <hi>Leiden,</hi> to ſtudy Phyſick. The third had a minde to be a Souldier in the Low-Countries, thither I ſent him, and I furniſhed him with money to buy places of preferment as they fell, and he is now a Captaine or a Major. The fourth I put Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice to my Father in law, a Merchant, who loved him dearely, and would have done much for him. Before he dyed, he run his Maſter fifteen or ſixteen hundred pounds out of Caſh and ſpent it, and I am almoſt forced to pay it for him. The fift I bound to a <hi>Ruſsia</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and gave with him two hundred pounds. During his Maſters life he was imployed in <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> and after his Maſters death returned, but I ſent him thither againe, and to incourage him, adventured two or three hundred pounds with him, which he fairely ſpent, &amp; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to other courſes. The ſixt I bound Apprentice to a Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Draper in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, and gave one hundred and twenty pounds with him. He ſerved out his time, and was a Journey-man a while, and had thirty pounds a yeare of his Maſter, and twenty of me. But he ſoon grew weary of his imployment, and running into his Maſters debt, was forced to leave the Towne, and then to mend the matter, unfortunately Marryed. The ſeventh was a Daughter, to whom I allowed for her maintenance forty pounds a yeare, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon a convenient match, to have given five hundred pounds Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her, but ſhe, when I was Sequeſtred and in Priſon, before I ever knew any thing of it, marryed her ſelfe to one of the Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of my Eſtate, who is, now he comes to live upon his owne, worth I think but little.</p>
                  <p>This is a true relation of what I did for my halfe-Brothers and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which I think is not much amiſſe. And I ſtill continue to every one of them, (though they have not made good uſe of the courſes they were put in) an allowance of thirty pounds a yeare out of their Mothers Eſtate; if they will take no courſe any wayes to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and better their Fortunes, the blame is not mine. I am ſure, had I not uſed all the friends and intereſt I had, and disburſed a good ſumme of money too, a Courtier had begg'd their Mother, being a Lunatick, and then there had been nothing at all to maintaine them. What their Mother doth not ſpend, they have, and ſhall have fairely diſtributed among them after her deceaſe. In the meane time they ſhall doe well to look out for ſome additionall ſubſiſtance, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident will not be much.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have given you an account of the Education and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of my halfe Brothers. There is much fault found with me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30430:11"/>
I denyed to lend my third Brother a Summe of money, about one hundred pounds, which he lately writ to me for out of the Low-Countreys. 'Tis true, I did deny it, and upon this account. I was at that time, with divers others, a Priſoner in <hi>Upnor</hi> Caſtle. Cauſe I knew none, but we ſuſpected it might be for fear of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, leaſt they ſhould draw down this way, and the <hi>Hollander</hi> joyning with them, ſome party of this Nation might be aſſiſtant to them. Juſt at this time when all the feares and jealouſies were upon the Nation, and many every where committed, comes my Brothers Servant with a Letter, and tells us of the neer approach of the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Governor of the Caſtle looked very ſtrangely on the buſineſſe, and all my fellow Priſoners began to wonder, to ſee a man come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to me at that time from thence, and I was as much, and more then any, troubled at it, but could not help it. Yet to doe the beſt I could to avoid all ſuſpition, ſo ſoon as I had read the Letters, I gave them to the Governor to reade, one of which being in <hi>French,</hi> I En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhed to him, not knowing but that he might ſuſpect ſomething of privacy, I let him know, that I was ſorry the meſſenger came to me at ſuch a time. The Money I could not furniſh him with, being a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and had not but for my owne expences, and I told the man I neither would, nor durſt let him have it, if I did know where to get it, and therefore wiſhed him to returne againe as ſoon as he could, for I knew there would be jealouſies upon me, ſo long as he was here. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him not to come to me, or to ſpeak to me in private. I knew there was nothing yet to charge me with, but ſhould I now be ſending money over-ſea, they might then pretend to enough. Therefore I wiſhed the meſſenger to returne to my Brother, and in a Letter which I ſent then to him, deſired to be excuſed, if I had ſome care of my own ſafety. So I ſent the meſſenger away, having paid for his lodging and dyet, and given him ſome money in his purſe. And, to my ſenſe, I did in that juncture of time, what was fitteſt to be done, blame it who will.</p>

               <p>I confeſſe I was trained up in Religion, from my child-hood, and when I was ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> had <hi>Doctor Preſton</hi> a very eminent and godly man for my Tutor; of whom, I thank God, I learned much good; And by my familiarity with him, I came acquainted with thoſe who were moſt eſteemed; but I never to my knowledge, heard from him or them, but that <hi>a good Chriſtian, and a Royalliſt might ſtand together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they taught us in the firſt place to <hi>feare God;</hi> ſo the next was, <hi>to honour the King.</hi> And I am ſure, nothing is more frequent in Scripture, then the requiring us to performe our vowes, both to God and Man. And I am as ſure, I was bound by many ſeverall Oaths to my King, which I did not ſo readily know how to diſpenſe with. Yet I never was ſo great a Royalliſt, as to forget I was a free-borne Subject. Our King I was willing to have him; but not our Tyrant, or we his Slaves. I was ever for Reformation in Church and State, but not for Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I was never againſt reducing of Biſhops to their priſtine functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of taking care of the Churches, nor of the reſt of the Clergy, to take them off from ſecular imployments: But to unbyſhop them, and take away all orders and degrees, and a certainty of maintenance from them, this I underſtand not.</p>
               <p>I was ever for Order, &amp; Government, both in Church and State. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſpeaks nothing but confuſion and ruine. God is the God of order, and therefore of his owne Courtiers he hath degrees, Angels and Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſo is his Court alſo compoſed. The ſphears all differ in their magnitudes, and move one within another; his lights vary in their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, greater and liſſer. The Choriſters of Heaven have their varieties, and doe not all ſing the ſame note; and if in the Quires here, the Organs ſhould have pipes all of one ſize, the muſick would be but dull. If the Bells were all Tenors, there would be little pleaſure in ringing; and it would be a bad comfort, where there is not as well a Treble, as a Baſe Violl. I can coſt my eye on nothing in the whole Univerſe, but hath, and invites to degrees, onely Religion muſt have its parity. That which is the rule and order to all other things, muſt that be out of Order? what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? It is ſay they, becauſe our great Maſter ſo commanded it, ſaying,</hi> among you it ſhall not be ſo. <hi>What is it he ſayes ſhall not be ſo? why, you ſhall not tyrannize over, and enſlave thoſe that are under you, as the rulers of the Gentiles doe; but he that will be chiefe among you, let him be your ſervant. And ſo he is, and ought to be who governs aright. The greateſt Chieftaine is the greateſt Servant, and hath the greateſt care of thoſe that belong to him. Ye call me Lord and Maſter, ſayes Christ, and 'tis true, ſo I am; and if your Lord doe ſuch meane offices, think not much for you to doe the like. He forbids not Mastery, but enjoynes humility and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlineſſe.</hi> This, learned Divines make to be the true meaning; and thoſe that give it another ſenſe, are certainly miſtaken. But that is no wonder in theſe times. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was bred at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30430:12"/>
abounded in Revelations, and was full of the Spirit, yet at the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the worke, ſaid, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> who is able to wade into theſe depths? and yet <hi>now our illiterate Mechanicks, who muſt have ſeven years to learne their owne trade, will at ſeven dayes or leſſe, undertake to teach this. Oh Divinity! thou that art the apex, and chiefe of all Sciences, thou to whom all other are but handmaids, that art,</hi> ars artium, &amp; ſcientia ſcientiarum, <hi>art made too cheap thus to be humbled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was I ever againſt taking away Monopolies, and arbitrary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and Impriſonment of the free Subject, Nor againſt leſſening the exorbitancy of favorites, who like Drones ſucked and devoured all the Honey which the Common-wealths Bees, with much toyle ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
               <p>I went with them ſo long as it was for King and Parliament, and I think did them as faithfull ſervice as any: But when it came to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and no King, and Parliament againſt King, then I bogled, I knew not what to doe. I was contented to fit ſtill, and not do: againſt my Conſcience I could not, nor would not doe. And though I have ſuffered enough, yet I never acted any thing againſt the State, never was in any Plot or Petition againſt them, <hi>No ſo great a Royalliſt then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my Religion, I am what I ever profeſſed, and I hope better then ever I was; for I know that <hi>non progredi eſt regredi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ever loved ſolidities. Formalities and outward ſhewes of a leafy Religion never took with me. I ever ſuſpected thoſe, who to ſeem more holy and Religious to the world, had their Congregations apart, crying stand off to their Brethren, I am holier then thou, and talke like the proud Phariſee, God I thank thee, I am not as other men, and brag of new Lights, ſprung from old Hereſies, and will not be contented with thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Apoſtolicall, and holy practices of the Church, but will have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments after a new way and time too, and are angry if the Scripture be not taken in their ſenſe, when God knowes, they underſtand not one word of the Originall to expound it by; That care not how foule their heart be within, ſo they can but with their eyes and hands make a ſhew of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſeem to be very ſtrict in keeping the Sabbath, though they break all the other Commandements, as if he that ſaid, thou ſhalt keep holy the Sabbath day, had not likewiſe ſaid, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember it is written, that God was not in the fire, or the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous winde, but in the ſoft and gentle voyce. And Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Learne of me, for I am lowly and meek. Theſe boysterous and fiery ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men, I much doubt whether the Spirit of God be in them or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am and ever was farre from deriding or ſcoffing at any of them. I onely wiſh that they were what they ſeem to be. I meddle not with them, but leave them to ſtand or fall to their owne Maſter.</p>
               <p>The way that I profeſs and propoſe to my ſelf, to walk in, is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but I thinke a ſure one, 'tis ſhort but full, Chriſt his owne way,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30430:13"/>
and this it is, <hi>To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soule, and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thank heaven, I have indeavoured theſe things in the whole courſe of my life. <hi>I never feared any thing in the world more than ſin, becauſe it offended my God, nor ever was much troubled with any outward loſſes and croſſes, ſo long as I found I had peace within my ſelfe, and with my God. And I praiſe God, in the midſt of this deluge of troubles which might have ſunk an ordinary ſhip, I have hardly taken in any water, but that of tears of repentance, and tears of naturall love and affection, which could not but be aboundant in my condition, yet I have not been overwhelmed with them. The good hand of God ſtill ſuſteined me, and his comforts ever refreſhed my ſoule, ſo that thorow the thickeſt darkneſſe of this black and fearfull cloud I could ſee the Sun of comfort. I knew my God was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and that he both could and would in his good time totally diſpell it, and restore me the like comforts again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that other branch of Love to my Neighbour, this I can ſay. That to the poor I have ever been charitable, and relieved their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, as occaſion was offered, and ſo ſhall doe as long as I live, and at my death, not forget to doe them good, as the members of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt.</p>
               <p>My other neighbours, of what quality ſoever, I have treated as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. I never to my knowledge, or with my good will, wronged or defrauded any. In all my dealings with them, I have ſtill made that my rule, <hi>to doe as I would be done by.</hi> To my beſt remembrance, I never did that to another, but I was contented ſhould be done to me in the ſame caſe. And he that walkes by that rule, cannot erre, it is our Saviours; and as himſelfe ſayes, it is the fulfilling of all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <head>THE ANSWER.</head>
               <p>I deſire no more to be forgiven of Heaven, then I am ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the world. Heaven it ſelfe doth not promiſe pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, but to the penitent ſinner. You muſt acknowledge your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, you muſt be ſorry for your ſinne, you muſt promiſe and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour amendment, before you can expect forgiveneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>I have been as foulely injur'd, and as deeply wounded, and that by thoſe of neer relation, from whom I have highly deſerved, as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could be. Yet let them performe to me the condition God himſelfe requires, and I both can and will forgive them. More then this I conceive God requires not. Our daily prayer is, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Otherwiſe then thus to forgive, is to ſeem as though you ſlighted, or did not underſtand the injury. And what would the effect of this be, but an incouraging the ſame parties, or others to doe the like againe, or worſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:30430:13"/>
We all offend God and our Neighbour. And our Saviours rule is, to forgive, not to ſeven times, but to ſeventy times ſeven times, that is, to a numberleſſe number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the injuries and affronts done to me be not too notorious and wilfull, I can and doe daily forgive them undeſired, I never minde them. But if they be great and ſpeak loud, even then, if the party will but acknowledge them, and profeſſe hearty ſorrow for them, be the offence never ſo foule and great, I have a charity to forgive them. More than this I think is not required of man, or begged of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that I can and have thus forgiven, is evident by that ſhort Prayer I compoſed, and was uſed in my Family for my Son Morning and Evening ſo long as he lived, and recommended to the Churches about me. I am ſure a greater injury could not be done to me than he did.</p>

In his Examination at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> before the Juſtices, when he was asked what provoked him to commit ſo foule an act? 'tis ſtrange to ſee how he ſeems to make my hard uſing of him to be the motive and provocation: whereas it is well known to all, that never Son was treated more tenderly by a Father. I will ſet down the effect of his Examination, and my Anſwer to himſelf by a Letter, when I came to the knowledge of it, and the true ſtory of the Doublet he ſo much complained of, atteſted by divers who were then by. And when at laſt he asked forgiveneſſe of me, and deſired to hear from me, you ſhall ſee my bowels toward him in my laſt Letter.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The effect of his Examination.</head>
                  <p>The fact of murthering his Brother, he freely confeſſed before the Juſtices. It is already in print, and it is my grief to repeat it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked why he did it, He anſwered, It was, becauſe upon a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between him and his Brother, about a week before <hi>May day</hi> laſt, concerning a Doublet, his Father threatned that he would ruine him, never look on him more, keep him ſhort while he lived, and at his death make him a Servant to his Brother: that whereas it was ſaid by ſome that he had a thouſand pounds a year, I would not leave him a thouſand groats, and that I would make him as poor as his Unkle <hi>Nicholas;</hi> and that for the ſpace of four yeares laſt paſt, he hath not had of his Father forty pounds, he believeth not twenty; and that his Fathers diſpleaſure againſt him ſtill continued.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, if truths, might have been ground of diſcontent, but no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to ſo wicked an act. But he who is the <hi>father of murthers,</hi> is alſo the <hi>father of lyes,</hi> and taught man this leſſon from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. We are all apt to lay our faults on others, our Father <hi>Adam</hi> did it in Paradiſe: <hi>The Woman whom thou gaveſt me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhe gave me of the fruit and I did eat:</hi> As if he had ſaid, if thou hadſt not given her to me, I had never eaten of the forbidden fruit. <hi>Oh ingratefull</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>to upbraid thy Maker who gave thee a Woman, the beſt of Creatures for an help, and not for thy ruine!</hi> O wicked Son, ſo to pervert thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers words which were ſpoken to thee for thy amendment, but not for thy hurt! My Letter to him will declare the truth, and in what manner the words were ſpoken to him.</p>
                  <p>Can it be imagined, if any thing had paſt that had troubled him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Doublet, that it ſhould provoke him to commit that foule fact a quarter of a yeare after, eſpecially ſince he had the ſame, if not greater opportunity all along, and all manner of reſpect and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both from his Brother &amp; me paſſing ſtill to him to the very night before, and all former quarrels quite forgot?

                        <p>I <hi>Have received your Letter, and like well of the words and deſires you uſe therein, and wiſh with all my ſoul you were as that ſpeaks you; That you were heartily ſorry for that moſt high and crying ſinne committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your heavenly and earthly Father, in ſo foulely murthering your moſt innocent brother. Upon theſe hopes, (though never greater injury
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30430:15"/>
was done to man) I doe really and fully forgive you. And doe, and have, and ſhall, as long as you have being here, moſt heartily and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every moment of time, beg of God, that he would give you a true ſight of this and of all other your ſinnes, and receive you to his mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe. But let me tell you, that will never be, but upon a true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all your ſins, and an acknowledgment of them, and that, (let me be plain with you) I yet ſee not in you. For this moſt detestable fact, you confeſſe indeed you did it, but as much as in you lies lay the provocation of it upon your Father, by charging him with moſt falſe and deviliſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, as I finde in your examination. As firſt, upon the falling out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and your Brother about wearing one anothers Doublets</hi> (wherein you had and would have your will:) <hi>you tax your Father, that he ſaid he would ruine you; whereas your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle</hi> Nicholas <hi>and the Servants who were then by, know, that I onely ſaid,</hi> Theſe ſtubborn and wilfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of yours, if you continued in them, would ruine you. <hi>And ſo I fear they have, for to the last you continued in them. And in the leaſt trivial things, of riding abroad to my Park and Town (things you liked in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) yet becauſe I deſired it of you, you refuſed it, and ſaid,</hi> If your Father had not asked you to goe, you ſhould have done it. <hi>And this you did the Thurſday and Saturday before this foule fact. I minde you only of this, being ſo lately done; hundreds more you know there are; as your perpetuall running to</hi> Lingſted <hi>againſt my minde, and ſtaying out untill ten, and twelve at night. And this you would doe three or four times every week, and make me wait thoſe late hours for you both for ſupper and bed. And when I told you the danger of riding thoſe late hours, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends that followed upon it was, the next day to doe the ſame again or worſe, and never could I prevail with you to ſtay any one time from going thither, though you knew it was extremely againſt my minde, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no good from thence: but you continued it the rather, and that to the laſt.</hi>

                           <hi>Next, you tax me that I would make you Servant to your Brother. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch word fell from me, it is moſt falſe, as all then by canteſtifie, and I proteſt to God, it was never in my thoughts, nor did my actions ever tend the leaſt that way, which all the world ſaw. For,</hi> you were ever habited and cloathed alike; and I never made difference between you in any thing, but have been taxed for ſhewing you more kindneſs, and bearing more with you than with your Brother. <hi>But poſsibly I might ſay, you need not carry your ſelf ſo doggedly toward him, for you muſt be beholden to your Brother; and ſo you muſt have been, had he lived.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Next, you tax me, that whereas ſome friends had told you, that you had a thouſand pounds a yeare given you, that I could not keep from you: I ſaid, you had not a thouſand groats, and that I would make you as poor as your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle</hi> Nicholas.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is true, I did tell you, you had not a thouſand pounds a year, neither doe I know that you have one foot of land, or one great of money given you by any friend in the world.

                           <hi>Next you complaine, that for theſe laſt four yeares, you have had none, or very little money from me, not forty or twenty pounds. I ſuppoſe this is from the time you came from</hi> Cambridge, <hi>for then I am ſure I allowed you a certainty of forty pounds a yeare, beſides Cloaths and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that was not ſmall, for at one time, I paid a Bill of forty pounds for you, when you had the ſmall poxe. And I am confident, and you know it, you have ſpent me in Cloaths and otherwiſe, above an hundred pounds a yeare, beſide your diet, ever ſince you came from thence.</hi> You had of all things that you would, and as coſtly as you pleaſed, and as often, &amp; all paid by me without the leaſt check: though ſometimes your vanity carryed you to lay out threeſcore pounds or more upon one ſuite. I am ſure no mans younger Son in <hi>Eng:</hi> went better, nor had more care taken for his Education then you had. The beſt Maſters in <hi>London</hi> for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, and divers exerciſes came to you, to my great expenſe. And often have I been earneſt with you, to goe to the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> or undertake ſome other imployment, and offered to allow you for your expenſes what you could deſire, but you would not. For mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſpend, you had ſtill equall with your Elder Brother, and as much as I thought you could any wayes need, being alwayes with me, or any wayes ſeem to deſire. You never asked any ſumme that ever was denyed you, you knew where my ſpending money was, and you did goe to it, and take what you pleaſed, I never checked you for it. Ten pounds at a time I have offered you, &amp; that lately, &amp; you would have none of it, you needed it not, you had money enough, you ſaid, and ſo indeed I think you had, to your great hurt. For that made you play at ſuch great games, and bet ſo high at Cocking, as none higher, and to loſe, and that at my lodging, neer an hundred pounds at a time. To play with your Father you ſcorned, though he often deſired it, he played at too ſmall a game for you. Theſe are no ſignes that you wanted money, or that your Father carryed a ſtrait hand toward you.</p>
                        <p>Oh <hi>Freeman!</hi> thou knoweſt thy Father loved thee but too well, and that he could deny thee nothing. From thy Cradle to this day, I know not that I ever ſtruck thee, ſaving that once, when through thy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30430:16"/>
unſufferable ſaucineſſe, in the Parlour, I pulled off thy Hat, and gave thee a little pat on the head. <hi>And much good came thereby: for you preſently took it up, and put it on again, cocking of it, and in ſcorn ſate in your chaire by me, in a diſcontented poſture, and ſo continued for foure or five houres, not ſpeaking one word.</hi> Nor doe I remember that ever I did chide thee in anger, <hi>though thy dogged humour of hiding thy ſelfe for a long time, and running to</hi> London <hi>without my knowledge, and the jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with thy Brother upon the least triviall occaſions, would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked any Father living. But ſay I did it at any time,</hi> thou knoweſt it was as ſoon over as ſpoken, <hi>and therefore you need not ſuggeſt my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure continued against you. To that very night you did this bloody fact, how have I courted thee as my Miſtreſſe, not my Son?</hi> Ever ſince I came from <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pnor,</hi> how have I every day ſought new wayes and jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes to have thy company? Surely theſe are no arguments of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſpleaſure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But ſay I was diſpleaſed. Why then didſt thou not kill me, and ſpare that innocent Lambe? O Youth! I believe thou mightest be offended at me, but certainly the maine thing that provoked thee, was thy envy at thy Brothers vertues, and growing goodneſſe, and that he was the Elder, and that I and the world began to look on him, and love him.</hi> Oh helliſh wickedneſſe! Heaven give thee grace to repent thee heartily of it, and God be mercifull to thy moſt foule Soule, and waſh it clean in the blood of his deare Son Chriſt Jeſus; that when thou comeſt to dye, it may be a gueſt fitting to be received into his pure manſions; <hi>And that it may there ever live with him, in eternall bliſſe, is the conſtant prayer of</hi>

                           <hi>THe time of your leaving this world (for ought I know) draws neer, and I hope, as you have had ſufficient time, ſo you have made good uſe of it, and are prepared to go to your God. If you have (as you tell me) a true ſight and hearty ſorrow for your foule ſinne, then I doubt not but when you are diſſolved, you ſhall be with Christ. And if I could be once thorowly aſſured of that, I confeſſe (as you ſay) I ſhould have comfort in your death, although I have had but little in your life.</hi> But let me beg of thee my Son, doe not deceive thy own ſoule; God is not mocked, he ſees not as man ſeeth, there is no diſſembling with him. Now is the time of thy making or undoing forever. As the tree falls here, ſo it lyes. <hi>If thou goest out a true penitent here, thou ſhalt undoubtedly be a glorious Saint in heaven hereafter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But know, it is not all the prayers, and teares, and cries of all the godly Miniſters about you, who I heare (and heartily thank them for it) have plentifully afforded you their aſsiſtance, nor the earneſt beggings of your Father, or of the Churches, can doe that work. It muſt come from thy own ſelf, thy own heart muſt beg it, or all will be in vain.</hi> The hotteſt Sun cannot make a dead tree live, nor the ſtrongeſt blowings kindle fire in a dead coale. If there be no ſap in the root, the Sun doth but dry and not enliven the tree. If no ſpark of fire lie hidden under the aſhes, all the blowings will never make it to burn. <hi>I hope thou haſt ſome ſparks of grace in thee, though deeply buried under a world of rubbiſh, and I hope all thoſe godly bellows that are uſed will blow that away, and make thy fire of true repentance and godly ſorrow burn clear, and make thee able truly to ſay with the Prodigall,</hi> Father, I have finned againſt heaven and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon: <hi>and then thou mayſt be aſſured of the like reception from him. He will imbrace thee in the arms of his mercy, he will feaſt thee in his heavenly manſions.</hi> For thou wert loſt, but now thou art found; thou waſt dead to ſinne, but now thou art alive in Chriſt, and ſhalt for ever live in him. Oh happy ſadneſſe, if it produce this joy! Oh happy death, if it produce thee that bleſſed life! happy change, to leave a world of miſery, to go to an heaven of bliſſe. Oh <hi>Freeman!</hi> rouſe up thy ſelfe like a man, minde the worke you are about, ſtirre up the graces which I hope are in thee. <hi>Certainly thou canſt not be ſo barren of knowledge and goodneſſe as I heare you make your ſelfe to be. Thou haſt been inſtructed in the wayes of godlineſſe from a Childe. Thou hadſt Maſters and Tutours to keep thee in them when thou waſt abroad, and at home thou hadſt thy Fathers counſell and example. He never failed to cauſe you and your Brother to reade the Scriptures, and conſtantly himſelf prayed with you, and called on you to betake your ſelves to your private devotions, and ſtill had you to Church to hear the best men, and the moſt godly Sermons, and diſcours'd to you of what was preached. Is all this loſt? hath this foule ſin ſo deaded thy ſoule, that no ſpark of true grace can appear? Take this comfort, mans ſinne cannot be ſo great, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30430:17"/>
Gods mercy is greater.</hi> Hell is onely full of impenitent ſoules. If thou canſt but truly repent, God will forgive. Say but with <hi>David</hi> heartily, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and God will ſay to thy ſoule as <hi>Nathan</hi> to him, <hi>The Lord hath forgiven thy ſinne.</hi> The Thief on the Croſſe no ſooner ſaid, <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdome;</hi> but Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</hi> And doe you but deal plainly and clearly with heaven, I doubt not but you will finde the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your own ſoule. <hi>Doe not palliate, or ſhift off thy ſinne: I tell thee, neither thy Father, or thy Brother I am ſure, ever gave thee the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion which might provoke thee to commit this foule fact.</hi> Too much ſoftneſſe and gentleneſſe, old <hi>Ely</hi>'s fault, was his more than any other. I could but reprove thee with this, Doe ſo no more my Son. <hi>I have often checked my ſelfe for it, I know I ought to have gone higher, but thy dogged and ſtubborn nature was ſuch, that I feared to doe it, and I could not ſee any reproofs did work good upon thee. No, I tell you, you have none to accuſe in this but your own wicked and envious diſpoſition, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil who had got ſo much power over thee as to make thee to doe his will. And thanks be to heaven that reſtrained both his and your power from acting further miſchief on me.

                  <p>There is much diſcourſe abroad about a Doublet, and a falling out between my Sons in that buſineſſe. I will ſet down the true and plain ſtory of it.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>The ſtorie about the Doublet.</head>
                  <p>My Son <hi>George</hi> coming to me to <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Candlemas.</hi> Terme laſt, out of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> he ſent his gray cloath Doublet that he rid up in, to <hi>Banks</hi> his Taylour to face the ſleeves. <hi>Banks</hi> ſeeing it, told his Man, that he was ſure that was not his Maſters, for I (ſaid he) never made it. Poſſibly, ſaid my Sons Servant, the Doublets being both alike, it might be miſtaken; but this is it, my Maſter rid his journey in, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray mend it, and ſo he did, and it was brought home, and his man told <hi>George</hi> what the Taylour ſaid: I thought ſo, ſaid he, for it is too little for me, yet wore it a day or two in <hi>London.</hi> But coming down into the Countrey, one night he ſpoke to his Brother to let him have his own Doublet. <hi>Freeman</hi> ſaid, he would keep the Doublet he had. Then I being in the next Chamber, and hearing them loud and wrangling came out to them, and asked what was the matter? <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaid, his Brother would have his Doublet. Then I ſaid to <hi>George,</hi> why doe you goe about to get his Doublet from him? let him alone
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30430:17"/>
with it. No Father, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> it is my own Doublet I would have, onely it was miſtaken when I went into <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and they gave me his inſtead of mine, and now I would have my own again, his being too little for me: but <hi>Freeman</hi> ſaid, he ſhould not have it. Come, ſaid I, what adoe is here about a fooliſh doublet? get you to bed. I know not what to doe with it, ſaies <hi>George,</hi> I cannot wear it, and ſo flinging it on the bed, bid his Unkle <hi>Nicholas</hi> (who was then by) take it. Doe ſo, ſaid I, and then we ſhall have no more janglings about it, and ſo went to my Chamber and Bed.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning, fearing there might be more wranglings about it, to prevent it, I went as ſoon as I was up to <hi>Freeman</hi>'s bed-ſide, and uſed all the fair words I could to perſwade him to let his Brother have his doublet, and earneſtly deſired him to doe it, but could not prevail with him. Now, ſayes he, my Brother hath worn the Doublet in <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> he would have me have it again, I will never take it. Doe you hear, ſaid I to <hi>George,</hi> what your Brother ſayes? Why, ſayes he, if I have worn his he hath likewiſe worn mine, and the Doublet is as freſh and as good as mine every jot; 'tis not for that I would have my own again, but becauſe it fits me better. Upon this I went into <hi>George</hi> his Chamber, and ſaid to him, You ſee the wilfulneſſe of your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make ſhift to wear that Doublet for a while, you will not wear it much longer. Father, ſayes he, I deſire to weare it but two or three daies, till I get to <hi>London,</hi> and I have tryed this, it is ſo little I cannot weare it.</p>
                  <p>By this time <hi>Freeman</hi> had put on his cloathes and was come into his Brothers Chamber, when I ſaid to him, fetch the Doublet, and let thy Brother wear it. No ſayes he, he ſhall have none of my Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet, let him weare that he hath had all this while. It is ſaid I, too little for him.</p>
                  <p>Father, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> if he will but let me have it to <hi>London,</hi> (which will not be above three or four dayes) that I may ſpare my other ſuits, when I come thither, he ſhall have Doublet and Breeches too: I am ſure the lace will be worth four or five pounds, but I regard it not, onely for my preſent uſe I would have it. Nay then, ſaid I, <hi>Freeman,</hi> you cannot deny this offer. I care not, ſayes he, I will keep my owne.</p>
                  <p>Then I ſaid to him, nay, now I ſee it is nothing but wilfullneſſe, onely to croſſe your Brother, and ſaid to <hi>George,</hi> let him alone, it ſhall doe him no good; and to <hi>Freeman</hi> I ſaid, theſe croſſe and dogged humours of yours, if you continue in them will ruine you. You need not be ſo dogged to your Brother, for I tell you, if I dye, you muſt be beholding to him; and what ever your flatterers tell you of an Eſtate of a thouſand pounds a yeare, or more, that you have, which your Father cannot keep from you; I, who know better then they, tell you, that you have not a groat, but what you muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to your Father for, and that it is in his power to leave you as little as your Unkle <hi>Nicholas</hi> hath left him. And therefore you need
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30430:18"/>
not carry your ſelfe ſo ſtubbornly and doggedly towards him, as if all were your owne already. I tell you, if you mend not your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it will be the worſe for you. This was all the reproof I gave him, and to my beſt remembrance the very words. And I thinke to ſuch a wilfullneſſe, there being no reaſon for it, but onely his owne humour, I thinke a Father could not ſay leſſe. Well, his will he had, and would have, &amp; ſtill kept his Brothers Doublet: and I deſired <hi>George</hi> to let him alone, and give the other Doublet to his Unkle <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that there might be no more words about it; which he did: for his Unkle <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> was by, when all theſe words were ſpoken, and remembers them well.</p>
                  <p>This was in <hi>April</hi> laſt, now neer four moneths ſince. And that this wicked wretch ſhould make theſe words the occaſion that provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him to murther his Brother, is a moſt deſperate wickedneſſe, and I believe; a moſt devilliſh untruth. God forgive him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Boreman,</hi> a reverend Divine, who took much pains with my Sonne before his ſuffering, hath ſince in print related many paſſages of that buſineſſe. I was then, and ſtill am, a meer ſtranger to him, having yet never ſeen him. In that regard, it was hard for him ſo fully to clear many things, I am aſperſed with. This conſideration, together with the perſwaſion of others, hath occaſioned my ſilly pen thus rudely to ſpeak to the captious world, and even enforced me to ſay ſomething more.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt part of his book, he brings in theſe words with a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis, <hi>He being in love with a faire Gentlewoman,</hi> intimating <hi>that</hi> to be one of thoſe things, might provoke my Sonne. Truly this is more then ever he would confeſſe to me, or any friend or Servant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me that I know of. And when he hath been asked about it, he would deny it with much ſlighting, and profeſſe the contrary: and this he did not above two or three dayes before the fact.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I thinke they loved one anothers company very well, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often, and gaming together. If they did intend Marriage, it never received hinderance or diſlike from me. I alwayes liked very well of it; &amp; when ſuch a thing was ſpoken of upon the bye, I ſo much incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged it, that I preſently ſaid thus, <hi>They tell me that ſhe hath three or foure hundred pounds a yeare:</hi> what ever it be, I will give my Sonne as much in preſent, beſide his future expectancies, and they are not ſmall. Thus much I proffered of my ſelfe. I know not then, why anything concerning that Gentlewoman ſhould trouble him.</p>
                  <p>Next I finde in that Relation, that I am taxed for neglect of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, and for not reproving my Sonne, as I ought to have done, in thoſe Letters I did write to him.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt of theſe you may ſee an anſwer in my <hi>Charges</hi> before: and the ſecond the <hi>letters</hi> themſelves will confute, and evidence the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:30430:18"/>
I ſent an able Divine to be continually with him, and inſtruct him, and this was as much as the exigence of the time would ſuffer me to doe.</p>
                  <p>To that of my Sons advice to the world, of reading the Scriptures frequently, and praying to God daily, and of Parents not to ſuffer their Children to live in idleneſſe, but imploy them in ſome Calling, I thinke it concernes me to ſay ſomething, though in my <hi>Charges,</hi> I have ſufficiently ſpoke to theſe things.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure no man ever indeavoured or laboured more to perſwade a Sonne to take to ſomething, then I did him.</p>
                  <p>Very lately I was earneſt with him to Study the Law, or be a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, or any thing, ſo he would be ſomething: but he was ſo averſe, that neither my owne, or the perſwaſion of his moſt intimate friends, could prevaile with him. No longer ſince then Eaſter Terme laſt, this was laboured by us, but to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>To the advice of Prayer, and reading the Scriptures, I can ſay it truly, that he was ſufficiently admoniſhed by me to doe it. He knew that I never failed daily to doe it my ſelf. And I ſhall not onely adviſe the world to read the Scriptures, but alſo to endeavour the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them: and the way to doe that, is not onely to exerciſe our ſelves in praying and reading, but to make uſe of the moſt godly, able, Orthodox Divines, ſuch as are skilfull in the Original Tongues, and can rightly interpret, and give the true ſenſe. If this were done, we ſhould not have ſo many ſtrange Religions, and ſo many odde conceits and opinions broached every day. The Sadducees read the Scriptures, and were as ready and well verſed in them as any, yet Chriſt tells them, <hi>They erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I could have prevented it, nothing at all ſhould have been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning theſe ſad paſſages; but ſince I could not hinder others, I have ſuffered my ſelfe to be perſwaded that I was neceſſitated to publiſh ſomething in my owne vindication, and to undeceive the world.</p>
                  <p>I like not Phariſaicall boaſting: but when ſo many calumnies and falſe aſperſions are layd upon me, I have S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule and practice, to right my ſelfe in publiſhing the plain truth.</p>
                  <p>'Tis believed by many that I am very covetous: I am ſure, if I had been a lover of money, I might have had many thouſands in my purſe more than I have. I doe not know but that in building and other wayes I have expended as much as I had come in. If at any time I had any money by me (which was never much) I put it not to uſe, but pleaſur'd friends with it. I have paid many a thouſand pound for the uſe of mony, but never in all my life received one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for all the moneys I ever lent.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid I have much improved my eſtate: I thank heaven I have not waſted it, but indifferently freed it of incumbrances, and charges that lay upon it: yet I have added but little to it by my purchaſes.</p>

Had I but the lands that my Father and Grandfather have ſold from it, it would be double what it is. I repine not, but am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and thank God for what I now have.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps I may be cenſured for ſome things here, as not fit to be publiſhed to the criticall world: but this I can ſay; <hi>Though it be plain, yet it is true and honeſt, and for my part, as long as I live, I will indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour honesty not onely in my words, but in all my actions, and as much as in me lies, labour to have peace with all men. If I cannot obtain it, it ſhall not trouble me, ſo long as I have peace of conſcience, and peace with my God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> could not but be much grieved, when <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his Brother <hi>Abell,</hi> but they did not both then dye. God the Judge did not at that time execute <hi>Cain</hi> for it, but onely baniſht him from his preſence, and ſuffered him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerward to grow numerous, and to build Cities. Mine are both dead and no remembrance left of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> ſurely was much perplexed, when God commanded him to ſacrifice his Sonne <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but it was not done, an Angell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtaid his hand in the very act. It was onely for triall, and required by him, to whom the firſt-borne was due, and if it had been done, yet <hi>Iſhmael</hi> whom he loved, had ſtill been left to him. <hi>Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have loſt both my <hi>Iſaac</hi> and my <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> both really ſlain, and that by no expreſſe command from Heaven, to afford me the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaac</hi> certainly was much troubled, that <hi>Eſau</hi> hated <hi>Jacob,</hi> and threatned his death, yet his reſolution was, not to kill him till his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were dead. <hi>The dayes of mourning for my Father are at hand,</hi> ſaye; he, <hi>then will I ſlay my Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he met his Brother with armed Troops, his heart relented and he did it not. My Sonne acted what he intended, and that moſt foulely. He ſtayed not till his Fathers death, but as ſoon as he had done it, came preſently to his Father, and acquainted him with it, and brought him to the bed-ſide, to ſee his Brother lye weltring in his blood, not then quite dead. <hi>Oh unparallel'd villany! Oh most ſad ſpectacle!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> ('tis true) loſt ſeven Sonnes, and three Daughters, all at one time: Gods hand was ſo heavy on him, that he became a map of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. He loſt but all the Children he had, and ſo did I. His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were kill'd by the fall of an Houſe, which the winde blew down, it might ſeem a caſualty: But mine, one murthered in his bed by his Brother, and the other deſervedly hang'd for it. A ſadder end!</p>
            <p>But <hi>Job</hi> loſt beſide a number of Oxen, Sheep, Camells and Aſſes, for he was the richeſt man in all the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe I cannot ſay during my troubles, I have loſt ſo great a ſtock of Cattle, but I can ſay it confidently, that the Goods and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30430:20"/>
that I have been deprived of, were worth neer forty thouſand pounds, <hi>which would have purchaſed a great ſtock, in</hi> Job'<hi>s time and Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had three faire Houſes then, in my own hands, all well furniſhed, and at leaſt two thounſand pounds a yeare about them. My Lands were all well ſtockt; I had at leaſt one hundred head of great Cattell. Halfe an hundred Horſes, and thoſe none of the worſt, ſome of them worth forty or fifty pounds a piece. I had five hundred Sheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide other ſtock. About a thouſand Quarters of Wheat and Malt in Garners, and ten Barnes (none of the leaſt) all full of good Corn, and great quantities of Flaxe and Hops.</p>
            <p>All this was ſeized and taken away at one time, with Plate and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells, for I removed nothing, concluding my ſelſe and Eſtate ſecure enough ſo long as I acted for them.</p>
            <p>Beſide all this, they had the Rents and Profits of my Eſtate, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares together, and the two firſt yeares allowed neither me, nor my Children any thing out of it.</p>
            <p>They had not onely the Profits of my owne Eſtate, but what they could get of Alderman <hi>Freemans,</hi> to whom I was Adminiſtrator, and of my Mother-in-Law, to whom (ſhe being a Lunatick) I was Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. By that meanes ſhe and her Children were damnified at leaſt a thouſand pounds. And no returne would be made of it, though they knew it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>At laſt I was forced to pay three thouſand five hundred pounds for Compoſition; or elſe (for ought I know) they would have kept my Eſtate till this time, or ſold it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it may be ſaid to me: <hi>Iob</hi> was a righteous Man, but theſe puniſhments were inflicted upon you for your Delinquency, for being in Armes, and ſiding againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>To that I boldly ſay, I never was in Armes againſt the PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAMENT, or ever ſided or aſſiſted any againſt them, or ever had any charge of Delinquency laid againſt me, or ever was called before the Parliament or any Committee (though I alwayes ſought it, and laboured it) for any offence. Neither could I ever learn to this day, why I was Sequeſtred or Impriſoned. Indeed ſome Kentiſh men have told me, I was put down to ſet up others; and ſet up they were, but did not long continue.</p>
            <p>When I was to compound for my Eſtate, neither the Committee before whom I appeared, or my ſelfe could finde out, how I might be made a Delinquent, that ſo I might be capable to compound. There was a Taxe for my Parke then unpaid, becauſe it was over-rated, and it was agreed (I being willing to enjoy my Eſtate, and be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that I ſhould be entred (and ſo it ſtands in their books) <hi>a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, for not paying of Taxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was all my Delinquency, and that hath long ſince been ſatisfied, ſo that now I am no Delinquent, nor indeed even was, and therefore I hope for that matter, I may ſtand clear with <hi>Iob.</hi> But in this I am ſure I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30430:20"/>
goe beyond him, his afflictions were but for a ſhort time, about a year at moſt, and then he was at quiet. Mine have been for theſe twelve years, ever ſince forty three, and ſtill continue, I am now a Priſoner. And the laſt yeare, upon a ſuit of the Truſtees in the Exchequer for arrears of Rent due to the Church, I was there denyed the benefit of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Pardon, which, as I conceived, took off thoſe arreares.</p>
            <p>And it was likewiſe decreed, that I ſhould pay to them one hundred and five pounds, as Rent for the Parſonage of <hi>Eaſtry:</hi> for that year 1643. when the Parliament farm'd it out, for four hundred and ten pounds, and received all the money for it, I had not one peny bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it, they had it all, and yet I muſt pay that Rent.</p>
            <p>It was decreed alſo that I ſhould pay to them, forty nine pounds and ten ſhillings, and ſeventy two pounds, which I proved I had paid to Mr. <hi>Brett,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Flote,</hi> by order from the Committee of Plundered Miniſters, by way of Augmentation. I produced their Acquittances for it, and Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi> the Receiver, knew and allowed of Mr. <hi>Bretts</hi> payment, and yet it was decreed, that I ſhould repay thoſe ſums to them againe, which I conceived to be very hard meaſure, and ſtrange juſtice, that all this ſhould befall me, onely for that marke of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency.</p>
            <p>This cauſed me to Petition the Lord <hi>Protector</hi> for reliefe, and if he be not pleaſed to relieve me, or recommend me back to the Court, where poſſibly I may now finde more equall juſtice, the two Barons whom then ſate being removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt pay thoſe ſummes, and I ſtand now in Contempt of that Court for not doing it.</p>
            <p>So then my miſeries are not yet ended; and were the ſame power that then ruled, to continue ſtill, I ſhould never hope to end them but with my life. But I hope more righteous things, from the preſent <hi>Protector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Iob</hi> had a Wife, and kindred that vexed him. She gave him counſaile to curſe God and dye.</p>
            <p>Indeed in all the time of my troubles, I have not had a Wife, either to comfort or vexe me, nor did I deſire one. Now I doe, and ſhall indeavour it, God ſend me a good and fruitfull one, who may help to ſweeren all my miſeries. Kindred I had, but they come not now at me, they know they were too much concerned. But at a diſtance, they drank wine in Bowls, and ranted high, ſaying, <hi>The Heires are now killed, the Inheritame ſhall be ours.</hi> But perhaps they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>And for my Neighbours, ſee how ſome of them have all along reproached me. <hi>Iob</hi> had not greater, nor more falſe things charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him then I have had.</p>
            <p>For my Sonnes wickedneſſe I muſt needs ſay, <hi>Cains</hi> was not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for he did it in the field, and firſt talked with his Brother, and poſſibly did it with a Sword, and had ſome pretence of reaſon for it, becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> and his offering was more reſpected; But thou didſt murther thy Brother baſely and inhumanely, not in the Field, but in his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30430:21"/>
Bed. Thou didſt not talk or diſpute it with him, but didſt kill him ſleeping, and couldſt heare nothing but ſad groans from him. Nor didſt thou doe it with a Sword or manly weapon, but with a butcherly Cleaver beat out his brains. And as if that had been too little, with a moſt cowardly Steeletto didſt ſtab him ſeven or eight times in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the heart: nor for this thy ſo doing couldſt thou have any ſuch pretence as <hi>Cain</hi> had, for thou wert ever equally reſpected with thy Brother.</p>
            <p>Even profane <hi>Eſau</hi> came far ſhort of thee: He did but reſolve to kill his Brother, and when he came to him, he repented of his purpoſe, and embraced him: But thou didſt goe through with thy work, in the height of malice. And when thou hadſt brought me to him, after thou hadſt ſlain him, I ſaw not any relenting in thee, or one teare drop from thine eyes for that foule fact.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But certainly</hi> Judas <hi>went beyond thee, none ſo wicked as he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet perhaps it may be ſaid, that he did not know Chriſt to be the Lord of Life, and then he did but betray his innocent Maſter: Thou didſt more, for thou didſt kill thy innocent brother. <hi>Iudas</hi> did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Maſter up to the Judge for his tryall, thou wert Judge and Executioner thy ſelfe. He might plead, that after he took the ſop, the Devill entred into him, and that his Maſter bade him, <hi>What thou doſt, doe quickly,</hi> and that he was hired for thirty pieces of ſilver; Thou hadſt no Devill enter into thee, nor any command or hire, but thy own mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious nature. He did it in the dark of the night, aſhamed that the light ſhould behold ſo foule a fact; Thou in the faire morning, when the Sunne aroſe, and ſhined cleare. He gave his Maſter time to pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took him; Thou didſt kill thy Brother fleeping, not ſuffering him to wake or ſpeak, onely to ſigh, and groan, and that moſt ſadly, but all moved not thee.</p>
            <p>Oh Heaven! Whither doth the remembrance of thy wickedneſſe tranſport me? Can <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſinne find any to conteſt with it? thine comes too neere it. Yet in this thou haſt much the better of him: He when he conſidered what he had done, deſpairing, hang'd himſelf, and ſo went to hell, that place of torment, prepared for the ſon of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Thou hadſt many dayes after thy foule fact to conſider what thou hadſt done. And I thank Heaven thou didſt heartily and ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thee of thy ſins, (as I am well aſſured by thoſe godly Miniſters who were with thee to the laſt) and ſo art gone to Heaven, the place of thy Bliſſe, prepared for all truly penitent ſoules.</p>
