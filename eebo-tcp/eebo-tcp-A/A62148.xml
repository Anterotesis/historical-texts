         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a <hi>Treatise</hi> come forth the
other day, Intituled <hi>Respondet
Petrus;</hi> or an answer of <hi>Peter
Heylin</hi> to Doctor <hi>Bernard</hi> &amp;c.
And although it be very large to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet at the 109<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Page, he adds an
<hi>Appendix</hi> in answer to certain passages in
Mr. <hi>Sandersons History</hi> of the late <hi>King
Charles, relating to the Lord Prymate,</hi> The
<hi>Articles of Ireland,</hi> and The <hi>Earl of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
And (as if it were so memorable a
business to be kept upon Record) he gives
us punctually the day, when he began to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66002:4"/>
undertake this <hi>Taske,</hi> and the time of his
finishing; In which I find little else true,
but the confessing <hi>of his infirmities, and his
unfitness to enter into disputes &amp;c.</hi> Instead of
cleering himself, he hath added more spots
to his former.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Petrus</hi> hath made hast; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the extremity of the season
(as he sayes) and his languishing quartan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ague,
he hobled up his answers for the
middle of the <hi>Term</hi> following, <hi>with as much
ease, as Hoggs eate Acornes, or Pidgeons pick
Pease.</hi> Yet he was interrupted the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing,
by the <hi>undertakers</hi> with him; a dead
<hi>vacation</hi> not profitable for the vent thereof;
And so it came not forth untill just the first
day of this <hi>Midsomer Term;</hi> By it, he hath
both thriftily gotten the advantage of sale,
and enforceth his adversaries to hunt dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
after him a whole long <hi>Summers Vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
contemptible Grashoppers compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with such a sonne of <hi>Anak</hi> as himself;
Only <hi>Petrus</hi> considers wisely, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>convicia spreta exolescunt &amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66002:4"/>
Short liv'd Pamphlets (with which he
hath been often bang'd) pass away upon
the breath of Rumour, <hi>but for him to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
upon record in the body of an History,
what is it lesse, than for him to live defam'd,
and dye detestable, a scorne to these times and
an ignominy to all ages following?</hi> But who
can help it, if a Man will make himself
such? I wish he be not prophetick in it,
which by this book he hath put hard for,
Let him not blame me, tis the malefactor
himself (not the judge who pronounceth
justly) that is the Author of his own ruine.</p>
            <p>And thus in briefe we have the <hi>Preface</hi>
to his large <hi>Treatise;</hi> which I shall leave to
such, whom it may concern, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it worthy of answering, for I find
some learned Men are for the Negative, as
if he had been in it, his self-revenger, and
next doore to a <hi>felo de se,</hi> rather to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than opposed.</p>
            <p>I shall only take notice of his <hi>Appendix,</hi>
and shew him to the Reader by that light
by which he longs to be seene (wherein
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66002:5"/>
               <hi>Petrus</hi> falls upon me) not so much answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as to shew how little he deserves it. I
have been a while considering, which part
to take of that double Counsell of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in the like case, <hi>Answer not &amp;c. And
yet answer &amp;c.</hi> I concluded upon the latter
in this <hi>Post-Hast,</hi> that the <hi>Term</hi> might
not want an enterlude at the <hi>ending,</hi> as
well as it had by his Book, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it.</p>
            <p>And now let me meet my <hi>Petrus,</hi> who
spends 17 whole Pages in the combate with
me, taking in his large <hi>Frontispeice<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> or the
Contents of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> which might
have well stood for the whole. So have we
seen a da<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ing coward practise on the <hi>Stage</hi>
to fence with his supposed foe, when all
that while it was but with his own hat and
feather. How much time doth <hi>Petrus</hi>
spend, to hear himself speak, imagining the
Reader to be bound up to his sence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>Indeed I had warning heretofore not to
meddle with him, and was told, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66002:5"/>
he was blind, yet he with his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
could see as far into a <hi>Millstone</hi> as any
other Man: And that if he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in my History (as how could he
scape) he would reprint himself, and be
thereby well paid for his paines.</p>
            <p>And truly I conceive it no discretion
for me, to make it my business other than
to dry blow beat him, since he is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
worthy of bleeding. For to say much
were but to give him further occasion to
assume fresh credit of copeing with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
now at rest, whom he hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to disturbe, even the most Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
name and living fame, of that appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
learned Prelate, the late Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Armagh,</hi> Prymate of all <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to be a little serious with him, 'tis
no newes for Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> to be a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of pious and eminent Men, while they
were living, of which (now he is not like to
live long himself) tis time to think upon
repenting, I shall upon this occasion only
instance in his demeanour towards Doctor

            <p>Upon which the Doctor was compelled
to make his defence; with a protestation
under his hand against those false Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
given in against him; Pretending to
have been cross to the <hi>Articles,</hi> and in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
to the 20th, <hi>of the Church of England,</hi>
branched into positions <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 That the Church is <hi>Mera Chimaera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 That it teacheth and determines nothing,</p>
            <p>3 That controversies might better be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the <hi>Vniversities</hi> than to the Church.</p>
            <p>4 That learned men in the <hi>Vniversities</hi>
might determine of controversies without the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66002:6"/>
Bishops or acquainting them with them.</p>
            <p>To these Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> was fain to
make answer, which to satisfie the desire of
the Reader (not being heretofore publisht)
I shall give him a transcript as followeth
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The answer of Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> to the
Information given in against him by
Doctor <hi>Heylin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These passages imperfectly catched at by
the Informer were not positions of mine, (for
I detest them, as they are layd, for impious and
ridiculous) but oppositions according to my place
proposed for the further clearing of the truth;
to which the Respondent was to give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And this generall protestation I hope takes
off all that can be laid against me, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
Notwithstanding to touch on each of
them as they are layd.</p>
            <p>1 To the First, I never said that the Church
was <hi>Mera Chimaera</hi> as it is, or, hath a being,
and ought to be beleived; but as the Respondent
by his answers made it: In which I conceived
him to swerve from the Article, where his
questions were taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:66002:7"/>2 <hi>To the Second my argument was to this
purpose,</hi> Omnis actio est suppositorum,
vel singularium.</p>
            <p>Ergo Ecclesia in abstracto nihil docet, aut
determinat, sed per hos aut illos Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,
Pastores, Doctores, &amp;c. homo non
disputat sed Petrus et Johannes.</p>
            <p>3. 4. The Third and Fourth may be well put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
my prosecution was, that the Vniversities are
eminent parts, and Seminaries of the Church, and
had better opportunity to discuss controversies, than
diverse other assemblies; Not by any meanes to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them, but to prepare them for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Ecclesiasticall assemblies, of <hi>Synods, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
Bishops,</hi> that have superiour Authority,
wherein they might doe service to the Church, and
those superiours not perscribe any thing unto them;
As the debating of a point by learned Counsell,
makes the easier passage for the Benches sentence:
And this was urged only as commended, not as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>

               <p>Thus was this learned and eminent

                  <q>In the second impression of his book

when he mentions our men he vilefies
them more than he did in his first Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
But the matter is not much, what he
saith of one or the other, the condition
of the man, being such, as his word
hardly passeth, either for commendation,

               </p>
               <p>By this you may see that my adversary
had good cause to disguise his name, and
so would I too, were it under such an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious

a person of some fame and great ability.</hi>
That (possibly) might be my mistake as

he hath prevented any further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of either, by his own confessing of his
<hi>being too much credulous in beleiving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
in publishing such mistaken intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</hi>
Which are his own words folio 87.
And I could wish that in the <hi>Errata</hi> of the
next Edition of his <hi>History of the Sabbaoth</hi>
(if the world be ever troubled with it
again) he would Record this Ingenuity of
his (being such a rarity in him) so as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it, and howsoever he is much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at the Primates expressions, <hi>viz. Nor
shames he to affirm as being a Notorious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth</hi>
&amp;c. Truly with me it seemes a gentle
penance for so presumptuous an assertion,
and pertinaciously continuing in it these
many yeares, till he was thus convict; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming

not only a single person, but a

               <p>3 <hi>That the Lord Prymate boar no grudge
to the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>so as to advise the
King to pass the Bill of Attainder.</hi> This
(whosoever he accounts the Actor) hath
been sufficiently cleared also, and needs no
repetition here.</p>
               <p>For the term of <hi>Sophistry,</hi> (for which he
is also much offended with the Prymate)
he hath in the Iudgment of divers, made it
good, throughout his book, which are so
many, that they would find as much work
for an observator, as he saith my History
will afford him: I shall only trouble the
Reader with one instance (<hi>ex ungue Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

which is in such great Characters, that he

               <p>'Tis folio 63. where he repeating a

doctrine of the Preachers of Antichrist; who
at his coming shall cause both the Lords day,</hi>
and <hi>the Sabaoth, to be kept, or celebrated from

<hi>and,</hi> for the disunctive <hi>or</hi> (though
the <hi>Prymate</hi> in the next words, had given
him warning of that Stumble:) And so
upon a false fent he runs away with the
Hunt, as if it must necessarily follow from
thence <hi>That it is the doctrine of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Antichrist that no manner of work be
done on the Saturday</hi> or <hi>the Sunday:</hi> And
from that surmise, he makes an application
(of which, I leave it to others to give the
sense.) <hi>What will become</hi> (saith he) <hi>of our</hi>
English <hi>Sabbatarians and their Abettors, who
impose as many restraints of this kind, upon
Christian people, as ever were imposed on the
Iewes, by the Scribes and Pharisies?</hi> And in
Conclusion he attempts to put out our
Eies also, in perswading us again; <hi>That 'tis
all one to say, on the Saturday</hi> and <hi>the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
as on the Saturday,</hi> or <hi>the Sunday;</hi> As
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66002:13"/>
if unity and division; conjunction and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,

to the latter.</p>
               <p>As for that great offence taken by him
