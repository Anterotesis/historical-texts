            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A a short return to a late Tragedy call'd
The Duke of Guise.</head>
            <l>HAil Royal Prince! our happy Morning Star;</l>
            <l>The Genius of our peace, the Soul of War:</l>
            <l>High by descent, by vertue higher yet,</l>
            <l>Which make the people crovvd to kiss thy Feet.</l>
            <l>Fame blow thy Trumpet! and let the mighty sound,</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> from the <hi>Antartick</hi> Pole rebound.</l>
            <l>Fame blow again! until the blast be heard,</l>
            <l>As far as Noble <hi>Iames,</hi> is lov'd or fear'd.</l>
            <l>Blow! till the Universe doth answer give,</l>
            <l>Till <hi>Monmouth</hi> is the bravest Prince alive.</l>
            <l>Oh that <hi>I</hi> could proportionate my Rhime,</l>
            <l>Unto the praise of Vertue so Sublime:</l>
            <l>But were I ne'r so skilful, such desert,</l>
            <l>Doth ev'n Anticipate the Poets Art.</l>
            <l>Hyperbolies in such exalted Theams,</l>
            <l>But low, inferiour, sickly Whimsies seems.</l>
            <l>His Name doth higher Elogies contain,</l>
            <l>Then can be reacht by all <hi>Apollo's</hi> train.</l>
            <l>The highest Tune that ever Poet sung,</l>
            <l>Wou'd such an Elevated Subject wrong.</l>
            <l>If so my Muse forbare, lay by thy Lyre,</l>
            <l>The worth thou canst not reach learn to admire.</l>
            <l>Brave Noble Prince! such worth can never be,</l>
            <l>Design'd for everlasting Obloquy.</l>
            <l>Tho' from black Mouths, Malignant Vapours rise;</l>
            <l>And for the present hide thee from our Eyes.</l>
            <l>Yet thou shalt shine, and all those Clouds disperse:</l>
            <l>Thy rayes again, shall glad the Universe:</l>
            <l>Infer no wretched thought from frowning Fate,</l>
            <l>Tho' Vertuous men may be Unfortunate:</l>
            <l>The Sun is oft Eclipst, through little Stars,</l>
            <l>And As unenvy'd, no Misfortune Fears.</l>
            <l>While Envy lives, true worth will be defam'd,</l>
            <l>She'l bark, although she be for barking damn'd.</l>
            <l>Brave Gen'rous Prince! has Vertue learn'd to Sing,</l>
            <l>Under the lash of every Libels Sting.</l>
            <l>Be not offended with the silly Stage,</l>
            <l>Nor the Effects of a blind Horses Rage.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Pegasus</hi> alone, her Race she'l run,</l>
            <l>And spight of thee, attain Damnation.</l>
            <l>Yet let his anger thy compassion move,</l>
            <l>Methinks his Passion has the looks of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>True Adversaries seldom warning give,</l>
            <l>Like that which in this Play, thou dost receive.</l>
            <l>Not that I'll wrong him in this Patrons sence,</l>
            <l>Nor spoil his Fortune, by his small pretence.</l>
            <l>We'l rather say, to make amends for that,</l>
            <l>His Plot doth Item what sport he'd be at.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:62079:2"/>
Rejoyce Great Prince! and may thy wretched Foes,</l>
            <l>Proceed their worst intentions to disclose.</l>
            <l>Fear not their malice, nor their threats despise,</l>
            <l>But let apparent folly, make thee wise.</l>
            <l>Finish the Vertuous Race thou hast begun,</l>
            <l>And future toils, with former Vigour run</l>
            <l>To keep those Lawrels, thou'st already won.</l>
            <l>'Tis true they've brought forth only <hi>Thorns</hi> as yet,</l>
            <l>But thereby Fate runs more and more in debt.</l>
            <l>Who knows what is for such desert prepar'd?</l>
            <l>Did vertue ever go without reward?</l>
            <l>Despair not <hi>Iames,</hi> for ev'ry Vertue is,</l>
            <l>A Pledge of Temporal, or Eternal bliss.</l>
            <l>Vertue is Earnest of some good to come,</l>
            <l>Though oft that good be bought with Martyrdome:</l>
            <l>Though Providence be slow it can't be rude</l>
            <l>It ne're was guilty of Ingratitude.</l>
            <l>Thou know'st not what'by <hi>Heaven</hi> is design'd,</l>
            <l>For the Exercise of thy heroick mind.</l>
            <l>Who knows but <hi>Monmouth</hi> yet may th' Vict'ry have,</l>
            <l>Ore Papists, who wou'd his Native Land inslave.</l>
            <l>Who knows for what thou art preserv'd, for we</l>
            <l>Heavens Love perceive in thy delivery,</l>
            <l>From the <hi>Italians</hi> Savage cruelty.</l>
            <l>Who knows what Honours thou may'st yet regain?</l>
            <l>The Sun must in the Morning rise again,</l>
            <l>Who knows what Storms thy Lustre may dispell,</l>
            <l>What mischief stop, and what heart burnings quell,</l>
            <l>'Mongst Romish <hi>Tory's</hi> earnest to rebell?</l>
            <l>Such Vertues ought not to be buried quick,</l>
            <l>To gratifie the Cath'lick Shismatick.</l>
            <l>Such Talents ought not to be hid, but spread,</l>
            <l>Vertue like Faith is fruitful if not dead.</l>
            <l>Thy Countries Peace, and Liberty they Claim,</l>
            <l>Thy Lords renown, the Centre of thy Fame:</l>
            <l>Wert thou ambitious, thou hadst yet been high,</l>
            <l>But this thy fall doth prove thy Loyalty.</l>
            <l>Disdain those Mungrels that would run thee dovvn,</l>
            <l>True Courage in adversity is shovvn.</l>
            <l>As in a Storm the Sun doth light some parts,</l>
            <l>So doth thy presence chear all Loyal Hearts.</l>
            <l>But as for them vvho envy deart thy life,</l>
            <l>May they live curst and die vvithout relief.</l>
            <l>May they die beggers and an offspring leave,</l>
            <l>To vvhom Eternal infamy may cleave.</l>
            <l>May all their hopes to desparation turn,</l>
            <l>Live their ovvn shame, and die the peoples scorn:</l>
            <l>On one another, vent your svvelling Gall,</l>
